At the base of the reef ecosystem are dinoflagellate algae, which live symbiotically within coral cells. Efforts to understand the relationship between alga and coral have been greatly hampered by the lack of an appropriate dinoflagellate genetic transformation technology. By making use of the plasmid-like fragmented chloroplast genome, we have introduced novel genetic material into the dinoflagellate chloroplast genome. We have shown that the introduced genes are expressed and confer the expected phenotypes. Genetically modified cultures have been grown for 1 year with subculturing, maintaining the introduced genes and phenotypes. This indicates that cells continue to divide after transformation and that the transformation is stable. This is the first report of stable chloroplast transformation in dinoflagellate algae.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dinoflagellate</kwd><kwd>Amphidinium</kwd><kwd>chloroplast</kwd><kwd>transformation</kwd><kwd>zooxanthella</kwd><kwd>coral reef</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMF4976.01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nimmo</surname><given-names>Isabel C</given-names></name><name><surname>Barbrook</surname><given-names>Adrian C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lassadi</surname><given-names>Imen</given-names></name><name><surname>Aranda</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Purton</surname><given-names>Saul</given-names></name><name><surname>Waller</surname><given-names>Ross F</given-names></name><name><surname>Nisbet</surname><given-names>R Ellen R</given-names></name><name><surname>Howe</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004052</institution-id><institution>King Abdullah University of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>URF/1/2216/01-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jit Ern</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Successful stable transformation of the dinoflagellate chloroplast genome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coral reefs are complex ecosystems, made up of many thousands of species. At the base of the ecosystem are dinoflagellate algae, frequently referred to as zooxanthellae. These single-celled algae live in symbiosis with corals as intracellular photosynthetic symbionts, providing fixed carbon to the host. Loss of the symbiotic alga results in coral bleaching, which is one of the most urgent and worsening worldwide ecological concerns. In 2016, 85% of the Great Barrier Reef was found to be affected by coral bleaching, a significantly higher proportion than had been previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Change in sea water temperature is recognized as one of the environmental causes of coral bleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Spalding and Brown, 2015</xref>). It is likely that this results in disturbance of photosynthetic electron transfer in the dinoflagellate symbiont and consequent damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rehman et al., 2016</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Slavov et al., 2016</xref>). The PsbA (D1) reaction center protein of photosystem II is believed to be an important target of such damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Warner et al., 1999</xref>). The key subunits of photosynthetic electron transfer chain complexes, including the PsbA protein, are encoded in the dinoflagellate chloroplast genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Howe et al., 2008</xref>). There have been no reports to date of transformation of the dinoflagellate chloroplast genome, hampering attempts to study the mechanism of bleaching.</p><p>An alternative approach to transformation of the chloroplast might be to insert genes for proteins carrying chloroplast targeting sequences into the nucleus. There have been numerous attempts at stable nuclear transformation of dinoflagellates, but none has been clearly successful. An early report of the transformation of the dinoflagellates <italic>Amphidinium sp.</italic> and <italic>Symbiodinium microadriaticum</italic> mediated by silicon carbide whiskers, with selection for resistance to hygromycin or G418 and using Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) as a reporter, appeared to produce transformants after 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">ten Lohuis and Miller, 1998</xref>). However, there are no reports of successful use of this technique since the initial publication. In 2019, a series of experiments on <italic>Symbiodinium microadriaticum,</italic> using biolistics, electroporation and agitation with silicon carbide whiskers failed to introduce a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene to the nuclear genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite this, Ortiz-Matamoros and co-workers reported transient expression of GFP in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> using a plasmid designed for plant transformation introduced by treatment with glass beads and polyethylene glycol, and selection for resistance to the herbicide Basta (gluphosinate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ortiz-Matamoros et al., 2015a</xref>). However, transformed cells were not capable of cell division, and no genetic confirmation of transformation was carried out. Transformation with the same plasmid mobilized by the plant pathogen <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> was also reported, although the transformed cells again failed to divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ortiz-Matamoros et al., 2015b</xref>). The lack of stable expression of heterologous genes limits the use of these techniques for functional biochemical studies.</p><p>Here, we describe a method for stable transformation of the dinoflagellate chloroplast. The chloroplast genome of dinoflagellate species containing the carotenoid peridinin (which is the largest group and includes those forming symbionts with coral) is typically fragmented, comprising approximately 20 plasmid-like DNA molecules of 2â5 kbp known as âminicirclesâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbrook et al., 2014</xref>). Each minicircle typically carries a single gene, together with a conserved core region which is assumed to contain the origin of replication as well as the transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Howe et al., 2008</xref>). These minicircles have been shown to be localized to the chloroplast using in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Owari et al., 2014</xref>). Each chloroplast contains multiple copies of each minicircle, although the exact copy number varies according to the growth stage of a culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Koumandou and Howe, 2007</xref>).</p><p>We exploited this unusual minicircular genome organization to create shuttle vectors for dinoflagellate chloroplast transformation. We created two artificial minicircles, both based on the <italic>psbA</italic> minicircle from the dinoflagellate <italic>Amphidinium carterae,</italic> as the <italic>A. carterae</italic> chloroplast genome is the best characterized amongst dinoflagellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbrook et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koumandou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbrook et al., 2001</xref>). We replaced the <italic>psbA</italic> gene with a selectable marker (either a modified version of <italic>psbA</italic> which confers tolerance to the herbicide atrazine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hirschberg and McIntosh, 1983</xref>), or a gene for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT), which confers resistance to chloramphenicol), and an <italic>E. coli</italic> plasmid backbone (to allow propagation in <italic>E. coli</italic>). We tested numerous transformation methods and were able to obtain sucessful introduction of these artificial minicircles into dinoflagellates using particle bombardment. Following selection, we could detect the presence of the artificial minicircles, and transcripts from them, using PCR and RT-PCR. We were able to detect the product of the introduced chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene using immunofluorescence microscopy. Cultures under selection continued to divide and maintain the artificial minicircles for at least 1 year, indicating that transformation was stable. The availability of a method for dinoflagellate chloroplast transformation enables a range of studies on the maintenance and expression of this remarkable genome and the proteins it encodes, such as PsbA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of artificial minicircles</title><p>Two artificial minicircles were used in this study. The first, pAmpPSBA, was designed to confer atrazine tolerance. Tolerance to atrazine in plants can be conferred by a single residue change in the PsbA protein, where a Serine is mutated to a Glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goloubinoff et al., 1984</xref>). We therefore cloned the <italic>A. carterae psbA</italic> minicircle into the <italic>E. coli</italic> vector pGEM-T easy (Promega) and introduced the necessary mutations into the <italic>psbA</italic> gene using site-directed mutagenesis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The second artificial minicircle, pAmpChl, was designed to confer chloramphenicol resistance. It is also based on the <italic>A. carterae psbA</italic> minicircle, but the <italic>psbA</italic> gene was excised and replaced by a <italic>A. carterae</italic> codon-optimized gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyl transferase.

This has never been reproduced, despite numerous attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Walker et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, theÂ whiskers are a significant health hazard, and, in other species, glass bead-mediated transformation has a higher transformation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ortiz-Matamoros et al., 2018</xref>). There has been one previous report of transient transformation of dinoflagellates with glass beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ortiz-Matamoros et al., 2015a</xref>). We therefore first sought to replicate this finding, by transforming the <italic>A. carterae</italic> dinoflagellate chloroplast genome using glass beads. We used the artificial minicircle pAmpPSBA followed by selection with atrazine. The experiment was carried out three times, but no viable cells were seen following selection (i.e. following the addition of atrazine, all cells died at the same time that untransformed cells died).</p><p>Polyethylene glycol has been reported to increase glass bead transformation efficiency. We therefore added polyethylene glycol and repeated the transformation (in triplicate). No live cells were recovered following selection, indicating that this method did not give rise to stable transformants. A second attempt (in triplicate) was also not successful.</p><p>Many eukaryotic protist species can be transformed using electroporation, and the Lonza Nucleofector system is used with many hard-to-transfect species. This includes <italic>Perkinsus marinus,</italic> a sister group to the dinoflagellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burkett and Vasta, 1997</xref>). The artificial minicircle pAmpPSBA was used to attempt to transfect <italic>A. carterae</italic> using the Lonza Nucleofector with several settings indicated as suitable for protist transformation (X-100, D-023, L-029 and EH 100), each in triplicate. We were never able to recover any transformants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Biolistic transformation with pAmpPSBA</title><p>We next turned to biolistics, since this has been reliably used to transform the unicellular alga <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> for 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boynton et al., 1988</xref>). Nine experiments to introduce the pAmpPSBA artificial minicircle into <italic>A. carterae</italic> using biolistic transformation were carried out, using a range of rupture disk pressures. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate, and included a single negative control line (cells subjected to biolistic treatment but without pAmpPSBA). The mean survival time for each culture under selection was assessed by bright field microscopy, and results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. In six experiments, <italic>A. carterae</italic> cells shot with particles carrying pAmpPSBA showed greater mean survival time under selection conditions than untransformed cells, suggesting successful transformation (Experiments A2, A3, A4, A5, A7 and A8). One experiment (A6) was harvested prior to the death of the control strain, so no conclusions can be drawn on relative survival times. Finally, two experiments showed no difference in the length of time for which cells survived. The first (Experiment A1) was carried out using the lowest pressure rupture disks. In this experiment, control and experimental cells survived just 13 days, suggesting that cells had not been transformed, perhaps because an insufficient bombardment velocity had been applied. In the second experiment (A9), selection was carried out with 1 Âµg ml<sup>â1</sup> atrazine, below the lethal concentration of 2 Âµg ml<sup>â1</sup>. Both test and control cultures survived at least three months, with subculturing occurring at 8-week intervals.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45292.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Biolistic transformation of <italic>A. carterae</italic> with pAmpPSBA.</title><p>Each experiment was carried out in triplicate, thus producing three potentially transformed lines.

By making use of the plasmid-like fragmented chloroplast genome and a biolistic system, we have introduced a modified version of an existing sequence as well as a heterologous gene. These genes are transcribed, and produce protein, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy and the presence of an expected phenotype. Stable transformation was achieved with two separate artificial minicircles, one containing a modified <italic>psbA</italic> gene designed to confer atrazine tolerance and another encoding chloramphenicol resistance, with cultures surviving at least 1 year under selection. The copy number of the artificial minicircle is similar to that of native minicircles.</p><p><italic>A. carterae</italic> cells transformed with the modified <italic>psbA</italic> gene (atrazine tolerance) survived under non-lethal concentrations of atrazine for at least 3 months, retaining the modified gene, indicating that the transformation is stable even under low levels of selection. The results suggest it is important to titrate the concentration of selective agents used. With an atrazine concentration of 2.5 Î¼g ml<sup>â1</sup> some of the transformed cultures did not survive more than a few days longer than untransformed ones, suggesting that the modified PsbA was at least partially inhibited at that higher atrazine concentration. In addition, it is possible that a background of minicircles containing wild-type <italic>psbA</italic> genes competed with the introduced artificial minicircles for replication or transcription factors, making it difficult for adequate levels of atrazine-insensitive PsbA to be maintained to cope with the higher atrazine concentration. With chloramphenicol concentrations of 30 Î¼g ml<sup>â1</sup> or above, the survival of transformed and untransformed strains was similar. However, at 20 Î¼g ml<sup>â1</sup> or lower the transformed cultures outlasted the untransformed ones, and some were able to survive apparently indefinitely.</p><p>There have been multiple previous reports of transformation in dinoflagellates. Although the initial report (using silicon carbide whiskers) described transformation as stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">ten Lohuis and Miller, 1998</xref>), it has never been successfully reproduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Walker et al., 2005</xref>). Transient expression has been carried out using glass beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ortiz-Matamoros et al., 2015a</xref>). However, we were unable to build on this result to obtain stable transformation, despite numerous attempts (and there have not been any subsequent reports of transformation using either glass beads or <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>). Instead, we found that microparticle bombardment gave stable transformants. Our results â using the same artificial minicircle in all experiments â suggest that the primary reason for failure of the majority of methods to give stable transformation is due to inability of the DNA to enter the cell, rather than inherent dinoflagellate genetics.</p><p>The ability to modify the dinoflagellate chloroplast genome will be of enormous value in many areas of dinoflagellate biology. Modification of existing minicircles should allow us to study many other aspects of this highly unusual chloroplast genome, such as the promoter regions of the genes. For example, many chloroplast genes are down-regulated under high temperature stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gierz et al., 2017</xref>). Little is known about how transcription is regulated, or initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbrook et al., 2012</xref>), though it is assumed that initiation occurs in the conserved core region of the minicircle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbrook et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). We also do not know how the minicircles are replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbrook et al., 2018</xref>), although again it is assumed the core region is important. It will now be possible to mutate this core region to determine which sections are important. The ability to express heterologous proteins will be of great value in studying a wide range of other aspects of dinoflagellate chloroplast biology. The ability to express modified forms of the PsbA protein will be of particular value in studying the role of this protein in the response by dinoflagellates to the disturbances that are believed to precipitate coral bleaching.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Amphidinium carterae</italic>)</td><td><italic>A. carterae</italic> CCMP1314</td><td>Culture Collection of Marine Phytoplankton</td><td>CCMP1314</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (vector)</td><td>pAmpChl</td><td>this paper, synthesized by GeneArt</td><td/><td>Full sequence provided in supplemental data.</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (vector)</td><td>pAmpPSBA</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>Full sequence provided in supplemental data.</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti-Chloramphenicol-acetyl-transferase, polyclonal</td><td>Antibodies-Online</td><td>Antibodies-Online Cat# ABIN285051, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10781219">AB_10781219</ext-link></td><td>1:500 in f/2 medium with 5% BSA, 1 hr.</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (HÂ +Â L) Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 405, polyclonal</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-31556, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_221605">AB_221605</ext-link></td><td>1:1000 in f/2 medium with 5% BSA, 1 hr.</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>DNAdelTM Gold Carrier Particles Optimized for Plasmid Delivery</td><td>Seashell Technology</td><td>Seashell Technology Cat# S550d</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culturing of <italic>Amphidinium carterae</italic></title><p><italic>A. carterae</italic> CCMP1314 (from the Culture Collection of Marine Phytoplankton) was cultured in f/2 medium on a 16 hr light/8 hr cycle, 18Â°C at 30ÂµE m<sup>â2</sup> s<sup>â1</sup>, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbrook et al., 2006</xref>).

If no living cells were found 3 days in a row, the culture was recorded as dead on day 3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Extraction of DNA and RNA from <italic>A. carterae</italic></title><p>Total RNA was isolated from <italic>A. carterae</italic> using the Trizol - chloroform method. Purification was carried out using the RNA clean-up with on-column DNase protocol of the Qiagen RNeasy kit as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rio et al., 2010</xref>) except that isopropanol precipitation was carried out overnight, rather than for 10 min.</p><p>DNA was released from cells prior to PCR by resuspending 5 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> cells (depending on the number available) in 50 Âµl dH2O withÂ ~10â20 acid-washed 500 Î¼m glass beads and vortexing for 10 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RT-PCR and PCR</title><p>First strand synthesis of the RNA was performed using Invitrogen Superscript IV using the manufacturerâs protocol and either random hexamer primers or a gene-specific primer. Negative controls lacking reverse transcriptase were performed by the same method but replacing the reverse transcriptase enzyme with dH<sub>2</sub>O. PCR was carried out using Promega GoTaq polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions, and annealing temperature, extension time and MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration were varied as appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cloning and sequencing of PCR products</title><p>PCR products were separated by 1â1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with GelRed. PCR products were purified from excised gel pieces using the MinElute gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Some PCR products were directly sequenced after gel extraction whilst others were ligated into the pGEM-T Easy plasmid vector (Promega), following the manufacturerâs instructions. The ligation mix was used to transform chemically competent <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> TG1, followed by overnight growth on 1.5% LB agar containing ampicillin at 100 Âµg/ml. Individual colonies were picked and grown overnight in LB containing ampicillin at 100 Âµg/ml. Plasmids were extracted from resulting cultures using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). All sequencing was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 3130XL DNA Analyser in the Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge sequencing facility.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>Five Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in f/2 medium for 5 min.

Cells were then incubated with an anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 405 secondary antibody (raised in goat; ThermoFisher) at a final concentration of 1:1000 in f/2% and 5% BSA for 1 hr under constant agitation, washed in f/2 medium three times for 5 min, and mounted on VWR-polysine-coated slides using Vectashield mounting medium.

Therefore, determining the copy number doesnât really give much useful information, aside from giving an indication of the growth stage of the culture (log/lag/stationary). What is relevant however is how the copy number compares to that of the native psbA minicircle that we have hijacked to create the artificial minicircle backbone. We therefore carried out a semi-quantitative PCR reaction with primers immediately adjacent to the gene (either psbA or CAT), in a shared region of the minicircle. This revealed that the larger band (psbA) was twice the intensity of the lower band (CAT). Although they differ slightly in size, there is no reason to suspect a major difference in PCR efficiency. As the CAT gene is half the size of psbA, this would therefore indicate that about half the minicircles with a psbA backbone contain psbA, and half contain CAT. This data is included in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Besides these essential revisions, please find additional suggestions for improvement in the individual reviews attached below.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors are to be commended for embarking on a difficult project where there is a (largely unpublished) history of failed attempts.

This requires cells to be on an agar plate. Amphidinium will only grow in liquid culture. Cells therefore need to be plated out, taken for biolistic transformation (in a vacuum) and then scraped off the agar plate and resuspended into liquid culture. There are consequently a large number of variables that prevent meaningful comparison of the growth and survival of the cultures. The survival rate is therefore very variable, based on the time not in solution (the first transformed line always does better than the last; there is an upper limit of 12 transformations that can be carried out at any one time). Thus, measuring the cell density is not a very accurate measure of anything. However, longer-term, the cell growth rate can be compared. Atrazine-selected lines do grow significantly more slowly than wild type, while chloramphenicol-selected lines grow a bit more slowly than wild type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In experiments A6 and A7, both mock-transformed and plasmid-transformed cells were harvested while the cultures were still alive, but what was the cell density of each?</p></disp-quote><p>About 50-100,000 cells/ml.

The cells were transformed, allowed to grow, subcultured and allowed to grow. They were harvested just before the second subculturing was due.

This includes the psbA minicircle, which is the one we selected for modification. We therefore carried out immunofluorescence looking for the location of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase protein using an antibody. It co-localizes to regions of the cell with autofluorescence and thus is in the chloroplast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors study minicircle (wt and introduced) copy number during the experiment? Could this explain the low growth rate or other aspects of the transformation?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it is about 50% wild type psbA minicircle, 50% pAmpChl minicircle (see above). We think that the problem with growth rate for the pAmpPSBA minicircle is due to the mutation that we introduced. There are numerous psbA mutations which give rise to atrazine resistance in plants. The mutation we selected for use in the construct is the one that gives the highest level of resistance (Oettmeier et al. 1999, Cell Mol Life Sci 55:1255-1277). However, other research has shown that it can have consequences for photosynthesis (Erickson et al. 1989, Plant Cell 1:361-371). In many plant and algal species, this does not appear to be significant for viability, but it does appear to be more significant for Amphidinium.</p></body></sub-article></article>
