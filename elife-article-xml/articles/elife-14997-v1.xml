Here, we used next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to produce a quantitative, whole genome characterization of gene expression for the major excitatory neuronal classes of the hippocampus; namely, granule cells and mossy cells of the dentate gyrus, and pyramidal cells of areas CA3, CA2, and CA1. Moreover, for the canonical cell classes of the trisynaptic loop, we profiled transcriptomes at both dorsal and ventral poles, producing a cell-class- and region-specific transcriptional description for these populations. This dataset clarifies the transcriptional properties and identities of lesser-known cell classes, and moreover reveals unexpected variation in the trisynaptic loop across the dorsal-ventral axis. We have created a public resource, Hipposeq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hipposeq.janelia.org">http://hipposeq.janelia.org</ext-link>), which provides analysis and visualization of these data and will act as a roadmap relating molecules to cells, circuits, and computation in the hippocampus.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14997.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14997.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14997.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Both mouse and human brains are made up of many millions of cells called neurons that are interconnected to form circuits.

For example, by relating the specific enriched or depleted genes to their corresponding ontologies in a given population, functional hypotheses can be generated at the intrinsic level (e.g., voltage-gated channel subunits) and network level (e.g., ligand-receptor interactions). A different approach, agnostic to functional correlates of genes, can be taken by using gene expression profiles as a means to genetically delineate different populations of cells, either across classes or within a given class. In this way, gene expression profiling simultaneously clarifies complementary aspects of molecular, cellular, and circuit properties of cells.</p><p>Transcriptional profiling in the mouse brain is becoming a powerful tool in neuroscience, owing to a host of complementary innovations and technologies. A variety of transgenic mice have emerged over the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>), which enables access to genetically defined populations of neurons, and a variety of techniques now exist for purifying labeled cells from surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Okaty et al., 2011a</xref>) to obtain cell-class-specific transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okaty et al., 2011b</xref>). Although large-scale, quantitative gene expression profiling across neurons has typically been performed by microarray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belgard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Siegert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sugino et al., 2006</xref>), more recently the technically superior RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shin et al., 2014</xref>) is finding application in the neurosciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Complementing these quantitative profiling methods is the mouse Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lein et al., 2007</xref>), providing histological information from in situ hybridization (ISH) assays.</p><p>A combination of these techniques has been previously applied to study principal cells in the hippocampus. Microarray work has been used to study CA1 pyramidal cellsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamme et al., 2003</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sugino et al., 2006</xref>) as well as cellsÂ ofÂ the trisynaptic loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greene et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nakamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2001</xref>). Mining of the ABA has revealed molecularly defined subregions in multiple principal cell classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>). Most recently, RNA-seq work has been used to study CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>). This work has helped to identify genetic differences within and across regions and as well revealed differences within canonical neuronal populations.</p><p>Despite this extensive investigation, many aspects of the hippocampal transcriptome remain unresolved or warrant further investigation. Previous transcriptional profiling has predominantly focused on CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells; markedly less work has examined DG granule cells and CA2 pyramidal cells (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2005</xref>) and no profiling has been performed for DG mossy cells. Additionally, recent work has suggested that DG granule cells may be a heterogeneous population along the dorsal-ventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>), but this has not been systematically investigated. Perhaps most importantly, the technical superiority of RNA-seq may reveal governing organizational rules that may have not been resolved with ISH or microarray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that a systematic RNA-seq based approach may provide unparalleled insight into the transcriptional organization of the hippocampus.</p><p>Here, we manually purified labeled excitatory cell populations from microdissected hippocampal regions, and used RNA-seq in combination with histological information from ABA to characterize gene expression quantitatively and histologically. This approach enabled analysis of hippocampal gene expression in a cell-class- and region-specific manner. We use this approach to examine both previously characterized and novel transcriptomes, and to understand the organizational schemes of gene expression within and across neuronal populations. These data and analysis tools are publicly available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hipposeq.janelia.org">http://hipposeq.janelia.org</ext-link>), enabling users to examine gene expression at multiple levels of granularity in the hippocampusÂ and providing a molecular blueprint to predict and investigate phenotypes at cellular, systems, and behavioral levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generating a cell-class- and region-specific RNA-seq database for the hippocampus</title><p>The hippocampus is grossly comprised of five excitatory cell populations; namely, granule and mossy cells of the dentate gyrus (DG), and pyramidal cells of CA3, CA2, and CA1.

The transcriptional data obtained here provide insight into multiple complementary properties of the hippocampus. For example, the greatly expanded number of marker genes fosters predictions for the role of genes and cell classes in physiology and disease, the complement of RNA-seq and ISH reveals the spatial relationships within and across cell classes of the hippocampus, and the dorsal versus ventral profiling demonstrates the surprising finding that gene expression can be regionally enriched invariant to distinct cell classes.

Our profiling recapitulated many marker genes known <italic>a priori</italic>, but in addition, demonstrated an abundance of previously unappreciated marker genes. Consequently, our work greatly expands the total number of marker genes and enables several complementary lines of inquiry based upon these findings. First, the marker genes uncovered here serve as candidates for obtaining genetic access to well-defined populations of neurons. Due to the inherently quantitative nature of RNA-seq, the strength and specificity of candidate genes can be evaluated by examining expression in both on-target and off-target populations; promoters associated with genes that are sufficiently restricted in expression can be employed for designing transgenic animals or viruses to enable genetic access. We emphasize that the Cre lines used here for labeling cells for transcriptional profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) may already provide sufficient genetic access to many excitatory subpopulations of the hippocampus; thus, this work offers both existing and new ways to selectively target and manipulate specific populations of neurons. Second, many of the marker genes identified here can be tied to specific functionality (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1a</xref>), allowing novel marker genes to be used for hypothesis generation. These hypotheses can be investigated through a variety of perturbations (e.g., siRNA, knockouts, or CRISPR-Cas gene editing) combined with other experiments (e.g., physiology, behavior). Similarly, many marker genes identified here are annotated as specific disease-related genes (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b,d</xref>), which can help to reveal both the molecules and cell classes to examine in pathological conditions and disease models.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cell-class- and region-specific gene expression in the trisynaptic loop</title><p>Our work here identified two components of transcriptional variability in the cells of the trisynaptic loop; namely, differences across different neuronal populations (across-class) and differences across the dorsal-ventral axis (across-region). On a gene-by-gene basis, these two organizational principles could be observed either individually or simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Transcriptional differences across classes of the trisynaptic loop have been identified and appreciated for some time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greene et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lein et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, it is likely that these transcriptional differences are fundamental in producing across-class variability in morphology, physiology, and connectivity, ultimately underlying the diverse and distinct roles that the different cell classes are believed to play in hippocampal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mizuseki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2014</xref>).

Indeed, the transcriptional distance between dorsal and ventral granule cells is similar to that between different populations of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), a finding similar to that found between CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14997.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Gene expression patterns of excitatory hippocampal neurons.</title><p>Genes can be expressed in relatively similar abundances across the hippocampus (<italic>Slc17a7</italic>; upper left), vary in a cell-class-specific (<italic>Fibcd1</italic>; upper right) or region-specific manner (<italic>Cadm2</italic>; lower left), or vary in both cell-class- and region-specific manners simultaneously (<italic>Wfs1</italic>; lower right).

The fact that many of these genes are involved in cell adhesion and axon guidance, in conjunction with the observation that they are enriched along the dorsal-ventral axis in multiple areas of the brain, suggests that they may generally be used for maintaining polarity in the mature brain. During development, gradients of gene expression are used for proper patterning of neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sansom and Livesey, 2009</xref>); in a similar fashion, these genes may reflect the mature counterpart that actively maintains spatial identity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Transcriptional variability in excitatory cells of the hippocampus</title><p>A central goal of neuroscience is to disentangle and understand the vast complexity of neuronal populations, both within and between cell classes. Next-generation RNA-seq provides a comprehensive means of clarifying cellular identities in the hippocampus and complements other gene expression analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>). Our work here furthers understanding of across-class differences, but also emphasizes the high degree of transcriptional variability that can be present within a given population (e.g., across the dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus). Pyramidal cells in CA1 and CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>), as well as both mossy cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) of the dentate gyrus, appear to exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity across the long axis. Notably, this within-class, dorsal-ventral heterogeneity can exhibit different organizational principles; for example, CA3 pyramidal cells have been shown to conform to discrete subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>), whereas CA1 pyramidalÂ cellsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>), DG mossy cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4)</xref>,Â and DGÂ granule cellsÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5)</xref>Â doÂ not exhibit clear subdomain organization.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that our results, although illustrating a high degree of transcriptional heterogeneity in principal cells of the hippocampus, likely underestimate the total amount of variability for several reasons. First, comparing the dorsal and ventral poles may miss differences present along other dimensions, as well as differences present at spatially intermediate locations. Second, our population-level approach may miss heterogeneity that is present at a subpopulation or single-cell level, including transcriptional signatures associated with specialized but sparse excitatory cell classes (e.g., radiatum giant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gulyas et al., 1998</xref>), semilunar granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Williams et al., 2007</xref>), and CA3 granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szabadics et al., 2010</xref>)). Finally, transcriptional properties may vary in ways other than geographical location; for example, differential gene expression for cells of the same region that target different downstream locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sorensen et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Hipposeq, a publicly available resource for hippocampal transcriptomics</title><p>All data presented here are accessible on the Hipposeq website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hipposeq.janelia.org">http://hipposeq.janelia.org</ext-link>), an interactive database that allows user-friendly analysis and visualization of gene expression data for individual genes, cohorts of genes, and entire transcriptomes.

This website and associated dataset expand upon and complement other existing publicly available gene expression databases, mostly notably the ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lein et al., 2007</xref>). Our RNA-seq approach offers advantages that circumvent traditional issues associated with ISH; namely, providing class-specific data with a large dynamic range, helping to circumvent confounds associated with image-based analyses of gene expression that can be limited by changes in cell density and/or labeling across sections. Of course, RNA-seq also has limitations relative to ISH, including an inherent lack of spatial information. In this way, the combination of Hipposeq and the ABA ISH atlas provides a powerful set of tools that enables quantitative and histological whole genome insight into gene expression in the hippocampus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Mice were housed on a 12-hr light/dark cycle with ad libitum food and water access.

The datasets appear to have been carefully generated and analysed, and the results and methods are clearly described. It is likely the datasets will be useful as a &quot;ground truth&quot; of population level gene expression profiles of each of the investigated cell types.</p><p>Points for revision:</p><p>1) The study claims to have characterised gene expression for every excitatory neuronal class in the hippocampus. While we agree the major classes have been characterised, there are additional excitatory cell classes that were not investigated, e.g. semilunar granule cells in the dentate gyrus (Williams et al., J. Neurosci. 2007; Larimer and Strowbridge, Nature Neuroscience 2010), radiatum giant cells in CA1 (Gulyas et al., Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; Bullis et al., J. Physiol. 2007), and CA3 granule cells (Szabadics et al., J. Neurosci. 2010). These classes have distinct morphology and biophysical properties. It would not be surprising if their gene expression profiles are also distinct. Given the good evidence for these additional excitatory cell classes, the claims for completeness should be qualified and the excitatory cell classes not characterised should be acknowledged.</p><p>2) The replicate correlation score is much lower for granule cells. Is there a known reason for this? Were granule cells sampled from upper or lower blade of the DG? Or both? Is there a difference?</p><p>3) Mapping of reads used TopHat. For many applications this has been superseded by STAR (Dobin et al., Bioinformatics 2013) which has been suggested to map more accurately. It might be worth checking whether this gives improvements sufficient to reveal any additional differentially expressed genes.</p><p>4) The Hipposeq resource is referred to multiple times in the manuscript, but is not accessible so it is not possible to comment on the &quot;resource&quot; aspect of the manuscript. It's also not clear what the resource provides that could not be achieved by downloading the data via GEO and using standard analysis tools. Ease of use? Novel analyses?</p><p>5) Materials and methods. '12-hour light/dark cycle'. At what time were the animals sacrificed? If the time differed between animals, does this contribute to any variance in the data?</p><p>6) In the last paragraph of the subsection âGenerating a cell- and region-specific RNA-seq database for the hippocampusâ. How many cells (mean Â± SD)? I think this is in the Methods, but would be helpful to make clear in the Results section.</p><p>7) In the first paragraph of the subsection âManual sorting, library preparation, and sequencingâ. Which C57bl/6 strain? If not generated on this background, for how many generations are the lines back-crossed?</p><p>8) How was the integrity of the RNA assessed? E.g. was there a threshold RIN value?</p><p>9) There is increasing evidence for diversity of CA1 along the radial (deep vs. superficial) axis. Please consider.</p><p>10) The figure legends are a bit sparse and could benefit from adding a more detailed description of the data.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>. Please label the various panels with the identity of the transgenic line.</p><p>12) Although some mouse lines do show fairly specific expression limited to specific subregions, other lines show very broad patterns of expression, particularly for CA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). How did the authors manage to get a CA2-specific population to examine?</p><p>13) Did the authors look for inhibitory specific cell markers (e.g. GAD65,67) to judge the level of contamination from inhibitory neurons?</p><p>14) Please give a better description of the bar graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>, etc. Is the x-axis the cell type? If so, it would be helpful to indicate this on the panels and in the legend. Also, what is the y-axis? FPKM? Please define. The normalized color plots of FPKM are hard to understand, and the description in the Methods are obscure for a non-expert. What is the being normalized? The bar-graph quantification much more useful than the normalized color plots.

While we agree the major classes have been characterised, there are additional excitatory cell classes that were not investigated, e.g. semilunar granule cells in the dentate gyrus (Williams et al., J. Neurosci. 2007; Larimer and Strowbridge, Nature Neuroscience 2010), radiatum giant cells in CA1 (Gulyas et al., Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; Bullis et al., J.

It would not be surprising if their gene expression profiles are also distinct. Given the good evidence for these additional excitatory cell classes, the claims for completeness should be qualified and the excitatory cell classes not characterised should be acknowledged.</italic> The reviewer makes an excellent point. As such, we have removed all claims of profiling every excitatory neuronal class in the hippocampus, instead emphasizing that we have investigated the major neuronal classes. In addition, we have explicitly indicated in the Discussion that there are additional classes that require further investigation, specifically highlighting the classes the reviewer points out.</p><p><italic>2) The replicate correlation score is much lower for granule cells. Is there a known reason for this?</italic> </p><p>The relatively low correlation in DG granule cells (dorsal in particular) emerges largely due to one dorsal replicate having a slightly lower correlation with the other two dorsal DG granule cell replicates (<italic>r</italic> = 0.94 and 0.94 when correlating this replicate to the other two dorsal DG replicates). We do not know the exact reason for this lower correlation, but have ruled out contributions from off-target effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>We also hasten to emphasize that the overall dorsal DG granule cell correlation is still very high (~95% correlation), and seems relatively low in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref> due to the near- perfect correlations found in our other datasets (typically 98-99% correlated).</p><p><italic>Were granule cells sampled from upper or lower blade of the DG? Or both?</italic> </p><p>Cells for sorting were taken from both the upper and lower blades of the DG. We have noted this in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Is there a difference?</italic> </p><p>We were also interested in whether there were discernable differences in gene expression between the upper and lower blades of the dentate gyrus, which we have previously investigated by examining the Allen Brain Atlas in situhybridization database. However, neither manual searching nor automated methods were able to identify clear gene expression differences between the upper and lower blades. We have noted this in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Mapping of reads used TopHat. For many applications this has been superseded by STAR (Dobin et al., Bioinformatics 2013) which has been suggested to map more accurately. It might be worth checking whether this gives improvements sufficient to reveal any additional differentially expressed genes.</italic> The reviewer makes an excellent suggestion. We have now conducted this analysis, which produced few differences relative to our previously used pipeline, and note this in the newest version of the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3H-J</xref>).</p><p>To elaborate on this approach, we used STAR v2.5.1a with default arguments to conduct alignment, and subsequently performed quantification and differential expression with Cuffdiff. This approach was analogous to our previous pipeline, with the sole exception of changing the alignment software (STAR vs. TopHat), allowing us to assess the choice of software on downstream quantification and differential expression.</p><p>First, we examined whether the transcriptomes were quantitatively similar across alignment approaches. Comparing average transcriptomes across alignment software, we found that most genes had similar FPKM values between the two approaches. For example, for dorsal CA1, the Pearson correlation between the outputs of the two pipelines was 0.98 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>; for all datasets, Pearson correlation = 0.98 Â± 0.00, mean Â± SD, n=8 datasets).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14997.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14997.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14997.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14997-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>We note that there are indeed differences between the two aligners for some genes, which are expected due to some fundamentally different properties of the two aligners (e.g., relativetolerances for mismatches and splice junctions; see EngstrÃ¶m et al., Nature Methods, 2013 for detailed analysis). However, the vast majority of genes were found to be expressed to similar levels between the two alignment strategies, indicating that to a first approximation the overall measured transcriptomes were robust to alignment software.</p><p>As requested, we next investigated the robustness of differential expression calls across alignment software. Here, too, the results were similar between the two aligners; e.g., for dorsal vs. ventral CA1, the overall extent of differential expression was nearly identical, with almost all genes being shared between the two alignment schemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>, with differentially expressed genes highlighted in green; 955/1015 = 94% of differentially expressed genes found by Tophat were also identified by STAR).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14997.022</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14997.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14997.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14997-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig></p><p>These results were similar for differential expression analyses across all pairwise comparisons (95.0 Â± 1.3% of differentially expressed genes found by TopHat approach were shared with STAR, with STAR identifying 6.8 Â± 1.3% more genes than TopHat; mean Â± SD, n = 28 pairwise comparisons for each). This revealed that STAR did not make a substantial increase in differential expression calls relative to TopHat, and thus reinforces the robustness of our results to the particular choice of alignment software.</p><p><italic>4) The Hipposeq resource is referred to multiple times in the manuscript, but is not accessible so it is not possible to comment on the &quot;resource&quot; aspect of the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>The website is now accessible with the credentials provided in response to the comments above.</p><p><italic>It's also not clear what the resource provides that could not be achieved by downloading the data via GEO and using standard analysis tools. Ease of use? Novel analyses?</italic> </p><p>Primarily, our website will be of use to individuals and laboratories that do not have prior knowledge in the statistical analysis and/or visualization of RNA-seq data. For this audience, Hipposeq provides a readily available interface that does not require coding experience or statistical knowledge to quickly arrive at mathematically well-principled and biologically informative results.</p><p>Even for individuals and laboratories that have background in the bioinformatics of RNA-seq analysis, moving from raw data to finalized conclusions can be a challenging and time-consuming task (e.g., Garber et al., Nature Methods, 2011). We have worked hard to provide a suite of analysis and visualization tools that allow our RNA-seq data to be immediately examined and interpreted. In particular, this suite includes exploratory analysis tools that interactively facilitate moving from broad analyses (e.g., comparing transcriptomes) to more refined, low-level searches (e.g., comparing gene cohorts or individual genes). These readily available analysis tools will a helpful asset for novel and experienced users alike.</p><p> <italic>5) Materials and methods. '12-hour light/dark cycle'. At what time were the animals sacrificed? If the time differed between animals, does this contribute to any variance in the data?</italic> To avoid any contributions arising from circadian rhythms, all animals in this study were sacrificed within a 3-hour time window approximately halfway through the light cycle. We now explicitly mention this in the Methods of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) In the last paragraph of the subsection âGenerating a cell- and region-specific RNA-seq database for the hippocampusâ. How many cells (mean Â± SD)? I think this is in the Methods, but would be helpful to make clear in the Results section.</italic> This value (112 Â± 6 cells per biological replicate, n = 24 replicates) is now included in the Results section.</p><p><italic>7) In the first paragraph of the subsection âManual sorting, library preparation, and sequencingâ. Which C57bl/6 strain?</italic> </p><p>C57bl/6J strain was used; this is now included in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>If not generated on this background, for how many generations are the lines back-crossed?</italic> </p><p>Most transgenic lines used in this study were not generated on the C57bl/6 background, but all lines were bred to C57bl/6 at least one generation, which we now note in the Methods. We do not believe that the number of generations of the backcross has a dramatic effect on the observed results, for three reasons. First, our RNA-seq results were cross-validated by ABA ISH data, which was performed on a C57Bl6/J background. Second, we have previously shown (Cembrowski et al., Neuron, 2016) that our RNA-seq results recapitulate differential expression results from other mouse species (e.g., cf. 129SvEv mice from Leonardo et al., Neuroscience, 2006). Third, consistent with the previous two points, gene expression differences across mouse strains have been shown to be negligible (e.g., &lt;1% of expressed genes in the hippocampus are differentially expressed between 129SvEv and C57bl/6 lines, Sandberg et al., PNAS, 2000).</p><p> <italic>8) How was the integrity of the RNA assessed? E.g. was there a threshold RIN value?</italic> As we have relatively few cells per replicate, we have insufficient RNA to determine RIN scores. However, we have two lines of argument that suggest our RNA integrity is nevertheless very high. First, our preparation keeps neurons alive as they go into lysis buffer containing DTT, preserving RNA integrity at â80C until downstream RNA extraction and library preparation.</p><p>Second, the high correlation found between RNA-seq replicates suggests that our RNA integrity is high, as poor RNA healthy tends to produce poorly correlated replicates.</p><p><italic>9) There is increasing evidence for diversity of CA1 along the radial (deep vs. superficial) axis. Please consider.</italic> We are very interested in this as well, and investigated it in depth in a recent publication (Cembrowski et al., Neuron, 2016). To summarize these findings, we found that the superficial-deep axis does contain transcriptional differences; however, these differences were quantitatively much smaller than dorsal-ventral differences in CA1 (see Figure S3, Cembrowski et al., Neuron, 2016).</p><p><italic>10) The figure legends are a bit sparse and could benefit from adding a more detailed description of the data.</italic> We have incorporated additional details to the legends, especially elaborating on the conventions of bar graphs and heat maps used throughout this paper (as requested in point 14 below).</p><p><italic>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>. Please label the various panels with the identity of the transgenic line.</italic> Done.</p><p><italic>12) Although some mouse lines do show fairly specific expression limited to specific subregions, other lines show very broad patterns of expression, particularly for CA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). How did the authors manage to get a CA2-specific population to examine?</italic> The transgenic animals used for characterization of CA2 (Mpp3-cre x Ai9) showed a sharp drop in fluorescence at the CA1-CA2 border. Using this border as a landmark, we carefully microdissected out a region immediately before this drop in fluorescent expression, postulating that this was a small region corresponding to CA2 pyramidal cells. After obtaining transcriptomes for this labeled population, we verified post hoc the enrichment of genes previously associated with CA2 pyramidal cells (indicating CA2 was effectively targeted; e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and the depletion of previously identified genes associated with CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells (indicating off-target CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells were effectively excluded; e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>13) Did the authors look for inhibitory specific cell markers (e.g. GAD65,67) to judge the level of contamination from inhibitory neurons?</italic> Yes. These data are part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>, and show that all replicates are devoid of expression of gene cohorts associated with a variety of off-target cells, including interneurons.</p><p><italic>14) Please give a better description of the bar graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>, etc. Is the X axis the cell type, if so, it would be helpful to indicate this on the panels and in the legend? Also, what is the Y axis? FPKM? Please define.</italic> </p><p>These conventions are now explained in the Methods, as well as in the figure legend corresponding to the first bar graph to appear in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p><italic>The normalized color plots of FPKM are hard to understand, and the description in the Methods are obscure for a non-expert. What is the being normalized?</italic> </p><p>Again, these conventions are now explained in the Methods, as well as incorporated into the figure legend for the first heat map to appear in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p><italic>The bar-graph quantification much more useful than the normalized color plots.</italic> </p><p>We certainly agree that the bar graphs are much easier to interpret than the heat maps when considering small numbers of genes. However, heat maps are the easiest way to quickly visualize expression for more comprehensive lists of genes, and a standard visualization technique for representation of gene cohort data in genomics (e.g., Sugino et al., Nat. Neuro., 2006; Bernard et al., Neuron, 2012; Zhang et al., J. Neurosci., 2014). As such, we have used bar plots when considering individual genes or small groups of genes, and heat maps when trying to communicate the full extent of gene expression differences between samples.</p><p><italic>Perhaps the authors may wish to include a table in the supplemental material listing actual fold differences in expression of various genes?</italic></p><p>We have provided an interface on the website to allow users to select desired populations and parameters for enrichment assays, and also included a table listing fold differences for DG granule cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), which were specifically examined and referenced in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
