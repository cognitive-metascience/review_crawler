Predicting when events will occur is a critical component of these expectations. Temporal expectations are often generated based on individual cue-duration relationships. However, the durations associated with different environmental cues will often co-vary due to a common cause. We show that timing behavior may be calibrated based on this expected covariance, which we refer to as the ‘common cause hypothesis’. In five experiments using rats, we found that when the duration associated with one temporal cue changes, timed-responding to other cues shift in the same direction. Furthermore, training subjects that expecting covariance is not appropriate in a given situation blocks this effect. Finally, we confirmed that this transfer is context-dependent. These results reveal a novel principle that modulates timing behavior, which we predict will apply across a variety of magnitude-expectations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cauality</kwd><kwd>statistical inference</kwd><kwd>interval timing</kwd><kwd>time perception</kwd><kwd>causal reasoning</kwd><kwd>peak-interval procedure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Temporal expectations can be guided by local sources of information. For example, specific environmental stimuli often function as temporal cues (e.g., a traffic light turning yellow indicates that it will turn red after a certain duration has passed).</p><p>However, global properties of the environment can be used to calibrate these expectancies. This point can be illustrated with the following metaphor. Consider an animal that is foraging for food in an area that contains two plant types—plant A and plant B. When it searches through plant A, it typically finds food every 8 s. In contrast, when searching through plant B, it finds food every 16 s. Despite the fact that these plants (i.e. temporal cues) are associated with different inter-food intervals (i.e. durations), the intervals for both plant types will co-vary as environmental conditions change. For example, during a drought, both plant types would produce less food than normal. Consequently, the intervals would increase for both plant types (i.e. food would be found less frequently), relative to stable weather conditions.</p><p>Now, consider what would happen if the animal were to enter the drought-impacted area and learned that plant A’s interval increased. If the animal anticipates that there will be covariance between plant A and B’s intervals, it could use plant A’s new inter-food interval to estimate what plant B’s new duration will be, without physically visiting the plant itself. In other words, knowledge of or expectations about the statistical structure of the environment would allow the learning from plant A to generalize to other plants in the area.</p><p>From an evolutionary standpoint, this would be a highly advantageous process because the animal could predict the expected rate of return for foraging in the entire area based on a change in one interval. As such, it would spend less time before deciding to stay or leave a given location, relative to learning each plant’s new interval individually.</p><p>The essential point proposed in the above example is that, in the environment, the intervals associated with different temporal cues will often co-vary due to a common underlying cause (e.g. drought, increased rainfall, seasonal changes, etc.). Our question is whether a mechanism has evolved that capitalizes upon this property in order to adaptively recalibrate behavior. We will refer to this possibility as the ‘common cause hypothesis’ and test its predictions in the following experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1: changes in temporal expectations transfer across cues</title><p>The underlying premise of the common cause hypothesis is that common causal factors can often produce covariance among the durations associated with distinct temporal cues. According to this hypothesis, observers can benefit from this statistical property by anticipating that, when the duration associated with one temporal cue changes, the durations associated with other cues will have changed in the same direction.</p><p>We tested this hypothesis using the ‘peak-interval’ procedure. In this task, trials begin with the presentation of a cue that indicates reward can be earned for responding after a specified duration elapses (e.g. responding at a nosepoke after 16 s have passed). Probe trials are also included in which the cue remains on for much longer than normal (e.g. 48 –64 s) and no reward is provided. When averaged across trials, probe trial responding resembles a Gaussian curve with a peak (i.e. peak time) centered over the trained time of reward, providing an estimate of the temporal expectation associated with the cue in question (for examples see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38790.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A and D depict the general design used for the 8-to-4 (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and 16-to-32 (<italic>n</italic> = 10) groups, respectively.</title><p>(<bold>B</bold>) and (<bold>E</bold>) show average normalized response rate during probe trials during initial training and testing for the 8-to-4 and 16-to-32 groups, respectively.

Then, during a ‘change phase’, we altered the duration of one of the cues, hereafter, referred to as the ‘changed cue’. Specifically, for one group, we decreased the short, 8 s cue’s duration to 4 s (8-to-4 group). Conversely, for the other group, we increased the long, 16 s cue’s duration to 32 s (16-to-32 group). Importantly, we did not present the other, ‘unchanged cue’ until testing, which occurred after rats had adapted to the changed cue’s new duration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref> for design schematics).</p><p>According to the common cause hypothesis, increasing or decreasing the changed cue’s duration should produce a corresponding increase or decrease in the unchanged cue’s temporal expectation. We evaluated this during a test phase by introducing probe trials for the unchanged cue (i.e. no feedback regarding when to respond was provided). Normalized average probe trial responding from the 8-to-4 and 16-to-32 groups during initial training and testing are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for non-normalized graphs). For clarity, we present percent change in peak-times in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>. However, all statistical comparisons were conducted on non-normalized values here and throughout, with the exception of the Bayesian analyses to account for within-subject variance (see below and methods). Consistent with our prediction, in both groups, responding to the unchanged cue shifted in the same direction as the changed cue, despite the fact that the unchanged cue’s duration was never explicitly altered.</p><p>Specifically, in the 8-to-4 group, decreasing the short cue’s duration from 8 to 4 s caused responding to the long (i.e., unchanged) cue to shift leftward [<italic>M</italic> = −22% ± 5% <italic>SEM</italic>, <italic>t</italic>(9) = −4.10, p&lt;.005; ANOVA: Phase, <italic>F</italic>(1,8) = 55.72, p&lt;0.001; Cue, <italic>F</italic>(1,8) = 875.72, p&lt;0.001]. Likewise, in the 16-to-32 group, increasing the 16 s cue’s duration to 32 s caused responding to the short (i.e. unchanged) cue to shift rightward [<italic>M</italic> = 59% + /- 9% <italic>SEM</italic>, <italic>t</italic>(9) = 6.02, p <italic>&lt;</italic>. 001; ANOVA: Phase, <italic>F</italic>(1,8) = 49.47, p&lt;0.001; Cue, <italic>F</italic>(1,8) = 363.02, p&lt;0.001; Phase X Cue, <italic>F</italic>(1,8) = 68.40, p&lt;0.001]. In contrast, no significant changes were found in the relative spreads of the response function (i.e. coefficient of variation (CV) = spread/peak time) [8-to-4, <italic>M</italic> = −4% ± 10% <italic>SEM</italic>, <italic>t</italic>(9) =.038; p&gt;0.05; 16-to-32, <italic>M</italic> = 16% + /- 7% <italic>SEM</italic>, <italic>t</italic>(9) = 2.21, p&gt;0.05]. In other words, changes in the spread of responding were consistent with the scalar property of interval timing, whereby the spread scales in direct proportion to the peak time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gibbon et al., 1984</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that the smooth response curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> do not reflect the response pattern generated on individual probe trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Church et al., 1994</xref>). Rather, during probe trials, rats emit an abrupt burst of responses that typically start before and stop after the expected time of reward. While single-trial behavioral data during unchanged cue trials were limited and variable—a common finding during extinction trials in this task—changes in start and stop times were largely consistent with the peak time shifts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for single-trial averages for this experiment, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> for all others). Specifically, in the 16-to-32 group, both start and stop times were delayed during unchanged cue trials, relative to initial training [Start: <italic>M</italic> = 59% + /- 12% <italic>SEM</italic>, <italic>t</italic>(9) = 4.14, p&lt;.005; Stop: <italic>M</italic> = 65% + /- 10% <italic>SEM</italic>, <italic>t</italic>(9) = 6.23, p&lt;0.001]. Comparably, in the 8-to-4 group, long cue stop times were leftward shifted [<italic>M</italic> = −27% ± 5% <italic>SEM</italic>, <italic>t</italic>(9) = −5.54, p&lt;0.001]. However, start times were not reliably different [<italic>M</italic> = −4% ± 12% <italic>SEM</italic>, <italic>t</italic>(9) = −0.83, p&gt;0.05].</p><p>We also ran a control group, in which we replicated the design used for the 8-to-4 group, yet kept the short cue’s duration at 8 s throughout the experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for schematic). This allowed us to assess the possibility that over-exposing rats to the changed cue during what would have been the ‘change phase’ could cause responding to the long cue to shift leftward, regardless of whether a duration-change occurred.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38790.011</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A depicts the design used for each phase in the no-change control group (<italic>n</italic> = 10).</title><p><sc>(</sc><bold>B</bold>) shows normalized response rate during training and testing.

Critically, using an alternative prior that tested the specific hypothesis that the peak times shifted to the same degree as the 8-to-4 group showed decisive evidence in favor of the null [Bayes Factor = 2875.88].

For example, in the 8-to-4 group, responses to the long, unchanged cue shifted leftward because the short cue’s duration shifted leftward.</p><p>However, this explanation highlights that altering the changed cue’s duration will induce uncertainty regarding the status of the unchanged cue’s duration. Many have shown that, when subjects time multiple durations under conditions of uncertainty, their estimates regress toward the mean of all experienced intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Corte and Matell, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). This is often interpreted as a Bayesian process, wherein heightened uncertainty causes subjects to rely more heavily on prior knowledge (all previously learned intervals) over current sensory measurements (timing of the present cue’s duration). Consequently, estimates of all intervals regress toward one another.</p><p>This explanation can account for Experiment 1’s results. For example, in the 8-to-4 group, the uncertainty from altering the 8 s cue’s duration could have caused responses for the 16 s cue to regress leftward, toward the average of all previously experienced intervals (4, 8, and 16 s). Similarly, in the 16-to-32 group, increasing the 16 s cue’s duration may have caused responses to the 8 s cue to move rightward, toward the mean of the previously learned intervals (8, 16, and 32 s).</p><p>This ‘regression to the mean’ account and the common cause hypothesis make identical predictions for Experiment 1. However, we were able to dissociate them with the following design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). First, we trained rats to associate a tone and light with either an 8- or 16 s duration, as in Experiment 1. Then, we increased the 8 s cue’s duration to 12 s and subsequently evaluated how rats responded to the 16 s cue. In this case, the average of all intervals remained to the left of the 16 s cue’s duration. Therefore, the regression account predicts a leftward shift in responding. In contrast, according to the common cause hypothesis, increasing the 8 s cue’s duration to 12 s should cause responses to the 16 s cue to shift rightward, as the direction of the changed-cue shift should determine the direction of the unchanged-cue shift.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38790.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A shows the design used in the 8-to-12 group of the second experiment (<italic>n</italic> = 10).</title><p>(<bold>B</bold>) shows normalized responding during training and the test phases.

However, it also altered the reward-structure of the overall task itself. Using the 8-to-4 group of Experiment 1 as an example, decreasing the 8 s cue’s duration to 4 s caused a global decrease in the intervals being produced during the task. Furthermore, it introduced a novel duration that was earlier than the intervals the rats had learned up to that point. These non-cue-specific changes to the overall task could produce the pattern of transfer we observed.</p><p>For example, altering the changed-cue’s duration often shifted the overall average time-to-reward during the task. For illustration, during the change phase in the 8-to-4 group, reward was delivered consistently at 4 s, rather than occurring at 8 or 16 s as during training. Unchanged-cue responding could have shifted in the direction of this average reward-time change. However, we note that, in the no-change group of the first experiment, maintaining the 8 s cue’s duration during the ‘change’ phase decreased the overall average time-to-reward (i.e., consistently at 8 s, rather than 8 or 16 s during training). We did not observe a leftward shift in responding in this group, thereby weakening this explanation.</p><p>Another possibility is that introducing a novel duration that was earlier or later, relative to the previously trained intervals, caused responses to the unchanged cue to shift in the same direction. However, in the 8-to-12 group of Experiment 2, the new 12 s duration fell between the initial 8- and 16 s durations. As this new duration was neither earlier nor later than both of the two previously trained intervals, this explanation would not account for the rightward shift in unchanged-cue responding.</p><p>While these results weaken a reward-structure account, we directly addressed this concern in Experiment 3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). First, we trained rats to associate two cues with an 8- and 16 s duration, respectively. Then, we instituted a change phase, in which we stopped presenting the 16 s cue. In one ‘no-change group’, we kept presenting the 8 s cue, maintaining its duration. Critically, we also introduced a novel cue that predicted reward availability at 4 s. This changed the reward structure, without introducing a cue-duration relationship change. In contrast, in the ‘change group’, we decreased the 8 s cue’s duration to 4 s and associated the novel cue with an 8 s duration. With this design, the overall reward structure of the task (i.e. cues, durations, etc.) was identical between the two groups. However, only the ‘change’ group experienced a cue-duration relationship change. Consequently, any between-group differences in unchanged-cue responding could only be driven by the cue-duration change.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38790.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Top panels of A and B show designs used for the change (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and no-change (<italic>n</italic> = 5) groups of Experiment 3, respectively.</title><p>Mean normalized response rate for the critical, long cue during initial training and testing are plotted in the corresponding bottom panels.

We tested a final prediction based on the purported functional purpose of this mechanism.</p><p>To illustrate, we will again use the metaphor of an animal foraging in an area that contains two plant types. When foraging through plant A, it finds food every 8 s, whereas searching through plant B yields food every 16 s. Under stable conditions, the intervals associated with either plant type will remain constant. However, during a drought, both plants would become depleted, causing their inter-food intervals to increase. According to the common cause hypothesis, if the animal learns that plant B’s inter-food interval increased, it will expect that plant A’s interval also increased. Our results support this notion.</p><p>However, what would happen if the animal left the drought impacted area and travelled to a new location that also contained plant types A and B. Would the assumption that plant A’s interval has changed be appropriate in this new context? Furthermore, should the animal expect that plant B’s interval changed, as it did in the drought impacted area? As an extreme example, if the two locations were located on different continents, a drought affecting one should have little relevance to the other.</p><p>The essential point posed in this example is that, in the environment, common causal factors that impact the durations associated with different temporal cues (e.g. drought) should be context-specific. We tested this prediction in our next experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref> for design). First, we trained rats to associate a tone and light with either an 8- or 16 s duration in one context. Then, we moved them into a novel context, and trained them that the 16 s cue now predicted reward after 32 s. Finally, we evaluated how they would respond to both cues when tested in the original training context versus the novel context (i.e. no feedback was given for either cue). If the common cause hypothesis is correct, any transfer should be eliminated or attenuated when rats are tested in the original training context, relative to the novel context.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38790.027</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Top panels of (A) and (B) illustrate the design used in either context during Experiment 5 (<italic>n</italic> = 20).</title><p>Panels below each schematic show corresponding normalized response rates during training and during testing in either context.

This account emphasizes that, in a real-world setting, the durations associated with distinct temporal cues will often covary due to a common underlying cause. We evaluated whether a mechanism has evolved that allows observers to utilize this statistical property in order to adaptively recalibrate expectations. Consistent with this, we found that, when the duration associated with one temporal cue changes, the temporal expectations associated with other cues shift in the same direction (Experiments 1–3). Furthermore, in Experiment 4, we found that, when the durations associated with multiple temporal cues do not covary, the transfer is absent. Finally, in Experiment 5, we confirmed that this transfer is context-dependent. These results have important implications within and beyond the field of timing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Model-free vs. Model-based mechanisms?</title><p>The common cause hypothesis focuses on the function that the transfer we document here serves to the organism in question. However, it does not propose a theoretical mechanism by which the transfer occurs. A variety of mechanisms can potentially account for our results. The topic can broadly be framed in terms of the contrast between ‘model-free’ and ‘model-based’ behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daw et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doll et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gläscher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petter et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In model-based behavior, actions are guided by cognitive models of the sequence of events and choices that lead to desired outcomes (e.g. reward). With respect to the transfer we observe, rats in our studies could have relied on a statistical model of the expected covariance between the different entrained intervals and used this to guide responding to the unchanged cue. They could even have explicitly inferred that the changed-cue’s duration shifted due to a common cause that operated on all cues, as contemporary data suggest that rodents engage in causal reasoning, make inferences about latent variables in the environment, and rely on covariance computations during conditioning experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blaisdell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng and Novick, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gershman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Starkweather et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>However, dissociating whether rats truly engage in causal and/or statistical inference or simply act <italic>as if</italic> they are doing so is a difficult problem. For example, ‘model-free’ processes could have guided the transfer. In this behavioral mode, simple stimulus-response associations guide behavior, rather than more complex cognitive models. With respect to our data, a particularly important consideration is how simple extinction and reinforcement mechanisms could produce the transfer.</p><p>Specifically, in our tasks, changing a cue’s duration entailed extinguishing responses emitted at the old reinforced time and reinforcing responses emitted at the new time. If these response-level extinction and reinforcement processes carried over to unchanged cue trials, responding would shift in the direction of the changed cue’s new duration. To assess this, we recommend using a design in which each cue is associated with a different action-outcome contingency (e.g., Cue 1: 8 s/nosepoke; Cue 2: 16 s/lever press). During the change phase, model-free processes would operate on different actions. Therefore, under this account, one would not expect the transfer to occur.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for theories of timing</title><p>As far as we are aware, no traditional timing theory can readily (i.e. without modification) account for our findings. For example, established models of timing at both the cognitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gibbon et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Killeen and Fetterman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kirkpatrick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machado et al., 2009</xref>) and neural level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matell and Meck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simen et al., 2011</xref>) typically assume that the temporal expectations associated with different cues are independent of one another. That is, a change in one cue-duration relationship should have no impact on performance for the others an observer has learned. Our results clearly challenge this assumption.</p><p>This is not to say that timing models could not be modified to account for our findings. Our primary point is that the information that guides responding to a temporal signal may be far more complex than often assumed, being guided by a host of variables that go beyond a given cue-duration relationship. This has been proposed previously and is supported by work showing that rodents take non-temporal factors into account when guiding responses in time, such as the probability of receiving reward after a given duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balci et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Corte and Matell, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gür and Balcı, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, during Pavlovian conditioning, the learning-rate for a cue is determined by the relative relationship between the duration separating cue-onset and reward-delivery and the interval separating successive rewards, rather than the cue-reward interval alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balsam and Gallistel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gallistel and Balsam, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallistel and Gibbon, 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>ACT-R pooled memory model</title><p>There is one model that is important to discuss, as it was able to predict aspects of the data where traditional models failed. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taatgen and van Rijn (2011)</xref> recently proposed a modified clock-memory model based on the well-established ACT-R cognitive architecture, a theory that has enjoyed wide success at explaining cognitive phenomena across a variety of domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 1996</xref>). In their model, the ‘temporal memory’ associated with a cue is determined by a pool of recently experienced intervals. Importantly, this pool consists of intervals associated with all cues an observer has experienced in the recent past. When a cue is presented, the observer retrieves a blend of the durations contained in this pool. More weight is given to the intervals associated with the cue in question, causing the final estimate to fall close to its true duration. However, the intervals associated with other cues also bias the retrieved estimate, due to memory interference. In support of this, they documented cross-cue transfer in humans, similar to the transfer we observed.</p><p>Our results can inform this model in several respects. First, Experiment 4 suggests that transfer is not inevitable when the duration associated with one cue changes. Rather, duration-change covariance determines whether reliable transfer occurs, which is currently not incorporated in the model. Second, Experiment 5 suggests that the physical context in which a memory is retrieved strongly modulates cross-cue transfer. Interestingly, in their model, temporal memories are treated as declarative knowledge, and this proposition was recently supported by work in mice showing that temporal and episodic memory may be highly inter-related processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kheifets et al., 2017</xref>). Work in other domains has shown that declarative memory retrieval is heavily influenced by physical context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bilodeau and Schlosberg, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Godden and Baddeley, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith and Vela, 2001</xref>), and ACT-R has been equipped to deal with such contextual variables in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, adding a context-component may be straightforward.</p><p>Finally, there is a conceptual problem with applying this theory to our data. Specifically, according to their model, the transfer occurs due to memory interference. In some of our experiments, unchanged cue responding shifted by as much as 60% (e.g., the 16-to-32 group of Experiment 1). Pragmatically, if memory interference were responsible for such a dramatic shift, one would have to assume that the interval timing system is incredibly delicate and potentially question what utility it has in a real-world context. The common cause hypothesis does not suffer from this critique, as the transfer serves a function.</p><p>Exploring these modifications could potentially provide a bridge between the timing field and research in other cognitive domains in which ACT-R is more often utilized. Importantly, the theory could provide an avenue for mathematically formalizing the common cause hypothesis, which, at present, can only predict whether or in what direction transfer will occur.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Future directions and beyond timing</title><p>This work opens several avenues for future research on the effects documented here. For example, an important question is whether the predictions of the common cause hypothesis will extend beyond the domain of time alone. We feel that this is highly likely within the context of both prior work and the assumptions of the common cause hypothesis.</p><p>For example, evidence suggests that dimensions such as time and number rely on common-coding mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brannon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gallistel and Gelman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leibovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meck and Church, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riemer et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, statistical and/or causal relationships among different environmental cues should not occur within the dimension of time alone. In fact, this can be clearly illustrated from the foraging example that initially inspired the common cause hypothesis. Specifically, during times of increased rainfall, plants might produce more and/or larger fruit than normal, leading to covariance among size and number, in addition to duration. Therefore, one would expect transfer within these dimensions as well.</p><p>A potentially more interesting point to note is that, in this example, duration, size, and number will also co-vary <italic>across</italic> dimensions (e.g. a higher amount of food will shorten a plant’s inter-food interval). Therefore, from the common cause hypothesis, one might expect transfer across these dimensions as well. In support of this, many have documented correlated interactions between the dimensions of time, space, and number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Merritt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rugani and de Hevia, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walsh, 2003</xref>), such as when larger stimuli are perceived as lasting a longer amount of time than smaller stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Corte et al., 2017</xref>). Investigating this proposal might reveal that our results relate to a more general computational principle used for generating expectations of any kind, rather than being a component of the timing system alone.</p><p>Another direction would be to investigate how the cue interactions observed here relate to those seen in other areas of learning and memory research. For example, the ‘peak-shift’ effect, wherein the generalization gradient for a reinforced stimulus is systematically shifted away from a non-reinforced stimulus, is a prominent area of conditioning research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akins et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lynn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siegel, 1967</xref>). Typically, the degree of generalization is determined by their perceptual similarity (e.g. relative brightness). In our study, we chose highly distinct cues whenever possible (often in different modalities) to minimize interpretations related to perceptual generalization. However, the sensory similarity of the two cues may modulate the transfer (as suggested by Experiment 4). Furthermore, our findings may relate to the ‘acquired equivalence’ effect, whereby stimuli that predict the same outcome are treated as more similar than stimuli that predict different outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coutureau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Honey and Hall, 1989</xref>). Further investigations could evaluate how well these phenomena relate to the transfer we observe.</p><p>Finally, an important question is whether the transfer follows an optimal policy. As noted above, the common cause hypothesis can primarily predict whether transfer will occur and in what direction. However, we also propose that the transfer serves an adaptive function. If this were the case, one would expect that the degree of transfer would follow a systematic optimization principle, based on the expected covariance between the cues. To address this, we recommend explicitly training the animals on what degree of temporal covariance to expect between cues by including phases in which all cues are reinforced at new times and the degree of the shifts follows a programmed covariance relationship. If only a single cue were shifted during a final change phase, one could evaluate whether responses to the remaining cue(s) follow the experimentally chosen covariance policy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We begin with a concise overview of our procedures and analyses.

Training progressed through three phases. During an initial ‘training phase’, trials began with the presentation of a cue that predicted reward availability after a certain duration elapsed. Different cues were used, each associated with a different delay to reward (e.g. tone-8s/light-16s). Rats were free to respond at any point when the cue was presented. However, reward was only delivered for a response after the cue’s duration had passed. When a rewarded response occurred, the cue terminated and reward was delivered. Probe trials (30% of trials within a session for each cue) were also included in which the cue was presented for much longer than normal (3–4 times the length of the longest duration in effect), and no reward was provided. Once trained, a ‘change phase’ was implemented. During this phase, the duration associated with one of the cues was changed (i.e. changed cue), and one of the cues was no longer presented (i.e. unchanged cue). Exceptions include the control group of Experiment 1 in which we presented one cue without altering its duration (i.e. ‘exposed’ cue), yet still omitted the other cue (i.e. ‘unexposed’ cue). In Experiment 3’s change phase, the short cue’s duration in the ‘change group’ was shifted to 4 s, whereas in the no-change group, the cue’s duration remained at 8 s. Additionally, a novel cue was added during this phase, signaling reward availability at 8 s (change group) or 4 s (no-change group). In Experiment 4a and 4b, we either changed two cues’ durations (correlated group) or one cue’s duration and left another unchanged (uncorrelated group). Finally, in all experiments, a ‘test phase’ was instituted. This was identical to the change phase. However, we reintroduced the cue that was omitted in the previous phase (20% of trials within a session). No feedback was given during unchanged cue trials. Furthermore, in Experiment 5, all trials were probes, as evaluating shifts in responding for both cues were relevant in that case.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data analysis</title><p>We grouped each rat’s responses into 1 s bins. Then, for each cue, we computed average response rate as a function of time within a trial. These ‘peak functions’ were fit (Matlab curve fitting package, Cambridge, MA) using a five-parameter Gaussian function: Y = B + S * exp((−1/2) * (abs(T - PT)/SP)^K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swanton et al., 2009</xref>). B represents the baseline, S is a scale parameter, T is time, PT is the mean, SP is the spread, and K allows the function to fit peaks with varying degrees of kurtosis. The mode of the distribution was taken as the peak time. We also computed start and stop times during single trials as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Church et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gibbon and Church, 1992</xref>). Briefly, we fit three flat lines to the rate of responding during individual trials (first low, second high, third low). The left and right sides of the higher line were taken as the start and stop time, respectively.</p><p>We compared data from initial training and the test phase with mixed-model ANOVAs. Cue, Phase (training vs. test), and Context (i.e. for Experiment 5; change-context vs. no-change context) served as within-subjects factors. Group and, where applicable, Modality-Duration subgroup (e.g. tone-short/light long vs. tone-long/light short) were used as between-subjects factors. The Modality-Duration relationship did not exert reliable effects in cases where these factors were counterbalanced within an experiment (the four groups in Experiments 1–2). To simplify statistical reporting, these results are not detailed. Planned comparisons were conducted using paired and independent samples t-tests. Critical interactions were evaluated with simple effects. To clearly demarcate planned comparisons from ANOVA statistics, these results are reported using t-values (i.e. taking the square root of the F-statistic and listing the corresponding degrees of freedom). In some cases, we were interested in whether transfer occurred in one group, but not in another (Experiments 1, 3, and 4). To assess evidence in favor of the null hypothesis for the latter case, we used two Bayesian analyses. One utilized an ‘uninformative’ or ‘incremental’ alternative prior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallistel, 2009</xref>) and provided evidence regarding whether a shift in peak times occurred, per se. The null prior was the marginal likelihood distribution of peak times from the group in question, linearly shifted to have a mean of zero. The second analysis was more specific and compared data from the group that was expected to show a shift to the one that was not. The null prior was the same as described above. However, the alternative prior was the marginal likelihood function of peak times from the group that was expected to show a shift.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Detailed experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Subjects and apparatus</title><p>100 naïve, male, Sprague-Dawley rats, who were 2 – 3 months of age at the start of each experiment were used as subjects. Rats were housed in pairs, given free access to water, but food restricted to 85 – 90% of their free-feed weights, adjusted for growth. Colony room lights were set to a 12 hr light-dark cycle. Rats were randomly assigned to experimental groups, and sample sizes for each experiment (10 at a minimum, with a minimum of 5 rats per subgroup) were determined based on prior studies in which a reliable peak time shift of at least 10–20% was assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Corte and Matell, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gooch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matell and Meck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matell et al., 2006</xref>). Rats in Experiments 1, 2, and 5 were run in 2 hr sessions during the light cycle, while rats in Experiment 3 – 4 were run for 12 hr sessions during their dark cycle to accelerate completion of the experiment, due to the increased complexity of training (see below). Subjects were trained and tested in standard operant conditioning chambers (30.5 × 25.4×30.5 cm; Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA). The chambers’ left and right walls consisted of ventilated Plexiglas. The front, back, and top sides of the chambers were composed of aluminum. Floors consisted of an array of stainless steel bars. Three nosepoke apertures, equipped with photobeam detection circuits, were located on the back wall. An 11 lux houselight and seven-tone audio generator, set to produce 90 dB tones, were located along the back wall of the chambers as well. A pellet dispenser on the front wall was used to deliver 45 mg grain pellets into a food magazine (Bio-Serv, Flemington, NJ). A fan (60 dB) provided ventilation. Stimulus control and data acquisition were accomplished using a standard operant-conditioning control program (Graphic State 4, Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA), with a temporal resolution of 1 ms.

As ‘unchanged-cue’ trials were always probes, rats were never given feedback about when to respond. The critical question was whether the time of responding for the ‘unchanged cue’ shifted between the peak-interval (i.e., training) phase and the test phase and, if so, in what direction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-8"><title>Individual experiment descriptions</title><sec id="s4-4-8-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><p>Rats (<italic>n</italic> = 30) were trained that a 1 kHz tone and the houselight were associated with 8 s and 16 s durations until availability of reinforcement. During the change phase, the interval associated with one of the cues was changed, and the other cue was not presented. For half the shift rats (<italic>n</italic> = 10), the interval associated with the short, 8 s cue was changed to 4 s. For the other half of the shift rats (<italic>n</italic> = 10), the interval associated with the long, 16 s cue was changed to 32 s. In the 16-to-32 group, probe trials were extended to 96–128 s to provide sufficient time to assess peak responding. Control rats (<italic>n</italic> = 10) were trained and tested identically to those in the 8-to-4 group above. However, during what would have been the change phase, the short cue’s duration was not altered (i.e. remained at 8 s). The modality-duration relationship was counterbalanced in all groups. As discussed further below, response rates during extinction trials were low and more variable than normal during testing. This was particularly problematic in the 8-to-4 group, with some rats showing a brief burst of responding late into a probe trial, presumably in anticipation of trial end. To prevent these trials from interfering with our measures of peak responding, we excluded trials for this group in which the first response did not occur before 32 s had elapsed (i.e. twice the length of the longest duration in effect). This restriction is highly conservative, relative to other methods used to filter non-timed responses from probe trial data (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Church et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Corte and Matell, 2016a</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4-9"><title>Experiment 2</title><p>Rats (<italic>n</italic> = 10) were trained identically to Experiment 1. However, during the change phase, the short cue’s interval was lengthened to 12 s. The modality-duration relationship was counterbalanced.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-10"><title>Experiment 3</title><p>Rats (<italic>n</italic> = 10) were initially trained to associate a continuous, 1 kHz tone with an 8 s (short) fixed interval schedule and a beeping (10 Hz - 50 ms on, 50 ms off) 4 kHz tone signaled a 16 s (long) fixed-interval schedule. During the change phase, rats were split into two groups (<italic>n</italic> = 5 each). In the first ‘change’ group, the 8 s cue’s duration was decreased to 4 s. We also introduced a novel houselight cue that was associated with an 8 s fixed-interval schedule. In the second ‘no-change’ group, the 8 s cue’s duration was held constant, whereas the novel houselight cue was associated with a 4 s duration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-11"><title>Experiment 4</title><p>In Experiment 4a, rats (<italic>n</italic> = 10) were trained with three cue-interval relationships. A continuous 1 kHz tone signaled a 4 s (short) fixed interval schedule, the houselight signaled an 8 s (medium) fixed-interval schedule, and a beeping (10 Hz - 50 ms on, 50 ms off) 4 kHz tone signaled a 16 s (long) fixed-interval schedule. As in previous experiments, 70% of all trials for each cue were reinforced, and the remaining 30% were non-reinforced. During the change phase, all rats were retrained that the long (beeping tone) cue was lengthened from 16 s to 32 s. Half of the rats were also retrained that the short cue (continuous tone) was lengthened from 4 s to 8 s (correlated group; <italic>n</italic> = 5), whereas in the other half of the rats, the short cue’s duration was maintained at 4 s (uncorrelated group; <italic>n</italic> = 5). During the test phase, we presented the two auditory cues as described above, and presented the medium cue (i.e. houselight) as probe trials only (20% of trials during a session). Experiment 4b was identical. However, the short and long cues were the continuous tone and light, respectively, and the medium cue was the beeping tone. There was a further minor difference due to a procedural error. Specifically, probe trials during the training phase were initially 48 – 64 s and then extended to 96 – 128 s during the change phase, whereas in Experiment 4a, probe trials were 96 – 128 s throughout the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-12"><title>Experiment 5</title><p>Rats (<italic>n</italic> = 20) were trained identically to Experiment 1, except that rats were trained in two different contexts. In addition, the probe lengths for all trials were 96 – 128 s. While the composition of the operant chambers were identical for all rats, half the rats (<italic>n</italic> = 10) were trained in a lab room on the 4th floor, with clay based cat litter (Arm and Hammer Double Duty) serving as ‘bedding’ underneath the metal bars of the operant chamber floor (Context A). These rats were moved via a wheeled cart down a hallway to and from a 4th floor colony room to the testing room on each session. The other half of the rats (<italic>n</italic> = 10) were housed in a colony room on the 3rd floor, and testing occurred in an adjacent room with wood shaving underneath the chamber floor (Context B). During the change phase, the location of all rats was switched (i.e. rats trained in Context A were retrained in Context B and vice-versa). Furthermore, all rats were presented with only the long cue, and the interval until reinforcement availability was lengthened to 32 s. The test phase was two sessions long. One session took place in the rats’ original training context, whereas the other session took place in the novel context in which rats had learned the long cue’s new duration. During both sessions, rats were presented with both the short and long cues as probe trials only, and each cue was presented with an equal probability. The training/novel context testing order was counter-balanced.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Parametric analyses</title><p>Each rat’s responses were grouped into 1 s bins and mean response rate as a function of time within a trial was computed. These ‘peak functions’ were fit (Matlab curve fitting package, Cambridge, MA) using a five-parameter Gaussian function: Y = B + S * exp((−1/2) * (abs(T - PT)/SP)^K), as used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Corte and Matell, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swanton et al., 2009</xref>). B represents the baseline rate of responding, S is a scale parameter, T is time, PT is the mean, SP is the spread, and K allows the function to fit peaks with varying degrees of kurtosis. The mode of the distribution was taken as the peak time.</p><p>We also computed start and stop times during single trials as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Church et al., 1994</xref>). Briefly, we fit three flat lines to responding during individual trials (first low, second high, third low). The left and right sides of the higher line were taken as the start and stop time, respectively. Given that the critical data of interest (i.e., unchanged cue responding) came from extinction trials, single-trial behavior was variable, as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roberts and Gharib, 2006</xref>), and response rates decreased rapidly due to a lack of reinforcement. To prevent non-temporally controlled responses from being spuriously registered as start and stop times, we only analyzed trials in which at least three responses were emitted and the obtained start and stop times occurred before and after the obtained peak time, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Church et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gibbon and Church, 1992</xref>).</p><p>We compared peak, start, and stop times from initial peak-interval training and the test phase with a mixed-model Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) implemented in SPSS. We matched the number of training and test sessions for data analysis. Cue (short vs. long), Phase (initial peak-interval training vs. test-phase), and Context (Experiment 5; no-change vs. change) served as within-subjects factors. Where applicable, Group (e.g., correlated vs. uncorrelated groups of Experiment 4a/b) and the modality-duration subgroup (e.g., 8-to-4, 16-to-32, 8-to-8 groups of Experiment 1 and the 8-to-12 group of Experiment 2) served as between-subjects factors. We did not observe effects related to Modality-Duration subgroups, in cases where this variable was counterbalanced (Experiments 1 – 2). We used paired and independent samples t-tests for within- and between-group planned comparisons, respectively. Simple effects were used to probe cross-group interactions, which are reported using t-values. An alpha level of. 05 was used across all analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Bayesian analyses</title><p>In some cases, we were interested in whether the predicted pattern of transfer was absent in a group of interest. To assess this, we ran two Bayesian analyses to quantify evidence for the null hypothesis (transfer absent) over the alternative hypothesis (transfer occurred). Our procedures follow closely from those described by Gallistel and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallistel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kheifets et al., 2017</xref>) which we highly recommend for interested readers.</p><p>To illustrate our approach, we will describe the methodology used for Experiment 1. In the 8-to-4 group of this experiment, the short cue’s duration was shifted from 8 to 4 s. Rats were given several sessions to adapt to this cue’s new duration before we tested whether this manipulation would cause responding to the long cue to shift leftward.</p><p>As a control, we also ran a ‘no-change’ group that received identical conditions. However, the short cue’s duration was left at 8 s throughout. This allowed us to assess whether any variables other than shifting the short cue’s duration (e.g. over-exposure to the short cue) could produce an equivalent leftward shift to that seen in the 8-to-4 group.</p><p>To assess this, we first computed the marginal likelihood function for the percent change in peak times from training to testing in the no-change group, denoted as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>For each rat, we estimated the likelihood of obtaining the observed percent change in peak time if it had been drawn from a normal distribution with a mean <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and a standard deviation equivalent to that seen across rats in the 8-to-4 and no-change groups. Then, we took the log of each rat’s likelihood functions, summed across the corresponding values of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> for each subject, reverted back to a linear scale, and normalized the resulting vector by its sum, such that it integrated to 1. This gave a single, unimodal distribution that gives the estimate of the true posterior distribution from which the data were drawn.</p><p>Our null hypothesis was that this distribution had a mean of zero (i.e. no transfer occurred). Therefore, we developed a null prior by following the same procedure described above, yet linearly shifting the data to have mean of zero (i.e. subtracting each value by the sample mean). This distribution is denoted as:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> stands for the hypothesis that no shift occurred. The primary question was how much this null distribution overlapped with the group likelihood function, relative to an ‘alternative’ prior distribution, which was constructed based on the assumption that a shift in responding had indeed occurred during testing.</p><p>Our two analyses only differed with respect to how this alternative distribution was constructed. In our ‘non-specific shift’ analysis, we tested whether any change in peak time occurred, regardless of whether the shift went in the predicted direction (i.e. leftward) or not. Therefore, we used what is often referred to as an ‘incremental’ alternative prior, denoted as:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> stands for the hypothesis that a shift had occurred. In essence, this is a uniform distribution that was centered around the null prior, yet spread out on either side according to the largest shift seen in the 8-to-4 group and then convolved with the null distribution. Consequently, the distribution assigns a higher prior probability to values that, under the null prior, would be considered unlikely to occur. Therefore, a leftward or rightward peak time shift would cause the alternative distribution to have higher overlap with the group likelihood function, relative to the null prior.</p><p>To quantify the degree of evidence in favor of either hypothesis, we first computed a Bayesian posterior between each prior and the group likelihood function:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>This gives the marginal likelihood of each hypothesis, given the data (i.e. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>). The ratio of the areas for either distribution gives the odds in favor of one hypothesis over another. For simplicity, we computed this as:<disp-formula id="equ5"><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The higher the evidence in favor of the null hypothesis, the higher the Bayes factor.</p><p>While this approach is effective at detecting evidence for or against a peak time shift during testing, it does not answer our primary question when running the no-change group. Specifically, variables such as overexposure or extinction could very well produce some form of a slight shift during testing. In fact, some evidence does suggest that this could be the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roberts, 1981</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we wanted to test whether these variables would produce an equivalent leftward shift to that seen in the 8-to-4 group. This would falsify our prediction that decreasing the short cue’s duration would have anything to do with the a leftward shift in long cue responding seen in the 8-to-4 group.</p><p>Therefore, we ran another test that was tailored for this question. Specifically, we constructed an alternative prior using data from the peak-time shifts seen in the 8-to-4 group. The procedures were the same as those used to construct the no-change group likelihood function. If the shifts seen in the no-change group were indistinguishable from those seen in the 8-to-4 group, this alternative distribution should show high overlap with the no-change likelihood function. In contrast, if no (or a slight) change in peak times occurred, the null distribution (i.e. mean of zero) should overlap more closely with the actual data. All other procedures used to quantify the Bayes factor were equivalent to those described above.</p><p>The analyses in Experiments 3–4 followed these same methods, yet using data from their respective groups. With respect to heuristics, we refer to Bayes factors &gt; 3 as ‘substantial’ evidence in favor of the null hypothesis, those &gt;10 as ‘strong’, and those &gt;100 as ‘decisive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallistel, 2009</xref>). However, we should emphasize that Bayes factors should be interpreted with respect to the continua of evidence that they, in fact, reflect. We do not endorse the assignment of arbitrarily binned cut-offs for what is considered ‘real’ or not, which we feel is a common problem in typical null-hypothesis testing (i.e. p&lt;0.05).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>BJD - Alfred P.

Your article is being evaluated by Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers..</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present a series of experiments testing the hypothesis that expectations for the timing of expected rewards for different cues covary as if determined or at least influenced by an underlying common cause. In support of this proposal, they show that following a change in the timing of reward availability for one cue, behavior for another cue is often changed in the same direction, but to a lesser degree. They dissociate this effect from that predicted by a change in the average duration experienced during the task and show dependence of this effect on correlated changes in duration and context.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers were overall positive about the significance of the question and the potential impact of the findings, there were significant concerns expressed by several and reinforced on discussion regarding the importance of several control experiments that were not done. It was agreed that the addition of controls for both change and action would be ideal. The former was judged to be particularly important. If one or both of these can be done in a reasonable amount of time, the reviewers felt it would substantially increase support for the common cause hypothesis advanced by the authors. If either or both is not possible, there must be substantial changes to the paper (Abstract, Introduction, Discussion section) to acknowledge these shortcomings or possible caveats. Reviewer 1 also felt that a broader analysis of the behavioral change beyond simply characterizing effect on peak responding is also an essential revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript by de Corte et al., the authors report an elegant series of experiments testing the correlation between temporal expectations induced by different cues on a peak procedure task, when one of those cues undergoes a change in duration.</p><p>Overall, the authors nicely demonstrate the shift effect they predict under a 'common cause' hypothesis, in which a shift in temporal expectation induced by changing the trained interval of one cue transfers to the second, previously trained cue, for which the duration has never been changed. They disambiguate this effect from that predicted by a change in the average duration experienced during the task (before the test phase) and show how this duration transfer effect depends on correlated changes in duration for all (shifted) cues and is specific to the context in which the change in duration is experienced.</p><p>Some relatively minor amendments should improve the clarity of the manuscript, increase the transparency of the results, and provide a more complete picture of the changes in responding measured in their series of experiments.</p><p>My main concern is with the reporting of the change in responding largely in terms of a change in peak responding. While the parametric fit of a Gaussian to the average response curves certainly captures the change in responding as a change in the mean of the fit distribution, it seems in many of the experiments that this obscures some of the finer details of the change in response induced by the experimental manipulation. For instance, start and stop times change differently for some of the experiments, indicating there may be a change as well in the spread of the response curve in some cases? While the start/stop times are reported in the supplemental for most (?) of the experiments, I think some more attention needs to be diverted to this variability in the main Results section.</p><p>For instance, the mean+/-SEM of all fit parameters for at least the first two experiments would be very helpful for the reader in interpreting the nature of the change in responding on these tasks.</p><p>I also do not recall seeing reference to the start/stop times in the supplemental for the control experiment 2 – since this is a critical control, it seems important to highlight that there is no change in start/stop times as well as in the fit peak times.</p><p>There were also some interesting inconsistencies in the experiments that were not discussed but should be addressed. First – the% change in the correlated group of experiment 3 is significant, but much smaller than the other experiments. Is this to be expected under the common-cause hypothesis? Would not more evidence of a shift in durations in this context lead to greater rather than lesser transfer to this cue? The supp methods state there are N=5 per group here but the authors also suggest there are min N=10 elsewhere.</p><p>Finally, the discussion links the common-cause hypothesis to latent state inference in rats, but the authors do not cite some influential literature in this domain, especially Wilson et al., 2014 which pre-dates the two hidden state inference citations given. I think this part of the Discussion section would also benefit from linking to latent state inference in behavior more generally as a large body of literature exists in this domain with well-developed and generalizable computational and neural theories (for e.g. Daw, 2005; Doll, 2012).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Achievements:</p><p>The authors novelly and valuably present four different experiments robustly illustrating that following a change in the timing of reward availability for one cue, behavior for another cue is often changed in the same direction, but to a lesser degree. This is a thorough set of observations for which any theory of timing would have to account. Their findings provide a strong challenge to existing perspectives and are therefore significant for the field and worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Caveats, problems:</p><p>The authors should clarify that their results do not demonstrate animals learn or optimally use the causal structure of their environment within the time domain. The authors also do not have controls that show it is really the change in a specific cue-duration relationship that produces the observed effect (although it is very likely), nor can they attribute their findings to a general expectation of timing covariance instead of action-specific mechanisms which involve less representational richness (a more reasonable alternative).</p><p>Major rhetoric issues:</p><p>The Title and the Abstract both imply that the authors have shown that animals (1) explicitly represent the statistics relating timing of various sources of reward, (2) update a posterior distribution of expected cue-reward times following new evidence from other cues and (3) optimize their timing behavior accordingly. However, the authors do not construct any experiment in which a specific cross-cue timing relationship is knowable, they do not calculate the optimal policy based on such a relationship, and they do not demonstrate that animals follow such an optimal policy.

They then show that this inference is not behaviorally observable when the assumption of covariance is explicitly broken in the environment. They also show that this effect is context-dependent.</p><p>Overall, I like the study and find the authors' hypothesis quite intuitive and interesting. I find the statistics, data analysis, and treatment of prior literature to be satisfactory. The authors also do some obvious controls such as the no change and directionality controls. Nevertheless, there is an important additional control that is imperative before these conclusions can be drawn.</p><p>Major Comments</p><p>1) The key claim here is that rats are assigning durations to individual cues and inferring that when one cue-reward interval is changed, another is likely to change as well, due to a phylogenetically evolved assumption of covariance. For this to be shown, it is required to demonstrate that the change in the test intervals happens solely due to the change in the observed cue-reward interval change for the other cue. However, the results observed could be explained even if the animals ignore the causal structure.</p><p>For instance, an important control experiment for Figure 1A is this: Train Cue1-8 s and Cue2-16 s. For the Change phase, add Cue3-4 s instead of Cue1-4 s. Show that in this case, Test for Cue2 shows no change. If this experiment showed a change in the test for Cue2, then that means that the effect is not due to an inferred &quot;causal structure&quot; but instead because the relevant intervals to be produced generally decreased. Since this explanation could work for all experiments presented, a similar control needs to be done for each experiment to rule out an explanation of a general adaptation to change in timed intervals.</p><p>2) I find it interesting that in the only experiment in which the assumption of covariation was explicitly confirmed to the animals (Figure 4A), the% change in peak time seems to be lower in magnitude than the experiments in which there is no explicit information regarding whether the covariance assumption is valid (Figure 1). If the &quot;common cause&quot; hypothesis held, would one not expect that if the animals had explicit confirmation of a &quot;common cause&quot; like in Figure 4A, their behavior would show bigger changes, especially considering that this is argued to be an &quot;optimal&quot; inference?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38790.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] My main concern is with the reporting of the change in responding largely in terms of a change in peak responding. While the parametric fit of a Gaussian to the average response curves certainly captures the change in responding as a change in the mean of the fit distribution, it seems in many of the experiments that this obscures some of the finer details of the change in response induced by the experimental manipulation. For instance, start and stop times change differently for some of the experiments, indicating there may be a change as well in the spread of the response curve in some cases? While the start/stop times are reported in the supplemental for most (?) of the experiments, I think some more attention needs to be diverted to this variability in the main Results section.</p><p>For instance, the mean+/-SEM of all fit parameters for at least the first two experiments would be very helpful for the reader in interpreting the nature of the change in responding on these tasks.</p><p>I also do not recall seeing reference to the start/stop times in the supplemental for the control experiment 2 – since this is a critical control, it seems important to highlight that there is no change in start/stop times as well as in the fit peak times.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your suggestions to provide more detail on the behavioral results. We now provide the mean change +/- SEM for all reported timing indices across experiments. There were indeed changes in the spread of unchanged-cue responding. However, these effects were largely expected due to ‘scalar timing’, in which the spread of responding scales in direct proportion to the peak time (for discussion see Roberts, 1981; Buhusi and Meck, 2005). For example, if the peak time were to double (for any reason), the spread would also be expected to double, due to this timing property (see text for further description; Results section). To address this, we now report the coefficient of variation (CV = spread/peak time) data for all experiments. This is a common way to characterize spread changes, while accounting for scalar timing, in this task. Specifically, if spread changes were due to scalar timing, this normalized-spread value should remain constant, relative to training. This result was seen in virtually all experiments. There are a few minor CV effects in some cases, but these effects were neither systematic nor restricted to the critical cue.</p><p>Your note on differential effects on start/stop times is also important. Some manipulations can indeed selectively impact start or stop times (e.g., dopamine manipulations often affect start times but not stop times; see Balci, 2014). These results can have substantial theoretical relevance from a decision-making standpoint, so we have brought more attention to them in the main Results section for all experiments as well. As we noted in the results of Experiment 1, our single-trial data were limited and noisy due to extinction. Nonetheless, the overall pattern of start/stop time changes across experiments does not suggest a preferential effect of the transfer on either measure.</p><p>Finally, the bar graph detailing start/stop time changes in the control group of Experiment 1 was mistakenly added to Figure 1—figure supplement 2 of the initial version (see top left corner). This figure was supposed to present data from groups not included in Experiment 1. These data are now correctly included in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, and thank you for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There were also some interesting inconsistencies in the experiments that were not discussed but should be addressed. First – the% change in the correlated group of experiment 3 is significant, but much smaller than the other experiments. Is this to be expected under the common-cause hypothesis? Would not more evidence of a shift in durations in this context lead to greater rather than lesser transfer to this cue?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, while the transfer was consistent with our hypothesis, we also felt that the magnitude of the transfer was surprisingly small in the correlated group. We expected it to exceed or, at the very least, match the 16-to-32 group of Experiment 1. However, as we describe in the revised manuscript, we believe within-modality categorization influenced our results in this case. Specifically, in the correlated group of Experiment 3 (now Experiment 4a), the changed cues (short and long) were both auditory stimuli and the unchanged cue (medium) was a visual stimulus. We suspected that this could have caused rats to begin categorizing the changed cues as belonging to the auditory modality alone, thereby weakening the transfer to the critical (visual) cue. The other experiments in the initial manuscript only presented one cue from each modality, which would have prevented modality-specific categorization.</p><p>To assess this, we ran a follow up study in which the short and long (i.e., changed) cues were visual and auditory, respectively, preventing modality categorization. As predicted, transfer to the medium cue (auditory in this case) was nearly equivalent to that seen in Experiment 1. We have added this follow up as Experiment 4b and the initial experiment is now listed as Experiment 4a.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The supp methods state there are N=5 per group here but the authors also suggest there are min N=10 elsewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this in the main results (figure captions) and Materials and methods sections for each experiment. Specifically, all experiments had a minimum of 10 rats, yet some included sub-groups with minimum <italic>ns</italic> of 5 (this is also now stated more clearly in the Supplemental Methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the discussion links the common-cause hypothesis to latent state inference in rats, but the authors do not cite some influential literature in this domain, especially Wilson et al., 2014 which pre-dates the two hidden state inference citations given. I think this part of the Discussion section would also benefit from linking to latent state inference in behavior more generally as a large body of literature exists in this domain with well-developed and generalizable computational and neural theories (for e.g. Daw, 2005; Doll, 2012).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for recommending this literature, which is now cited/discussed in-text. We have revised the subsection ‘Causal inference in rats?’ to frame the results in terms of model-free and model-based mechanisms (subsection is now titled ‘Model free vs. model-based mechanisms’). We enjoyed conceptualizing the data in this context as it provides a broader perspective for our results. It also helped us clarify the current boundaries of the common cause hypothesis, as detailed further in response to reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Caveats, problems:</p><p>The authors should clarify that their results do not demonstrate animals learn or optimally use the causal structure of their environment within the time domain. The authors also do not have controls that show it is really the change in a specific cue-duration relationship that produces the observed effect (although it is very likely), nor can they attribute their findings to a general expectation of timing covariance instead of action-specific mechanisms which involve less representational richness (a more reasonable alternative).</p><p>Major rhetoric issues:</p><p>The Title and the Abstract both imply that the authors have shown that animals (1) explicitly represent the statistics relating timing of various sources of reward, (2) update a posterior distribution of expected cue-reward times following new evidence from other cues and (3) optimize their timing behavior accordingly. However, the authors do not construct any experiment in which a specific cross-cue timing relationship is knowable, they do not calculate the optimal policy based on such a relationship, and they do not demonstrate that animals follow such an optimal policy. The Title and Abstract should be changed to prevent this misleading interpretation. Maybe &quot;Interval timing shifts suggests animals infer timing correlations&quot; would be a better title. The main text does not similarly mislead.</p></disp-quote><p>These are certainly fair points. In hindsight, the initial title and some of the text were certainly overly ambitious. We have made the following revisions to address these concerns. First, as noted above, we have toned down the title as follows:</p><p>Recalibrating timing behavior via expected covariance between temporal cues.</p><p>This removes the ‘optimality’ reference and our use of the term ‘timing behavior’ is intended to avert the implication that temporal expectations, per se, are being changed across phases (over other mechanisms such as reinforcement-based effects you mention, see below).</p><p>Second, we removed optimality/inference references in the Abstract and main text.</p><p>Third, we have added a paragraph to the main Discussion section emphasizing that evaluating the (potential) optimality of the transfer is a critical future direction as follows (subsection “Future directions and beyond timing”):</p><p>“Finally, an important question is whether the transfer follows an optimal policy. As noted above, the common cause hypothesis can primarily predict whether transfer will occur and in what direction. However, we also propose that the transfer serves an adaptive function. If this were the case, one would expect that the degree of transfer would follow a systematic optimization principle, based on the expected covariance between the cues. To address this, we recommend explicitly training the animals on what degree of temporal covariance to expect between cues by including phases in which all cues are reinforced at new times and the degree of the shifts follows a programmed covariance relationship. If only a single cue were shifted during a final change phase, one could evaluate whether responses to the remaining cue(s) follow the experimentally chosen covariance policy.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternative to 'common cause' hypothesis 1, and possible control experiment (maybe not necessary):</p><p>Animals' timing behavior could be sensitive to the external reward-time structure generally. To control for this possibility, the authors could train sessions that only present a novel cue with a 32s duration in place of sessions that change the 16s duration to 32s for a familiar cue in Experiment 1 and observe the effect on timing following the 8s cue as before. However, the breadth of observations across experiments make the interpretation that the general change in reward timing landscape accounts for all the observed effects, although they make account for some of the effects, less likely.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree fully and, as mentioned in our revision plan, had the same concern. We do believe that some of our initial results, particularly from Experiments 1-2, were sufficient to weaken this explanation (described in the introduction to Experiment 3). Experiments 4a and 4b (correlated vs. uncorrelated groups) also pose a problem, as the reward structure was altered in the uncorrelated groups in a comparable way to Experiment 1 and no reliable shift was seen in either case (not explicitly addressed in-text, for brevity). However, we agree that a more direct test was needed. Therefore, we have added the following results as Experiment 3 in the manuscript. The design is similar to the one you recommend. We initially trained two groups to associate distinct cues with either an 8- or 16-second delay to reward. Once trained, we introduced a second phase, in which the 16-second cue was not presented, but a novel cue was introduced. In the ‘no-change group’, the novel cue was associated with a 4-second duration, and the initial 8-second cue was presented, with its duration unchanged. Conversely, in the ‘change group’, the 8-second cue’s duration was shifted to 4-seconds, and the novel cue’s duration was set at 8-seconds. Thus, both groups had the same reward structure (cues, durations, etc.). However, only the change-group experienced a cue-duration change. Therefore, any group differences in transfer to the 16-second cue at test would have to be caused by a specific cue-duration change.</p><p>As predicted, the transfer to the 16-second cue was more than 3 times larger in the change group than the no-change group, confirming that cue-duration changes strongly regulate the effect. Admittedly, there was some evidence of transfer, albeit more mild, in the no-change group (although only significant for stop times). Thus, while there may be some contributions from overall changes in reward delays, the results indicate that specific cue-duration changes far exceed the reward-structure effects, which was the critical question in this case.</p><p>Finally, although it was not explicitly requested, we had hoped to have the reverse version of this change-control experiment (i.e., shifting to a longer duration, rather than a shorter one) completed by the time of resubmitting as well. Unfortunately, a variety of errors/equipment problems (e.g., feeder jams, power outages) occurred during the process that resulted in disrupted behavior and made the experiment invalid. We would certainly be willing to rerun and add these data if the review group feels they are critical, but doing so would further delay resubmission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternative to 'common cause' hypothesis 2, and possible control experiment (greatly improve interpretation):</p><p>The 'common cause' hypothesis proposes that animals make inferences based on expected positive correlations in timing.

This ties in well with the model-free vs. model-based discussion suggested by reviewer 1, so we have incorporated your critique as follows (subsection “Model-free vs. Model-based mechanisms?”):</p><p>“Particularly important consideration is how simple extinction and reinforcement mechanisms could produce the transfer.</p><p>Specifically, in our tasks, changing a cue’s duration entailed extinguishing responses emitted at the old reinforced time and reinforcing responses emitted at the new time. If these response-level extinction and reinforcement processes carried over to unchanged cue trials, responding would shift in the direction of the changed cue’s new duration. To assess this, we recommend using a design in which each cue is associated with a different action-outcome contingency (e.g., Cue 1: 8 seconds/nosepoke; Cue 2: 16 seconds/lever press). During the change phase, model-free processes would operate on different actions. Therefore, under this account, one would not expect the transfer to occur.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Major Comments</p><p>1) The key claim here is that rats are assigning durations to individual cues and inferring that when one cue-reward interval is changed, another is likely to change as well, due to a phylogenetically evolved assumption of covariance.

We believe the results of Experiment 4b help to address this caveat (see responses and main text). Those results show shifts that are roughly the same magnitude as seen in Experiment 1. We can only speculate as to why the transfer was not magnified, relative to Experiment 1. The obvious possibility is that rats weigh expected covariance equally to confirmed covariance. A related possibility is that there is a ceiling effect on the transfer. Our suspicion is that the transfer reflects a weighted average of the unchanged cue’s initial duration and what its duration would be if it had shifted by the same factor as that observed for the changed cue(s). They may simply adjust the weight given to the initial duration to ensure that their estimate does not deviate too far from this initial value. Unfortunately, we don’t have data necessary to address this issue (see notes on optimality below). Nevertheless, we don’t feel that this is absolutely critical to address before moving forward with the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
