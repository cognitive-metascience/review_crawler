pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28672.001</object-id><p>Oriented cell division is one mechanism progenitor cells use during development and to maintain tissue homeostasis. Common to most cell types is the asymmetric establishment and regulation of cortical NuMA-dynein complexes that position the mitotic spindle. Here, we discover that HMMR acts at centrosomes in a PLK1-dependent pathway that locates active Ran and modulates the cortical localization of NuMA-dynein complexes to correct mispositioned spindles. This pathway was discovered through the creation and analysis of <italic>Hmmr</italic>-knockout mice, which suffer neonatal lethality with defective neural development and pleiotropic phenotypes in multiple tissues. HMMR over-expression in immortalized cancer cells induces phenotypes consistent with an increase in active Ran including defects in spindle orientation. These data identify an essential role for HMMR in the PLK1-dependent regulatory pathway that orients progenitor cell division and supports neural development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28672.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As an embryo develops, its cells divide, grow and change into many different types of cells that eventually build our body. When cells divide, they first need to duplicate their genetic material. A structure called the spindle then distributes the two copies of the genetic information between the new cells. Cells must position their spindle precisely, and the way the spindle is oriented helps to determine what type of cell will develop. If the spindle fails to align properly, it can disrupt the development of specific tissues and organs and even lead to diseases such as cancer.</p><p>Numerous proteins help to position the spindle. For example, a protein called Ran-GTP ensures that motor proteins are anchored on opposite sides of the dividing cell, which tug on the spindle and position it between them. If the spindle gets pulled too closely to one side, a protein called PLK1 changes parts of the motor proteins to reduce the pulling force and to reposition the spindle towards the center.</p><p>Previous research has shown that non-motor proteins, such as a protein called HMMR are also part of the motor-protein complex. However, until now it was not known how HMMR was involved in repositioning the spindle during this process.</p><p>Now, Connell et al. have used mice that lacked HMMR to find out if it helps the cells in the brain to develop. The results show that without HMMR, very few mice were able to survive and many suffered from deformed and underdeveloped brains. In these mice, the orientation of the spindle changed and fewer cells of the correct type could be formed. Connell et al. then analyzed different types of cells grown in the laboratory to better understand how HMMR controls the position of the spindle. In all cases, HMMR formed a complex with Ran-GTP and was needed for the cells to orient their spindle correctly. When HMMR was absent, PLK1 could not work properly, and the spindle was positioned incorrectly.</p><p>This suggests that HMMR is essential for the spindle to align properly and is needed to help brain cells develop and become specialized. The next step will be to understand how HMMR, Ran and PLK1 work together during cell division. Studying mice that survive without HMMR offer an opportunity to examine how poorly aligned spindles affect their development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>asymmetric cell division</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>spindle orientation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Michael Cuccione Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Connell</surname><given-names>Marisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name><name><surname>Maxwell</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name><name><surname>Lange</surname><given-names>Philipp F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000147</institution-id><institution>Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BC Children's Hospital Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Zhengcheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Lange</surname><given-names>Philipp F</given-names></name><name><surname>Maxwell</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lange</surname><given-names>Philipp F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000245</institution-id><institution>Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lange</surname><given-names>Philipp F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OBC 134038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maxwell</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HMMR regulates spindle positioning in neural and other cell types downstream of PLK1 and subsequently affects cortical NuMA-Dynein localization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development and homeostasis of the brain require that neural stem cells, termed neuroepithelial progenitors (NPs), balance expansion with differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gönczy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knoblich, 2008</xref>). During neurogenesis, NPs primarily undergo divisions that produce the various types of cells required for proper brain development. During these divisions, the orientation of the axis of division and mitotic spindle position determines the placement of the progeny cells within the tissue and, as a consequence, imbalances in the spindle positioning pathway can lead to defects in brain morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Mitotic spindle position is controlled by forces applied on astral microtubules by dynein molecular motor complexes, which are anchored at the cell cortex by complexes of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA)- G-protein signaling modulator 2 (GPSM2, aka LGN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Konno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peyre et al., 2011</xref>). In mammalian cultured cells, a gradient of Ran-GTP at chromosomes excludes LGN-NuMA complexes from lateral regions of the cell cortex to establish cortical asymmetry of these complexes and to position the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>). The activity of dynein complexes anchored at polar regions of the cortex are regulated by the proximity of the spindle pole and its associated polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>) and complexes of dynein light chain 1 (DYNLL1)- hyaluronan mediated motility receptor (HMMR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunsch et al., 2012</xref>). If one pole moves too close to the cortex, the centrosomal components of this pathway strip dynein from the cortex to reduce pulling forces and reposition the mitotic spindle. PLK1 activity, for example, stabilizes astral microtubules that are needed to strip dynein-dynactin complexes from the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). HMMR is not proposed to be part of the NuMA-PLK1 spindle positioning pathway but rather to regulate cortical dynein through a complex containing CHICA (aka FAM83D) and DYNLL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunsch et al., 2012</xref>). However, HMMR and PLK1 activity are known to be interconnected during mitosis: during spindle assembly, PLK1 activity as measured by a kinetochore-localized, FRET-reporter construct is reduced following treatment of cells with siRNA targeting HMMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>) and HMMR-threonine 703 is a putative substrate for PLK1 identified through mitotic phosphoproteome analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nousiainen et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>During cell division, HMMR acts downstream from Ran-GTP to localize targeting protein for XKLP2 (TPX2) and promote spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Groen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joukov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scrofani et al., 2015</xref>). This action is reliant upon a carboxy-terminal basic leucine zipper (bZip) motif in HMMR, which targets it to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maxwell et al., 2003</xref>), and enables the activation of Aurora A by TPX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scrofani et al., 2015</xref>). Aurora A can directly phosphorylate PLK1 on Thr210 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macůrek et al., 2008</xref>), which suggests that HMMR may impact the PLK1-dependent positioning pathway. Consistent with a potential role establishing the planar cell division exhibited in neural progenitors, HMMR has been shown to regulate apicobasal polarity in mammary epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maxwell et al., 2011</xref>), while expression of a truncated <italic>Hmmr</italic> (1–317 of 794 aa, termed <italic>Hmmr <sup>m/m</sup></italic>) impairs planar cell division in ovarian follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2015</xref>), and germ cells in the testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>HMMR is expressed in the developing nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casini et al., 2010</xref>) and proliferative regions of the adult mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lindwall et al., 2013</xref>), Recently, HMMR has been shown to be required for anterior neural tube closure and morphogenesis in <italic>Xenopus,</italic> where HMMR reduction leads to the absences of ventricular lamina and increased intraocular distance, olfactory bulb size, and forebrain width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prager et al., 2017</xref>).

We find that HMMR is needed for neonatal survival and proper brain development.

That is, spindle pole-localized HMMR may create a local increase of DYNLL1 at the spindle/spindle poles that binds to dynein in competition with dynactin and displaces dynein from the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunsch et al., 2012</xref>); however, Dyn2 (yeast DYNLL1 ortholog) promotes, rather than impedes, the incorporation of dynactin into the dynein motor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2011</xref>). So, we examined whether the loss of HMMR altered the composition of the dynein motor complex.

Moreover, a corresponding reduction in p150<sup>glued</sup> co-precipitated with DHC-GFP was also observed in HMMR-silenced lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We also noted that both FLAG-DYNLL1 and CHICA were retained at spindle poles, although absent from spindle fibers, in HMMR-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). Therefore, HMMR appears dispensable for the spindle pole localization of CHICA and DYNLL1 and HMMR promotes, rather than restricts, the incorporation of p150<sup>glued</sup> into DHC complexes. As our data do not support the proposed PLK1-independent role for HMMR in spindle positioning, we investigated a putative role for HMMR in the PLK1-dependent positioning pathway.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28672.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>HMMR enables the PLK1-dependent spindle pole positioning pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of mitotic HeLa extracts stably expressing DHC-GFP treated with scrambled (siScr) siRNA or siRNA targeting HMMR (siHMMR) subjected to immunoprecipitation with GFP antibody or control IgG and blotted with the indicated antibodies, including GFP (GFP-DHC), dynein intermediate chain (DIC), p150<sup>glued</sup>, DYNLL1, HMMR or Actin (four replicates).

As PLK1 activity is reduced at kinetochores in HMMR-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), we measured the levels of phosphorylated-PLK1, the active form of the kinase, by immunofluorescence in HMMR-silenced and control-treated mitotic cells.

As these data suggest HMMR enables PLK1-dependent processes, we tested if the concurrent inhibition of HMMR and PLK1 significantly altered the spindle positioning pathway when compared to the inhibition of either alone.

In mitotic cells treated with BI2536, the localization of NuMA mirrored that observed in HMMR-silenced cells and was not additively altered in dual inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>) consistent with a requirement for PLK1 and HMMR in a shared positioning pathway. Thus, our data supports the conclusion that astral microtubule density is dampened in HMMR-silenced mitotic cells in a PLK1-dependent manner, which disturbs the spindle pole-localized positioning pathway and results in spindle rotation due to the retention of NuMA-DHC complexes at the proximal cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>HMMR interacts with RanBP2 and regulates the centrosome localization of Ran</title><p>As PLK1 phosphorylates HMMR at threonine 703 (pHMMR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nousiainen et al., 2006</xref>), we used mass spectrometry to identify proteins that are co-precipitated with antibodies targeting pHMMR as a means to discover putative pathways through which centrosome-localized HMMR may regulate spindle position.

To test this postulate, we first measured the levels of Ran-GTP in scrambled siRNA-treated or HMMR-silenced HeLa cell lysates with a commercially available assay that pulls-down the active form of Ran (Ran-GTP). In control experiments, scrambled siRNA-treated HeLa cell lysates were treated with either non-hydrolysable GTP (GTPγS) or with GDP to switch all Ran to Ran-GTP or Ran-GDP, respectively, prior to immunoprecipitation. As expected, the level of co-precipitated Ran was significantly augmented in cell lysates treated with GTPγS and lost in cell lysates treated with GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Having verified our control conditions, we then compared the levels of Ran-GTP in control-treated and HMMR-silenced cell lysates. In HMMR-silenced cell lysates, the level of Ran-GTP precipitated was slightly reduced relative to scrambled control-treated cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). When we confirmed the knockdown efficacy of HMMR in these experiments, we noted that HMMR was also co-precipitated when lysates were pretreated with GTPγS suggesting HMMR may interact specifically with Ran-GTP, which is greatly increased by GTPγS treatment. To titrate a putative HMMR-Ran-GTP interaction, we precipitated HMMR from mitotic cell lysates previously treated with increasing amounts of GTPγS. While the levels of precipitated HMMR remained constant, we found that the level of Ran co-precipitated with HMMR was increased in a GTPγS dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, HMMR interacts with Ran-GTPγS in cell lysates. We predicted that HMMR may affect the localization of active Ran in mitotic cells. To test this, we expressed constitutively active Ran (Ran Q69L, Ran<sup>CA</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kazgan et al., 2010</xref>) in HeLa cells treated with scrambled siRNA or siRNA targeting HMMR. In scrambled siRNA-treated cells, a fraction of Ran<sup>CA</sup> colocalized with the spindle pole demarked by γ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), consistent with the identification of Ran in the centrosome proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2003</xref>). However, the fraction of Ran<sup>CA</sup> that colocalized with γ-tubulin, as measured by the ratio of intensities for Ran<sup>CA</sup> and γ-tubulin, was significantly reduced in HMMR-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). Similarly, inhibition of PLK1 activity, through treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor BI2536, also reduced the fraction of Ran<sup>CA</sup> that colocalized with γ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–H</xref>). This data shows that reducing PLK1 activity or silencing HMMR reduces the localization of constitutively active Ran at mitotic centrosomes and suggests the phosphorylation of HMMR (pHMMR) by PLK1 may promote pHMMR-RanBP2-Ran-GTP complexes at spindle poles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>HMMR localizes Ran and positions metaphase spindles in neural cells and tissues</title><p>To investigate the HMMR-Ran pathway in neural cells and tissues, we first utilized the neuroblastoma cell line, SHSY5Y, which is known to polarize NuMA during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Izumi and Kaneko, 2012</xref>).

In <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic>mice, however, the predominant phenotype observed was microcephaly, which may be explained by a decreased mitotic rate for Pax6<sup>+</sup> radial glial cells; consistent with the recent observations in <italic>Hmmr<sup>m/m</sup></italic> brains, we did observe rare <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> brains at E14.5 with cortex enlargement.</p><p>The different neural phenotypes between <italic>Hmmr<sup>m/m</sup></italic> and <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> mice imply the expression of truncated N-terminal <italic>Hmmr</italic> protein retains critical functions needed for neural development and neonatal survival. In support of this, the microtubule-binding domain of HMMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maxwell et al., 2003</xref>) has recently been shown to be important for neural development in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prager et al., 2017</xref>). Microinjection of morpholinos targeting <italic>Hmmr</italic> in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos resulted in gross alterations in forebrain morphogenesis and anterior neural tube closure and these defects were rescued by the expression a truncated <italic>HMMR</italic> construct that preserved the microtubule-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prager et al., 2017</xref>). These defects were attributed to the loss of a non-mitotic role for HMMR in the promotion of neural cell polarization and radial intercalation concomitant with neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prager et al., 2017</xref>). While we observed no changes in cell morphology in <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> MEFs and no defects in the localization of Par3 or ZO-1 in <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> NSCs lining the ventricles, future studies should investigate the disruption of Hmmr function in non-mitotic <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> tissues and cells, such as during directed cell migration needed for corticogenesis and neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marín and Rubenstein, 2003</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayala et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Directed smooth muscle cell migration following balloon catheter injury in rats is reliant upon HMMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silverman-Gavrila et al., 2011</xref>), and HMMR is expressed in cells within the SVZ and rostral migratory stream in the adult mouse brain, where neural progenitor cells persist throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lindwall et al., 2013</xref>). While a detailed investigation of non-mitotic processes are needed in <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> mice, we focused on mitotic processes due to our analysis of <italic>Hmmr</italic> promoter activity and HMMR expression during the directed neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC). When we derived neural rosette-like structures from a mouse mouse <italic>Hmmr<sup>BB0166/+</sup></italic> ESC line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>), in which β-geo is inserted following <italic>Hmmr</italic> exon 7 on one allele, or from WT ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>), we found <italic>Hmmr</italic>/HMMR expression was restricted to apical-positioned, cyclin B1-positive rosette-neural stem cells (r-NSCs); moreover, spindle position was disturbed in apical-positioned r-NSCs derived from <italic>Hmmr<sup>BB0166/+</sup></italic> mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>). Thus, <italic>Hmmr</italic> shows cell cycle-restricted expression in G2 phase and mitotic cells during the process of neural differentiation, and our data are consistent with the defects we observed in <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> mice being attributed to alterations in neural progenitor expansion and differentiation as determined by changes to the control of spindle orientation and cell division.</p><p><italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> mice exhibited the following phenotypes that are known to arise from defects in spindle orientation and planar cell division: microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gai et al., 2016</xref>), enlarged ventricles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dietrich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Godin et al., 2010</xref>), and testicular atrophy and fertility defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, in HeLa cells, HMMR is critical to spindle positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunsch et al., 2012</xref>). However, other mitotic or post-mitotic processes may also be disturbed in <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> mice independent of spindle orientation, such as an increased rate of apoptosis, centrosome amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marthiens et al., 2013</xref>), and decreased division rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caviness et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caviness et al., 1995</xref>). In our study, we focused our efforts on addressing many of these additional factors and specifically those related to cell division. TUNEL analysis revealed no increase in apoptosis in <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> mice at both embryonic and neonate stage. An elevated occurrence of supernumerary centrosomes, as induced for example through overexpression of PLK4, results in embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vitre et al., 2015</xref>). Our analysis revealed no evidence of multipolar spindles or centrosome amplification in neural tissues, but we did note an increased frequency of centrosome amplification in <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> MEFs. In addition, <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> MEFs require more time to complete the spindle assembly checkpoint when followed through cell division independent of spindle orientation (Unpublished results). However, whether such delays in cell division kinetics are present in <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> mice, or if an associated reduced rate of cell division contributed to the observed neural defects remain unknown. A loss of control of the cell division axis, however, has been consistently observed in HMMR-silenced HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunsch et al., 2012</xref>) and, as described here, in r-NSCs derived from <italic>Hmmr<sup>BB1066/+</sup></italic> mESCs, <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> MEFs, and neural progenitor cells lining the SVZ in brains isolated from <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>The intrinsic spindle positioning pathway regulates components of the dynein motor complex on the cortex to generate forces that center spindles. It is well recognized that the PLK1 gradient at both centrosomes and kinetochores is essential in regulating the spindle positioning pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tame et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we find HMMR is a critical component of a PLK1-dependent positioning pathway, which contrasts with the findings of a prior report that predicts HMMR-CHICA-DYNLL1 play a PLK1-independent role that regulates the composition of cortical dynein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunsch et al., 2012</xref>). While DYNLL1 and CHICA were identified in our mass spectrometry analysis of pHMMR immunoprecipitates and we found that the incorporation of DYNLL1 into DHC-GFP complexes was dampened in HMMR-silenced cell lysates, our data are consistent with HMMR-DYNLL1 enabling the incorporation of p150-glued into DHC-GFP complexes. This role is similar to that reported for Dyn2 (yeast DYNLL1 ortholog) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2011</xref>) but contrary to the prediction that DYNLL1-bound form of dynein cannot bind to dynein adaptors required for cortical targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunsch et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>HMMR acts downstream from Ran-GTP to localize TPX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Groen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joukov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scrofani et al., 2015</xref>), which relies upon a carboxy-terminal bZip motif in HMMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maxwell et al., 2003</xref>) and enables the activation of Aurora A by TPX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scrofani et al., 2015</xref>). As Aurora A can directly phosphorylate PLK1 on Thr210 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macůrek et al., 2008</xref>), our observed reduction in pPLK1(T210) in HMMR-silenced cells can be mechanistically explained through reduced Aurora A activity. Consistent with reduced PLK1 activity in HMMR-silenced cells, we find that astral microtubules are reduced and cortical NuMA is retained, which is phenocopied and not additively augmented by PLK1 inhibition. Indeed, the growth rate of EB1-marked microtubule comets was previously shown to be dampened in HMMR-silenced cells although the conclusion of these experiments was that astral microtubule organization was similar to control-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunsch et al., 2012</xref>). We note that the density of astral microtubules is reduced in HMMR-silenced cells, which provides an alternative mechanistic explanation for the retention of cortical DHC-GFP in HMMR-silenced cells with off-center spindles.</p><p>Ran is a component of the centrosome proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2003</xref>), although FRET-based assessment of Ran activity has not been seen at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaláb et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we find evidence for the location of Ran-GTP at mitotic centrosomes reliant upon PLK1 activity and HMMR. Mass spectrometry analysis discovered RanBP2 as a novel interactor with pHMMR and we show that HMMR precipitates Ran-GTPγS in a dosage-dependent manner and is needed to locate active Ran at mitotic centrosomes. Moreover, in HeLa cells induced to express GFP-HMMR we also observe ectopic localization of Ran to mitotic spindles and the loss of cortical NuMA localization similar to those induced by expression of Ran<sup>CA</sup>. However, HMMR appears dispensable for the Ran-GTP gradient generated at chromosomes, which strips NuMA and DHC-GFP at the midzone cortical region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>). Therefore, our data supports a spatially restricted role for pHMMR in the localization of Ran-GTP at centrosomes and spindle fibers downstream of PLK1 activity. However, the relative contribution in the control of spindle positon for pHMMR function with Ran at centrosomes versus the role HMMR plays in promoting pPLK1(T210), potentially through modulation of Aurora A activity, warrants further study.</p><p>Taken together, the results of our study identify HMMR as a key component of the PLK1-dependent mitotic spindle positioning pathway that is needed for neural development and neonatal survival. We suggest that the loss of spindle positioning identified here, and by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunsch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2016</xref>;

Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 X <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C and protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher). For immunoprecipitation, lysates were precleared with protein G or A/G PLUS-Agarose beads (Santa Cruz). Protein complexes were isolated by incubation with the indicated antibodies at 4°C on rotation, and then with protein G or A/G PLUS-Agarose beads for 6 hr at 4°C on rotation.

Sodium cyanoborohydride was added to a final concentration of 20 mM immediately after to both samples and incubated at 21°C for 60 min. Both conditions were combined, acidified to pH 2.5 with TFA, and the peptides purified with C18-STAGE tips as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rappsilber et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed with the Easy nLC ultra-high-pressure LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) couple to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer with an EASY-Spray source. An EASY-Spray C18 column (Thermo-Fisher, 50 cm long, 75 µm inner diameter) heated to a temperature of 50°C was used for separation. Dried Stage-tip eluates were resuspended in 10 µL buffer A (0.1% FA) and 2 µL was used for injection. The peptides were loaded at a back pressure of 550 bar and separated with a gradient of 3–25% buffer B (0.1% FA in 80% ACN) over 105 min followed by 25–40% buffer B over 20 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The chromatography method ends with a ramp from 40 to 100% buffer B over 3 min then a hold at 100% buffer B for 12 min. A column equilibration step using 11 µL buffer A was included prior to the next sample loading step.</p><p>MS data were acquired using a data-dependent top 12 method with a dynamic exclusion of 20 s. MS1 was performed at a resolution of 60,000 at m/z 200 with an AGC target of 3E6 and a maximum ion injection time of 75 ms over the m/z range 400 to 1800. HCD fragmentation of peptides was performed with an isolation range of 1.4 m/z and normalized collision energy set to 28. A resolution of 15,000 at m/z 200, an AGC target of 5E4 and a maximum ion injection time of 50 ms was set for fragment spectra acquisition.</p><p>Acquired spectra from two separate experiments and multiple injections were searched using Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Database search was performed against the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> reference proteome including isoforms downloaded from UniProt in June 2016. Main search parameters: enzyme: Trypsin (full); missed cleavages: 2; precursor mass tolerance: 10 ppm; fragment mass tolerance: 0.02 Da; static modifications: +57.021 Da on C; variable modifications: +15.995 Da on M, +28.031 or +34.063 on K and peptide N terminus, +42.011 Da on protein N terminus. Identifications were filtered for 1% FDR at the peptide and protein level. Differential abundance of proteins between pHMMR and control IP was calculated based on the area of heavy and light dimethyl precursor peaks. Common contaminants and decoy identifications were filtered out. To identify proteins commonly identified in affinity purification experiments the identified proteins were searched against the CRAPOME database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crapome.org">www.crapome.org</ext-link>, version 1.1, H. sapiens). Proteins that were found in less than 30% of reported experiments were classified as ‘rare’, the reminder as ‘common’. Proteins not matched in the CRAPOME database were classified as ‘unknown’.

In rosettes, spindle orientation was measured as the angle of the cleavage plane (anaphase or telophase cells) relative to the apical surface. For analysis of the division orientation of apical NP cells, E14.5 brain sections were stained for pH3 and γ-Tubulin. The long spindle axis of anaphase cells, defined by a line bisecting the two centrosomes, was used to indicate the cell division plane. For each progenitor, the angle between the long spindle axis and the apical surface (defined by a line along the centrosomes of apically localized interphase cells) was determined. In cultured MEFs, spindle orientation was measured between the long axis of G2 phase cells (15 mins prior to mitosis) and the angle of the mitotic spindle (anaphase cells).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>All replicates were biological replicates.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Iain M Cheeseman (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, the authors investigate the role of the HMMR protein in mitotic spindle positioning and orientation. The authors use multiple systems (mutant mouse, ES derived rosettes, fibroblasts derived from mutant mice, HeLa cells, neuroblastoma cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic>) to demonstrate the function of HMMR in spindle orientation. Although the role of HMMR in spindle orientation is not new, the authors have identified mechanism by which HMMR controls spindle positioning in cells. They find that reducing or eliminating HMMR perturbs spindle positioning and alters the cortical localization of both dynein and NuMA. They provide evidence that this occurs by HMMR associating with Ran to alter this signaling pathway.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers are in agreement that this paper is interesting, but feel that there are several things that are necessary to improve the paper to the point where it would be acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The primary suggestions relate to strengthening the mechanistic aspects of the work.</p><p>1) Your paper suggests an important role for spindle pole-localized HMMR in signaling to the cell cortex to promote proper spindle positioning and regulating DHC and NuMA localization. Prior work has suggested that Plk1 also acts as a spindle-localized signal to control spindle position. Does this suggest that HMMR impacts Plk1 activity as well? It would be very useful to consider the relationship between these two pathways and compare the effects from individually or simultaneously targeting these pathways:</p><p>• It is important test whether HMMR affects Plk1 signaling. The reviewers recommend that you combine Plk1 inhibition or cortically tethering with HMMR perturbations for the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and 6.</p><p>• The authors show that HMMR centrosome localization domain is important for its function in spindle orientation. This is a nice part of the study, and the authors use many different techniques to decipher this mechanism. However, as they admit in the Discussion, the relative importance of HMMR-Ran-centrosomal pathway with respect to others involving Plk1 and DYNLL1 is not determined; making less clear what is the relevance of these results. The authors may want to dissect whether Ran centrosome localization alone is important for spindle orientation by modulating centrosomal Ran levels independently of HMMR and by altering DYNLL1 and PlK1 expression and activity in the HMMR overexpression experiments.</p><p>2) It would be helpful to more carefully evaluate the role of Ran in this process using Ran mutants (constitutively active or dominant negative). For example, does a Ran constitutively active mutant phenocopy HMMR overexpression? Alternatively, does Ran inhibition suppress the effects of HMMR overexpression? For the work on Ran, it would provide a useful addition if you could provide data to clarify the interaction and nature of the relationship between HMMR and Ran (direct interaction, through RanBP1, does this affect Ran activity, etc.):</p><p>• siHMMR cells still deplete NuMA from the lateral cortex, suggesting this chromosomal Ran effect is functional. The authors might consider including additional siRNA conditions, such as against Rcc1 alone or in combination with HMMR, to compare HMMR to loss of activated Ran. A discussion of how HMMR discriminates potential subcellular pools of Ran as well as how it may or may not interfere with the Plk1-Dynein regulatory loop would be beneficial.</p><p>• To further establish the link between the HMMR-Ran centrosomal pathway described in vitro and in vivo observations (and to confirm that the HMMR-centrosomal Ran pathway controls spindle orientation to regulate neurogenesis), the authors should show localization of Ran to centrosomes in vivo (the fact that they study this in neuroblastoma cells is not sufficient).</p><p>• It is also important to consider alternative explanations for the observed phenotypes beyond altered Ran signaling.</p><p>- HMMR loss is shown to amplify centrosome number in MEFs (although a discussion of how this might occur is not presented). Have the authors considered that this centrosome amplification may contribute to spindle orientation defects (e.g. see Kulukian et al. PNAS 2015) independent of any HMMR-Ran connection?</p><p>- To what extent is the orientation pathway described in vitro responsible for orientation defects in vivo? Polarity defects could affect spindle orientation upstream of the force localizing machinery (which is different from the mechanism the authors propose). Spindle density, mitotic defects and centrosome amplification phenotypes should be also considered when analyzing /stating the mechanism controlling spindle orientation. Are Astral MT affected? Is mitosis length increased? In spindle pictures in vivo and in ES derived rosettes, spindle density and size seem affected. The authors should characterize these features (in vivo and /or in cells). Generally it would be useful to analyze polarity markers, centrosome amplification, spindle morphology in vivo (or at least in rosettes).</p><p>3) The reviewers also recommend that you trim aspects of your analysis to focus on the novel and substantive new insights. All three reviewers expressed confusion for the diverse data and systems, some of which was not directly relevant to the overall conclusions. The authors could do a better job of integrating this data and experimental systems. The reviewers recommend removing some of the data from the work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells and other experiments that are not directly related to the main points of the paper, although we leave this to your discretion.</p><p>• In its current version, it seems that this paper is constructed so that it can accommodate a large amount of data obtained in different systems. The authors try to squeeze together a neurodevelopmental biology study and a cell biology study, and the resulting message is confused and confusing. The paper is difficult to read, and it needs a major overhaul.</p><p>• The inclusion of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> experiments seems unnecessary as there is no complementation of the Miranda phenotype (perhaps not surprising given the evolutionary difference), and they only use this to see cortical blebbing. If the authors want to include this data, they could alter this section to minimize the analysis of the complementation (perhaps a single sentence).</p><p>4) The in vivo analysis with the mouse model would benefit from some additional consideration. For the revised paper, you should use caution in the interpretation of the mouse knockout phenotypes and avoiding redundancy with other recently published work to highlight your novel discoveries:</p><p>• Previous work by Li et al. also generated a HMMR mouse mutant. There are a number of similarities, but also differences between these two papers. In the previous case, the authors only eliminated the C-terminal region of the protein. Here, the authors argue that the lethality of their mutant (but not the previous mouse model) is related to functions of the N-terminus. However, the prior paper also analyzed spindle orientation with apparently similar observations. It would be helpful to further clarify the differences and similarities between the two papers.</p><p>• Although the systems are used somewhat interchangeably, in some cases they are not used to their full potential. The power of this paper to generate a potent knockout for HMMR in mice. However, they do not use cells derived from these mice for most of the subsequent cell biological experiments. Instead, they deplete the protein by RNAi in HeLa cells, which may be both less efficient and also prone to off target defects (no rescue is shown).</p><p>• The authors state that HMMR effect is &quot;pleiotropic&quot; and are careful not to conclude that the observed developmental defects derive strictly from spindle orientation defects. However a large part of the Introduction is based on the idea that spindle orientation dictates cell fates in the developing CNS, and somehow directs the reader towards this interpretation. This is actually a very dogmatic view: although many published studies claim a causal relationship, they only show a correlation between strong neurogenesis defects (that may be caused by defective migration, cell death, or many other factors) and often minor defects in spindle orientation. As the authors later show in different HMMR mutant contexts, there are actually many defects:</p><p>- increased cell death,</p><p>- probable aneuploidy,</p><p>- centrosome mispositioning (described in rosettes),</p><p>- centrosome overduplications (described in MEFs)</p><p>- mitotic cell death (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)which are as many possible causes of microcephaly. If all these defects occur also in vivo (which they do not document), then one cannot conclude that neurogenic and brain formation defects are specifically generated by spindle misorientation itself. Indeed, centrosome amplification has been linked to microcephaly independently of spindle orientation (Marthiens et al., 2013). Centrosome positioning defects in rosettes suggest that polarity may be affected, and indeed the authors cite defects in a-b in mammary epithelia. Polarity defects can affect the architecture of the neuroepithelium, affecting indirectly neuroepithelium structure and neurogenesis, and it would be necessary to investigate a-b cell polarity in mutant brains.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled <italic>HMMR</italic> acts in the PLK1-dependent spindle positioning pathway and supports neural development&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been much improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>All three reviewers expressed an appreciation for the changes to the manuscript, including the addition of a variety of new experiments, the removal of some unnecessary or distracting data, and changes to the text. However, there are some issues that were not resolved to the reviewer's satisfaction, and other concerns that arose due to the new changes to the paper. For submitting a revised version, please focus on the following key points:</p><p>1) Rework of the text to provide a coherent model for HMMR function. For the first submission of the paper, the primary focus was on HMMR playing a role together with Ran at the spindle poles. Due to the new data presented in the revised version, the emphasis changed to propose a shared pathway for HMMR and Plk1. This is a quite significant change, and although you have changed the title, this has not yet achieved an integrated model or narrative in other sections of the paper.

First, it uses both genetic perturbations in mouse models and cell biology in human tissue culture cells to investigate spindle positioning in diverse contexts. Second, by analyzing the role of HMMR in the established spindle positioning pathways (including dynein/NuMA, Plk1, and Ran-based mechanisms), this can help provide insights into the overall control of this process. For this revised version, the authors have conducted substantial additional experimentation, and have also made a number of changes to the text and figures (for example, removing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> data as requested by the reviewers). There are some nice additions to the paper, including the analysis of Plk1. Although this work represents a step forward, I am left with the feeling that this story is not fully definitive or comprehensive. The overall take home messages have changed substantially since the first submission, necessitating a change to the title and some of the core findings. In this case, instead of proposing that HMMR is acting through Ran, now the authors are proposing Plk1 as a primary factor. At the same time, there is still confounding data arguing for an interaction with Ran (through RanBP1), but this is ill-defined. Although some of the individual datapoints are intriguing, I think that they are far away from being able to make definitive statements like &quot;Thus, PLK1 phosphorylation of HMMR (pHMMR) enables an interaction with RanBP2.&quot; or &quot;PLK1 activity and HMMR, which binds Ran-GTP, are required to locate constitutively active Ran at mitotic centrosomes.&quot;</p><p>The nature of the advance and such definitive statements is further complicated by the fact that many of the data and images show relatively modest effects (such as the change in the Ran-GTP interaction with RanBP1 when HMMR is depleted – looks like a blotting issue – or the effect on RanCA localization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>/G and Ran in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> – quantification looks like a modest change at best). Similarly, I don't understand mechanistically why HMMR depletion would lead to a reduction of DYNLL1 or dynactin with DHC. These type of co-IP Western experiments are quite sensitive and need to be carefully controlled. In this case, there is not a realistic explanation for this effect. The effect in cells looks more like a secondary effect on spindle structure to me rather than a direct effect on dynein interactions (they don't show dynein spindle localization, for example).</p><p>As much as I like the overall concepts and ideas in this paper, I am concerned that the substantive advances in this paper will be compromised by distracting data that does not rise to this level and that their model and conclusions currently being complicated by trying to include all of this regardless of significance. I would also strongly urge the authors to reconsider their overall model and to use caution in making strong and incontrovertible statements.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The new version of the manuscript is much improved.

The primary suggestions relate to strengthening the mechanistic aspects of the work.</p><p>1) Your paper suggests an important role for spindle pole-localized HMMR in signaling to the cell cortex to promote proper spindle positioning and regulating DHC and NuMA localization. Prior work has suggested that Plk1 also acts as a spindle-localized signal to control spindle position. Does this suggest that HMMR impacts Plk1 activity as well? It would be very useful to consider the relationship between these two pathways and compare the effects from individually or simultaneously targeting these pathways:</p><p>• It is important test whether HMMR affects Plk1 signaling. The reviewers recommend that you combine Plk1 inhibition or cortically tethering with HMMR perturbations for the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and 6.</p></disp-quote><p>HMMR does impact PLK1 activity. In the Introduction for the revised manuscript, we have referenced published studies linking HMMR with PLK1 activity, including that silencing HMMR reduces PLK1 activity at kinetochores during spindle assembly (Chen et al., Cell Cycle 2014) and that HMMR-T703 is a substrate for PLK1 as identified in a mitotic phosphoproteome (Nousiainen et al. PNAS, 2006).</p><p>These published findings, and the reviewer’s recommendations, founded our new MS analysis of proteins immunoprecipitated with antibodies against phosphorylated HMMR-T703 (pHMMR), which discovered RANBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; subsection “HMMR interacts with RanBP2 and regulates the centrosome localization of Ran”, first paragraph). We have performed multiple new experiments and we found that silencing HMMR dampens the intensity of phosphorylated PLK1 at spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D-E</xref>) and that small-molecule inhibition of PLK1 results in similar phenotypes as observed in HMMR-silenced cells, including a reduction in Ran co-localization with TUBG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-H</xref>), reduced astral microtubule density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F-G</xref>), and reduced cortical NuMA localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H-I</xref>). We tested if the concurrent inhibition of HMMR and PLK1 significantly altered the spindle positioning pathway when compared to the inhibition of either alone and found that the localization of NuMA was not additively altered in dual inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H-I</xref>). We now conclude that HMMR acts in the PLK1-dependent spindle positioning pathway, and have modified the title of our article accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors show that HMMR centrosome localization domain is important for its function in spindle orientation. This is a nice part of the study, and the authors use many different techniques to decipher this mechanism. However, as they admit in the Discussion, the relative importance of HMMR-Ran-centrosomal pathway with respect to others involving Plk1 and DYNLL1 is not determined; making less clear what is the relevance of these results. The authors may want to dissect whether Ran centrosome localization alone is important for spindle orientation by modulating centrosomal Ran levels independently of HMMR and by altering DYNLL1 and PlK1 expression and activity in the HMMR overexpression experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new experiments to dissect the importance of the HMMR-Ran-centrosomal pathway with respect to others involving PLK1 or DYNLL1. Our new pHMMR IP/MS data discovered RANBP2 as a putative interaction that potentially placed the HMMR-RANBP2-Ran localization downstream of PLK1 activity. Consistently, the deficits in spindle positioning that followed PLK1 inhibition are similar to those that follow HMMR silencing and concurrent disruption of both did not have an additive effect. As outlined in our first response to comment 1 (above) and as we now summarize in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>, we believe HMMR acts with PLK1 to locate Ran and modulate the centrosome-localized, spindle positioning pathway.</p><p>HMMR-CHICA-DYNLL1 is proposed to strip cortical NuMA-DHC in a PLK1-independent manner however a definitive mechanism was not described (Dunsch et al., 2012). It was proposed that HMMR-CHICA anchored DYNLL1 at the spindle pole and the consequent gradient of DYNLL1 brought proximal to the cortex with an off-center spindle pole altered the composition of cortical dynein complexes by competing with dynactin, which is needed for retention on the cortex (Dunsch et al., 2012). In a set of new experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-C</xref>), we tested two predictions derived from this putative mechanism: (1) We IP’d DHC-GFP complexes from HMMR-silenced cells and found that co-precipitated DYNLL1 was reduced, which is consistent with the putative mechanism. However, we found that co-precipitated p150<sup>glued</sup> was also reduced. (2) We localized CHICA and DYNLL1 in HMMR-silenced spindles, and found their localization to spindle fibers was reduced but both were localized at spindle poles. Thus, we conclude that silencing HMMR does alter the composition of DHC-GFP complexes and reduces the incorporation of DYNLL1; however, the incorporation of p150<sup>glued</sup> is also reduced and thus HMMR-DYNLL1 may not impede dynein-dynactin complex formation. HMMR also appears dispensable for DYNLL1 and CHICA localization to the spindle poles although it does impact their localization to spindle fibers. Together, these data support a conclusion that HMMR acts in the PLK1-dependent spindle positioning pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be helpful to more carefully evaluate the role of Ran in this process using Ran mutants (constitutively active or dominant negative). For example, does a Ran constitutively active mutant phenocopy HMMR overexpression? Alternatively, does Ran inhibition suppress the effects of HMMR overexpression? For the work on Ran, it would provide a useful addition if you could provide data to clarify the interaction and nature of the relationship between HMMR and Ran (direct interaction, through RanBP1, does this affect Ran activity, etc.):</p></disp-quote><p>Results from a new experiment demonstrate that the expression of a Ran constitutively active mutant does phenocopy the effect of HMMR overexpression on the cortical localization of NuMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8 F-G</xref>). As recommended in Essential revision 3 (see below), we have removed the work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to focus the study. The removal of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> work also led to the removal of the observation of cortical blebbing resulting from the ectopic expression of HMMR in neuroblasts; thus, we removed our analysis of cortical blebbing in tet-HMMR cells, as well. So, we did not examine if Ran inhibition suppresses the effects of HMMR overexpression in tet-HMMR cells. In new IP- MS analysis, we discover and validate a pHMMR-RANBP2 interaction to clarify the nature of the relationship between HMMR and active Ran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• siHMMR cells still deplete NuMA from the lateral cortex, suggesting this chromosomal Ran effect is functional. The authors might consider including additional siRNA conditions, such as against Rcc1 alone or in combination with HMMR, to compare HMMR to loss of activated Ran. A discussion of how HMMR discriminates potential subcellular pools of Ran as well as how it may or may not interfere with the Plk1-Dynein regulatory loop would be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have discussed the role of HMMR in the PLK1-dynein regulatory loop and contrasted that role with the putative mechanism of action published concerning the HMMR-CHICA-DYNLL1 pathway (Discussion, seventh, eighth paragraphs). We have discussed the assignment of Ran in the centrosome proteome, the role of HMMR in co-localizing Ran with TUBG1, and our observation that HMMR is dispensable for the Ran-GTP gradient generated at chromosomes (Discussion, ninth paragraph). A connection between HMMR and RCC1 in the control of the generation of Ran-GTP at chromosomes is beyond the scope of this manuscript but is a provocative concept given the central role that HMMR plays in chromosome-dependent spindle assembly (Groen et al., 2004) (Joukov et al. 2006) (Chen et al., 2014) (Scrofani et al., 2015), which is RCC1-Ran-GTP dependent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• To further establish the link between the HMMR-Ran centrosomal pathway described in vitro and in vivo observations (and to confirm that the HMMR-centrosomal Ran pathway controls spindle orientation to regulate neurogenesis), the authors should show localization of Ran to centrosomes in vivo (the fact that they study this in neuroblastoma cells is not sufficient).</p></disp-quote><p>In new studies, we examined spindle position, spindle fiber density, and Ran co-localization with TUBG1 in neuroblasts lining the ventricles in <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup> </italic>or <italic>Hmmr<sup>+/+</sup></italic>E14.5 brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-E</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• It is also important to consider alternative explanations for the observed phenotypes beyond altered Ran signaling.</p><p>- HMMR loss is shown to amplify centrosome number in MEFs (although a discussion of how this might occur is not presented). Have the authors considered that this centrosome amplification may contribute to spindle orientation defects (e.g. see Kulukian et al. PNAS 2015) independent of any HMMR-Ran connection?</p><p>- To what extent is the orientation pathway described in vitro responsible for orientation defects in vivo? Polarity defects could affect spindle orientation upstream of the force localizing machinery (which is different from the mechanism the authors propose). Spindle density, mitotic defects and centrosome amplification phenotypes should be also considered when analyzing /stating the mechanism controlling spindle orientation. Are Astral MT affected? Is mitosis length increased? In spindle pictures in vivo and in ES derived rosettes, spindle density and size seem affected. The authors should characterize these features (in vivo and /or in cells). Generally it would be useful to analyze polarity markers, centrosome amplification, spindle morphology in vivo (or at least in rosettes).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this series of excellent observations. In the revised manuscript, we discuss alternate mitotic or post mitotic processes that are disturbed in HMMR-silenced cells (usually cancer cells) as additional explanations for observed phenotypes in <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup> </italic>mice (Discussion, third paragraph). As discussed (Discussion, second paragraph), we focused our studies on mitotic processes, rather than non-mitotic processes, given our observations that HMMR is expressed in cyclin-positive, apically positioned r-NSCs during the process of neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D-I</xref>). We now include the findings from many additional experiments to address each of the reviewer’s comments in the following ways:</p><p>- Polarity markers appear unaffected in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>- Centrosome amplification: We assessed centrosome numbers, and the presence/absence of multipolar spindles, in WT and KO NP cells and found no significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>- Spindle morphology in vivo: we examined spindle position, spindle length and spindle fiber density in neuroblasts lining the ventricles in <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup> </italic>or <italic>Hmmr<sup>+/+</sup></italic>E14.5 brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-E</xref>).</p><p>- Astral microtubules are affected in HMMR-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F-G</xref>). We were not able to resolve astral microtubule density in vivo.</p><p>- The length of mitosis is augmented in <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic> MEFs and HMMR-silenced cells, which is noted in the s paragraph of the Discussion as unpublished data. These unpublished data are described in a separate manuscript, entitled Chen et al. The non-motor adaptor HMMR dampens Eg5-mediated forces to preserve the kinetics and integrity of chromosome segregation (submitted, Mol Biol Cell).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers also recommend that you trim aspects of your analysis to focus on the novel and substantive new insights. All three reviewers expressed confusion for the diverse data and systems, some of which was not directly relevant to the overall conclusions. The authors could do a better job of integrating this data and experimental systems. The reviewers recommend removing some of the data from the work in Drosophila cells and other experiments that are not directly related to the main points of the paper, although we leave this to your discretion.</p><p>• In its current version, it seems that this paper is constructed so that it can accommodate a large amount of data obtained in different systems. The authors try to squeeze together a neurodevelopmental biology study and a cell biology study, and the resulting message is confused and confusing. The paper is difficult to read, and it needs a major overhaul.</p><p>• The inclusion of the Drosophila experiments seems unnecessary as there is no complementation of the Miranda phenotype (perhaps not surprising given the evolutionary difference), and they only use this to see cortical blebbing. If the authors want to include this data, they could alter this section to minimize the analysis of the complementation (perhaps a single sentence).</p></disp-quote><p>We have constructed a more cohesive story by removing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> data and the related data addressing cortical blebbing and daughter cell size in tet-Hmmr Hela cells. We have also removed many aspects of the neural rosette data. Finally, we have focused on the novel aspects of our work by contrasting our findings from our new mouse model with the findings obtained in published <italic>Hmmr</italic> mutant mouse models (Li et al., 2015, 2016) (Tolg et al., 2003) and recent work from <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos treated with <italic>HMMR</italic> morpholinos (Prgaer et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The in vivo analysis with the mouse model would benefit from some additional consideration. For the revised paper, you should use caution in the interpretation of the mouse knockout phenotypes and avoiding redundancy with other recently published work to highlight your novel discoveries:</p><p>• Previous work by Li et al. also generated a HMMR mouse mutant. There are a number of similarities, but also differences between these two papers. In the previous case, the authors only eliminated the C-terminal region of the protein. Here, the authors argue that the lethality of their mutant (but not the previous mouse model) is related to functions of the N-terminus. However, the prior paper also analyzed spindle orientation with apparently similar observations. It would be helpful to further clarify the differences and similarities between the two papers.</p></disp-quote><p>As is noted by the reviewer in the next comment, the <italic>Hmmr<sup>tm1a/tm1a</sup></italic>mouse model is the more potent knockout for Hmmr in mice so we do not believe there is redundancy between the findings from our work and the published <italic>Hmmr</italic> mice. We do note the work from Li et al. (2015, 2016) in the Introduction and we discuss the similarities and differences in the Discussion. In particular, we highlight in the discussion the recently published work in <italic>Xenopus</italic> HMMR morphants that indicate a critical role for the N-terminus of the protein in neural development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Although the systems are used somewhat interchangeably, in some cases they are not used to their full potential. The power of this paper to generate a potent knockout for HMMR in mice. However, they do not use cells derived from these mice for most of the subsequent cell biological experiments. Instead, they deplete the protein by RNAi in HeLa cells, which may be both less efficient and also prone to off target defects (no rescue is shown).</p></disp-quote><p>We performed many studies in siHMMR-treated HeLa cells, rather than <italic>Hmmr</italic> KO MEFs, due to: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) MEFs have a low mitotic rate, which makes them suboptimal for mechanistic studies; and, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) many of the seminal observations describing the spindle positioning pathway in mammalian cells were obtained using HeLa cells making this model an optimal one for comparison with the published literature.</p><p>With respect to rescue in siHMMR-treated HeLa cells, we have previously published that the reduced kinetics of spindle assembly observed in siHMMR-treated HeLa cells can be rescued through the expression of GFP-HMMR (Chen et al., 2014), which argues against the effects observed here (using the same constructs) being the result of off-target effects. In addition, our findings describe consistent phenotypes (changes to ran localization, spindle structure and spindle position) in redundant models for HMMR-deletion (mice, Mefs, HMMR-silenced HeLa).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors state that HMMR effect is &quot;pleiotropic&quot; and are careful not to conclude that the observed developmental defects derive strictly from spindle orientation defects. However a large part of the Introduction is based on the idea that spindle orientation dictates cell fates in the developing CNS, and somehow directs the reader towards this interpretation. This is actually a very dogmatic view: although many published studies claim a causal relationship, they only show a correlation between strong neurogenesis defects (that may be caused by defective migration, cell death, or many other factors) and often minor defects in spindle orientation. As the authors later show in different HMMR mutant contexts, there are actually many defects:</p><p>- increased cell death,</p><p>- probable aneuploidy,</p><p>- centrosome mispositioning (described in rosettes),</p><p>- centrosome overduplications (described in MEFs)</p><p>- mitotic cell death (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)which are as many possible causes of microcephaly. If all these defects occur also in vivo (which they do not document), then one cannot conclude that neurogenic and brain formation defects are specifically generated by spindle misorientation itself. Indeed, centrosome amplification has been linked to microcephaly independently of spindle orientation (Marthiens et al., 2013). Centrosome positioning defects in rosettes suggest that polarity may be affected, and indeed the authors cite defects in a-b in mammary epithelia. Polarity defects can affect the architecture of the neuroepithelium, affecting indirectly neuroepithelium structure and neurogenesis, and it would be necessary to investigate a-b cell polarity in mutant brains.</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent suggestions that overlap with aspects of those in the last criticism of point 2. As outlined in our response to that criticism, we have performed additional experiments to investigate these putative effects. With specific note to polarity defects, we looked at Par3 and ZO-1 as apical markers and their localization appears to be unaffected in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been much improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>All three reviewers expressed an appreciation for the changes to the manuscript, including the addition of a variety of new experiments, the removal of some unnecessary or distracting data, and changes to the text.

Briefly, Barr and colleagues, J Cell Biol 2012 demonstrated that a HMMR-CHICA complex at the spindle/poles contributed to the positioning pathway, potentially in a PLK1-independent manner. HMMR-CHICA was shown to recruit DYNLL1 to the spindle/ poles and proposed to create a local increase of DYNLL1 activity. Consistently, we identified DYNLL1 and CHICA in pHMMR IPs by MS analysis and we found that the DYNLL1-DHC interaction was reduced in HMMR-silenced cells.</p><p>Barr and colleagues further speculated that the local increase of DYNLL1 caused DYNLL1- dynein interactions that resulted in loss of dynein from the cell cortex by competing with dynactin: “a prediction of this model is that the DYNLL1-bound form of dynein cannot bind to dynein adaptors required for cortical targeting” and “Therefore, DYNLL1 may compete with dynactin for binding sites on the dynein intermediate chain, and thereby displace dynein complexes from the cell cortex.” A prediction of this model would be that cortical dynein is retained in HMMR-silenced cells because dynactin is incorporated and not displaced by DYNLL1. While we found the DYNLL1-DHC interaction was reduced in HMMR-silenced cells, we do not find evidence for augmented dynactin-DHC complexes. In fact, we find that dynactin-DHC complexes are reduced. We agree that these co-IP experiments are quite sensitive.

I would also strongly urge the authors to reconsider their overall model and to use caution in making strong and incontrovertible statements.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the model, and the text throughout, to highlight that HMMR feeds into the intrinsic PLK1 positioning pathway. We have also highlighted the fact that while we localize active Ran at spindle poles, and that its localization is reduced by the silencing of HMMR or the inhibition of PLK1, the relative contribution of active Ran at the spindle pole to the regulation of cortical NuMA localization is not yet clear.</p></body></sub-article></article>
