essential mechanism for spinal nerve patterning. In birds and mammals the embryonic somites generate a linear series of impenetrable barriers, forcing axon growth cones to traverse one half of each somite as they extend towards their body targets. This study shows that protein disulphide isomerase provides a key component of these barriers, mediating contact repulsion at the cell surface in chick half-somites. Repulsion is reduced both in vivo and in vitro by a range of methods that inhibit enzyme activity. The activity is critical in initiating a nitric oxide/S-nitrosylation-dependent signal transduction pathway that regulates the growth cone cytoskeleton. Rat forebrain grey matter extracts contain a similar activity, and the enzyme is expressed at the surface of cultured human astrocytic cells and rat cortical astrocytes. We suggest this system is co-opted in the brain to counteract and regulate aberrant nerve terminal growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spinal nerve</kwd><kwd>repeat

periodicity, or segmentation, that reflects their necessary isolation from the segments of developing bone that will form the vertebral column. This study sets out to identify the molecular basis of this patterning. We find a critical role for the enzyme protein disulphide isomerase in separating outgrowing axons from the somite cells that generate the vertebrae, and provide evidence regarding the underlying mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cook et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In avian and mammalian embryos, both outgrowing motor and sensory axons, and migrating neural crest cells, encounter the periodic somites that flank both sides of the neural tube (future spinal cord). Here they traverse preferentially the anterior (A, rostral/cranial) - rather than posterior (P, caudal) - halves of each successive somite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Keynes and Stern, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rickmann et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bronner-Fraser, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). For neural crest cells this preference has been shown to depend on repulsive signalling in the P-half-somite by members of the Semaphorin/Neuropilin- and Ephrin/Eph protein families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krull et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang and Anderson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koblar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gammill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davy and Soriano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwarz et al., 2009</xref>).

Two somites are shown, each sub-divided into 2 main components - the dermomyotome (future dermis and skeletal muscle) and sclerotome (future vertebral cartilage and bone). The sclerotome of each somite is further subdivided longitudinally into A- and P-halves (dashed lines), and the early components of the peripheral nervous system develop within the mesenchyme of each successive A-half-sclerotome. Here, motor axons (green) extend from cell bodies in the ventral (V) neural tube, and sensory axons (red) extend from cell bodies that coalesce to form the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). The DRGs derive from neural crest cells that earlier migrated into the A-half-sclerotomes (thick arrows) from the dorsal neural tube (<bold>D</bold>). Each DRG cell body generates one axon that grows dorsally to enter the neural tube and one that grows ventrally to join the motor axons; together with preganglionic autonomic axons (not shown), these motor and sensory axons form the 'mixed' spinal nerves that will innervate the body at each segmental level.

Our finding that somite cell surface PDI (csPDI) binds PNA, and is lactose-elutable from immobilized PNA, indicates that this form of PDI is O-glycosylated. This is supported by the observation that csPDI expressed by Jurkat T cells, immortalized from human T cell leukaemia, also possesses PNA-binding O-glycans, the elongation of which can be blocked experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schaefer et al., 2017</xref>).

The expression of PDI at the surface of P-half-sclerotome cells was confirmed by live-staining of microdissected strips of chick somites, using both polyclonal anti-PDI antibody and fluorescently labelled PNA, which showed co-localization at the cell periphery in the P-half-sclerotome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–g</xref>).

PDI gene knockdown in ovo was then carried out by microinjection of the siRNA, incorporated in a polyethylene glycol matrix, into at least 8 somites on one side of the embryo, anterior to the most recently formed somite (stage 9–12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Confirmation of cs-PDI knockdown using Western blotting was not attempted due to the limiting availability of sufficient quantities of somite tissue, combined with the high ratio of constitutive PDI expression in the ER versus csPDI. As predicted however, PDI knockdown in ovo caused loss of extracellular PNA-binding in P-half-sclerotomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e–g</xref>). After siRNA injection and further incubation for 48 hr, spinal nerve outgrowth was assessed by immunohistochemistry using a neuron-specific-β-III tubulin antibody (clone TUJ1), observer-blind to treatment condition. Embryos treated with control/scrambled siRNA showed normal axon segmentation, with growth restricted to the A-half-sclerotomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). However PDI knockdown caused outgrowing motor axons to project additionally into the P-half-sclerotomes adjacent to the neural tube/spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>), an abnormal trajectory not seen in untreated embryos or in those similarly treated with control/scrambled siRNA.

In confirmation we found that immobilized jacalin, a lectin that binds the same O-linked disaccharide (Galβ1-3GalNAc) as does PNA, but unlike PNA is not selective for its de-sialylation, can be used to deplete collapse induced by rat forebrain extracts (RFE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ghosh and David, 1997</xref> have also described a growth cone collapse-inducing activity in membrane preparations of rat cerebral cortical grey matter. We therefore tested whether, as for somite extracts, a range of inhibitors of PDI activity block RFE-induced collapse, and found this was the case. Application of PACMA 31 (5μM) significantly reduced collapse (by 50–60%) whereas PACMA 56 (5μM) did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Another small molecule PDI-inhibitor, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jasuja et al., 2012</xref>) inhibited RFE-induced collapse when used at both 1 μM and 50 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). RFE-induced collapse activity was immunodepleted using polyclonal anti-PDI antibody but not using IgG or bovine serum albumin (BSA) as sham protein controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).

The NGF-dependent primary sensory neurons assessed here project axons in vivo in the CNS as well as PNS, making synapses in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in the brainstem. We have shown previously that two populations of CNS-restricted neurons are also responsive to the somite contact-repellent system. When explants of embryonic day-4 (E4) chick telencephalon or E7 retina are grafted in ovo in place of chick spinal cord, their axons avoid P-half-somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keynes et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vermeren et al., 2000</xref>).

It has been implicated in processes such as platelet aggregation and thrombosis, and in animal cell infection by a variety of micro-organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali Khan and Mutus, 2014</xref>). Here we have identified a key function for csPDI in contact repulsion using a biological system. Consistent with its location at the cell surface, somite csPDI is an O-glycosylated protein, as shown by our lectin-binding studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davies et al., 1990</xref>) and by Bi et al. for human Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi et al., 2011</xref>). In keeping with this, it has been shown that contact between a single DRG growth cone filopodium and the surface of a P-half-somite cell in vitro is sufficient to initiate a rapid filopodial withdrawal/repulsive response, followed by reorientation of the growth cone away from the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steketee and Tosney, 1999</xref>). The rapid nature of this response, combined with our finding that somite extract collapse-inducing activity is depleted using the lectins PNA and jacalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davies et al., 1990</xref>), argue strongly that repulsion is likely to arise from the activity of csPDI rather than ER-based PDI. These lectins have specificity for O-glycans that are synthesised and linked to protein in the Golgi apparatus before the glycoprotein is transported to the cell surface. Also consistent with a repulsion mechanism, inhibition of PDI activity in vivo, using either siRNA knockdown or PACMA 31 inhibition of enzyme activity, causes axons to traverse the P-half-somites. Since PDI is a multifunctional enzyme operating both within and outside cells, it is possible that this phenotype might arise for other reasons. However we used the same target for gene knockdown experiments as used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zai et al., 1999</xref>., who showed that cell viability is unperturbed despite inhibition of csPDI expression. Additionally we saw no change in somite morphology despite loss of lectin binding at the cell surface.</p><p>In chick somites the onset of csPDI expression in P-half-sclerotome immediately precedes the first emergence of spinal axons in the A-half. This matches well the proposed function of csPDI in mediating contact repulsion of outgrowing motor and sensory axons. The selective migration of neural crest cells in A-half-sclerotomes precedes by several hours the first axon outgrowth at each segmental level in the chick embryo, and is likewise matched temporally by the onset of expression of the secreted repellent Sema3F in newly-formed P-half-sclerotomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gammill et al., 2006</xref>). The secreted axon repellent protein Sema3A is additionally expressed selectively in P-half-sclerotome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eickholt et al., 1999</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shepherd et al., 1996</xref>). However no long-distance axon repulsion is detected in collagen gel co-explants of DRGs with dissected P-half-sclerotomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keynes et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, segmented spinal nerve patterning persists in compound Neuropilin1/2 mutant mice in which somite-based Semaphorin signalling is depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwarz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huber et al., 2005</xref>), presumably because csPDI expression in these mice compensates disrupted neural crest migration.</p><p>Together these observations imply that the segmental patterning of neural crest cells and axons is regulated predominantly by distinct molecular signals. Supporting this, the Eph-family receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2 and its ligand ephrin-B1 have been additionally implicated in somite-based repulsion of neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krull et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang and Anderson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davy and Soriano, 2007</xref>), but shown not to be necessary for motor axon segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koblar et al., 2000</xref>). Other candidate axon-repellent molecules that are preferentially expressed in P-half-sclerotome have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kuan et al., 2004</xref>) but their in vivo roles have remained uncertain. For T-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ranscht and Bronner-Fraser, 1991</xref>) and F-Spondin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tzarfati-Majar et al., 2001</xref>), while each of these proteins has been shown to inhibit motor axon growth in vitro, mouse gene knockout phenotypes consistent with a role in spinal nerve segmentation in vivo have not been published to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciatto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>). The chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans aggrecan and versican provide further similar examples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Watanabe and Yamada, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perissinotto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dours-Zimmermann et al., 2009</xref>). Also the extracellular matrix glycoprotein Fibulin 2 was recently found to have P-half-specific expression in a RNA-seq screen of dissected mouse A- and P-half-somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schaeffer et al., 2018</xref>). While Fibulin 2 does not possess intrinsic growth cone collapse-inducing activity, the evidence indicates that it promotes Sema3A signalling in the P-half-sclerotome, and may contribute to spinal nerve fasciculation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schaeffer et al., 2018</xref>). Last, the identification by Pfaff and colleagues of the <italic>Columbus</italic> mouse mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2011</xref>) provides a striking example of loss of motor/sensory axon repulsion in mouse P-half-somites. Here, the loss of Presenilin-1 (PS-1) function causes outgrowing axons to traverse both halves of the somite. This is explicable by the consequent loss of <italic>Notch</italic> function required to generate P-half-somite polarity, upstream of P-half-somite differentiation, as seen in two previous PS-1 mouse gene knockout studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wong et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the mechanism of csPDI, the models of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zai et al., 1999</xref> (using human erythroleukaemia cells), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ramachandran et al., 2001</xref> (using fibroblasts and endothelial cells) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sliskovic et al., 2005</xref> have been proposed to explain how NO entry into these cells is regulated by a transnitrosation mechanism facilitated by csPDI. These in vitro cellular models are directly applicable to the axon growth cone/somite system in vivo. We suggest that csPDI acts as a de-nitrosylase, operating constitutively at the P-half-somite cell surface to promote the transfer of NO• from extracellular S-nitrosothiols into the cytosol of contacting growth cone filopodia, thereby initiating repulsion/collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Extracellular S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) may provide a ubiquitous source of NO donor, as suggested for csPDI activity in the context of platelet aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shah et al., 2007</xref>). Critically we have shown that its ambient extracellular concentration in vivo (~1 µM) is sufficient, in combination with purified PDI, to elicit growth cone collapse in vitro. Alternatively or additionally, other NO donors may be involved.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of the proposed action of csPDI in mediating growth cone repulsion by NO.</title><p>1. A filopodium (blue) contacts a sclerotome cell in the posterior/P-half-somite, where it encounters csPDI, leading to the denitrosylation of a NO-donor molecule, for example GSNO. This reaction can be blocked by PACMA 31, so preventing collapse. 2. NO (which is known to cross cell membranes) is transferred into the filopodium as a result, where it may additionally regulate nNOS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benhar et al., 2009</xref>). 3. As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stroissnigg et al., 2007</xref>., nNOS activation causes nitrosylation of cysteine 2457 in the COOH terminus of the MAP1B light chain LC1. They propose that the resulting conformational change in LC1 enhances MAP1B/microtubule binding, which in turn blocks activity of the anchored motor protein dynein. Dynein normally provides a tubulin/minus-end-directed motor activity via its motor domains (filled green circles) that drives axon extension through interaction with microtubules. This is counteracted by a retraction force due to cortical actin/myosin, so that dynein blockade converts filopodial extension to filopodial retraction/repulsion (large red arrow).

SIN-1-induced collapse is prevented by the presence of haemoglobin, which binds released NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hess et al., 1993</xref>), and we have shown that both myoglobin, which similarly binds released NO, and the membrane-impermeable NO-scavenger PTIO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flögel et al., 2001</xref>) deplete the collapse-inducing activity of somite extracts. Moreover nNOS inhibition by L-NAME prevents such collapse, indicating that NO signalling may be further amplified in the growth cone by nNOS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benhar et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>How might NO signalling in the growth cone influence the cytoskeleton? Our results accord well with the proposal of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stroissnigg et al., 2007</xref> that, in axons extending in vitro, growth cone retraction is counteracted by a microtubule/dynein-based system. S-nitrosylation of LC1 induces a conformational change that enhances binding of the LC1-HC complex to microtubules, so blocking dynein action and promoting retraction over extension. Correspondingly, in the somite system in vivo both motor and sensory axon growth cones extending at the A/P-half-somite boundaries will make filopodial contact with P-half-somite cells expressing csPDI, triggering NO-mediated repulsive signalling. Consistent with this, using the iodo-TMT reagent we find that LC1 is the only S-nitrosylated protein detected in cell free extracts of dissected somite strips, which necessarily include growth cone proteins.</p><p>The observation that a repellent activity closely similar to the somite system is expressed in mammalian forebrain grey matter is of particular interest, and extends the range of brain proteins originally identified as developmental axon repellents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Raper and Kapfhammer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cox et al., 1990</xref>). Collapse-inducing activity is significantly reduced using the lectins PNA and jacalin (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keynes et al., 1991</xref>), and is also prevented using a variety of small molecule inhibitors (PACMA 31, rutinoside, GSH) as well as myoglobin and anti-PDI antibody. Our findings additionally implicate the astrocyte as a source of this activity, since human astrocytic (1718) cells and rat cortical primary astrocytes express csPDI, and 1718-cell-derived growth cone collapse activity is removed by immobilized PNA and jacalin. In view of the involvement of NO/S-nitrosylation signalling in the csPDI-mediated repulsion mechanism, rather than a protein-based ligand-receptor interaction, a broad range of CNS axon types may prove susceptible to it. And consistent this, we have shown previously that chick CNS (retinal and telencephalic) axons respond to the somite repellent in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keynes et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vermeren et al., 2000</xref>). It may also be significant that csPDI expression by human malignant glioblastoma cells has been related to their invasiveness within the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goplen et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The neuron may be another source of brain-derived csPDI, since a recent proteomic analysis of CNS synaptic cleft proteins identified csPDI/P4HB among the most enriched candidates at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in embryonic rat cortical neuronal cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loh et al., 2016</xref>; csPDI has also been identified at the surface of both neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xiao et al., 1999</xref>) and retinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pariser et al., 2000</xref>). Together with the experiments reported in this study, these findings collectively raise the possibility that csPDI is 'bifunctional' in promoting both adhesive and repulsive neuronal/glial interactions in the CNS. For example, NO signalling is implicated in synapse elimination during CNS development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gibbs and Truman, 1998</xref>), and csPDI activity might provide an extracellular source of NO alongside intracellular nNOS activity.</p><p>In sum, this study reveals a novel role for the multifunctional enzyme PDI in the periodic patterning of peripheral spinal nerves, ensuring their separation in somites from developing cartilage and bone. The additional expression of csPDI at the astrocyte surface, and its function in promoting NO-based repulsion of growing nerve terminals, suggest a promising candidate for regulating axon growth and plasticity that may be widely distributed in the developing and mature nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

An incision was made between the neural tube and newly-formed sclerotome on one side of the embryo, and a single Affi-Gel Blue agarose gel bead (BioRad, Cibacron blue coupled to agarose, 30–50 μm diameter) impregnated with PACMA31 or PACMA56 (500 μM in PBS) was implanted into the resulting space (adjacent to the neural tube medially and notochord ventrally). Embryos were then re-incubated for 24–36 hr before fixing and processing for axon staining (see below) as whole-mounts or as (left and right) half-embryo-mounts. PACMA31 or PACMA56 solution was made by adding 0.5 ml dimethylsulfoxide to 2.2 mg PACMA to make a 10 mM stock solution. This was diluted x20 in PBS to make a 500 μM working solution, in which the Affigel beads were then placed for 2–3 hr at 21°C prior to implantation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Preparation of tissue extracts</title><p>Stage 16–18 chick embryo trunks (comprising ectoderm, somites with DRG neurons, and motor axons, neural tube and notochord) or somite strips (ectoderm, somites with DRG neurons and motor axons) were dissected and immediately placed on solid CO<sub>2</sub> and transferred to −80°C for longer storage.

restricted to the anterior half of each somite-derived sclerotome in the spinal cord, during generation of the segmented patterning of nerves during early peripheral nervous system development. The authors show that the cell surface protein disulphide isomerase contributes to such axonal segmentation by serving as an impenetrable barrier for growth cones in the posterior somite through acting on a nitric oxide/S-nitrosylation-dependent signal transduction pathway regulating the growth cone cytoskeleton, inducing axon growth cones to traverse the anterior half of each somite as they extend towards their body targets.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Regulation of nerve growth and patterning by cell surface protein disulphide isomerase&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ann Rajnicek (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your study on how the growth of sensory and motor axons are restricted to the anterior half of each somite-derived sclerotome, generating the segmented patterning of the early PNS, was viewed favorably by the reviewers. The demonstration of a key role for cell surface protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) via an NO-based mechanism in the establishment of such segmental axon patterning was deemed a major and important contribution. To ensure that the manuscript is accessible to the wide audience of <italic>eLife</italic> and to be clear even to developmental biologists, the reviewers and I ask that you insert a diagram in the first figure that would depict the somite arrangements and axon tracts, to set out the hypothesis, then a summary diagram in a final figure that would pull together the various strands of the results. Also, the reviewers call for examples of growth cone collapse and time course images, and for minor text modifications. I have left the reviews intact so that you can read the many positive comments on your study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All of the revisions requested below are essential, and none call for performing new experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The restriction of the growth of sensory and motor axons to the anterior half of each somite-derived sclerotome, generating the segmented patterning of the early PNS, and the demonstration that this is due to contact repulsion exerted by the posterior sclerotome cells is one of the first and classic examples of this fundamental axon guidance mechanism. However, the molecular basis of segmental patterning is not understood. Here Cook and colleagues provide evidence for a key role for cell surface protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) via an NO-based mechanism in the establishment of segmental axon patterning and as such make a major and important contribution to our understanding.</p><p>Because they have previously shown that the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) binds to the posterior half sclerotome cells and that immobilised PNA depletes the collapse activity of the posterior sclerotome which is recovered by lactose elution, they subjected a major band in silver-stained SDS PAGE preparations of lactose elutes to tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry. This revealed numerous peptides distributed throughout PDIA1/P4HB, a member of the PDI family. They additionally showed that PDI staining appears in the posterior sclerotome shortly before the segmental emergence of sensory and motor axons. Importantly, they showed that in ovo microinjection of PDI siRNA, but not a scrambled control, disrupted the segmental patterning of early axons. As an alternative demonstration of the role of PDI, they microinjected a molecule that has been shown to specifically disrupt one of the active sites of PDI. Like PDI siRNA, this too disrupted segmental axon growth. To elucidate how PDI causes growth cone collapse, they investigated the potential involvement of an NO, based on the previous demonstration that NO causes growth cone collapse and that PDS catalyses NO entry by a transnitrosation mechanism. They showed in a DRG growth cone collapse assay that PDI (but not inhibited PDI) promotes NO donor-induced collapse. Moreover, somite extract-induced collapse was prevented by pre-treating DRG with an NOS inhibitor. Because S-nitrosylation of the MAPB1 light chain subunit LC1 has been shown to mediates calcium ionophore-induced growth cone collapse, they investigated whether a similar mechanism occurs in somite-induced growth cone collapse. Western blotting revealed that only one band, that corresponds to LC1, was S-nitrosylated in dissected somite strips and that S-nitrosylation of this band was prevented by an NOS inhibitor. Finally, they showed that PDI is expressed on mature astrocytes and that the growth cone collapsing activity of the grey matter of mature mammalian brain is blocked by inhibitors of PDI activity, suggesting that a similar mechanism operates in the CNS.</p><p>It is unfortunate that the chicken lacks suitable transgenetic tools, so well developed in mice, to demonstrate conclusively the role of PDI in segmental axon patterning. Nonetheless, the authors have done what is acceptable to show beyond reasonable doubt the role of PDI in segmental axon patterning and its mechanism of action in the developing chicken embryo. This is an important, far-reaching study. Many of the experiments are truly heroic given the very small quantity of tissue available. The results are well-controlled and logically presented and the paper is very well written. I have no major criticisms.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a careful study in which a plethora of methodologies are used to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which cell surface protein disulphide isomerase underpins sensory axon segmentation of spinal neurons.

A summary figure to set out the hypothesis in a first figure, coupled with a summary diagram in a final figure pulling together the various strands of the results would be incredibly useful. Both because of the wide range of specialist techniques used in the study and because there is a wider context in which the study could be interpreted- but there is a lot to digest from the text and the point is difficult to grasp in places.</p><p>2) The authors say that ….'co-injection of siRNA…rescued the normal segmented phenotype (Figure 2….)'.

It would be useful to have images so the reader can get a feel for what 'collapse' looks like, especially with respect to soluble and contact mediated factors. For example, when the growth cones are challenged with soluble factors or liposomes: how do liposomes interact physically with filopodia in these cultures as compared to soluble factor influences on growth cone morphology (important because, as the authors state, a single filopodial contact can make all the difference)? They report time course data, so they must have time lapse images of growth cones as they collapse from which such measurements were made. These would be useful for the reader.</p><p>4) In a similar vein, given the importance of growth cone collapse and the role of the identified molecular mechanism on axon pathfinding I'm wondering why the authors did not include 'classical growth cone turning assay' or 'stripe assay' experiments. I am not necessarily requesting additional experiments, but if the authors have such data they would add to the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this interesting manuscript, Cook and colleagues provide a kind of closure to a long-standing question about patterning of metameric nerve growth in avian and mammalian embryos. Previous studies, many from the Keynes laboratory, showed that although both neural crest cells and motor and sensory axons traverse only the anterior half somite during outgrowth, the underlying molecular mechanisms that channel neural crest cell migration are distinct from those that channel axon extension. Here, they identify PDIA1/P4HB, a protein disulphide isomerase, as the cell surface activity required to prevent axons from entering the posterior half somite. They demonstrate that this PDI mediates axon repulsion by activating nitric oxide signaling, which elicits growth cone collapse. The also show that this PDI is the activity from adult brain extracts previously shown to mediate sensory axon growth cone collapse, and that this activity may emanate from astroglia.</p><p>This manuscript provides a satisfying answer to a question that has long been elusive. For the most part the data are very robust and well-documented. However, I suggest two types of improvements. First, other molecules, including ones described by the Keynes laboratory, are also implicated in preventing axons from entering the posterior half somite. This should be discussed. I think it would be very helpful to include a model figure that shows how PDI operates, as they describe in the Discussion, and also includes these other molecular mechanisms.

We note the comment on our use of the chick embryo rather than mouse, which stems from earlier embryo grafting experiments that defined this biological system. Relevant here, we have added a new comment in the Discussion (third paragraph) regarding the mouse mutant screen published by Samuel Pfaff and colleagues, and a reference to this work (Bai et al., 2011). Their <italic>Columbus</italic> mutant has an impressive spinal axon phenotype indicative of a loss of somite polarity (P-to-A).

We have made it clear that collapse is defined morphologically as loss/conversion of the entire growth cone structure (i.e. both filopodia and lamellipodia) to a needle-like point, with no more than two filopodia. We have additionally referred to images of collapsed growth cones in a previous publication from our lab (Manns et al., 2012, Figure 1K, L). These show that using phase-contrast optics to visualise growth cones, as we have also done here, compares favourably with phalloidin staining of growth cones. Regarding the reviewer's further comment on liposomes, as a control we use liposomes that have not incorporated any proteins, and routinely we find they do not cause collapse beyond the background levels also seen after addition of phosphate-buffered saline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In a similar vein, given the importance of growth cone collapse and the role of the identified molecular mechanism on axon pathfinding I'm wondering why the authors did not include 'classical growth cone turning assay' or 'stripe assay' experiments.

Panel A shows that fluorescein-labelled siRNA was delivered into several consecutive somites after a typical injection experiment. Therefore, in respect of siRNA distribution in a contiguous row of somites, we did not predict randomly-distributed loss of PDI from segment-to-segment. Abnormal outgrowth patterns were seen in consecutive segments, as shown in panels C and D (on the right in each image); these panels also show normal segmented outgrowth in more posterior segments (to the left in each image), presumably where siRNA delivery was diminished compared with the abnormal segments. The legend has been modified accordingly to make this point clearer.</p><p>In the case of a single somite we did not expect the knockdown to affect every cell within it, nor did we see evidence for this. Figure 2—figure supplement 2J and K show a scattered distribution of sclerotome cells expressing PDI (J) and the FLAG M1 epitope (K). In view of the cell-surface-localized nature of the contact-based repulsion mechanism, we would expect such somites to elicit the sprouting defects as described. We find no evidence that P-half-somite cells secrete an axonal repellent (Keynes et al., 1997), so cells that escape the siRNA would not be expected to compensate knocked-down cells in the same somite. We prefer not to lengthen the Discussion with these arguments but will do this if so required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2—figure supplement 2.
