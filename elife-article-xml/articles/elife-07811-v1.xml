tissues. Furthermore, because mechanical stress is widespread, mechanical signals are difficult to uncouple from biochemical-based transduction pathways. Here we focus on the homeobox gene <italic>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM</italic>), a master regulator and marker of meristematic identity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We found that <italic>STM</italic> expression is quantitatively correlated to curvature in the saddle-shaped boundary domain of the shoot apical meristem. As tissue folding reflects the presence of mechanical stress, we test and demonstrate that <italic>STM</italic> expression is induced after micromechanical perturbations. We also show that <italic>STM</italic> expression in the boundary domain is required for organ separation. While <italic>STM</italic> expression correlates with auxin depletion in this domain, auxin distribution and <italic>STM</italic> expression can also be uncoupled. <italic>STM</italic> expression and boundary identity are thus strengthened through a synergy between auxin depletion and an auxin-independent mechanotransduction pathway at the shoot apical meristem.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07811.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07811.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07811.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The bending, stretching or squashing of cells or tissues can be used as a signal to trigger a range of biological responses. However investigating the role of these mechanical signals remains a challenge. This is partly because the forces that trigger the mechanical signals are often short-lived and changeable, and partly because the signals can be difficult to separate from the biochemical responses that they generate.</p><p>Stem cells present at the tip of the growing shoots in a plant are exposed to mechanical forces. These growing tips are called shoot meristems, and the stem cells they contain create all the aboveground organs of the plant (stems, leaves and flowers etc.). In each meristem, a boundary forms between the slow-growing stem cells at its centre and the fast-growing organs that form around them. Because these plant cells are both stuck together by their cell walls and growing at different rates, strong mechanical stresses are created causing this boundary to fold. A key regulator of the meristem is a protein called STM, but it remains unclear whether mechanical signals are involved in the control of this protein.</p><p>To investigate this, Landrein et al. tracked where the gene for the STM protein was switch on in shoot meristems in a plant called Arabidopsis, and found that it is highly active at the boundary. Analysing STM in different mutant plants combined with advanced imaging techniques revealed that STM activity correlates with the extent of creasing at this boundary. The STM protein is also required at the boundary to ensure that developing organs separate out. These findings suggest that boundary folding might somehow create signals that activate STM. One candidate signal was the plant hormone called auxin because reduced levels of this hormone were previously associated with boundary formation. However, in further experiments, Landrein et al. ruled out auxin’s involvement in this process.</p><p>So do mechanical signals activate STM at the boundary? To test this, the mechanical forces in the meristem were altered by compressing the growing shoot meristems in miniature vices and by killing a few stem cells at the meristem centre. Both of these actions triggered the production of STM in the meristem, consistent with its activity being altered by mechanical stress.</p><p>Landrein et al. propose that the mechanical regulation identified acts in parallel to auxin signalling, providing robustness to the regulation of gene activity in the shoot meristem. In other words, tissue folding can guide gene expression, via the production of mechanical signals. But how shoot meristem cells respond at a molecular level to mechanical stress awaits future work. Finally, proteins related to STM can be found in all biological kingdoms, including some proteins that regulate important process in animal development. Whether the activity of these related proteins is also regulated by mechanical forces remains to be investigated.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07811.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07811.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mechanical stress</kwd><kwd>homeobox</kwd><kwd>meristem</kwd><kwd>boundary</kwd><kwd>auxin</kwd><kwd>STM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-BLAN-1516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Landrein</surname><given-names>Benoît</given-names></name><name><surname>Kiss</surname><given-names>Annamaria</given-names></name><name><surname>Traas</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Boudaoud</surname><given-names>Arezki</given-names></name><name><surname>Hamant</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2013-CoG-615739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamant</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-BLAN-1614</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cortizo</surname><given-names>Millan</given-names></name><name><surname>Laufs</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2013-AdG-294397</award-id> <principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sassi</surname><given-names>Massimiliano</given-names></name><name><surname>Traas</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mechanical stress promotes the expression of the homeobox gene and meristem master regulator STM, synergistically and independently from auxin depletion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Almost 100 years ago, Thomas D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson proposed that shape of plants and animals could be described as a consequence of the laws of physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">D’Arcy Thompson, 1917</xref>). While this view has been overshadowed by the rise of molecular biology and morphogen-based patterning mechanisms, a growing contribution of mechanics in shape changes is currently emerging. In this framework, an instructing role of mechanical forces has been successfully explored theoretically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shraiman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aegerter-Wilmsen et al., 2007</xref>) and there is today accumulating evidence that many molecular actors involved in development are under both biochemical and mechanical control. In particular, studies on single animal cells show that mechanical forces contribute to the control of cell division and cell polarity, and relevant mechanotransduction pathways have been identified (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Houk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thery et al., 2007</xref>). The idea that mechanical stress may also play a role in defining cell identity has also emerged in the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Engler et al., 2006</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aliee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Landsberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Farge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunet et al., 2013</xref>). However, this pioneering work is still debated and a role of mechanical signals in cell identity during development remains an open question. Furthermore, all the currently known mechanotransduction pathways involve elements of established biochemical-based transduction pathway (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Janmey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jaalouk and Lammerding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Orr et al., 2006</xref>). Assuming mechanical signals play an important role in development, one may thus question the added value of mechanical signals in development if their action is so tightly coupled to biochemical signaling.</p><p>Because their development is slow, iterative and does not involve cell movements, plants are systems of choice to explore the possible contribution of mechanical signals in proprioception, i.e. in channeling growth and identity from intrinsically generated mechanical stresses. Mechanical cues contribute to the emergence of lateral roots in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ditengou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Richter et al., 2009</xref>), the expression level of the transcription factor <italic>PtaZFP2</italic> correlates to the amount of bending in poplar stems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coutand et al., 2009</xref>) and the expression of the <italic>ELA1</italic> gene in a specific cell layer of the developing seed is triggered by mechanical signals that are generated by the growth of the embryo against the endosperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Creff et al., 2015</xref>). While these studies suggest that physical forces can contribute to cell identity definition in plants, this remains to be fully demonstrated. A fitting system for this question is the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which contains a plant stem cell niche and controls the formation and identity of all aerial organs. Because cells are glued to each other, differential growth generates mechanical conflicts leading to shape changes. For instance, tissue folding occurs in the boundary domain of the SAM between the slow growing meristem and the fast growing organ. Because the epidermis is load-bearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dumais and Steele, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kutschera and Niklas, 2007</xref>), the boundary domain is characterized by a highly anisotropic mechanical stress; this mechanical stress controls microtubule orientation, which in turn channels growth direction and promotes tissue folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hamant et al., 2008</xref>). A contribution of mechanical stress in the polarity of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) was also proposed suggesting an indirect contribution of mechanical signals in auxin patterns and thus in organogenesis at the shoot apex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nakayama et al., 2012</xref>). While the genetic bases of meristem functions are now well documented, a link between these genetic regulators and mechanical signals remains to be identified in the SAM.</p><p>The homeodomain transcription factor SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) is a key regulator of meristem functions and its expression is often considered as the best marker of meristematic identity. In the shoot apical meristem, <italic>STM</italic> is expressed ubiquitously, with the exception of young primordia where it is down-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Long et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>STM</italic> promoter has previously been reported to be more active in the boundary domains of the SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Leasure et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jurkuta et al., 2009</xref>). In line with this observation, <italic>STM</italic> expression is regulated by several boundary specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aida et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borghi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takada et al., 2001</xref>), in part <italic>via</italic> auxin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aida et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Treml et al., 2005</xref>). Because the boundary domain is also a site under mechanical stress, we investigated whether such stresses could act as signals to control <italic>STM</italic> expression at the shoot apical meristem.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>STM</italic> promoter activity is quantitatively correlated to curvature at the meristem boundary</title><p>Because it is easily accessible, we focus our analysis on the shoot apical meristem (SAM) at inflorescence stage; the generated organs are thus floral meristems. We generated a transcriptional fusion <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> with the 5,7 kb region upstream of the <italic>STM</italic> gene (AT1G62360) and observed the presence of an enhanced <italic>STM</italic> promoter activity in the SAM boundaries, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Leasure et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jurkuta et al., 2009</xref>), n &gt; 20, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To further confirm this result, which was obtained in dissected meristems from greenhouse-grown plants, we also analyzed the CFP signal in meristems from NPA-treated in vitro grown seedlings.

To assess this quantitatively, we measured the Gaussian curvature of the boundary at different stages of development in parallel with CFP signal intensity. Existing quantification protocols were not adequate: the replica method for instance involves the application of dental resin to make a cast of the meristem (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kwiatkowska and Dumais, 2003</xref>) and this may impact gene expression; the image analysis software <italic>MorphoGraphX</italic> could provide a mesh surface together with gene expression levels, but some errors in the most curvy parts of the meristem could not be avoided. We thus implemented the level set method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sethian, 1999</xref>) in Python to detect the exact surface of the meristem: a suitable surface obtained by the thresholding of the image is evolved to the smooth surface that is the most accurate representation of the surface contrast in the 3D images. Second, <italic>MorphoGraphX</italic> was used to mesh the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kierzkowski et al., 2012</xref>), and to compute the Gaussian curvature taking into account neighborhoods within a 15 μm radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using this pipeline, a negative correlation between CFP signal intensity and Gaussian curvature could be revealed and quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). As a negative control, and using the same pipeline, no clear correlation between Gaussian curvature and CFP signal could be observed in a line expressing a transcriptional fusion <italic>pPDF1::CFP-N7</italic> that exhibits a relatively homogeneous signal in the whole meristem epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To test this correlation further, we also analyzed the expression pattern of <italic>STM</italic> in the <italic>pSTM::ALcR AlcA::GFP</italic> line (named hereafter <italic>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP)</italic> which contains 4.4 kb sequence upstream of the <italic>STM</italic> gene and has already been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Laufs et al., 2004</xref>). In this line, expression is restricted to boundaries, thus confirming the correlation between the GFP signal intensity and the extent of curvature at the boundary at least qualitatively (n &gt; 20, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The correlation could also be observed in meristems from NPA-grown seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this line, the signal was so clear-cut, that the total area of GFP expressing cells on longitudinal sections could be qualitatively correlated with the formation of a crease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To quantify this, we generated optical longitudinal section through the middle of each emerging primordia, measured the surface area of expression of <italic>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</italic> in these sections and plotted it against the angle of tissue folding at the same position (see Material and methods).

We reasoned that if <italic>STM</italic> promoter activity is truly correlated with curvature at the boundary, we should still be able to detect such correlation in the <italic>bot1-7</italic> mutant background, although with a delay in time. First, we measured the folding angle with respect to organ size in <italic>bot1-7</italic>. As expected, we observed a reduction in folding angle for a given primordium size in <italic>bot1-7</italic> when compared to the WT, demonstrating that the relation between tissue folding and organ emergence is impaired in <italic>bot1-7</italic>: large organs still have shallow boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,C</xref>). Next, we measured the GFP signal area in the boundaries of the <italic>bot1-7 pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</italic> line as described above.

Whereas <italic>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</italic> expression area was still correlated to tissue folding, we also observed a reduction in the area of GFP expression for a given primordium stage, when compared to the WT indicating a delay in <italic>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</italic> appearance in <italic>bot1-7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, WT: n = 154 measured on 5 meristems at 5 time points; <italic>bot1-7</italic>: n = 79 measured on 4 meristems at 5 time points). Therefore, modifying the shape of the SAM in <italic>bot1-7</italic> did not abolish the correlation between <italic>STM</italic> promoter activity and curvature, and instead demonstrated that <italic>STM</italic> promoter activity scales to Gaussian curvature values even when the relation between organ size and boundary shape is affected. Based on these results, <italic>STM</italic> promoter activity can thus be considered as a read-out of the extent of folding in the boundary of the SAM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary is required for organ separation</title><p>Even though we find a correlation between <italic>STM</italic> expression and tissue folding, it is not clear whether <italic>STM</italic> promoter activity at the boundary using a reporter line truly recapitulates <italic>STM</italic> expression in the SAM.</p><p>To check this, we first crossed the strong <italic>stm</italic> mutant allele <italic>stm-dgh6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aida et al., 2002</xref>) with a previously described <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> line, whose expression is enhanced in boundaries, as observed in our transcriptional marker lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Besnard et al., 2014;</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The <italic>stm-dgh6</italic> mutant exhibits the typical <italic>stm</italic> phenotype with two partly fused cotyledons, at an angle divergent from 180°, and a development arrest. At the same stage, the WT can exhibit up to 8 leaves while the <italic>stm-dgh6  </italic>only displays two old cotyledons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). As observed in other strong <italic>stm</italic> alleles, <italic>stm-dgh6</italic> was able in rare cases to reinitiate organogenesis and generate a lot of vegetative tissues. In our growth conditions, we found that roughly 1out of 30 <italic>stm-dgh6</italic> plants managed to grow beyond the cotyledon stage: these plants generated many whorled leaves and a few sterile flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To test whether <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> can complement the <italic>stm-dgh6</italic> phenotype, we selected 96 plants homozygous for the <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> construct and segregating the <italic>stm-dgh6</italic> mutation. After genotyping for the presence of the <italic>stm-dgh6</italic> mutation, we could not distinguish the WT, <italic>stm-dgh6</italic> heterozygotes and <italic>stm-dgh6</italic> homozygote plants visually, confirming that <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> can fully complement the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, we checked that STM-Venus was expressed in the <italic>stm-dgh6</italic> homozygote background by confocal microscopy. We found that the signal was comparable to that of <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> in a WT background, notably with an enhanced signal in boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In a few plants, we also observed larger stems and meristems, suggesting that <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> expression level might be slightly higher than that of the endogenous gene. These results demonstrate that higher <italic>STM</italic> promoter activity at the boundary in the marker lines reflects the endogenous <italic>STM</italic> expression pattern.

Genetic evidence suggests that, in addition to its role in meristem maintenance, <italic>STM</italic> also contributes to organ separation in the meristem, in conjunction with other boundary expressed genes, such as <italic>CUC, KNAT6, JLO</italic> and <italic>LOF</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aida et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belles-Boix et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Spinelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borghi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aida et al., 1999</xref>). Lack of STM activity can generate organ fusions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Endrizzi et al., 1996</xref>) and can enhance the fusion phenotype of <italic>cuc1</italic> and <italic>cuc2</italic> mutant seedlings, revealing a role of <italic>STM</italic> in boundary formation during the early stages of embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aida et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2002</xref>). This function also involves the <italic>STM</italic> paralog <italic>KNAT6</italic> gene, which is expressed in the boundary domain of the meristem in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belles-Boix et al., 2006</xref>). Based on this literature, the expression of <italic>STM</italic> at the boundary is generally thought to control organ separation, but this has not been formally demonstrated.</p><p>To address this hypothesis, we generated lines expressing an artificial microRNA (amiRNA) against <italic>STM</italic> under the control of the <italic>STM</italic> promoter. In these lines, <italic>STM</italic> expression level was not always negatively correlated to <italic>STM</italic> amiRNA expression level; yet, <italic>STM</italic> expression was down-regulated in all the lines we analyzed showing that this amiRNA can effectively inactivate <italic>STM</italic> to some extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given the expression pattern in the <italic>STM</italic> transcriptional marker lines, we reasoned that in these lines, we should primarily inactivate <italic>STM</italic> in the boundaries and to a lesser extent in the rest of the meristem. To test whether the amiRNA was effective at downregulating <italic>STM</italic> mRNA accumulation in boundaries, we introgressed the <italic>pSTM::STMamiRNA</italic> in the <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> lines. As expected, the STM-Venus signal was slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) or more strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) at the boundary, leading to a homogeneous STM-Venus signal in the meristem. Although meristem size was affected in these lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and K</xref>), meristem termination defects were rare when compared to <italic>stm</italic> mutants. In particular, many normal and fertile flowers were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). We also observed that Gaussian curvature in the boundaries did not scale to meristem size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Strikingly, major fusion defects were observed in most of the lines we generated, thus showing that organ separation was impaired in these lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). The presence of wide boundaries (relative to meristem size) together with a reduction in meristem size that brings adjacent boundaries next to one another, may cause such fusion events. Because the fusions are revealed much later in development, we cannot completely exclude other scenarios. Note that <italic>STM</italic> mRNA, protein or amiRNA can move between non-boundary cells and boundary cells. Yet, as a negative impact of the amiRNA on STM-Venus signal could be detected at the boundary, these data rather confirm that <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary has functional implications and further support its role in organ separation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Auxin depletion is not absolutely required for <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary</title><p>The fact that <italic>STM</italic> expression correlates with curvature at the boundary can simply be explained by the fact that STM reduces the growth rate at the boundary, leading to tissue folding. <italic>KNOX</italic> genes can cause alterations in curvature in otherwise smooth surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Long and Barton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barkoulas et al., 2008</xref>). The impact of STM on crease formation at the boundary could be mediated by inhibiting cell growth in this domain. Consistent with this scenario, <italic>KNOX</italic> target genes include genes involved in auxin transport as well as genes involved in cell wall synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bolduc et al., 2012</xref>). Given the strong correlation between <italic>STM</italic> promoter activity and tissue folding, we investigated whether a signal related to curvature could add robustness to the <italic>STM</italic> expression pattern at the boundary.</p><p>The plant hormone auxin could play such a role. A local auxin peak is one of the earliest marker of organ initiation, and conversely auxin depletion is an early marker of the boundary domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Reuille et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reinhardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>). As auxin keeps accumulating in the organ, outgrowth goes on and curvature at the boundary increases. Interestingly, auxin and KNOX proteins are known to act antagonistically. Disrupting auxin transport with NPA or in <italic>pin1</italic> and <italic>pid</italic> mutant enhances class I <italic>KNOX</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scanlon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Furutani et al., 2004</xref>). Conversely, <italic>KNAT1</italic> inactivation can partially rescue the leaf number defects in <italic>pin1</italic>, suggesting that the auxin signaling pathway also promotes organ emergence by repressing the expression of <italic>KNOX</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hay et al., 2006</xref>). In the boundary, the PIN1-dependent auxin minimum was also shown to promote axillary meristem formation whereas ectopic auxin production in the boundary inhibits axillary meristem formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). This is further consolidated by the analysis of the DII-Venus auxin sensor, which is degraded in the presence of auxin and exhibits a strong signal at the boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brunoud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vernoux et al., 2011</xref>).

If this scenario were true, the application of exogenous auxin should thus inhibit <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary. To test this hypothesis, we applied the synthetic auxin 2,4-D onto the meristem and observed the expression of <italic>STM</italic>. As expected, DII-Venus levels were dramatically decreased in these conditions ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brunoud et al., 2012</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), confirming that auxin could indeed diffuse into the meristem. In the same conditions, <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary was however either unchanged or even slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that, whereas auxin levels negatively correlate with <italic>STM</italic> expression in the meristem, this correlation is also dispensable: <italic>STM</italic> expression and auxin depletion can be uncoupled at the boundary. This also shows that the relation between auxin and <italic>STM</italic> expression is more complex. Next we investigated whether the involvement of mechanical signals in <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary could help clarify these discrepancies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>STM</italic> expression is induced by mechanical stress</title><p>There is growing evidence that mechanical stresses act as instructive signals in parallel to biochemical signals in development. These stresses have notably been involved in the progression of gastrulation in Drosophila embryos (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Farge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</xref>) or in the formation of leaves with ruffled edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Audoly and Boudaoud, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nath et al., 2003</xref>). In the meristem, the boundary separates a fast growing organ from the slow growing meristem. Mechanical stresses thus emerge early on from differential growth in the boundary and have been shown to act as instructive signals controlling the behavior of cortical microtubules and PIN1 early on. In turn, this promotes tissue folding that further reinforces the stress pattern at the boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hamant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>). We thus explored a scenario in which mechanical stress may be sufficient to induce and reinforce <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary. To do so, we investigated whether mechanical perturbations can trigger <italic>STM</italic> expression.</p><p>Note that mechanical perturbations can be of different nature. Mechanical perturbations induced by wind or touch, are extrinsic and discontinuous; they cause short-term elastic deformations (e.g. transient bending). They can impact gene expression within minutes and induce major developmental responses such as stem thickening, when repeated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Braam and Davis, 1990</xref>). In the context of meristem growth, mechanical (tensile) stresses are in contrast intrinsic and continuous, and they cause long-term plastic responses (growth). The origin of such growth-related stresses lies in the presence of high turgor pressure rather than external stimuli. The opposition between these two kind of stresses can be illustrated with the microtubule response: transient pinching does not lead to supracellular microtubule alignments in the meristem, and this has even served as a negative control for the microtubule response to ablations in this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hamant et al., 2008</xref>). Nonetheless we cannot exclude the possibility that some elements of the mechanotransduction pathways are shared between these two types of mechanical signals. Here, given our correlation between <italic>STM</italic> expression and crease formation at the boundary, we designed our mechanical tests to check whether <italic>STM</italic> expression can be modified by continuous mechanical perturbations.</p><p>First, we modified the mechanical stress pattern in the SAM using compressions or ablations and we followed the impact on the <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> and <italic>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</italic> expression patterns. Note that in all these experiments, we used in vitro-grown plants with a naked meristem recovering from a NPA treatment, as plants from the greenhouse need to be dissected to access the SAM, and the wounds may interfere with the mechanical perturbations. Using a microvice, we first induced global compression of the SAM. This is predicted to increase tension in the epidermis, and in the most extreme cases, to induce a bias in maximal stress direction parallel to the blades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hamant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Uyttewaal et al., 2012</xref>]<bold>)</bold>. Around 8 h after compression, we detected an increase of <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> signal (n = 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

Strikingly, we observed a local increase of <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> signal intensity around the ablation site from t = 18 h onwards (n = 16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).

Even though this method is only semi-quantitative, we could detect an asymmetric signal, with a higher intensity near the ablation site, consistent with the results obtained with the <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> and <italic>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</italic> lines after ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, n = 9). Note that ablation may also provide increased accessibility to the probe. Last, to check whether <italic>STM</italic> expression would be enhanced by wound-induced jasmonate production, we incubated shoot apices with 100 μM jasmonate over night. In these conditions, we did not observe any significant induction of <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> signal in most of the plants (N = 10/14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), and slight fluctuations in CFP signal in the remaining ones (N = 4/14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Based on these results, we cannot rule out completely that jasmonate interferes with <italic>STM</italic> expression. Yet, as this contrasts with the systematic and steady induction of <italic>STM</italic> after ablation and with the robust induction of a <italic>pJAZ10::GUS</italic> reporter by jasmonate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L-O</xref>), wound-induced jasmonate is not the most likely candidate as a secondary messenger between stress and <italic>STM</italic> induction.</p><p>To further confirm an induction of <italic>STM</italic> expression by mechanical signals, we next modified the mechanical stress level using isoxaben treatments. Isoxaben is a well-known inhibitor of cellulose synthesis; after treatment, walls become mechanically weaker, and thus tensile stress increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Uyttewaal et al., 2012</xref>). In these conditions, we could detect a global increase in <italic>pSTM-CFP-N7</italic> signal intensity, when compared to that of the control (measurement on 10 nucleus of the central zone in the control (n = 6 meristems) and isoxaben-treated (n = 7 meristems); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). This response was also confirmed in the <italic>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</italic> background (control: n = 10, isoxaben: n = 20; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Note that <italic>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</italic> was not induced in the entire meristem after isoxaben treatment, further demonstrating that mechanical perturbations cannot override the prepattern in the SAM. Because these different experimental setups have little in common except mechanical stress perturbation, we thus propose that <italic>STM</italic> expression can indeed be modulated by mechanical stress in the SAM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Boundary expressed genes are not systematically induced after mechanical perturbations</title><p>One may wonder whether such artificial mechanical perturbations could induce the expression of all meristematic genes, and in particular other boundary-expressed genes, as a non-specific stress response.

As detailed expression data were lacking in the meristem, we first analyzed the activity of the <italic>PID</italic> promoter. We generated a <italic>pPID::CFP-N7</italic> line and observed a pattern that somewhat echoes that of <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic>. In particular, the CFP signal was detected in the entire meristem and was enhanced in the boundary domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

As ablations are also inducing other signals than mechanical signals, such a test is not sufficient to know whether a gene is induced by mechanical stress. Yet, induction after wounding is a necessary condition for a gene to respond to mechanical perturbation and thus this simple test can help to identify genes whose expression is insensitive to mechanical stress.</p><p><italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC3</italic> belong to the NAC family of transcription factors and are two well-known regulators of boundary function at the shoot apical meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aida and Tasaka, 2006</xref>). Note that in contrast to <italic>CUC3</italic> for which a transcriptional fusion is sufficient to recapitulate boundary expression, <italic>CUC1</italic> expression is restricted to the boundary <italic>via</italic> the post-transcriptional action of miR164, and thus strict boundary expression of <italic>CUC1</italic> can only be observed in a translational fusion line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sieber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Laufs et al., 2004</xref>). After ablations, no significant induction could be observed in the <italic>pCUC1::CUC1-GFP</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; n = 11). For instance, when comparing the time points before and 24 h after ablations, GFP signal intensities were roughly identical and the GFP pattern could not be easily related to the wound position or shape. Later on, as the meristem recovered from the wound, new boundaries were initiated in which new GFP signal could be observed, again with no relation to the ablation position or shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Sometimes, the new CUC1-GFP signal even formed a line perpendicular to the wound edge, corresponding to the initiation of the boundary of following organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, bottom panels), in contrast to <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> and <italic>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</italic> induction that always appear and further consolidates along the wound edge. In other words, the cycle of <italic>CUC1</italic> induction at the boundary went on largely undisturbed, independent of the presence of a neighboring ablation. Altogether, this strongly suggests that <italic>CUC1</italic> expression at the boundary is also not controlled by a mechanical signal.</p><p>The response of the <italic>pCUC3::CFP</italic> line to ablation was completely different than that of the <italic>pCUC1::CUC1-GFP</italic> line. In the <italic>pCUC3::CFP</italic> line, we observed a strong and steady induction of CFP signal after ablation in all the analyzed meristems (n = 20). Interestingly, this induction seemed to appear earlier than in the <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> line, as a strong induction could be detected as early as t = 6 hr after ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Although these data may suggest that <italic>CUC3</italic> expression is controlled by a mechanical signal, further tests would be required to reach such a conclusion. Nonetheless this demonstrates that boundary expressed transcription factors, even from the same family, are not systematically induced by wounding and, thus, that the mechanical induction of <italic>STM</italic> retains some specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>STM</italic> induction after mechanical perturbations can be partly uncoupled from PIN1-dependent auxin distribution</title><p>Another issue raised by our mechanical perturbations is the relatively long time responses (8 to 24 hr) for <italic>STM</italic> to be induced. While this is consistent with the relatively slow timing of organ emergence and boundary folding in Arabidopsis meristems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kwiatkowska, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reddy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grandjean et al., 2004</xref>), it strongly suggests that the induction of <italic>STM</italic> expression after mechanical perturbations is indirect and could involve secondary signals, such as hormones. In line with this hypothesis, mechanical signals in animal development have all been shown to interfere with established biochemical signal transduction pathways (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Janmey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jaalouk and Lammerding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Orr et al., 2006</xref>]). Auxin signaling could again play such a role at the boundary, as the polarity of the auxin efflux carrier PIN1 depends in part on membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nakayama et al., 2012</xref>). Based on these data, a scenario emerges where mechanical stress would control PIN1 localization at the boundary, which in turn would locally deplete this domain from auxin, leading to a local induction of <italic>STM</italic> expression. Although our previous results suggest that <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary does not solely rely on auxin depletion (based on a global auxin treatment, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>), it does not formally exclude the possibility that the contribution of mechanical stress in <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary is mediated by local auxin gradients. In other words, whether mechanical stress impacts <italic>STM</italic> expression independently of the response of PIN1 to mechanical stress is unknown.</p><p>First, we checked whether mechanical stress can affect the distribution of auxin in the SAM. To do so, we performed a series of ablations on meristems expressing the DII-Venus sensor. Such treatments induce a local reorientation of PIN1 around the ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>), i.e. parallel to the new stress pattern, and should lead to the local depletion of auxin. After ablation and despite some variability in the basal level of DII<italic>-</italic>Venus signal on meristems recovering from NPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), we indeed consistently observed an induction of DII-Venus signal around the site of ablation (n = 21; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). Interestingly, the first effect of mechanical stress on DII-Venus signal was detected around 4 to 8 h after ablation, which is consistent with the timing of the response of PIN1 after ablation (ca. 4 hr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>]) and the subsequent response of <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> after mechanical perturbation (8 to 18 hr after compression or ablation respectively, this study). The DII-Venus signal was also induced after compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) further matching the response observed in the <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> line. Altogether, this suggests that auxin patterns and mechanical stress fields act synergistically to control <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07811.026</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title><italic>STM</italic> response to mechanical perturbations can be uncoupled from PIN1-dependent auxin distribution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time lapse of representative meristems from a NPA-grown plant and expressing DII-Venus.

First, we analyzed the DII-Venus signal in the <italic>pin1-6</italic> background. Although polar auxin transport in the meristem is largely inhibited, this mutant can generate bulges and sometimes ill-shaped flowers suggesting that compensatory mechanisms can be induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Okada et al., 1991</xref>]). Because some degree of organogenesis is present in the <italic>pin1</italic> mutant, this allowed us to observe boundary formation in this background. To distinguish this form of organogenesis from what we observed in the WT, we use the word 'pseudo-boundary' in <italic>pin1-6</italic>. Despite the variability in DII-Venus signal in the <italic>pin1-6</italic> meristems, we could not detect any DII-Venus signal in <italic>pin1-6</italic> pseudo-boundaries, suggesting that <italic>PIN1</italic> is necessary to deplete auxin from the boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, n = 6). Interestingly, both <italic>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</italic> and <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> signals were present in the <italic>pin1-6</italic> pseudo-boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>), thus suggesting that PIN1 is not a major player in the correlation between tissue folding and <italic>STM</italic> expression.</p><p>To further confirm this result, we performed mechanical perturbations in the <italic>pin1-6 DII-Venus pSTM:CFP-N7</italic> background. No significant induction of DII-Venus signal could be detected after ablation in <italic>pin1-6</italic> demonstrating that auxin depletion after ablation mainly relies on PIN1 (n = 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, both <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> and <italic>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</italic> were systematically induced around the site of ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1 fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and 2</xref>). This demonstrates that the induction of <italic>STM</italic> after ablation can occur independently of PIN1. While we cannot rule out the possibility that other auxin carriers substitute for <italic>PIN1</italic> in the <italic>pin1</italic> background, despite our efforts, the induction of <italic>STM</italic> around the ablation site could not be clearly correlated with DII-Venus signal intensity, suggesting that the induction of <italic>STM</italic> after an ablation is not primarily caused by a local reduction in auxin levels. In other words, <italic>STM</italic> expression and auxin distribution can be partially uncoupled and the correlation between tissue folding and <italic>STM</italic> expression always remains.</p><p>Last, we used a recently developed protocol in which tissue folding is triggered by the local application of the microtubule depolymerizing drug oryzalin, in the presence of the auxin transport inhibitor NPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sassi et al., 2014</xref>). In these conditions, a lateral outgrowth can be induced at the periphery of the meristem, mimicking the first stages of organ emergence. In both the <italic>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</italic> and <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> lines, oryzalin-triggered tissue folding led to a slight increase of GFP and CFP signals respectively, in the young boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Because this induction occurred in the presence of NPA and as oryzalin indirectly modifies the mechanical status of cell walls (and thus promotes organ emergence), this further supports a scenario in which mechanical stress can promote the expression of <italic>STM</italic> at the boundary, relatively independently of auxin distribution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Because tissue folding is generally associated with the presence of high mechanical stress levels, crease formation is a unique event in development where the biochemical regulation of morphogenesis may also involve a strong contribution of mechanical signals. For instance, the patterning genes <italic>Twist</italic> and <italic>Notail</italic> are induced by the deformation of the embryo during gastrulation and epiboly in Drosophila and Zebrafish embryos respectively, through the activation of the β-catenin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Farge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Desprat et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that shape changes are not only the result of biochemical regulation, but are also the source of mechanical signals that further channel morphogenesis <italic>via</italic> the control of gene expression. Our observations are in line with these conclusions: we report that the expression of <italic>STM</italic> at the boundary of the shoot apical meristem is correlated with tissue folding and is increased by mechanical stress. This provides a scenario in which biochemical factors, such as auxin, promote differential growth and shape changes in the meristem, which in turn, generate mechanical signals that can impact the expression of some of these regulators.</p><p>Incidentally, our work also echoes results from Drosophila embryo where tension lines acting as genetic and mechanical boundaries have been revealed in the wing disk and shown to compartment cell identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aliee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Landsberg et al., 2009</xref>). Here we show that mechanical stress at the boundary contributes to the local expression of <italic>STM</italic> that is in turn necessary for the separation between organs. Note that tensile stress at the meristem boundary becomes anisotropic before tissue folds, as maximal stress direction is first prescribed by differential growth. In this respect, our results might thus be extended to other tissues like leaves or embryo, where the induction of <italic>KNOX</italic> genes would be related to differential growth, and thus stress, before tissue folding.</p><p>Beyond organ separation, the boundary has many other functions. In particular, it is the site where new meristems, called axillary meristems, can be initiated. Interestingly, overexpression of class I <italic>KNOX</italic> genes is sufficient to induce ectopic meristems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chuck et al., 1996</xref>). The boundary also plays a crucial role in plant architecture: this is where auxin is redistributed from the adjacent neighboring organ to the meristematic pool where new organs or new axis need to be initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reinhardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Reuille et al., 2006</xref>). The central role of the meristem boundary in plants largely explains why this domain has received considerable attention over the past decades, albeit from a molecular genetics point of view mainly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aida and Tasaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tian et al., 2014</xref>). The role of mechanical stress in the function and regulation of the boundary domain of the meristem opens the possibility that other functions than organ separation are influenced by mechanical signals.</p><p>Another question raised in this work is that of the coordination between mechanical and biochemical signals to control development. In animals, well-known elements of biochemical-based transduction pathways are involved in mechanotransduction. For instance, integrin, β-catenin or YAP/TAZ are all involved in transducing mechanical signals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Janmey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jaalouk and Lammerding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Orr et al., 2006</xref>). Such intermingling raises the question of whether these signals can really be uncoupled with one another and this may even question the added value of mechanical signals in development. This is what we touched upon by analyzing the coordination between the plant hormone auxin and mechanical stress in the meristem. While we provide further evidence supporting a strong coordination between <italic>STM</italic> expression and auxin depletion, we also found that the response to mechanical stress can uncouple them. In particular, mechanical perturbations induce <italic>STM</italic> expression even when auxin transport or level is affected. In addition, mechanical stress does not seem to impact the expression of <italic>PINOID</italic>, which has been associated with the control of PIN1 polarity and thus auxin patterns in the meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robert and Offringa, 2008</xref>). This is thus a case where two redundant signalling pathways act relatively independently to control the same morphogenetic event. We propose that the absence of a strict coupling between auxin depletion and mechanical stress is a way to add robustness in meristem functions at the boundary. Incidentally, this highlights the added value of mechanical signals in this domain.</p><p>Alternative cues may be involved in the promotion of <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary. In addition to auxin, <italic>STM</italic> has been associated with the homeostasis of cytokinins, gibberellins and ethylene. Activation of <italic>STM</italic> promotes the expression of the cytokinin biosynthesis gene <italic>AtIPT7</italic> and cytokinin response factor <italic>ARR5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yanai et al., 2005</xref>). Conversely, overproduction or application of cytokinins increase the expression level of <italic>STM</italic> and can rescue weak <italic>stm</italic> mutant alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rupp et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jasinski et al., 2005</xref>). This interaction with cytokinins is largely shared among the different class I <italic>KNOX</italic> genes and, consistently, it has been shown that <italic>KNAT1</italic> and <italic>KNAT6</italic> display redundant functions with <italic>STM</italic>. Interestingly, the level of cytokinins has been predicted to increase in the boundary, based on the cytokinin activity reporter pTCS signal, and axillary meristem formation has been shown to require cytokinin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), consistent with the well-known bushy phenotypes of cytokinin overproducers. Temporally, this cytokinin burst would follow the initial reduction in auxin level at the boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Thus cytokinin, in parallel to and after auxin depletion, may very well contribute to <italic>STM</italic> induction at the boundary. Class I KNOX proteins also reduce gibberellins levels, notably through a direct repression of the GA-20 oxidase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sakamoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2004</xref>); conversely gibberellins can rescue the phenotype of KNOX overexpressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hay et al., 2002</xref>). The induction of the gibberellin catabolism gene GA-2 oxidase was also shown to depend on KNOX proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jasinski et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>While both cytokinins and gibberellins are tightly linked to class I KNOX gene expression, the potential interplay with mechanical stress has not been explored. In contrast, other hormones, such as ethylene, have been associated to the plant response to many stresses. Interestingly, ethylene restricts the expression of class I KNOX gene <italic>KNAT2</italic> in the shoot meristem to the boundary domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hamant et al., 2002</xref>). Note however that the exact contribution of ethylene in mechanoperception remains debated. For instance, while touch can induce ethylene synthesis, ethylene response mutants still display thigmomorphogenesis in response to touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chehab et al., 2012</xref>); touch-induced thigmomorphogenesis rather depends on jasmonate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chehab et al., 2012</xref>). While certain hormones are rather associated with repetitive elastic deformations (like touch or wind), others are involved in continuous plastic deformations (i.e. growth and shape changes), these may be better candidates for the regulation of <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary.</p><p>More generally, and as auxin does not seem to act as a secondary messenger of mechanical signals for <italic>STM</italic> expression, another exciting prospect for this work will be to identify the elements of the mechanotransduction pathway acting on <italic>STM</italic> at the boundary. The current dissection of the gene regulatory network acting at the boundary (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tian et al., 2014</xref>]) should help us weigh the putative contributions of these biochemical factors in transducing mechanical signals at the SAM in the future.</p><p>As illustrated in the art of origami, folding can in principle generate the widest diversity of shapes from simple inputs. In the past decades, there has been tremendous progress in the identification of genes that trigger such events in all living organisms. The robustness of such a complex regulation is often thought to rely on redundancy between different molecular pathways. Here we have investigated whether the shape itself, and its associated mechanics, interferes with gene expression and channels morphogenesis by constraining the possible outputs of the gene regulatory network. If generalized, such a dialog between gene and form could help us understand how reproducible shapes can emerge from a complex gene regulatory network that is susceptible to noise. Because of its essential function in morphogenesis and its impact on developmental robustness, this 'shape to gene' feedback may also have far reaching implications in evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant lines and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP, DII-Venus, pin1-6, stm-dgh6</italic> lines were already described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brunoud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vernoux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Laufs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vernoux et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aida et al., 2002</xref>).

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled &quot;Mechanical stress channels <italic>STM</italic> expression in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> meristem&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor), a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and three reviewers, one of whom, Gabriel Monshausen (Reviewer 3), has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>We are in principle interested in the work, but the reviewers have also identified a series of concerns. Below you can find the individual comments of the three reviewers, and we would like to ask you to address them point-by-point.</p><p>In the discussions between the reviewers and editors, a few key points emerged. Please pay particular attention to these:</p><p>1) A key aspect of your paper is your claim that <italic>STM</italic> expression is mechanosensitive. However, given the considerable lag between the mechanical insult and the change in <italic>STM</italic> expression, the reviewers feel that alternative interpretations are still valid and the claim that the <italic>STM</italic> promoter is mechanosensitive is overstated. We would therefore like to ask you to perform a more comprehensive analysis to strengthen your idea. For example, how does <italic>STM</italic> expression react to transient mechanical stimuli, such as pinching? Moreover, we would like to ask you to perform experiments to exclude the possibility that the observed expression changes are due to a wounding response. Analysis of <italic>STM</italic> expression upon local jasmonate application is one experiment that can be helpful here. Demonstrating that the behavior of the <italic>STM</italic> reporter is unchanged in the JA signaling mutant <italic>coi1</italic> would be another option. (We are aware that others have suggested that JA may be involved in thigmotropism, but it appears that those effects are probably rather indirect).</p><p>2) There are some questions about the specificity of your observations. If there is indeed causality linking mechanical stress and <italic>STM</italic> expression rather than correlation only, one could expect that this does not hold for any gene expressed in the boundary region. Performing the key experiments with other genes that are expressed in the boundary region could answer this question. Such control experiments should focus on other transcriptions factors.</p><p>3) Please also carefully address some technical issues.

These experiments would unequivocally demonstrate that the observed CFP induction is not an artifact of the reporter.</p><p>2) The boundary phenotype in the <italic>pSTM::STM</italic> rescue and <italic>amiRNA</italic> silencing plants is not documented properly. To be able to judge the phenotypes, we need SAM microscopy and curvature measurements. The pictures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are not very informative with regards to the boundary effect, rather they show overall growth habitus.</p><p>3) The boundary specific silencing supposed to be happening in the <italic>amiRNA</italic> lines is not documented.

From the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> it seems that the first effects become visible only after around 20 hours. Please comment.</p><p>5) The authors routinely refer to &quot;<italic>STM</italic> expression&quot; when they are talking about <italic>pSTM::CFP</italic> reporter activity. Please be more careful with wording.</p><p>6) The claim that <italic>STM</italic> reporter expression is much higher after removal of NPA is not substantiated by the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic>This interesting manuscript by Hamant and coworkers addresses the question of how the expression of <italic>STM</italic>, a key regulator of the shoot apical meristem also required for organ separation, is regulated. This is an important biological problem, which is explored by the authors using a range of sophisticated imaging, image processing and genetic tools. Overall this manuscript is very well written and the data provide strong experimental support for a role of mechanical stress in controlling <italic>STM</italic> expression patterns.</p><p>1) To analyze the relationship between mechanical stress, and more specifically Gaussian curvature, and <italic>STM</italic> expression, the authors mapped meristem curvature at high resolution and projected this onto a map of <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> expression. These experiments convincingly show that negative Gaussian curvature is correlated with enhanced <italic>STM</italic> expression in the boundary domain of the SAM.</p><p>2) The authors further analyze whether <italic>STM</italic> expression in the boundary is functionally important for organ separation during development. To this end, <italic>STM-Venus</italic> preferentially expressed in the boundary was introduced into a strong <italic>STM</italic> mutant (<italic>dgh6</italic>). The resulting transgenic lines exhibited only a partial recovery of meristem maintenance but a complete loss of organ fusion defects. <italic>pSTM::STMamiRNA2</italic> was introduced into WT to preferentially silence <italic>STM</italic> expression in the meristem boundary. This resulted in reduced, but functional meristems, and major organ fusions.</p><p>These are creative attempts to specifically alter <italic>STM</italic> expression in the boundary region; however, no evidence is presented to actually confirm that such preferential alteration has actually occurred. It would have been informative to show the expression pattern of <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> not only in a WT background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) but in the <italic>dgh6</italic> mutant line, as the expression pattern of the weakly expressing WT parent line (Heisler et al. 2005a) may not necessarily have been maintained after crossing. Similarly, it would be useful to know whether <italic>STM</italic> expression is preferentially silenced in the boundary in <italic>pSTM::STMamiRNA2</italic> lines. Transformation of the constructs into <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> lines would have been informative. If these experiments are not done, the limitations should at least be discussed.</p><p>3) The authors convincingly demonstrate that enhanced <italic>STM</italic> expression in the boundary is correlated with but not dependent on local auxin depletion. Treatment with 2,4-D globally increased auxin levels in the SAM (as monitored using DII-Venus) but did not alter the pattern of <italic>STM</italic> expression (although slightly increasing the intensity of <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> expression).</p><p>One question this experiment raised for me was whether 24 hour incubation with 2,4-D altered meristem organization in any noticeable manner, i.e. were Gaussian curvatures in the boundaries affected by the treatment? According to the authors' model, this should have affected <italic>STM</italic> expression.</p><p>4) The authors provide strong evidence that mechanical perturbations (compression of meristem and local cell ablation) and pharmacological treatments resulting in altered mechanical stress (isoxaben, NPA+oryzalin) resulted in increased <italic>STM</italic> expression. Based on the authors' initial experiments, <italic>STM</italic> expression was correlated with negative Gaussian curvature. Does this relationship hold when the SAM is perturbed by the various treatments described here? This analysis could greatly strengthen the concept that <italic>STM</italic> expression is regulated by a specific type of mechanical stress.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mechanical stress channels <italic>STM</italic> expression in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> meristem&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers, one of whom, Gabriel Monshausen (Reviewer 3), has agreed to share his identity. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>All reviewers and the editors agree that your work is interesting and original, but as you can see from their comments, the reviewers still have some questions about the causality relations put forward in your study. Yet, there is also consensus that this is a hard chicken-and-egg type of problem, and a completely unambiguous answer is hard to come by with current means. Although things might turn out somewhat different in the long run, your study presents one of the best ways forward into this area for the moment, and is likely to stimulate further research. In light of this, we believe that it would be in your own interest to be very careful how you phrase your conclusions. Please go once more through your manuscript and tone down any strong statements with respect to situations that entail a possibly circular logic. In that respect, please pay particular attention to the comments of reviewer 1.</p><p>Please also clarify the following: there is some doubts whether the experiments show jasmonate insensitivity of <italic>STM</italic> expression as stated in the text. In the supplemental figure, there is clear <italic>STM</italic> expression increase that does not occur in any of the mock treated samples. It thus appears simply wrong to say it is insensitive, and these results should not be &quot;hidden&quot; in the supporting information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> This paper presents several interesting observations. My problem with the paper – even after the changes and in some cases even more so after the authors' additions – is that the authors shoehorn their observations into a model in which mechanical stress increases <italic>STM</italic> expression.</p><p>In the body of the paper, the authors include alternative explanations for the correlation such as in this paragraph:</p><p>&quot;The fact that <italic>STM</italic> expression correlates with curvature at the boundary can simply be explained by the fact that <italic>STM</italic> reduces the growth rate at the boundary, leading to tissue folding. <italic>KNOX</italic> genes can cause alterations in curvature in otherwise smooth surface (Long and Barton, 1998, Barkoulas et al., 2008). The impact of <italic>STM</italic> on crease formation at the boundary could be mediated by inhibiting cell growth in this domain. Consistent with this scenario, KNOX target genes include genes involved in auxin transport as well as genes involved in cell wall synthesis (Bolduc et al., 2012). However the strong correlation between <italic>STM</italic> promoter activity and tissue folding suggests that a signal, which is related to curvature, could add robustness to the <italic>STM</italic> expression pattern at the boundary.&quot;</p><p>Why would a strong correlation lead one to prefer one direction of causality over the other? We know that <italic>STM/KNOX</italic> expression exists in the absence of tissue folding and also precedes tissue folding in the embryo, and precedes tissue folding in the development of leaf lobing. To my knowledge, there is no case of tissue folding that precedes <italic>STM/KNOX</italic> expression. Of all the treatments that the authors subject the plants to, pinching would seem to best simulate folding but pinching the meristem does not increase <italic>STM</italic> expression. This argues strongly for the arrow of causation to be in the direction counter to what the authors propose. (The authors make arguments about how pinching is somehow different than the stresses that would normally be sensed by <italic>STM</italic> but I am not convinced.)</p><p>Whatever the reality may be, in this paper alternative interpretations are downplayed. There is no mention of alternative models in the Discussion and the title is overly strong in its assertion given the weak, and by the authors' own admission, indirect, connection between physical stress and <italic>STM</italic> expression.</p><p>Unfortunately, without the framework of mechanical stress acting to increase <italic>STM</italic>, the experiments presented in this paper lack cohesion.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>1) The authors shore up their complementation data. They have now used PCR to genotype homozygous <italic>stm/stm; pSTM::STM-Venus/pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> double mutants segregating from among the progeny of <italic>stm/+ pSTM::STM-Venus/pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> parents. It would have been more convincing if they had recovered a fertile double homozygote but if the PCR data are compelling, then they likely have identified complemented individuals. (Unfortunately, the PCR data aren't shown. I would be worried about using the presence/absence of a 2.6 kb band for determining the presence of the wild type allele as lack of a band can be due to simple PCR failure. Presumably the authors have adequately controlled for this.)</p><p>2) The authors have added a test for response of <italic>STM</italic> expression to jasmonate, a hormone associated with wounding stress. This is an experiment to determine whether the response of <italic>STM</italic> expression to ablation might be in response to wounding. The data are given in the supplemental section (Figure 5–figure supplement 3). Most plants do not respond – however a significant fraction, 4 out of the 20 or so plants tested, <italic>did</italic> show an increase in <italic>STM</italic> expression in response to jasmonate. The authors dismiss this positive result as unimportant but I am not sure what the basis for their dismissal is.</p><p>(I can easily envision an entirely different historical scenario for these experiments that would lead to a different set of conclusions: A set of jasmonate researchers could have reasonably concluded that applied jasmonate can increase <italic>STM</italic> expression. They would then have followed up that observation with ablation experiments on the meristem finding that <italic>STM</italic> expression increased in response to wounding.)</p><p>In short, the jasmonate experiments indicate that the situation is likely to be complex. Rather than sweeping this complexity under the rug, the authors should discuss it.</p><p>3) The authors add data for other boundary-expressed genes and find that one – <italic>CUC3</italic>, but not the other, <italic>CUC1</italic>, respond to ablation with increased expression. This is very interesting but I am not entirely sure what to make of it. Again, it reinforces the conclusion that the situation is complex.</p><p>(I would add here as well that these experiments are done in NPA treated meristems and therefore the results hold for a context in which auxin is improperly localized. Since there is reason to believe that auxin and <italic>KNOX</italic> genes interact at some level, this is important to keep in mind. A different result might be obtained in the context of properly localized auxin).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic>I am very happy with the thorough revision of the manuscript and the addition of many meaningful and well-executed new experiments. I now support publication of the manuscript without hesitation.</p><p>The only issue I still have is the rather poor quality of <italic>STM</italic> in situ hybridizations after ablation. With some good will it is possible to identify enhanced <italic>STM</italic> RNA levels next to the ablation site, but it could be helpful to include more apices (if the authors have pictures available) to make that trend clearer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic>The authors satisfactorily addressed the issues that I raised previously; the manuscript is considerably strengthened by new experiments (i) showing insensitivity of <italic>STM</italic> expression to JA, (ii) confirming preferential downregulation of <italic>STM</italic> in the boundary region by <italic>STM</italic> amiRNA and (iii) demonstrating differential mechanosensitivity of <italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC3</italic> expression in SAMs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07811.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>In the discussions between the reviewers and editors, a few key points emerged. Please pay particular attention to these:1) A key aspect of your paper is your claim that</italic> STM <italic>expression is mechanosensitive. However, given the considerable lag between the mechanical insult and the change in</italic> STM <italic>expression, the reviewers feel that alternative interpretations are still valid and the claim that the</italic> STM <italic>promoter is mechanosensitive is overstated. We would therefore like to ask you to perform a more comprehensive analysis to strengthen your idea. For example, how does</italic> STM <italic>expression react to transient mechanical stimuli, such as pinching?</italic></p><p>We agree with this comment. In the strictest sense, saying that <italic>STM</italic> promoter is mechanosensitive is an overstatement as it may suggest a direct relation to actors of the mechanotransduction pathways, even though the <italic>STM</italic> promoter takes several hours to be activated. We find that the <italic>STM</italic> promoter is rather the downstream/indirect target of a mechanotransduction pathway. We had highlighted the indirect nature of the induction at the end of our initial submission and we have now stated this earlier in the revised text.</p><p>Here we need to dissect the meaning of mechanotransduction: the transduction of mechanical stress is achieved by various pathways, and these pathways highly depend on the nature of the mechanical stimulus. For instance, touch is an extrinsic, discontinuous mechanical perturbation that triggers thigmorphogenesis, and could for instance be coded in frequency. As an example, repeated stem bending can lead to stem thickening and this response can also lead to desensitization (e.g. Martin et al., 2010 J. Exp Bot). Another kind of mechanical perturbation is the intrinsic and continuous membrane tension in animal cells, leading to the inhibition of endocytosis, cytoskeleton reorganization and cell polarity (e.g. Houk et al., 2012 Cell). Tension also builds up in cell walls in plants: the slow extension of cell wall under turgor pressure, leading to wall thinning, triggers wall synthesis to compensate for wall weakening (Cosgrove 2005 Nat. Rev. Mol Cell Biol). Therefore mechanical cues can be either discontinuous or continuous in nature. The relevant mechanotransduction (and timing) will highly depend on the nature of these cues. Our data on <italic>STM</italic> are rather consistent with a response to intrinsic continuous tension than with discontinuous touch, and we have reworded the text in this revision to clarify this point.</p><p>The role of intrinsic/continuous mechanical stress in gene expression starts to be uncovered in plants. For instance, the expression of the <italic>ELA1</italic> gene has recently been shown to depend on the presence of mechanical signals in the growing immature seeds. In this context, mechanical perturbations induce a change in expression after 24 hours of prolonged exposure to stress (Creff et al<italic>.,</italic> 2014 Nat. Com.).</p><p>We tried pinching meristems. In fact, this can serve as a negative control for our ablation experiments: when a needle touches the surface without breaking the top cell wall, <italic>STM</italic> is not induced. This means that <italic>STM</italic> is induced only when high and prolonged tensile stresses are present. A similar response was observed for microtubule orientation in the meristem: microtubule reorient only when the top wall breaks, i.e. when continuous directional tensile stresses are induced (Hamant et al., 2008 Science). This observation is more in line with <italic>STM</italic> expression pattern maxima, which are not stochastic, are slow to change and correspond to regions under high and continuous tensile stresses. This means that <italic>STM</italic> could be the downstream target of the wall integrity pathway for instance (continuous stress), rather than the touch mechanotransduction pathway (intermittent stress). Consistent with this, we also tested the potential impact of jasmonic acid on <italic>STM</italic> induction and could not detect any significant induction (see below).</p><p>Note that we observed that the induction of <italic>STM</italic> expression scaled to the size of the ablation; furthermore, in addition to ablations, we also performed compressions and isoxaben experiments, and these (continuous) mechanical perturbations also induce <italic>STM</italic>.</p><p>In this revision, we have added <italic>STM</italic> in situ hybridization after ablation to confirm our finding, we have analyzed other boundary-expressed genes to demonstrate the specificity of the <italic>STM</italic> response to stress, and we have tested the role of JA in <italic>STM</italic> response. All these new data are consistent with our initial claim. See below for more details.</p><p><italic>Moreover, we would like to ask you to perform experiments to exclude the possibility that the observed expression changes are due to a wounding response. Analysis of</italic> STM <italic>expression upon local jasmonate application is one experiment that can be helpful here. Demonstrating that the behavior of the</italic> STM <italic>reporter is unchanged in the JA signaling mutant</italic> coi1 <italic>would be another option. (We are aware that others have suggested that JA may be involved in thigmotropism, but it appears that those effects are probably rather indirect).</italic></p><p>This is a good suggestion. We have applied JA (100 μM) on <italic>pSTM::CFP</italic> meristems and did not see any significant induction (while our <italic>pJAZ10: :GUS</italic> and <italic>pVSP2: :GUS</italic> positive controls were induced by such JA treatments, done in parallel). This confirms that <italic>STM</italic> is not induced by wounding stress, and also is more consistent with an absence of link with thigmomorphogenesis. Note that if compression and isoxaben treatments are likely to induce microcracks in cell walls, they do not induce wounding or cell death, yet they all lead to <italic>STM</italic> induction. We therefore believe that (continuous) mechanical stress is the most likely common factor in these different tests.</p><p><italic>2) There are some questions about the specificity of your observations. If there is indeed causality linking mechanical stress and</italic> STM <italic>expression rather than correlation only, one could expect that this does not hold for any gene expressed in the boundary region. Performing the key experiments with other genes that are expressed in the boundary region could answer this question. Such control experiments should focus on other transcriptions factors.</italic></p><p>In our initial submission, we had presented the (absence of) response of <italic>PINOID</italic> as such a negative control, to show that induction by stress is indeed specific to <italic>STM</italic>. Yet, we agree with the reviewer that a single gene, and not even a transcription factor, is too weak to fully support our claim. In this revision, we present the response to mechanical perturbations for two new boundary-expressed transcription factors. We decided to focus our efforts on <italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC3</italic>. Both genes display a boundary specific expression, albeit with minor differences both in their exact spatio-temporal pattern and regulation. We found that <italic>CUC1</italic> expression is completely insensitive to ablations, thus confirming that all boundary-expressed transcription factors are not induced by mechanical perturbations. In contrast, we found that <italic>CUC3</italic> is always induced after ablation, and we even found that this induction happened earlier than <italic>STM</italic>. Interestingly, <italic>CUC3</italic> has a greater contribution to the separation of cotyledons than <italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC2</italic> (Vroemen et al., 2003 Plant Cell) and it displays a slightly different spatio-temporal expression pattern that of <italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC2. CUC3</italic> is also not regulated by miRNA164. We thus thank the reviewer for this suggestion, as our manuscript is now strengthened with the example of two boundary-expressed genes from the same family, one being induced by mechanical perturbation while the other is not.</p><p><italic>3) Please also carefully address some technical issues. It would be especially important to demonstrate that your assumption that the</italic> amiRNA <italic>construct preferentially downregulates</italic> STM <italic>in the boundary region is true. Combination of this construct with a</italic> STM <italic>protein fusion reporter could substantiate this claim.</italic>This is indeed a good point and we have performed the required experiment. We had introgressed the <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> marker in the <italic>pSTM::STMamiRNA</italic> lines beforehand and in this revision, we provide the corresponding images: we can indeed detect a down regulation of STM-Venus signal in the <italic>pSTM::STMamiRNA</italic> lines, albeit at various levels, depending on the lines. In these lines, the <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> signal becomes more homogeneous, consistent with a down‐regulation of <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary (as seen on top and side views in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Following the suggestion by the reviewers, we also further characterized the <italic>stm-dgh6 pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> line in much more details. We now show the late phenotype of <italic>stm-dgh6</italic> plants in which vegetative growth can be observed. More importantly, we demonstrate that full complementation occurs in homozygous <italic>stm-dgh6</italic> lines when the <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> construct is also homozygote. We apologize for the confusion in the initial submission and thank again the reviewers for raising these issues; we believe that these extra data strongly support our initial claim.</p><p>Reviewer #1:<italic>[…] In summary, curvature and</italic> STM <italic>reporter expression are correlated in the shoot apical meristem.

In this revision, we have clarified the type of mechanical stress we are dealing with in the main text, notably by comparing the <italic>STM</italic> response in the SAM to that of cortical microtubules. In both cases, a steady response (<italic>STM</italic> promoter increased activity, MT hyperalignment) is caused by intrinsic continuous stresses, and not by touch. The absence of <italic>STM</italic> induction after jasmonate exposure further supports this conclusion.</p><p><italic>2) The boundary phenotype in the</italic> pSTM::STM <italic>rescue and</italic> amiRNA <italic>silencing plants is not documented properly. To be able to judge the phenotypes, we need SAM microscopy and curvature measurements. The pictures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are not very informative with regards to the boundary effect, rather they show overall growth habitus.</italic></p><p>We fully agree with the reviewer and acknowledge that our initial analysis was too superficial. As detailed above, we have improved the presentation of the results with more pictures and close‐ups, together with genotyping protocols. The <italic>STM</italic> amiRNA lines exhibit small meristems and organ fusions, consistent with a primary role of the boundary in organ separation. In this revision, we also measured curvature in the <italic>STM</italic> amiRNA lines. We found that curvature did not scale to meristem size and that the smaller size of the meristem also brought adjacent boundaries close to one another. These two factors might explain the presence of fusions in the <italic>STM</italic> amiRNA lines.</p><p><italic>3) The boundary specific silencing supposed to be happening in the</italic> amiRNA <italic>lines is not documented. Again, in situ hybridization seems essential to analyze where</italic> STM <italic>silencing occurs, to be able to interpret the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>.</italic></p><p>Same here: this was indeed a missing piece in our initial submission and we have corrected it by providing images of <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> expression in the amiRNA lines. <italic>STM</italic> is indeed downregulated at the boundary in these lines.</p><p><italic>4) The claim the</italic> STM <italic>responds to mechanical stimuli after 8 hours onwards is not substantiated by the data presented. From the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> it seems that the first effects become visible only after around 20 hours. Please comment.</italic></p><p>This was indeed unclear in our initial submission. The earliest induction for <italic>STM</italic> is 8 hours based on the compression experiments. We have not conducted extensive kinetics analysis to check when on average <italic>STM</italic> is induced after mechanical perturbations, but we never saw an induction before 8 hours so far. This has been clarified in this revision.</p><p><italic>5) The authors routinely refer to &quot;</italic>STM <italic>expression&quot; when they are talking about</italic> pSTM::CFP <italic>reporter activity. Please be more careful with wording.</italic></p><p>We now provide <italic><underline>STM</underline></italic> in situ hybridizations after ablation and we also demonstrate that <italic>pSTM::STM-Venus</italic> fully rescues the <italic>stm</italic> mutant, so it is very likely that our claim is also valid for <italic>STM</italic> expression. Yet, we agree with the reviewer and we have clarified this point in this revision.</p><p><italic>6) The claim that</italic> STM <italic>reporter expression is much higher after removal of NPA is not substantiated by the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–—figure supplement 1</xref>.</italic></p><p>Here we meant that after removal of NPA, <italic>STM</italic> reporter expression switches from being relatively homogeneous in the SAM to being high in a new boundary (as the absence of NPA triggers organogenesis), mimicking the pattern observed in dissected meristems expressing the <italic>pSTM::CFP</italic> construct in absence of NPA.</p><p>Reviewer #3:<italic>This interesting manuscript by Hamant and coworkers addresses the question of how the expression of</italic> STM<italic>, a key regulator of the shoot apical meristem also required for organ separation, is regulated. This is an important biological problem, which is explored by the authors using a range of sophisticated imaging, image processing and genetic tools. Overall this manuscript is very well written and the data provide strong experimental support for a role of mechanical stress in controlling</italic> STM <italic>expression patterns.</italic></p><p><italic>1) To analyze the relationship between mechanical stress, and more specifically Gaussian curvature, and</italic> STM <italic>expression, the authors mapped meristem curvature at high resolution and projected this onto a map of</italic> pSTM::CFP-N7 <italic>expression. These experiments convincingly show that negative Gaussian curvature is correlated with enhanced</italic> STM <italic>expression in the boundary domain of the SAM.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this positive feedback.</p><p><italic>2) The authors further analyze whether</italic> STM <italic>expression in the boundary is functionally important for organ separation during development. To this end,</italic> STM-Venus <italic>preferentially expressed in the boundary was introduced into a strong</italic> STM <italic>mutant (</italic>dgh6<italic>). The resulting transgenic lines exhibited only a partial recovery of meristem maintenance but a complete loss of organ fusion defects.</italic> pSTM::STMamiRNA2 <italic>was introduced into WT to preferentially silence</italic> STM <italic>expression in the meristem boundary. This resulted in reduced, but functional meristems, and major organ fusions.</italic></p><p><italic>These are creative attempts to specifically alter</italic> STM <italic>expression in the boundary region; however, no evidence is presented to actually confirm that such preferential alteration has actually occurred. It would have been informative to show the expression pattern of</italic> pSTM::STM-Venus <italic>not only in a WT background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) but in the</italic> dgh6 <italic>mutant line, as the expression pattern of the weakly expressing WT parent line (Heisler et al. 2005a) may not necessarily have been maintained after crossing.</italic></p><p>As detailed above, the suggested experiment is now included in this revision and confirms that complementation is associated with <italic>STM‐Venus</italic> expression in homozygous <italic>stm-dgh6</italic> lines.</p><p>As shown in the initial submission, we find that the <italic>STM</italic> amiRNA lines exhibit small meristems and organ fusions, but no meristem termination, consistent with a primary role of the boundary in organ separation. In this revision, we measured curvature in the <italic>STM</italic> amiRNA lines. We found that curvature did not scale to meristem size and that the smaller size of the meristem also brought adjacent boundaries close to one another. These two factors might explain the presence of fusions in the <italic>STM</italic> amiRNA lines.</p><p><italic>Similarly, it would be useful to know whether</italic> STM <italic>expression is preferentially silenced in the boundary in</italic> pSTM::STMamiRNA2 <italic>lines. Transformation of the constructs into</italic> pSTM::STM-Venus <italic>lines would have been informative. If these experiments are not done, the limitations should at least be discussed.</italic></p><p>As detailed above, we have introgressed <italic>pSTM::STM‐Venus</italic> in the <italic>pSTM::STMamiRNA2</italic> lines and found a down‐regulation of Venus signal in boundaries, when compared to WT plants.</p><p><italic>3) The authors convincingly demonstrate that enhanced</italic> STM <italic>expression in the boundary is correlated with but not dependent on local auxin depletion. Treatment with 2,4-D globally increased auxin levels in the SAM (as monitored using DII-Venus) but did not alter the pattern of</italic> STM <italic>expression (although slightly increasing the intensity of</italic> pSTM::CFP-N7 <italic>expression).</italic></p><p><italic>One question this experiment raised for me was whether 24 hour incubation with 2,4-D altered meristem organization in any noticeable manner, i.e. were Gaussian curvatures in the boundaries affected by the treatment? According to the authors' model, this should have affected</italic> STM <italic>expression.</italic></p><p>We could not detect a major impact of the treatment on the overall shape of the meristem. 2,4‐D is likely to impact growth rate as a whole, but it is unclear whether this would also increase differential growth. The independence with auxin is unequivocally shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G, in</xref> which STM expression can be induced in a pin1 background, in which no induction of the DII sensor can be detected.</p><p><italic>4) The authors provide strong evidence that mechanical perturbations (compression of meristem and local cell ablation) and pharmacological treatments resulting in altered mechanical stress (isoxaben, NPA+oryzalin) resulted in increased</italic> STM <italic>expression. Based on the authors' initial experiments,</italic> STM <italic>expression was correlated with negative Gaussian curvature. Does this relationship hold when the SAM is perturbed by the various treatments described here? This analysis could greatly strengthen the concept that</italic> STM <italic>expression is regulated by a specific type of mechanical stress.</italic></p><p>We have not measured the relation between curvature and <italic>STM</italic> expression after mechanical perturbation, notably because we would need to include a membrane marker (like FM4-64) that may interfere with the response. We prefer to keep the mechanical perturbations as simple as possible to avoid multiple controls. Yet, we analyzed the correlation between curvature and <italic>STM</italic> expression in the katanin mutant, which displays a delay in tissue folding, and found that the correlation between tissue folding and <italic>STM</italic> expression was maintained. We believe that this experiment addresses at least partly the suggestion from reviewer 3.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>All reviewers and the editors agree that your work is interesting and original, but as you can see from their comments, the reviewers still have some questions about the causality relations put forward in your study. Yet, there is also consensus that this is a hard chicken-and-egg type of problem, and a completely unambiguous answer is hard to come by with current means. Although things might turn out somewhat different in the long run, your study presents one of the best ways forward into this area for the moment, and is likely to stimulate further research. In light of this, we believe that it would be in your own interest to be very careful how you phrase your conclusions.

In that respect, please pay particular attention to the comments of reviewer 1.</italic></p><p>Thank you for this feedback – we have rephrased our conclusions accordingly in this revision.</p><p><italic>Please also clarify the following: there are some doubts whether the experiments show jasmonate insensitivity of</italic> STM <italic>expression as stated in the text. In the supplemental figure, there is clear</italic> STM <italic>expression increase that does not occur in any of the mock treated samples. It thus appears simply wrong to say it is insensitive, and these results should not be &quot;hidden&quot; in the supporting information.</italic></p><p>In the main text, we stated that “we did not observe any significant induction of <italic>pSTM::CFP-N7</italic> signal in most of the plants (N = 10/14, Figure 5–figure supplement 3), and slight fluctuations in CFP signal in the remaining ones (N= 4/14, Figure 5–figure supplement 3). As <italic>pSTM ::CFP</italic> is always induced, we thus thought that wound-induced jasmonate is not the most likely candidate as a secondary messenger between stress and <italic>STM</italic> expression. Our initial statement “wound-induced jasmonate production does not seem to be involved in the induction of <italic>STM</italic> expression after ablation” is indeed an overstatement and we have rephrased it as follows:</p><p>“Based on these results, we cannot rule out completely that jasmonate interferes with <italic>STM</italic> expression. Yet, as this contrasts with the systematic and steady induction of <italic>STM</italic> after ablation and with the robust induction of a <italic>pJAZ10::GUS</italic> reporter by jasmonate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L-O</xref>), wound-induced jasmonate is not the most likely candidate as a secondary messenger between stress and <italic>STM</italic> induction.”</p><p>We also have moved the jasmonate results in the main figure.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>This paper presents several interesting observations. My problem with the paper – even after the changes and in some cases even more so after the authors' additions – is that the authors shoehorn their observations into a model in which mechanical stress increases</italic> STM <italic>expression.In the body of the paper, the authors include alternative explanations for the correlation such as in this paragraph:&quot;The fact that</italic> STM <italic>expression correlates with curvature at the boundary can simply be explained by the fact that</italic> STM <italic>reduces the growth rate at the boundary, leading to tissue folding.</italic> KNOX <italic>genes can cause alterations in curvature in otherwise smooth surface (Long and Barton, 1998, Barkoulas et al., 2008). The impact of</italic> STM <italic>on crease formation at the boundary could be mediated by inhibiting cell growth in this domain. Consistent with this scenario, KNOX target genes include genes involved in auxin transport as well as genes involved in cell wall synthesis (Bolduc et al., 2012). However the strong correlation between</italic> STM <italic>promoter activity and tissue folding suggests that a signal, which is related to curvature, could add robustness to the</italic> STM <italic>expression pattern at the boundary.&quot;Why would a strong correlation lead one to prefer one direction of causality over the other?</italic></p><p>In the quoted text, we state that hypothesis 1: “<italic>STM</italic> slows down growth and this induces folding” is actually a fact. We are therefore not preferring one direction or the other, we say that direction 1 “<italic>STM</italic> -&gt; shape” exists for sure. We are exploring whether the other direction “shape-&gt; <italic>STM</italic>” also exists. In other words, what we are looking for is whether the correlation between folding and <italic>STM</italic> expression also reflects the presence of a feedback. This does not mean that a feedback exists, we only say that the existence of a correlation is a necessary condition for the feedback to exist. Therefore we need to quantify curvature and relate it to <italic>STM</italic> expression to check whether the correlation is strong or not, before moving on to auxin and mechanics as potential feedback factors. If we had found a very weak correlation between <italic>STM</italic> expression and curvature, then <italic>STM</italic> would not have been on our candidate list for a target of shape feedback.</p><p><italic>We know that</italic> STM/KNOX <italic>expression exists in the absence of tissue folding and also precedes tissue folding in the embryo, and precedes tissue folding in the development of leaf lobing. To my knowledge, there is no case of tissue folding that precedes</italic> STM/KNOX <italic>expression.</italic></p><p>We observed and measured that <italic>STM</italic> promoter activity increases with tissue folding, but it is very likely that <italic>STM</italic> induction indeed precedes tissue folding (although this would be more difficult to quantify, as this would involve measuring regional differential growth – see below). In fact, when comparing <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary with the microtubule response to mechanical stress in the same domain, we also see that microtubule align in the boundary before folding occurs, and this alignment can be correlated with differential growth (and thus directional stress) at the boundary before folding: the fast growing initium is generating stress before it forms a crease at the boundary (see e.g. Burian et al., 2013 J. Exp Bot). Here we only focus on curvature because the formation of a crease reflects the presence of stress at the boundary for sure, while a flat shape may or may not be related with stress (differential growth then also needs to be measured). The induction of <italic>STM/KNOX</italic> in leaves and embryo before folding may very well be related to differential growth (and thus stress) preceding folding. We have added this point in the new Discussion.</p><p><italic>Of all the treatments that the authors subject the plants to, pinching would seem to best simulate folding but pinching the meristem does not increase</italic> STM <italic>expression. This argues strongly for the arrow of causation to be in the direction counter to what the authors propose. (The authors make arguments about how pinching is somehow different than the stresses that would normally be sensed by</italic> STM <italic>but I am not convinced).</italic></p><p>We don’t think that the pinching experiment reflects what happens at the boundary: in this domain, mechanical stress is predicted to slowly increase and to become more and more directional as the tissue folds. This is quite different from a transient compression from the top of the tissue. In fact, the ablations, lateral compressions and isoxaben treatments that are included in our manuscript are more consistent with the situation at the boundary: a prolonged exposure to mechanical stress. This discussion comes down to signal transduction kinetics: if one could increase very transiently auxin concentration (for a fraction of a second), the TIR1 auxin pathway would probably not be induced significantly enough to have a visible, steady, impact on gene expression. But this may be sufficient to induce visible short term responses, like a calcium peak. In other words, the cell responds differentially to transient and prolonged cues. Similarly, cellulose synthesis occurs in response to prolonged exposure to mechanical stress (caused by progressive wall thinning/weakening). To our knowledge, one pinching event does not induce a permanent increase of cellulose synthesis; only the repetition of such deformations (like the wind) may have a significant impact on growth. Last, in the text we refer to other documented genes that are downstream targets of mechanical stress. While some of them (TOUCH genes) are clearly induced within minutes of mechanical deformation, others (e.g. ELA1 in the immature seed (Creff et al., 2014 Nat. Com)) take several hours to be induced after prolonged exposure to stress, like STM in our experiments.</p><p><italic>Whatever the reality may be, in this paper alternative interpretations are downplayed. There is no mention of alternative models in the Discussion and the title is overly strong in its assertion given the weak, and by the authors' own admission, indirect, connection between physical stress and</italic> STM <italic>expression.</italic>To clarify again: the fact that <italic>STM</italic> slows down growth and induce folding is not an alternative hypothesis, it is a fact. Here, based on the strong correlation between folding and <italic>STM</italic> expression, we explore whether signals may in turn enhance <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary. We explore two signals: auxin and mechanical stress. Other signals could be checked (the list is very long and beyond the scope of this article); this is where alternative hypotheses could be found. We find that if auxin depletion and mechanical stress both correlate with <italic>STM</italic> induction at the boundary, they are not coupled: mechanical induction of <italic>STM</italic> is most likely not mediated via auxin depletion or jasmonate induction. We have added two paragraphs in the Discussion to explore other scenarios (please see: “Alternative cues may be involved in the promotion of <italic>STM</italic> expression […] these may be better candidates for the regulation of <italic>STM</italic> expression at the boundary”) and carefully rephrased our conclusions and title to avoid any misunderstanding.</p><p><italic>Unfortunately, without the framework of mechanical stress acting to increase</italic> STM<italic>, the experiments presented in this paper lack cohesion.</italic></p><p>What is missing for sure is a mutant that would be mechano-insensitive and in which <italic>STM</italic> expression pattern at the boundary would be less robust. We are working on it currently and we hope to provide more conclusive results in the future. Yet, at this point, we believe that this work is a solid analysis of the relation between shape and <italic>STM</italic> expression in the meristem, from which we find that mechanical stress contributes to <italic>STM</italic> expression, in parallel to auxin depletion. We also provide a number of open prospects in the Results and Discussion that should stimulate further research.</p><p><italic>Comments on revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors shore up their complementation data. They have now used PCR to genotype homozygous</italic> stm/stm<italic>;</italic> pSTM::STM-Venus/pSTM::STM-Venus <italic>double mutants segregating from among the progeny of</italic> stm/+pSTM::STM-Venus/pSTM::STM-Venus <italic>parents. It would have been more convincing if they had recovered a fertile double homozygote but if the PCR data are compelling, then they likely have identified complemented individuals. (Unfortunately, the PCR data aren't shown. I would be worried about using the presence/absence of a 2.6 kb band for determining the presence of the wild type allele as lack of a band can be due to simple PCR failure. Presumably the authors have adequately controlled for this.)</italic></p><p>We have collected seeds from double homozygote thus confirming full complementation.</p><p><italic>2) The authors have added a test for response of</italic> STM <italic>expression to jasmonate, a hormone associated with wounding stress. This is an experiment to determine whether the response of</italic> STM <italic>expression to ablation might be in response to wounding. The data are given in the supplemental section (Figure 5–figure supplement 3). Most plants do not respond – however a significant fraction, 4 out of the 20 or so plants tested,</italic> did <italic>show an increase in</italic> STM <italic>expression in response to jasmonate. The authors dismiss this positive result as unimportant but I am not sure what the basis for their dismissal is.(I can easily envision an entirely different historical scenario for these experiments that would lead to a different set of conclusions: A set of jasmonate researchers could have reasonably concluded that applied jasmonate can increase</italic> STM <italic>expression. They would then have followed up that observation with ablation experiments on the meristem finding that</italic> STM <italic>expression increased in response to wounding.)In short, the jasmonate experiments indicate that the situation is likely to be complex. Rather than sweeping this complexity under the rug, the authors should discuss it.</italic></p><p>Here we are not investigating the contribution of jasmonate in <italic>STM</italic> expression (otherwise indeed 4 inductions out of 20 would have been an interesting lead). We only want to know whether, in response to ablation, the reproducible induction of <italic>STM</italic> is only due to jasmonate production. As jasmonate is systematically induced following ablations and as we see induction of <italic>STM</italic> expression in 4 out of 20 treated meristems and no clear/steady induction in the remaining 16, this is not the most probable hypothesis and indeed a more complex scenario must be called upon. We have rephrased our conclusion to better reflect this and we now show the relevant data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Our initial statement “wound-induced jasmonate production does not seem to be involved in the induction of <italic>STM</italic> expression after ablation” is indeed an overstatement and we have rephrased it as follows:</p><p>“Based on these results, we cannot rule out completely that jasmonate interferes with <italic>STM</italic> expression. Yet, as this contrasts with the systematic and steady induction of <italic>STM</italic> after ablation and with the robust induction of a <italic>pJAZ10::GUS</italic> reporter by jasmonate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L-O</xref>), wound-induced jasmonate is not the most likely candidate as a secondary messenger between stress and <italic>STM</italic> induction.”</p><p>We also have moved the jasmonate results in the main figure.</p><p><italic>3) The authors add data for other boundary-expressed genes and find that one –</italic> CUC3<italic>, but not the other,</italic> CUC1<italic>, respond to ablation with increased expression. This is very interesting but I am not entirely sure what to make of it. Again, it reinforces the conclusion that the situation is complex.</italic></p><p>The situation is complex and in this case there is an interesting perspective to follow: <italic>CUC1</italic> expression is regulated by miR164 whereas <italic>CUC3</italic> is not. This suggests that different mechanisms ensure the robustness in expression for members of the same gene family. For this article, the goal was rather to show that only a fraction of boundary-expressed genes are regulated by mechanical perturbations. This is the only conclusion we draw from these extra results.</p><p><italic>(I would add here as well that these experiments are done in NPA treated meristems and therefore the results hold for a context in which auxin is improperly localized. Since there is reason to believe that auxin and</italic> KNOX <italic>genes interact at some level, this is important to keep in mind. A different result might be obtained in the context of properly localized auxin).</italic> </p><p>In these experiments, meristems are recovering from NPA treatments so this would be unlikely, but not impossible. Yet, since controls and assays are conducted in the exact same conditions throughout, the conclusions still stand. Note that <italic>STM</italic> induction was also observed in the complete absence of NPA in a <italic>pin1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) and in the continuous presence of NPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref>), so at least <italic>STM</italic> induction by mechanical perturbations does not seem to be NPA dependent.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>I am very happy with the thorough revision of the manuscript and the addition of many meaningful and well-executed new experiments. I now support publication of the manuscript without hesitation.</italic></p><p><italic>The only issue I still have is the rather poor quality of</italic> STM <italic>in situ hybridizations after ablation. With some good will it is possible to identify enhanced</italic> STM <italic>RNA levels next to the ablation site, but it could be helpful to include more apices (if the authors have pictures available) to make that trend clearer.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the enhanced signal is rather subtle. We have added another picture of in situ hybridization as requested. We also have added a word of caution: “Note that ablation may also provide increased accessibility to the probe.”</p><p>We also have increased the number of replicates for the ablations on the <italic>CUC1</italic> marker line (all negative for induction as previously shown).</p></body></sub-article></article>
