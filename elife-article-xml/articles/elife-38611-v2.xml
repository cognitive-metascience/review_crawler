growth or other primary processes. 17-Hydroxygeranylinalool diterpene glycosides (DTGs) are abundant herbivory-induced, structurally diverse and commonly malonylated defense metabolites in <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> plants. By identifying and silencing a malonyltransferase, <italic>NaMaT1,</italic> involved in DTG malonylation, we found that DTG malonylation percentages are normally remarkably uniform, but when disrupted, result in DTG-dependent reduced floral style lengths, which in turn result from reduced stylar cell sizes, IAA contents, and YUC activity; phenotypes that could be restored by IAA supplementation or by silencing the DTG pathway. Moreover, the <italic>Nicotiana</italic> genus-specific JA-deficient short-style phenotype also results from alterations in DTG malonylation patterns. Decorations of plant specialized metabolites can be tuned to remarkably uniform levels, and this regulation plays a central but poorly understood role in controlling the development of specific plant parts, such as floral styles.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38611.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants produce tens of thousands of molecules called secondary metabolites that are thought to help them cope with threats from their environment, such as attack by insects or ultraviolet radiation from the sun.

Enzymes called malonyl transferases take a malonyl group from another substrate and attach it to the secondary metabolite.

The experiments show that more DTGs modified with malonyl groups accumulated in these plants compared to untreated plants. However, there was no change in the average number of malonyl groups added to individual DTGs during the modification process. Further experiments show that a malonyl transferase enzyme called NaMaT1 adds malonyl groups to DTGs in coyote tobacco plants. The flowers of plants that produce less of this protein have shorter styles (a tube structure that guides pollen to the egg cells at the base of the flower) and are less fertile than flowers in normal plants.</p><p>These experiments demonstrate that, along with helping plants to defend themselves from herbivores, DTGs regulate how flowers grow and develop. It was generally thought that secondary metabolites do not play important roles in how plants grow when they are not under stress. Indeed, plant breeders frequently select crops that produce lower levels of secondary metabolites in order to increase their nutritional value. Therefore, the findings of Li et al. may help improve the outcomes of crop breeding programs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Nicotiana attenuata</kwd><kwd>malonylation</kwd><kwd>stylar development</kwd><kwd>auxin</kwd><kwd>specialized metabolites</kwd><kwd>diterpene glycoside</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative Research Centre &quot;ChemicalMediators in Complex Biosystems - ChemBioSys&quot; (SFB 1127)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian T</given-names></name><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Meredith C</given-names></name><name><surname>Halitschke</surname><given-names>Rayko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Award: ClockWorkGreen 293926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Regulation of diterpene glycoside malonylation status influences stylar elongation through affecting auxin signaling in Nicotiana attenuata.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malonylation is a ubiquitous modification of proteins and specialized metabolites. In plant specialized metabolism, the malonyl group is largely transferred from malonyl-coenzyme A (Malonyl-CoA) to the Câ6 of the glycosyl moiety of glucoconjugates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taguchi et al., 2005</xref>). The malonyl residue is thought to confer structural diversity, stability, and solubility to the decorated metabolites and provide a means of detoxifying xenobiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taguchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koirala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>). Malonylation of anthocyanins enhances pigment stability and color intensity at the pH of the intracellular milieus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, malonylated anthocyanins are preferentially transported to vacuoles in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). The malonylation of glycosides is catalyzed by malonyltransferases, members of the biochemically versatile BAHD acyltransferase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Auria, 2006</xref>). Although tens of malonyltransferases have been identified and functionally characterized in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manjasetty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bontpart et al., 2015</xref>), their in vivo functions are largely unknown.</p><p>17-hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides (DTGs) are abundant (mg/g FW) secondary metabolites in green tissues of many solanaceous plants, including tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana</italic> spp.), pepper (<italic>Capsicum annuum</italic>) and wolfberry (<italic>Lycium chinense</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jassbi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heiling et al., 2010</xref>). DTGs consist of a 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool aglycone that is decorated at the C3 and C17 hydroxyl positions by glucose, which in turn is modified by glucose, rhamnose and malonyl moieties, in various combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). So far, 46 different DTGs (21 chemical formulas and several structural isomers) have been characterized in <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>, an ecological model plant with a rich portfolio of specialized metabolites; however, the glycoside Lyciumoside IV and its malonylated products, Nicotianoside I and Nicotianoside II, constitute more than 80% of the DTG pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poreddy et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>N. attenuata</italic>, DTGs function in resistance against the specialist herbivore, tobacco hornworm (<italic>Manduca sexta</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lou and Baldwin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jassbi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heiling et al., 2010</xref>). The malonylated DTGs are particularly strongly induced by <italic>M. sexta</italic> feeding and jasmonate signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heiling et al., 2010</xref>). The malonyl moieties of DTGs are lost from the DTGs soon after their ingestion by <italic>M. sexta</italic> larvae due to the alkaline environment of <italic>M. sexta</italic> oral secretions and midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poreddy et al., 2015</xref>). This observation rules out a central role for malonylation of DTGs in antiherbivore defense, and suggests that other arenas need to be explored for potential functions mediated by this malonylation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38611.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The malonylation percentage of DTGs is highly uniform across treatments and developmental stages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structures of 17-DTGs and their malonylation options.

Many are produced in response to particular ecological interactions, such as those that are induced in response to specific attackers. However, many secondary metabolites have effects on growth and development which are more specific than those that might result from resource trade-offs between growth and putative defense metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">ZÃ¼st and Agrawal, 2017</xref>). For example, the insect feeding-induced glucosinolate breakdown product, indole-3-carbinol, arrests growth by interacting with the auxin receptor Transport Inhibitor Response (TIR1) as an auxin antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katz et al., 2015</xref>). Arabidopsis glucosinolates are also thought to modulate plant biomass, flowering time and the circadian clock, and inhibit root growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerwin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Francisco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malinovsky et al., 2017</xref>). Hyper-accumulation of flavonoids is associated with stunted growth and developmental abnormalities, which are assumed to result from effects on auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonawitz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steenackers et al., 2017</xref>). With the exception of the glucosinolates and flavonoids, little is known about these potential âprimaryâ roles for other branches of specialized (also known as âsecondaryâ) metabolism.</p><p>The jasmonate signaling pathway is undoubtedly among the most important in plant defense responses to herbivory, regulating a large portion of herbivory-responsive specialized metabolism, including DTGs in <italic>N. attenuata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kallenbach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2018</xref>). However, jasmonates also regulate root growth, anther dehiscence, male fertility, fruit ripening and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Staswick et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wasternack et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stitz et al., 2014</xref>). Jasmonate signaling-deficient genotypes of <italic>N. attenuata</italic>, including RNAi lines targeting ALLENE OXIDE CYCLASE (irAOC) and CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (irCOI1), and ectopic expression of Arabidopsis JASMONIC ACID METHYL TRANSFERASE (JMT) and simultaneous silencing of METHYL JASMONATE ESTERASE (MJE) (JMT/mje) which dramatically decreased JA signaling, are reported to have short styles, resulting in reduced fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stitz et al., 2014</xref>). Transgenic <italic>N. tabacum</italic> plants deficient in COI1 also display short styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). However, the mechanism of this seemingly <italic>Nicotiana</italic> genus-specific jasmonate-regulated phenotype is completely obscure.</p><p>Auxin plays a pivotal role throughout the entire lifespan of a plant, particularly in determination of floral development. It can influence cell division, cell expansion and cell differentiation, and thereby regulate a wide spectrum of developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benjamins and Scheres, 2008</xref>). Mutants of <italic>AtPIN1</italic>, a polar auxinÂ transporter, developed naked, pin-shaped inflorescences and abnormalities in all flower parts, confirming that auxin signaling contributes to flower development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Okada, 1991</xref>). Consistent with this, mutants of the auxin biosynthesis genes TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS (TAA) and YUCCA display severe defects in floral patterning, and complete sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stepanova et al., 2008</xref>). Auxin can also regulate gynoecium morphogenesis, including style elongation, through a concentration gradient from the apical to the basal part of the gynoecium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nemhauser et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we discovered that the malonylation percentage of DTGs is remarkably uniform across development, treatments, and tissue types, and identified the gene involved in this malonylation. We ask whether this uniformity is essential for plant development. Silencing this gene caused strikingly and specifically short styles, and this phenomenon vanished when silencing this gene in DTG-deficient plants. We analyzed phytohormone levels, enzymatic activity, and effects of exogenous application, and all evidence indicated that the short style phenotype is caused by the influence of DTG malonylation status on IAA biosynthesis. Finally, we illustrate that the <italic>Nicotiana</italic> genus-specific JA-deficient style phenotype is caused by disturbing DTG malonylation patterns. Our work demonstrates that abnormal JA signaling could dysregulate DTG malonylation patterns, thereby affecting plant style development via auxin signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DTG malonylation percentages show remarkable uniformity across herbivory elicitation, developmental stages and tissues</title><p>To easily describe and understand the malonylation of DTGs, <italic>N. attenuata</italic> DTGs were classified, based on how many malonyl moieties they contained, into four categories: core, monomalonylated, dimalonylated, and trimalonylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Remarkably, although all types of malonylated DTGs increased after <italic>M. sexta</italic> elicitation, there was no difference in malonylation percentage between treatment and control. To further analyze DTG malonylation patterns over plant development, DTGs were analyzed in flower buds of different stages. Total DTGs decreased dramatically over flower development, whereas the malonylation percentage was very stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>). By mining previously published metabolite data sets from different plant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2016</xref>), we found that although different malonylated DTGs are highly variable across different tissues, with coefficients of variation (CV) ranging from 64 to 107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2BâF</xref>), the malonylation percentage was more uniform, with a CV of only 11: a significant outlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NaMaT is responsible for DTG malonylation</title><p>Manipulating gene(s) controlling the malonylation process is the most straightforward way to disentangle the function of DTG malonylation and its remarkably uniformity.

To address this hypothesis, we analyzed DTG profiles using a stably transformed <italic>N. attenuata</italic> irAOC line as a severely jasmonate-deficient model. In both herbivore-damaged and control leaves, malonylation percentages in irAOC were significantly higher than in EV plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

Here, we report that the decoration of specialized metabolites demonstrated remarkable uniformity across development, tissues, and treatments, and found that one malonyltransferase (MaT) contributes significantly to this process. Silencing this gene disturbed 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycoside (DTG) malonylation patterns, and stunted elongation of flower styles during development and fertility by affecting auxin biosynthesis. Abnormal jasmonate signaling could also disturb DTG malonylation patterns, causing similar stylar developmental defects.</p><p>Enzyme assays showed that three MaT proteins, NaMaT1-3, catalyze the first step of DTG malonylation, from Lyciumoside IV to Nicotianoside I, and the second step, from Nicotianoside I to Nicotianoside II, in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As Lyciumoside IV only has two glucose moieties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and the abundances of tri-glucosylated core DTGs are too low to purify from plants, we were unable to test the ability of those NaMaTs to catalyze the third malonylation reaction. However, in vivo silencing of <italic>NaMaT1</italic> dramatically decreased dimalonylated and trimalonylated DTGs in inflorescences and styles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which indicates that NaMaT1 might also control the third step of the malonylation reaction <italic>in planta</italic>. Notably, in vivo silencing of <italic>NaMaT1</italic> changed individual DTG abundances in complex ways. For example, although the total abundance of dimalonylated DTGs decreased significantly in <italic>NaMaT1</italic>-silenced styles, the abundance of one dimalonylated DTG, Nicotianoside X, did not change significantly, whereas the abundance of two dimalonylated compounds, Nicotianoside XII and Nicotianoside VII, increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âFigure supplement 1AFigure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Currently, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of these changes are not directly mediated by NaMaT1 catalytic activity, but result from systemic influence, such as substrate limitation. Future work should test NaMaT1 substrate specificity for all DTGs, when technology can support the purification of low-abundance components in sufficient amounts. Based on our current results, we infer that NaMaT1 is a malonyl-CoA:DTG malonyltransferase, which may catalyze three consecutive malonylation steps, as reported for Dm3MaT2, which catalyzes consecutive dimalonyl transfers to anthocyanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, two characterized MaTs in the <italic>Nicotiana</italic> genus, NbMaT1 and NtMaT1, accept aromatic glycosides as substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taguchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Phylogenic and protein identity analysis showed that NbMaT1 and NtMaT1 share the highest sequence similarity with NaMaT2 and NaMaT3, about 90%, whereas the identity with NaMaT1 is 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Here, we show that VIGS of <italic>NaMaT1</italic> tended to increase both <italic>NaMaT2</italic> and <italic>NaMaT3</italic> expression, and significantly increased <italic>NaGLS</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Two or more elements oppositely controlling one process is a powerful homeostatic strategy, as is found in JA-Ile conjugation and JA-Ile hydroxylation which maintains JA-Ile homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Woldemariam et al., 2012</xref>). Here, the induction of <italic>NaMaT1</italic> and suppression of <italic>NaMaT2</italic> and <italic>NaMaT3</italic> in response to <italic>M. sexta</italic> feeding may represent a similar mechanism to control DTG malonylation percentage during the response to herbivore attack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Using feed-back and -forward regulation together with differential expression levels of <italic>NaMaTs</italic>, plants maintain DTG malonylation percentage within a very narrow range. This is likely important because a malonylation percentage alteration as low as 4.1% in irAOC is associated with a drastically shortened style and infertility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Additionally, the very low variation in the malonylation percentages reported here throughout the results indicates that DTG malonylation is precisely regulated. Although long-term, high-dose MeJA treatments of the leaves of VIGS plants (3 days using the same amount of MeJA normally applied to glasshouse-grown plants, with leaves typically 3-5x the size of the leaves of VIGS plants) reduced DTG malonylation percentages (VIGS-EV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), the locally transient endogenous JA bursts elicited by <italic>M. sexta</italic> larval feeding did not alter malonylation percentages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Importantly, both high (irAOC) and low (VIGS-MaT1) malonylation percentages were accompanied by truncated styles. Notably, malonylation percentage decreased in irGGPPS-MaT1 inflorescences but without apparently affecting style length of irGGPPS-MaT1 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We think that this is because irGGPPS plants produce much lower levels of DTGs, and thus the total abundance of DTGs in inflorescences may not be enough to affect style development, regardless of their malonylation.</p><p>Induction of the jasmonate signaling pathway, including via MeJA treatment and <italic>M. sexta</italic> attack, strongly induced <italic>NaMaT1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and DTG malonylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that NaMaT1 is responsible for the increase in malonylated DTGs. However, as noted above, high-dose MeJA treatment suppressed malonylation percentages, and silencing JA biosynthesis (irAOC) increased malonylation percentage in many tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>). This apparent contradiction may be explained by the possibility that other MaTs also contribute to the DTG malonylation process, as indicated by the fact that <italic>M. sexta</italic> feeding suppresses NaMaT2 and NaMaT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Although <italic>NaMaT1</italic> transcript accumulation decreased more than 80% in VIGS-MaT1 leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), the malonylation percentage was only reduced by 19.6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), again consistent with the hypotheses that other MaTs catalyze DTG malonylation. Future research could test NaMaT2 and NaMaT3 functions by manipulating their expression with more robust means, such as CRISPR-mediated genome editing.</p><p>Our experiments shed light on this phenomenon by demonstrating that the DTG biosynthesis specific NaGGPPS is required for the development of the truncated style phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and this truncated style phenotype results from the low auxin levels found in the styles, which in turn are due to reduced IAA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We hypothesize that this style-specific effect occurs because the style synthesizes large amounts of DTGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2C</xref>), and VIGS-MaT1 results in a stronger decrease in malonylation percentage in styles than it does in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, styles contained the highest levels of IAA of all tissues analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and are likely the auxin source for at least the gynoecium, as predicted by the apical-basal gradient of auxin theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nemhauser et al., 2000</xref>). Our data from irGGPPS plants with depleted DTGs supports our hypothesis that the truncated style of VIGS-MaT1 is related to DTGs, but the exact molecular events that lead to this phenomenon remain unknown. Comparing individual DTG patterns in VIGS plants in the irGGPPS, irAOC and EV backgrounds showed that changes of individual compounds are complex. As we do not know how plants perceive DTGs, it is very challenging to figure out which individual compound or combination of individual compounds could be perceived by plants and affect YUC activity. The low abundance and structural similarity of many DTGs, along with the instability of malonylation in solution ex vivo, make purification difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heiling et al., 2016</xref>), and for the malonylated DTGs it is not feasible to obtain sufficient amounts or sufficient stability for the establishment and duration of bioassays. Furthermore, given the huge number of combinations of candidate DTGs, a gain-of-function test using specific DTGs is currently prohibitive. For example, if we were to try one or two DTGs at once, not accounting for isomers and limiting ourselves to the 16 DTG chemical formulae for which we could present relative quantification here, the total number of possible combinations is 2.8 Ã 10<sup>25</sup>. This number of course could be restricted based on comparisons of the dynamics of individual compounds to the dynamics in malonylation percentage of styles in different treatment groups (EV, irAOC, irGGPPS; VIGS-EV vs. VIGS-MaT1), although the possibility that a ratio rather than a single compound is required could still result in many combinations that require testing.</p><p>The biosynthesis and malonylation of DTGs, which are diterpenoid derivatives, may interact with other compounds from this pathway, especially some phytohormones, like strigolactones, abscisic acid, cytokinins, gibberellins and brassinosteroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cazzonelli and Pogson, 2010</xref>). Notably, flavonoids were thus far the only known secondary metabolites that could inhibit auxin transport, resulting in stunted growth in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>Medicago</italic>, tomato and apple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eckardt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Besseau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schijlen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dare et al., 2013</xref>), and malonyl-CoA is a required substrate for flavonoid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kreuzaler and Hahlbrock, 1975</xref>). It is possible that silencing <italic>NaMaT1</italic> may increase flavonoid biosynthesis, thereby affecting auxin and causing the short style phenotype. However, flavonoids did not significantly increase in VIGS-MaT1 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>), and levels of rutin even decreased. Rutin has been reported not to affect auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacobs and Rubery, 1988</xref>). In summary, the short style phenotype is a malonylation-dependent phenotype that is based specifically on DTGs. Bioassay-driven metabolite extractions from VIGS-MaT1 tissues may help to discover the specific compound(s) inhibiting YUC activity.</p><p>In conclusion, this study reveals the uniformity of specialized metabolite malonylation and the importance of this uniformity: when this uniformity is disturbed by silencing a malonyltransferase gene and its regulator, JA signaling, the cells of the tissue which accumulates the highest levels of DTGs fail to elongate normally, resulting in a stunted style phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This stunted style phenotype resulting from either JA signaling deficiencies or silencing <italic>NaMaT1</italic>, results from the inhibition of auxin biosynthesis. Elucidating how plants achieve this finely tuned DTG malonylation status, and which specific DTG structure is responsible for the inhibition of auxin biosynthesis in styles are exciting goals for future research. At a functional level, by shortening styles by titrating the degree of malonyl DTG decorations, plants may be able to regulate their outcrossing rates in response to environmental factors that influence JA signaling or DTGs accumulation, such as herbivory rates.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38611.035</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model summarizing how DTGs malonylation affects style elongation of <italic>N.Â attenuata</italic>.</title><p>Geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) forms GGPP from the MEP pathway products IPP and DMAPP.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joerg Bohlmann as the Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers and the reviewing editor found that your manuscript makes an important and new contribution to plant biology. Both reviewers have a number of comments that may help improve the paper. The reviewers' comments are below. The two reviewers have discussed their individual reviews as part of our consultation session. The major request of both reviewers is for a more detailed characterisation of the effects of NaMaT1 silencing in the backgrounds silenced for other relevant biosynthesis genes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes the role of a group of specialized (secondary) plant metabolites for normal style development and plant fertility. The authors identify the major enzyme from <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> that malonylates 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides (DTGs), a group of abundant, herbivore induced compounds in tobacco. Silencing this malonyl transferase NaMaT1 leads to reduced cell elongation in the style, and this effect appears to be mediated by a reduction in IAA biosynthesis. Importantly, it can be suppressed by silencing a key enzyme for DTG biosynthesis, arguing that the NaMaT1-VIGS effect is due to altered DTG malonylation levels. The authors also find that the short-style phenotype of JA-deficient plants that is observed in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>, but has not been described in other plants, is likely due to the influence of JA signaling on DTG malonylation levels.</p><p>Understanding how the vast diversity of plant specialized metabolites influences the plant's interactions with its environment and other organisms, but also the endogenous growth and developmental programs remains a key challenge in plant biology. In this respect, this paper provides exciting novel insight into the role of one class of specifically decorated metabolites. In particular, both the apparently strict control over the DTG malonylation levels throughout plant development and the highly specific effects of interfering with these malonylation levels highlight the functional importance of these compounds as putative novel regulators of phytohormone levels and plant growth. The manuscript thus makes an important contribution to our understanding of plant secondary metabolites.</p><p>The following three issues should be addressed to strengthen the manuscript further.</p><p>1) A key finding in this manuscript is that silencing NaMaT1 only results in short styles in a wild-type, but not in a NaGGPPS-silenced background. This experiment provides the main argument that the NaMaT1 effect is indeed mediated by the altered malonylation levels of DTGs, rather than some other undetected compound(s). However, it is not clear whether the style phenotype results from an excess accumulation of 'undermalonylated' DTGs, or from the altered malonylation percentage per se. It should be possible to address this by determining the malonylation percentage on the remaining DTGs in the VIGS-<italic>Mat1</italic> irGGPPS plants. If this is still reduced to the same extent as in VIGS-<italic>Mat1</italic> plants, it would argue that high levels of 'undermalonylated' DTGs interfere with auxin biosynthesis, rather than the malonylation level itself being critical.</p><p>2) The reason for the sterility of the VIGS-<italic>Mat1</italic> plants should be determined in more detail. Is it just the physical separation of stigma and anthers â in which case hand-pollination should rescue fertility â or is there also a functional difference in the styles that interferes with efficient pollen-tube growth or guidance, which might have interesting implications for plant incompatibility systems?</p><p>3) YUCCA activity appears to be reduced in VIGS-NaMaT1 styles, and the authors seem to favor an effect of altered DTG malonylation levels on YUCCA enzymatic activity, rather than on YUCCA gene expression. Are YUCCA mRNA levels altered in VIGS-NaMaT1 styles?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Li and coworkers report on the importance of malonylated hydroxygeranylinalool diterpene glycosides (DTGs) in <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>. They found that the malonylation percentage of DTGs was uniform in different organs of <italic>N. attenuata</italic> and after herbivore treatment. A correlation analysis lead them to the identification of three BAHD-acyltransferases (ATs), NaMaT1-3 able to catalyze a mono- and di- malonylation of the DTG, Lyciumoside IV. Virus induced gene silencing (VIGs) of NaMaT1 lead to a change in DTG malonylation patterns. A decrease in style length was the only phenotypic change for those NaMaT1-VIGs plants observed. Using plant hormone application as well as the background of knock-down plants (irGLS and irAOC) this phenotype was identified to be due to a decrease in auxin levels due to the inhibition of YUCCA. Furthermore the dependence of the effect on DTG and JA signaling could be shown.</p><p>Overall the paper tells a nice, relevant and interesting story of the complex regulation of plant metabolism and the linkage of primary and secondary metabolism. I do believe that the observed style phenotype in <italic>N. attenuata</italic> is dependent on JA signaling, DTGs and auxin and that the identified ATs are somewhat involved in DTGs malonylation. What the authors did not convince me of, yet, is that the phenotype is due to the malonylation percentage rather than key metabolites of the pathway described.</p><p>My main request is to see an analysis including individual DTGs instead of just pooling them into groups. Furthermore some sections require additional data or rephrasing.</p><p>- The authors look at DTGs based on their malonylation amounts. It would be of interest to look at single compounds. Could the observed effect of style length be due to single compounds rather than a shift in malonylation percentage? If this is not the case data should be provided to support that only the percentage changes. In fact one could test whether the percentage matters by shifting it through the application of DTG.</p><p>- The authors state that the phenotype is not observed with irGGPPS VIGS-MaT1 plants. No data however characterizing the chemo type of these plants is supplied. How do the DTGs levels compare to VIGS-MaT1 plants? The same goes for silencing efficiencies of MaT1. This holds for irAOC plants too. Please ensure that the reader has access to the full characterization: qRT for silencing,% of malonylation, mono-di-tri malonylation, style length, IAA and JA content, YUCCA activity for all the plants which are of importance to draw a conclusion. Please show whether YUCCA activity is inhibited in irGGPPS (+/- VIGS-MaT1) plants to support involvement of malonylated DTGs in this phenomenon. The authors claim that the mechanism is the same for irAOC plants. How do auxin levels look in those plants and is auxin biosynthesis (YUCCA) inhibited too?</p><p>- Expression level of MaT1 in VIGS plants was solely investigated in leaves the place of VIGS/<italic>Agrobacterium</italic> treatment. Those are however not the organs where a phenotype was observed. Explanations about the observation of a phenotype in styles, not the place of VIGS treatment should be included. The fifth paragraph of the Discussion states the style synthesises large amounts of DTGs. Why was no qRT done on styles? AT gene expression in irGGPPS and irAOC with EV and VIGS-MaT1 should be investigated in order to draw a full picture. Please answer the question of how knock down of MaT1 affects the plants in the background of irGGPPS and irAOC more carefully. For example, don't just show malonylation percentage but show at least mono-, di- and tri-malonylation. Especially as irAOC background changes malonylation percentage to be higher.</p><p>- The NaMaT1-3 enzymes mediate the mono- and di-malonylation of Lyciumoside IV. The mono-mannosylation however is unlikely to be the enzymes in vivo function as MaT1 VIGS plants produce greater amounts of the Nicotianoside I compared to EV plants. The diglycosylation, which the authors showed happens in vitro too, seems to be affected. Statements about enzyme function should be revisited in the paper as they sometimes seem rather blurry. Statements like &quot;controls the last two malonylation steps&quot; cannot be made as observed patterns can also be due to substrate limitations. In addition you cannot throw all the malonylated compounds together as one when talking about enzyme functions (unless you show that it really is one enzyme accepting those different substrates). Those compounds do differ greatly biochemically speaking. I would find it necessary to look at individual compounds rather than the pool of compounds categorized by mono-, di-, tri-malonylation, in order to figure out enzyme function. The specific enzyme function might help to prove the hypothesis about malonylation percentage or even show that the effect observed might be due to rather specific compounds. &quot;found that one MaT mediates this process&quot; is not true. Please phrase carefully. Regarding the three acyltransferases, the authors should provide details about similarity of genes/proteins mentioned in the first paragraph of the subsection âNaMaT is responsible for DTG malonylationâ. Substrate specificity of NaMaT1 should be accessed especially due to observed decrease in rutin. You might not find malonylated flavonoids, but how about NaMaT1s ability to accept other acyl donors? Statements like those in the second paragraph of the Discussion do not mean anything unless tested with the protein in question. Please state how similar NaMaT1 and NbMaT1 are. Was NbMaT1 tested with DTGs?</p><p>- I do not find it surprising that the malonylation percentage of DTGs are uniform. From the biosynthesis perspective if you activate the pathway all compounds accumulate (in case of co-regulated genes) and this is what we see. In contrast, if the malonylation percentage of DTGs has the ability to regulate auxin would you not expect the percentage to vary in different organs or developmental stages rather than to be uniform? From my point of view it is necessary to look at individual compounds. Statements in the third paragraph of the Discussion about the uniformity of DTG malonylation status in contrast to strong regulation of specialist metabolites is rather strange. DTGs appear to be regulated after all as they are induced after herbivory.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38611.046</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We were able to conduct many new measurements using plants growing in our glasshouse, and existing samples. This allowed us to address most reviewer concerns. However, we do not yet have measurements for the DTG profile of irGGPPS VIGS-MaT1 styles. We agree with the reviewers that the short style phenotype we observe could be due to one or a few individual DTGs, and we agree that analyzing the chemical profile of irGGPPS VIGS-MaT1 styles is a possible way to narrow down the number of candidates. However, based on our data describing the DTG profile in the inflorescence of irGGPPS VIGSMaT1, and stylar DTG profiles of VIGS-MaT1 in the backgrounds of EV and irAOC, we doubt very much that analysis of irGGPPS VIGS-MaT1 styles would allow us to pinpoint these putative âkeyâ DTGs. Even if it did, we would not be able to complement the short style phenotype to definitively test the role of these putative âkeyâ candidates, for several reasons, which we explain below. These explanations are followed by a point-by-point response to editor and reviewer comments.</p><p>We hope that we can address the editorsâ and reviewersâ concerns without conducting the additional experiments required to profile DTGs in irGGPPS VIGS-EV vs. VIGS-MaT1 styles.</p><p>Why we think that adding data on the DTG profile in VIGS-EV vs. VIGS-MaT1 irGGPPS styles will not substantially increase the explanatory value of our study:</p><p>Except for 3 of the at least 46 different DTGs (21 chemical formulas and several structural isomers), the individual compounds are not present in sufficient abundance for purification and complementation assays within a reasonable time frame; structural similarity of many DTGs further increases the difficulty (Heiling et al., 2016; Poreddy et al., 2015). Additionally, the malonylated compounds are not stable and previous attempts at the serial fractionation by UPLC of bulk extracts have failed regarding the malonylated derivatives (Heiling et al., 2016). Furthermore, depending on how much we could narrow down the candidate compounds, and starting from the 16 compounds for which we could present relative quantification in this manuscript (ignoring structural isomers), we could have up to (16! * 15!) + ((16!/2!) * 14!)) = 2.8 x 10<sup>25</sup> combinations to test in complementation tests if we tested combinations of 1-2 compounds (chemical formulas) â keeping in mind that even a single candidate compound may be perceived as a ratio against one or more other DTGs. Finally, we do not have a candidate mechanism, and so if we were able to test our best guesses based on comparison of the three background genotypes (EV, irAOC, irGGPPS) with VIGS-EV or VIGS-MaT1, and these tests did not produce conclusive results, there would be no clear way to proceed.</p><p>In summary, substantial additional work is required to determine the mechanism behind the role of DTGs in the short style phenotype in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>, and this work would be much more rigorous if done using an approach guided by alternative mechanistic hypotheses, rather than screening as many combinations as possible of individual metabolites for their effects on stylar elongation. Currently, the number of possibilities we could rigorously test is one (Lyciumoside IV, the only abundant nonmalonylated compound which we are able to purify in quantity), which is not likely to explain the phenotype (due to its lack of malonylation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers and the reviewing editor found that your manuscript makes an important and new contribution to plant biology.

To do so rigorously would require a tool to increase total DTG abundance without affecting malonylation percentage. The best comparison we have is the comparison of irGGPPS to EV plants (VIGS-EV); although EV has a much greater total abundance of âundermalonylatedâ DTGs, the two genotypes show similar malonylation percentages (new Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B) have styles of similar length.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reason for the sterility of the VIGS-Mat1 plants should be determined in more detail.

For example, the dimalonylated compound Nicotianoside VII is the only individual DTG which seems to follow the same pattern as malonylation percentage in the EV and irAOC backgrounds: it is elevated in VIGS-EV irAOC vs. VIGS-EV EV styles, but reduced to similar levels in VIGS-MaT1 styles of irAOC and EV plants. However, Nicotianoside VII is reduced in irGGPPS vs. EV inflorescences, regardless of VIGS treatment (it is reduced by VIGS-MaT1 in both backgrounds). It is difficult to explain how either elevated (irAOC VIGS-EV) or reduced (EV VIGS-MaT1) levels of a single compound can cause the same phenotype. We propose that this indicates that it is a ratio, or relative abundance of multiple compounds, which is decisive. An alternative hypothesis would be that homeostasis of Nicotianoside VII (as opposed to total malonylation percentage) determines the short style phenotype. Unfortunately, Nicotianoside VII is present in low abundance relative to other DTGs and has high structural similarity to three other low-abundance DTGs: Attenoside, Nicotianoside VI, and Nicotianoside VIII (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1).</p><p>Nicotianoside VII is just one candidate. As <italic>N. attenuata</italic> contains at least 46 different DTGs (21 chemical formulas and several structural isomers; Heiling et al., 2016), myriad DTGs changes could lead to this phenotype. Although total DTGs are as abundant as starch, Lyciumoside IV and its malonylated compounds, Nicotianoside I and Nicotianoside II, comprise more than 80% of total DTGs (Poreddy et al., 2015), meaning that other components are present in extremely low concentration. Together with the structural similarity and instability of the malonylated DTGs over time in solution, purification of some DTGs is challenging (Heiling et al., 2016). Heiling and colleagues were able to purify sufficient amounts for structural MS analysis, but bioassays require substantially more material and long-term stability under bioassay conditions.</p><p>In summary, all of these considerations make the use of most individual DTGs and mixes of DTGs in gain-of-function tests unfeasible. We found that the malonylation percentage is a uniform parameter, and all the phenotype patterns match very well with disturbances of the uniformity of malonylation percentage. Thus we think âmalonylation percentageâ is a good proxy for whatever the plant is specifically sensing. We agree that being able to understand exactly how plants sense âmalonylation percentageâ would be a high value target, it is clearly a question beyond the scope of this study, as it would likely require understanding the putative protein machinery involved in the sensing mechanism.</p><p>We thank you for these excellent suggestions and as we think that readers will also be thinking along similar lines, we have added a summary of these considerations in the revised Discussion section (fifth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors state that the phenotype is not observed with irGGPPS VIGS-Mat1 plants.
