Such learning is believed to emerge from alterations in network connectivity, but large-scale connectivity is difficult to measure directly, especially during learning. Here, we show that area CA1 cells converge to time-locked firing sequences that bridge the two stimuli paired during training, and this phenomenon is coupled to a reorganization of network correlations. Using two-photon calcium imaging of mouse hippocampal neurons we find that co-time-tuned neurons exhibit enhanced spontaneous activity correlations that increase just prior to learning. While time-tuned cells are not spatially organized, spontaneously correlated cells do fall into distinct spatial clusters that change as a result of learning. We propose that the spatial re-organization of correlation clusters reflects global network connectivity changes that are responsible for the emergence of the sequentially-timed activity of cell-groups underlying the learned behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01982.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01982.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01982.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ivan Pavlov famously discovered that dogs would salivate upon hearing a bell that had previously been used to signal food, even when there was no food present. This ability to connect events that occur close together in time is known as associative learning. But how is it supported within the brain?</p><p>In the late 1940s, neuroscientist Donald Hebb proposed that if one neuron persistently and repeatedly takes part in firing a second neuron, the connection between the two neurons will be strengthened. Thus, if neurons that encode the sound of a bell are active at the same time as neurons that encode receiving food, connections between the two groups will be strengthened, and this might enable the dogs to associate the two events.</p><p>However, animals can also learn to associate events that do not overlap in time. For example, we can associate a bout of food poisoning with a meal we consumed several hours earlier. In rodents, this type of learning is often studied using a task known as trace eyeblink conditioning, in which a tone signals the delivery of a puff of air to the eye after a short delay. Rodents eventually begin to blink in response to the tone, even thought the tone and the air puff are never presented simultaneously.</p><p>Two possibilities have been proposed for how this might occur: either the neurons that encode the tone remain active until delivery of the air puff, or different groups of neurons are successively activated in a relay that spans the interval between the tone and the air puff. Now, Modi et al. have used in vivo imaging in awake mice to obtain evidence in favour of the second option.</p><p>Mice were trained on the conditioning task while imaging was used to follow the activity of neurons in a region of the brain known as the hippocampus. As animals learned the task, neurons in part of the hippocampus called CA1 began to reorganize their firing patterns so that distinct groups of cells were active at each time point in the interval between the tone and the air puff. By contrast, hardly any neurons were active across the entire delay. The organized firing became particularly apparent at the same time as the mice first began to blink in response to the tone, and was only ever seen in animals that learned the task successfully.</p><p>As well as providing evidence to distinguish between competing theories of associative learning across a delay, this study is the first to follow in real-time the reorganization of networks of neurons within the hippocampus during this common type of learning.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01982.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01982.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>CA1</kwd><kwd>trace conditioning</kwd><kwd>activity sequence</kwd><kwd>noise correlation</kwd><kwd>learning and memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NLO–056727/Z/99/B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Modi</surname><given-names>Mehrab N</given-names></name><name><surname>Dhawale</surname><given-names>Ashesh K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR12531/BRB/10/747/2009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Modi</surname><given-names>Mehrab N</given-names></name><name><surname>Dhawale</surname><given-names>Ashesh K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Centre for Biological Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Modi</surname><given-names>Mehrab N</given-names></name><name><surname>Dhawale</surname><given-names>Ashesh K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>As mice learn to associate events separated in time, neurons within the CA1 region of the hippocampus progressively reorganize their firing patterns, leading to a relay of cellular activity that bridges the two events.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mechanisms of memory formation have been the subject of considerable study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kandel, 2001</xref>). Much evidence points to Hebbian plasticity as the neural mechanism for the association of two co-occurring stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bliss and Collingridge, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morris, 2003</xref>). However, this mechanism alone is not sufficient to account for learning under conditions where the two stimuli are separated in time by more than 100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levy and Steward, 1983</xref>), as has been commonly observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Solomon et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baeg et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>One example of such a time-bridging task is trace eyeblink conditioning, where the goal is to associate a neutral tone or conditioned stimulus (CS) with a temporally separated, aversive puff of air to the eye, or unconditioned stimulus (US) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McEchron and Disterhoft, 1999</xref>). After many pairings of these stimuli, the subject learns to blink in response to the tone, even though the tone and puff never overlap in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tseng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalmbach et al., 2009</xref>). Lesion studies have shown that the hippocampus is required for learning the trace conditioning task, but not a related delay conditioning task, where the CS and US overlap in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Büchel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tseng et al., 2004</xref>). These observations indicate a role for the hippocampus during the association of temporally discontiguous events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wallenstein et al., 1998</xref>), specifically during the ‘trace’ period separating stimulus pairs.</p><p>How might a network of neurons maintain a representation of the stimulus through time? Two possible models have been proposed. The first model hypothesizes that the representation of the first stimulus is maintained by the sustained firing of stimulus-selective cells through a trace interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Solomon et al., 1986</xref>). Such a model is supported by observations of sustained firing by neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fuster, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baeg et al., 2003</xref>) and the medial entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egorov et al., 2002</xref>) during working memory tasks. An alternative model proposes that sensory representations are maintained by the sequential activation of groups of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Howe and Levy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacDonald et al., 2013</xref>). This view arose from modeling studies that trained simple hippocampal area CA3 network models on the trace conditioning task. Rather than observing sustained firing, the authors found that groups of neurons began to show activity in well-timed, sequential bouts. Neurons representing the CS kicked off this ‘relay’ of activation, which eventually activated US representing neurons at the appropriate time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Howe and Levy, 2007</xref>). However, this model awaits experimental verification.</p><p>Sequential activity in hippocampal CA1 cells has been seen previously, albeit in some very different behavioral contexts, including temporal memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Louie and Wilson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gill et al., 2011</xref>). There has also been a series of recent, more closely related studies of hippocampal activity, in which rats or monkeys performed stimulus-retention tasks where they had to remember an odor or visual stimulus in order to receive a reward. Here too, hippocampal CA1 neurons were observed to be active in stimulus-triggered, time-locked sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Naya and Suzuki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kraus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacDonald et al., 2013</xref>). It is increasingly clear that hippocampal CA1 cells adopt sequential activity patterns when subjects are placed in a behavioral context requiring the bridging of temporally separated stimuli. However, in all the studies where this has been observed, only well-trained subjects were used, leaving the time course and mechanism of the emergence of sequentially timed activity entirely unknown.</p><p>Despite sequential activity having been implicated in several temporal memory tasks, there is little experimental data on the network changes that underlie its emergence. Functional connectivity, as measured by correlations between neuronal activity in the absence of stimulus presentation, is one way to monitor such network changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ts’o et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bair et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>). In a study using two photon calcium imaging of motor cortex pyramidal neuron activity, changes in spontaneous activity correlations have been inferred to indicate learning-related circuit plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komiyama et al., 2010</xref>). In another study where rats were exploring a novel track, correlations between pairs of place cells increased with increasing exposure to the novel environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Frank, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013</xref>). With the ability to measure changes in input from upstream circuits using spontaneous activity correlations across many cells in the network, two-photon recordings allow the testing of predictions from the model proposed for the emergence of sequential activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Howe and Levy, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, such recordings provide relative cell locations within the hippocampus, allowing one to examine the spatial organization of activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hampson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brivanlou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kjelstrup et al., 2008</xref>). As learning progresses, one should see changes in spontaneous correlations reflecting altered inputs and changes in network connectivity.</p><p>Two key questions remain unanswered in the absence of data recorded from large numbers of neurons during training on a temporal memory task – how do sequential activity representations in the hippocampus emerge during learning, and what are the underlying changes in network connectivity? In this study, we train mice on a trace eyeblink conditioning task while recording activity from populations of area CA1 neurons using two photon calcium imaging. In order to eliminate the influence of running or changing spatial position on hippocampal activity, we implemented a trace eye-blink conditioning task for head-fixed mice. Further, our activity measurements revealed CA1 network dynamics during learning, as we began with naïve mice and trained them to criterion within the recording session. We found that sequentially timed activity of groups of area CA1 cells emerged progressively during the course of learning. Additionally, mean spontaneous activity correlations at the network level rose transiently, while only the correlations between co-tuned cells remained elevated towards the end of the session. Finally, we observed spatially organized clusters of neurons that had elevated spontaneous activity correlations. These correlation clusters re-organized during learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Using two-photon calcium imaging, we monitored the activity of large numbers of neurons in area CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus in awake, head-fixed mice while they were trained on a trace eyeblink conditioning task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01982.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavior: trace eye-blink conditioning of mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon schematic of experimental system.

Tone and puff were non-overlapping and separated by a 250 ms interval, thus requiring the subject to maintain a representation or ‘trace’ of the tone (CS) in order to associate it with the puff (US). Behavioral responses were measured by recording deflections in eyelid position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>We found that naïve mice responded to tone presentation with small, but distinct and measurable eyelid movements early in training, even on trials prior to the introduction of the puff stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Following repeated pairings of tone and puff, however, blink responses to tone increased significantly (&gt;2 standard deviations [SD]) in amplitude and duration, (<italic>n =</italic> 9 of 18 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). Conditioned Response (CR) trials were defined as those trials in the training session whose area under the eyelid–position curve, during the interval spanning tone onset to puff onset, was significantly larger than the pre-training baseline (‘Materials and methods-Behavioral training’). We next established a performance score by measuring the ratio of CR blink rates to spontaneous blink rates (‘Materials and methods-Data analysis’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). As a learning control, we randomized the relative timing of tone and puff from trial to trial, for a different set of mice. These pseudo-conditioned mice did not demonstrate an increase in blink amplitude or duration (performance scores, trace = 8.74 ± 2.73, pseudo = 1.96 ± 0.44, mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>, two-sample <italic>t</italic> test, p=0.012). 9 of 18 trace conditioned mice had performance scores higher than those of the pseudo-conditioned mice.</p><p>We next examined the performance of each mouse, to assess which individual mice learned the task, and if so, at what trial number in the training session. We used a previously described expectation maximization algorithm to assess whether each individual mouse had learned the association, and to obtain learning curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). Briefly, the algorithm uses the list of CR trials for a given mouse, along with the chance probability of the occurrence of a well-timed, significant blink to estimate the probability of CR production at each trial in the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Furthermore, the trial at which a mouse has learned the task is statistically defined. It is the first trial when the lower 95% confidence interval of the probability of CR production rises and remains above chance. As per this criterion, 9 out of 18 trace conditioned mice learned the association. The mean of the individual learning trials was 26 ± 5 (mean ± SD, n = 9 learners; for six of these learner mice, imaging data was also acquired, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> shows high-speed video of mouse blinks before and after learning).

In part, this was because we were restricted to training mice for only a single session due to the limited residence time of calcium indicator dye in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stosiek et al., 2003</xref>). These non-learners most likely represent a heterogeneous population of mice at different stages of learning involving multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalmbach et al., 2009</xref>). In other words, given more training sessions, many of these mice would likely have learned this task to criterion. Consequently, the interpretation of area CA1 calcium imaging data from ‘non-learners’ is complicated by the uncertain state of learning of each mouse. Hence, in most analyses, we have not used data from these mice. However, for completeness, we have included data from non-learners in key figures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cells in hippocampal area CA1 imaged from awake, behaving mice exhibit temporal tuning</title><p>We surgically exposed the left, dorsal hippocampus of naïve mice and bolus loaded a synthetic calcium indicator dye.

Second, the summed area under the calcium curve was also calculated for all datasets, and those datasets that showed a significant drift between early and late trials were discarded (n = 1 of 21; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01982.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Two-photon imaging of calcium-responses in area CA1 neurons from awake mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the imaging preparation. o–objective lens, s–skull, cs–cover slip, hb–head bar, ag–agarose.

First, we determined whether or not cells showed sustained activity through the entire period of interest by measuring how wide each cell’s response was at half the amplitude of the peak of the response. The mean response width measured in this manner was found to be 120 ms ± 81 ms (mean ± SD, n = 542 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Only three cells (∼0.5%, of all cells) had response widths greater than 600 ms, the length of the period from tone-onset to puff-onset. Based on this analysis, we concluded that sustained cell activation is not the mechanism used by the hippocampus to maintain a stimulus representation. We next looked for indications of sequential activation. Prior to learning, calcium response peaks were not reliably timed across trials, relative to tone onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel). Post learning, however, we observed that area CA1 cells had activity peaks at fixed time-points relative to tone onset, seen consistently across multiple trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel). We further characterized this by averaging these ΔF/F activity traces over trials and identifying activity peaks within the time window from tone onset to 200 milliseconds after puff onset. We rank ordered cells based on the timings of their activity peaks and found that small groups of cells firing at each time-point, tiled the entire interval of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). When the same procedure (averaging followed by sorting by timing) was carried out on traces from the pre-training dataset, tiling was markedly skewed with most cells (66% in this case) showing activity peaks during the tone period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, if neurons in the pre-training dataset were ordered as per timing of peaks in the training session, no clear tiling was visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This indicated that timings of peak activity of area CA1 cells, relative to the onset of tone stimulus, changed during training. Furthermore, at the population level, these peak times appeared to tile the interval of interest between tone and puff.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>After learning, area CA1 cells show reliably timed, sequential calcium-responses</title><p>Having observed that area CA1 cells were active at fixed time-points relative to tone onset, we next wanted to quantify the reliability with which cells fired at these times. For each cell, we defined the timing of the peak in its averaged ΔF/F trace as its peak response time (PT). We then quantified the reliability with which cells fired at their respective PTs, from trial to trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows a cell reliably firing at a particular PT). First, we reasoned that if cells show time-aligned activity, the peak of the trial-averaged ΔF/F trace would be higher than if activity were not reliably timed. Hence, we computed the peaks of the averaged ΔF/F traces during the tone-onset to puff-onset period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The mean peak amplitude for cells from trace conditioned mice was significantly higher than for cells from pseudo-conditioned mice or for spontaneous activity data (trace = 0.022 ± 0.007, pseudo = 0.017 ± 0.009, spontaneous = 0.015 ± 0.008; mean ± SEM; one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey Kramer honest significant difference (h.s.d.) p&lt;0.01). The difference seen was a small one, but this measure does not control for differences in cell response sizes or average activity. Hence, to more rigorously characterize activity timing reliability, we computed a reliability score for each cell.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01982.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>After training, area CA1 cells show reliably timed, sequential calcium responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Calcium response traces for an example neuron, aligned to the time of stimulus delivery (tone and puff indicated by yellow and red bars at bottom respectively).

In this figure, we plotted the cell-averaged reliability score calculated using trial a range of trial bin-widths.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref> of the main text, reliability scores were calculated by averaging different numbers of trials (trial bin widths of 24 [on average] and 5 respectively). The size of the highest peak in the averaged trace from randomly time-shuffled trials depends on the number of time-shuffled trials averaged. Hence, the reliability score depends on the trial-bin width used to calculate it. As seen in this panel, the highest cell-averaged reliability scores for trial bin-widths of 5 and 25 closely match the reliability scores seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref> respectively.

Activity peak timings were calculated for the early half of the session by averaging activity traces for trials 1 to 25.

These two sets of peak-timings were then compared with the final, post-learning peak timings determined by averaging a non-overlapping set of trials from the 26–50 trial window. The absolute differences in peak timing have been plotted for trace learners (blue), pseudo-conditioned mice (green), spontaneous activity (red) and non-learners (cyan). For trace learners, the mean timing-difference is significantly higher for peak timings determined early in the session (solid colored bars) than for those determined in the latter half (bars with black hatch pattern).

We achieved this by pseudo-randomly shifting single-trial ΔF/F traces for each cell in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For every cell, a reliability score was then computed as the ratio of the peak area of averaged ΔF/F traces to the peak area of averaged, random time-offset traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Hence, the reliability score refers to the size of a time-aligned peak, expressed in multiples of that seen after random shifting. To aid in the intuitive understanding of this score, we report here the reliability score of the example neuron whose traces have been shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, which is clearly firing reliably at a particular time (RS = 2.5). That is, the area under the peak of the averaged curve for this cell is more than double that obtained after giving random offsets to individual trials.</p><p>Reliability scores for area CA1 cells in mice that learned the task (n = 542 cells from 6 mice), were significantly higher than reliability scores for neurons from pseudo-conditioned mice (n = 498 cells from 6 mice), non-learners (n = 612 cells from 8 mice) and for spontaneous activity data from the trace learners (trace = 3.12 ± 0.20, pseudo = 1.35 ± 0.08, spontaneous = 0.84 ± 0.07, non- learners = 1.72 ± 0.13; mean ± SEM; ANOVA followed by h.s.d., p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Since the peak timing reliability scores for cells from trace learners were significantly higher than those for controls, we concluded that only neurons from trace conditioned, learner mice had reliably time-tuned peaks in the ΔF/F trace. On plotting the distribution of all reliability scores obtained for cells from trace learners, we found that 44% of neurons had reliability scores close to 1, that is they displayed no time-locked activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Hence, for all subsequent analysis involving time-tuned activity, 50% of the neurons with the lowest reliability scores were discarded so that we could focus on the cells that did have significant time-tuning. The same treatment (calculation of reliability scores and then discarding the poorest 50%) was also given to control data from the spontaneous activity period, from pseudo-conditioned mice, or from non-learner mice.</p><p>Having seen that reliable time-tuning emerges only in trace conditioned mice we next examined the emergence of time-tuning during training. We quantified how the reliability in peak-timing changed as the training session progressed. The same reliability score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>) was calculated for the 50% most reliable neurons in five-trial blocks (‘Materials and methods: Data analysis’). We found that the reliability scores for neurons from trace learners increased over the training session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and that this increase was significantly greater than that seen in pseudo-conditioned mice or in spontaneous activity data from trace conditioned mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, ANOVA followed by Tukey–Kramer h.s.d., p&lt;0.01). Interestingly, the first trial bin where the increase in reliability scores is seen is for trials 21–25. This coincides well with the mean behavioral learning trial (24 ± 1 for imaged mice, 26 ± 2 for all mice mean ± SEM).</p><p>The peak reliability score seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> is lower than that seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. This is because the number of trials used to calculate the score in each case is different (bin-widths of 5 and 24 respectively). The size of the peaks in the averaged trace from randomly time-shuffled trials depends on the number of trials averaged together since averaging time-shuffled traces would cause isolated peaks to collapse in proportion to the number of trials averaged. On the other hand, peaks aligned in time across trials would reinforce each other upon averaging. We computed reliability scores for different bin sizes and found that mean reliability score increases with the number of trials used to compute it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This explains the difference in peak reliability scores seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>.</p><p>We concluded that time-selective area CA1 cell activity emerged progressively, as the mouse learned an association between two stimuli separated in time. Furthermore, the time-course of their emergence matched the average time taken by mice to learn the association.</p><p>We next considered two possible phenomena that might account for the improvement of reliability scores with learning. First, a cell may have a fixed activity peak timing from the beginning of the session, but not fire on every trial. In such a case, if the cell gradually started firing at the same, fixed peak-timing on a greater fraction of trials, its reliability score would increase. The cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> is such a cell. Alternatively, the timing of peak activity of the cell might change (e.g., the cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Such a cell too, would show an increase in reliability score. We therefore computed scores that distinguished between these phenomena, to establish that the predominant effect of learning involves changes in cell activity peak timings, and not their response probabilities.</p><p>First, we assessed the extent to which increases in trial to trial response probability affected reliability scores, ignoring changes in peak timing. We calculated local reliability scores as training progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Here, the timings at which reliability scores were calculated were re-estimated for each five-trial bin. Hence, if peak-timing were to shift during training, it would not affect the reliability score. On the other hand, if cells began to show activity on a larger proportion of trials, the score would increase. On average, no training-related increases in local reliability score were detectable. This indicates that most cells do not increase their response probability with training.</p><p>We next quantified how local activity peak timings for each neuron differed from the peak timings found after learning. Half the trials after the learning trials were used to estimate post-learning activity peak timings for all cells. Then, we computed local peak timings for 10-trial bins through the entire session and computed the absolute difference between these local peak timings and the post-learning peak timings. These differences served to estimate how far, on average, cell peak timings were from their values after learning. We observed a gradual decrease in absolute peak timing difference as training progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>) for cells from learners. Such a decrease was not seen for peak timing differences computed for cells from pseudo-conditioned mice, spontaneous activity data or non-learners. We also calculated the same peak timing differences, binning all trials before and after learning. The difference in peak timings from the post-learning peak timings was high prior to learning, and reduced to the order of a single frame-time post learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>) for trace learners. For mice that learned the association, the absolute difference in peak timings prior to, and post learning, were significantly different (ANOVA followed by Tukey Kramer h.s.d, p&lt;0.01). No such decrease in peak timing difference was seen for any of the control cases. Hence, we concluded that reliability scores increase as learning progresses and that this increase is mainly due to changes in the peak-timings of cell activity during learning.</p><p>To characterize the changes in peak timings of cell populations due to learning, we next examined the distributions of the PTs of all neurons pooled across trace conditioned mice, at various stages of learning. The distribution was clearly non-uniform both before (χ<sup>2</sup> goodness of fit test with uniform expected distribution; χ<sup>2</sup> = 69.14, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) as well as at an early stage of trace conditioning (χ<sup>2</sup> = 61.92, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). However, for the group of trials after the learning trial, the distribution was much closer to a uniform distribution (χ<sup>2</sup> = 20.53, p=0.015, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Thus, the highly non-uniform PT distributions prior to and early in training became more uniform, effectively tiling the entire period of interest as a result of trace conditioning.</p><p>If neuronal activity is indeed sequential and time-locked, it should be possible to use activity data to decode time since tone onset. Thus, as an independent test of time-locking of activity, we formulated a simple time-decoding algorithm based on template matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenton and Muller, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; ‘Materials and methods: Data analysis’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The decoder uses single-frame, ΔF/F fluorescence values from cell-populations on single trials to decode time elapsed since tone presentation. The time-decoder prediction accuracy scores (normalized to decoder accuracy for control, time-shuffled data) for data from trace learners were significantly higher than those for data from pseudo-conditioned mice, spontaneous activity data from trace learners and data from non-learners (trace = 2.28 ± 0.27, pseudo = 1.26 ± 0.10, spontaneous = 1.37 ± 0.06, non-learners = 1.59 ± 0.16, mean ± SEM; ANOVA, followed by Tukey Kramer h.s.d., p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). As with the activity timing reliability score, the time decoder prediction score is also expressed in multiples of the score achieved using temporally randomized, control data. Hence, a decoder score of 2 would indicate prediction capability twice as good as that obtained with randomized data. To aid an intuitive understanding of the score, we also calculated the percentage of decoder frame-number predictions that were within one frame of the correct frame. For activity data from trace learners, the percentage was 70.3%, for pseudo-conditioned mice it was 32.4%, for spontaneous activity data it was 47.6%, and for non-learners it was 53.1%. The mean correct prediction percentage by random chance was 28.8%. The mean performance scores reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> closely match the values obtained by taking the ratio of these prediction percentages to the chance prediction percentage.</p><p>We also checked if neurons sharing time-tuning were spatially clustered within the hippocampus. The mean pair-wise distance between neurons sharing time-tuning was not significantly different from the mean distance between random pairs of neurons, that is neurons sharing time-tuning were not spatially clustered together (mean ± SEM distance for same time-tuning 71.27 ± 1.53 µm, random 70.89 ± 0.62 µm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>; two-sample <italic>t</italic> test p=0.73).</p><p>Together, these data suggested that prior to training, area CA1 cells responded in a manner that was stimulus locked. These cells began to show reliably timed, sequential activity when mice were learning a task that required the maintenance of a sensory representation through a trace time-interval. Training caused a shift in the distribution of these activity peak times towards more uniform coverage of the interval of interest, spanning tone and puff stimulus durations as well as the intervening trace period.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Noise-correlations increase transiently during learning, especially between similarly time-tuned neurons</title><p>Trial by trial correlations in spontaneous activity (noise correlations or NC) have been used previously as a measure of functional connectivity and have been thought to indicate the presence of direct (monosynaptic) or indirect, polysynaptic connections between correlated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ts’o et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bair et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>).

We gave the spontaneous period activity trace of each neuron a time-offset equal to the relative timing of its activity peak timing within the stimulus period sequence. Then, we calculated the correlation coefficients between all such peak-time offset traces. If the same sequence indeed recurred during spontaneous activity, these correlations would be higher. As a control, we gave these spontaneous activity traces randomly chosen time-offsets from the set of peak-timings observed. Correlations for peak-timing offset traces were not significantly different from those for randomly offset traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>; peak-time offset 0.048 ± 0.0012, random offset 0.047 ± 0.0009, means ± SE; two sample <italic>t</italic> test, p=0.71). However, it must be pointed out that if sequence replay events are rare in comparison to spontaneous activity of area CA1 cells, then the correlation analysis described above, coupled with the limited size of our dataset (to minimize calcium indicator dye photo-bleaching) might not have the statistical power to detect them. Furthermore, spontaneous, sequential replay activity could still be occurring, but at an accelerated time-scale, as has been observed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>). Such fast replay events would not be resolvable, given our temporal resolution capability.</p><p>Surprisingly, spontaneous activity correlations for trace learners were observed to drop towards pre-training levels in the second half of the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This has been observed previously in the context of rats repeatedly exploring a novel track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Frank, 2008</xref>). Here, the reduction in spontaneous activity correlations was ascribed to a reduction in the novelty of the particular congruence of stimuli related to the track being explored. Hence, the reduction in noise correlations we observe could also be a post-learning phenomenon, related to a reduction in the novelty of the specific congruence of the paired CS and US stimuli. To support this interpretation, we ruled out possible technical contributors to the reduction in correlations. First, the reduction in correlations were not due to a gradual decline in the quality of optical activity recordings, since we found that recordings remained stable through the training session, as discussed in ‘Results: Cells in hippocampal area CA1 imaged from awake, behaving mice exhibit temporal tuning’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>. Second, this effect was not due to mice paying less attention to the task or fatiguing towards the end of the session. We tested this by measuring the sizes and peak latencies of the significant blinks before and after trial 25, where the decline in spontaneous correlations was seen to begin. Mean significant blink sizes before and after trial 25 were not significantly different (mean normalized early blink size = 1.03 ± 0.06, late = 0.95 ± 0.03, mean ± SEM; two sample <italic>t</italic> test p=0.62; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Additionally, mean significant blink peak latency from the time of tone onset did not change from the first to the second half of the session (early latency = 565.3 ± 68.5 ms, late latency = 538.7 ± 92.3 ms; mean ± SEM; two sample <italic>t</italic> test p=0.80; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Hence, we concluded that blink responses remained stable across the two halves of the session, and that a lack of sustained attention was not likely to be the cause of the reduction in noise correlations.</p><p>To summarize, spontaneous activity was seen to become more correlated as a result of trace conditioning, following which time-tuning peaked and mice learned the temporal association. Furthermore, neurons that eventually shared the same time-tuning, showed the greatest increases in NC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Correlated cell-groups are organized into spatial clusters that are re-organized by training</title><p>We next checked if area CA1 cells could be separated into groups sharing high within-group NC and low across-group NC.

We considered spontaneous activity data from three segments of the session comprising early, middle and late blocks of trials. We then measured the similarity between pairs of matched clusters obtained using data from different trial blocks. The similarity score measured the mean fraction of neurons belonging to clusters matched across these blocks, normalized to the mean overlap between random cell-clusters of the same sizes. For example, a high similarity score for a cluster (&gt;&gt; 1) would indicate a similarity much greater than chance, implying that this cluster is well preserved from one trial block to the next. Interestingly, we found highly reliable groupings (i.e., high similarity scores) in the pre-training session datasets, indicating stable patterns of input from upstream neuronal populations (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) prior to training. In contrast, cell-groupings changed drastically during the trace conditioning session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>), and were significantly less stable than those in the pre-training datasets. For pseudo-conditioned mice, cell groupings were reliable throughout the training session datasets (ANOVA followed by Tukey Kramer h.s.d., p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>).

This phenomenon became prominent at the same trial in the session at which mice learned the association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The emergence of activity sequences and learning were closely preceded by a transient increase in noise-correlations, and was accompanied by modifications to spatially organized clustering of correlated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6">Figure 4A,B, 5F, 6A–C</xref>). As has been seen before in the context of place cells, we found that neurons related to sequential activity were not spatially organized within the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dombeck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Stimulus representation by activity sequences–the ‘trace’ in trace eyeblink conditioning</title><p>The objective of this study was to shed light on the role played by the hippocampus in the association of stimuli separated in time, specifically during trace eyeblink conditioning. Previous work had identified neurons that were primarily air-puff responsive early in training, but became progressively more tone responsive as training proceeded. This process was thought to ascribe US valence to the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McEchron and Disterhoft, 1999</xref>). The progressive changes in neuronal activity timing we observed are consistent with this finding, as a small subset of neurons did indeed shift from being tone to puff responsive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>). However, the predominant learning-related change we observed was the emergence of sequentially timed activity of groups of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E,J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Here, we note that calcium response recordings typically have a time resolution of about 100 ms, a time window within which entire sequences of neuronal activation have been known to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>). Hence, we interpret our data to be indicative of sequential activity with respect to time-windows comparable to the average frame time (74 ms) of our recordings. Even at our lower time resolution, the total space of possible sequences is very large. Our study thus indicates that a very small fraction of all possible sequences is important for successful trace conditioning. Grouped by activity peaks within ∼70 ms time-windows, neurons might show finer-scale sequences or even fluctuations that would not be visible in our recordings. However, at the time-scale of a few hundred milliseconds relevant to trace conditioning, area CA1 cells show progressively emerging activity sequences after network re-organization during learning.</p><p>Another suggested model for stimulus trace representation involves sustained neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Solomon et al., 1986</xref>). We saw no evidence to support this model. Our observation of the progressive formation of cell activation sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figure 2C,D, 3E,J</xref>) significantly extends our understanding by revealing how the representation of the tone stimulus is maintained over the tone-puff interval in the trace conditioning task.</p><p>Time-tuned firing has previously been interpreted to imply that neurons encode time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>) or that they encode a triggering stimulus in the form of a well-timed sequence, effectively bridging two temporally separated stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Itskov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacDonald et al., 2013</xref>). Stimulus representation by sequential activity would also allow for the association of two temporally separated stimuli, by maintaining a representation of the first stimulus until the arrival of the second one. This would then allow Hebbian plasticity to strengthen synapses linking the neurons associated with the non-stationary, sequential stimulus representation. This stimulus maintenance is necessary since Hebbian plasticity cannot occur with stimuli separated by over ∼100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levy and Steward, 1983</xref>).</p><p>Simulation studies of the hippocampal CA3 network, have shown that stimuli separated in time can be ‘bridged’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wallenstein et al., 1998</xref>). Simple recurrent network models of the hippocampal CA3 region have also been trained on a close proxy of the trace conditioning paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Howe and Levy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levy et al., 2005</xref>). Notably, in these studies, the tone stimulus triggers a well-timed relay of CA3 cell activation that culminates in the activation of US representing neurons. Our experimental observations are in agreement with this model, if we assume that qualitatively, grouping in area CA1 cell activity reflects grouping of upstream CA3 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brivanlou et al., 2004</xref>). We suggest that the <italic>progressive</italic> emergence of sequentially timed activity we observe in our study is a signature of such network changes.</p><p>Sequential activity has been observed before, in subjects that have already learnt a temporal memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>).

Post training, we observed sequential activation over an 800 ms period, which is a task relevant timescale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly, to our knowledge, our study is the first to monitor the emergence of these sequences over the entire process of learning a temporal memory task (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). As we discuss below, this has allowed us to identify transient, learning-related network changes in spontaneous activity correlations that could underlie the emergence of the longer lasting sequential activity.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01982.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary and model schematics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic summarizing findings: early in the session (top), neuron activity peaks are tuned to stimuli. Spontaneous activity is largely un-correlated. By the middle of the session (center), time-tuned activity during the stimulus period begins to emerge, after spontaneous activity correlations have risen. At the end of the session (bottom), stimulus–period activity is time-tuned, but spontaneous correlations have fallen back towards baseline levels. (<bold>B</bold>) Cartoon model of possible network changes occurring at the synaptic level: early in training (top), CA3 to CA1 synapses (gray circles) are at baseline strengths. As training progresses, specific synapses are strengthened (larger gray circles), towards the middle of the session (middle). At this point, neurons that share time tuning also begin to display increased noise-correlations as they receive more common input. Late in the training session (bottom), after repeated re-organization of the network, synapses undergo homeostatic normalization (gray circles reduced in size), thus causing total common input and spontaneous activity correlations to drop. (<bold>C</bold>) Schematic diagram depicting network changes at the level of groups of cells. CA1 cell clusters (horizontal row at bottom of each panel; clusters are color-coded) have high correlations in spontaneous activity, receiving shared input (direction indicated with black arrows) from groups of CA3 cells that are also correlated in their spontaneous activity. These correlation-groups of cells are spatially clustered. As learning progresses, the clusters of correlated CA3 cells change, resulting in changes in the groups of correlated CA1 cells. These new groups are also spatially organized, but differ significantly from pre-training groups.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01982.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01982.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01982-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>As discussed earlier (‘Results: Mice learn a trace eyeblink conditioning task within a single session’), area CA1 activity data pooled from non-learners is probably confounded by contrary effects due to the uncertain state of learning of each mouse. However, for the sake of completeness, we have included data from non-learners in some key figures. These panels show that the data from non-learners is consistent with our interpretations and that trace learners are significantly different from non-learners as well as from pseudo-conditioned mice, in all cases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Network reorganization during learning is reflected in changes in spatially organized noise correlations</title><p>Correlations between neurons during periods of spontaneous activity or noise correlations (NC) have been thought to be indicative either of shared inputs, or of direct or indirect connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ts’o et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bair et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>). While high temporal resolution measurements of neuronal activity are required to infer direct, synaptic connectivity, we, in our study, infer changes in NC to be indicative of changes in clustering of inputs to CA1 cells from upstream CA3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komiyama et al., 2010</xref>). This view is consistent with earlier findings where the correlations between place cell pairs were seen to increase as rats explored a novel track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Frank, 2008</xref>). Importantly, this increase in correlations was dependent on the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and, therefore, the capacity for synaptic plasticity in area CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013</xref>). We found that cell-pairs that eventually share the same time-tuning show significantly higher increases in NC than do random cell-pairs, though on average, all cell-pairs show a significant increase in pair-wise correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). We interpret this to be due to increased common input from changing groupings of inter-connected CA3 neurons. However, this increase is temporary as average NC declines near the end of the session, although neurons sharing the same time-tuning still maintain significantly elevated NC. This is consistent with a previous observation that novelty-induced increases in spontaneous correlations gradually reduce with repeated exposure to the novel environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Frank, 2008</xref>). The transient, global increase in NC may arise from a network-wide increase in synaptic weights during learning, and the subsequent decline may reflect weakening of mean synaptic weights due to synaptic re-normalization (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, we observed that mean NC peaked just prior to the peaks in behavioral responsiveness and reliability of sequential activity, even on an individual mouse basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Similar results have also been observed in previous studies. Cortical neurons sharing task-specific tuning were seen to increase their spontaneous correlations as learning progressed on a sensory association task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komiyama et al., 2010</xref>). In recordings from rodent CA1 neurons, place cells were seen to show gradually increasing spontaneous correlations as a novel environment was explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Frank, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, over extended exposure to the same novel track, these elevated correlations gradually reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Frank, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, when neurons were divided into clusters that shared high NC, these clusters turned out to be spatially organized even prior to training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). This might indicate that area CA1 cells receive spatially segregated input from bundles of area CA3 cells. This is borne out by the observation of spatially segregated connectivity from CA3 to CA1 cells in hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brivanlou et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, we observed that these spatially segregated clusters changed only during learning, while in pseudo-conditioned mice and in data collected prior to training, NC clusters remained relatively constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This indicates that during learning, area CA1 cells (and probably also, by extension, CA3 cells) enter a dynamic state, where neurons change from one spatially-organized, correlated grouping to another (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In our view, these fluctuating, spatial groupings reflect network changes that underlie the emergence of spatially un-organized, behavior-related sequentially timed activity.</p><p>We propose that when learning the trace eyeblink conditioning task, and perhaps more generally when associating temporally separated stimuli, the hippocampus is recruited as follows:</p><p>Through a network-wide, transient increase in specific synaptic strengths within the CA3 and in the CA3 to CA1 network, changing groups of CA3 cells remodel the strengths of their connections to CA1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). This is reflected in changing clusters of area CA1 cells showing increased noise-correlations. Progressively, these groups stabilize into a sequence of stimulus-activated cell-groups, after which global synaptic re-normalization causes average noise correlations to move back towards baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Only neurons sharing the same timing in the sequence maintain significantly elevated noise correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Importantly, these spontaneously correlated clusters of cells are also spatially clustered and changes in these clusters underlie the emergence of sequentially activated cell-groups. These sequential groups allow CS-representing neurons to be indirectly connected to US-representing neurons, thereby forming an association between stimuli separated in time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and surgical procedure</title><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the National Centre for Biological Sciences Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (Protocol number USB–19–1/2011), in accordance with the guidelines of the Government of India (animal facility CPCSEA registration number 109/1999/CPCSEA) and equivalent guidelines of the Society for Neuroscience. All recordings and behavioral experiments were carried out on male, 30 to 45 day old C57BL/6 mice. Data acquired from a total of 35 mice is included here. A total of 18 mice were trace conditioned, and 17 mice pseudo-conditioned. Of the 18 trace conditioned mice, 9 learned the task to criterion and the other 9 failed to learn. Imaging data was acquired for 14 of the trace conditioned mice. Of these, 6 were learners and 8 were non-learners.

Temperature was maintained using a heating-pad (TR-200, Fine Science Tools, Canada). Dexamethasone 5 mg/kg body weight was injected sub-cutaneously to minimize swelling and bleeding prior to the surgery. The mouse was then head-fixed (Item 51547; Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) and a custom designed brass head-bar was affixed to the skull using skull-screws (83,438; Micro-Mark, Berkeley Heights, NJ, USA) and dental acrylic. The dorsal hippocampal surface (ipsi-lateral to the side of tone and air-puff delivery) was exposed through a craniotomy (2.0 mm posterior to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral to the mid-line [ipsi-lateral to the side of stimulus delivery]; diameter ∼ 1–1.5 mm) after gently aspirating away over-lying cortex to expose the external capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dombeck et al., 2007</xref>). Exposed brain-matter was constantly irrigated with cortex buffer (CB; in mM: NaCl–125, KCl–5, glucose–10, HEPES–10, CaCl2–2 and MgCl2–2. pH set to 7.35 with NaOH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holtmaat et al., 2005</xref>). A fluorescent indicator of calcium (O6807; Oregon Green BAPTA-1 AM ester, Molecular Probes - Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) was bolus loaded by pressure injection into the hippocampus, at a depth of ∼100 µm. Pressure injections were delivered using glass pipettes with tip impedances of 2–3 Mohms and pressure pulses of 5–10 psi for 3 to 5 min (Picospritzer-III, Parker-Hannifin, Cleveland, OH, USA). Dye solution was prepared by solubilizing 50 µg of dye (one vial) in 5 µl of a detergent (P-3000MP; 20% Pluronic acid, Invitrogen - Life Technologies), and then diluting down to 1 µg/µl by adding 45 µl of CB. The gap left behind by aspirated cortex was then filled by pouring molten, low-melting agarose solution (A9414; 5% in CB, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) into the craniotomy and covering with a 5 mm, circular cover-slip (CS-5R; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA). The cover-slip was then fixed in place with dental acrylic. A fragment from a freshly shattered Neodymium magnet was affixed to the left, upper-eyelid using cyano-acrylate glue. Dexamethasone (5 (± 2) µg/g body weight) was injected sub-cutaneously to minimize swelling and bleeding at the beginning of the surgery. Fortwin (Pentazoncine, 5 µg/g body weight) was administered sub-cutaneously at the end of the surgery, as an analgesic. The mouse was then released and given 95% O<sub>2</sub> to breathe until vigorous toe-pinch responses were seen and was then transferred to a closed cage with food and water for 1.5–2 hr, to recover before imaging began. OGB-1 dye, once loaded into neurons, allows imaging for a limited period before clearance from neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stosiek et al., 2003</xref>). This limited the viability of the imaging preparation to a few hours, corresponding to a single behavioral session.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral training</title><p>1.5 to 2 hr after recovery from anesthesia, mice were head-fixed on a custom-designed clamp (gift from the Albeanu Lab, Cold Spring Habor Laboratory, New York, NY, USA) and mounted onto the stage of a custom-built, two-photon microscope. Left eyelid blink responses were recorded using a custom-made magnetometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koekkoek et al., 2002</xref>) positioned close to (1–3 mm away) the neodymium magnet fragment glued to the eyelid and was left un-disturbed throughout the experiment. The magnetometer was constructed using a magneto-resistive sensor (HMC1051Z; Honeywell, Linden, NJ, USA), whose output was further amplified (SR560; Stanford Research Systems) and digitized at 10 KHz using a data acquisition card (PCI-6221; National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). The tone, conditioned stimulus was delivered using a speaker positioned to the left of the mouse. The stimulus was a pure tone of frequency 9.5 KHz, delivered at an intensity of 80–90 dB at the microscope stage and of 350 ms duration. In a pre-training session, only tones were delivered for 30 trials. Blink responses were acquired for 5 s prior to tone onset and terminated 10 s after tone onset. The inter-trial interval was randomized between 15 and 30 s, making the total duration between tone-presentations 30 to 45 s. Thereafter, a single trace conditioning session of 50 trials was carried out. On training trials a 100 ms air-puff (aversive, un-conditioned stimulus), was delivered 250 ms (trace interval) after the end of the tone. Pressurized air at 5 psi was passed through a nozzle of tip-diameter 1–1.5 mm positioned ∼1–2 cm away and aimed at the mouse’s left eye. Air-flow was switched on and off with a computer-controlled electronic, solenoid valve (EV mouse valve, Clippard, Cinncinati, OH, USA). Every fifth trial was a probe trial (on which no puff was delivered) however as these amounted to only 10 probe trials per mouse, data from these trials have not been used for any specific analysis. Only one training session of 50 trials was carried out per mouse. Longer sessions were seen to cause blinking fatigue and discomfort to the mice. Additional sessions over multiple days were not possible due to the acute nature of the imaging preparation (‘Materials and methods: Mice and surgical procedure’). All trained mice were imaged, irrespective of usability of imaging data, while training was carried out. Microscope scan-mirrors continued to oscillate during the inter-trial interval, to remove auditory cues signaling the beginning or end of a trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Awake, two photon calcium imaging of area CA1 cells</title><p>Hippocampal area CA1 cells were imaged in parallel with eye-blink acquisition and training.

For the purposes of analysis, the mean ‘learning-trial’ across trained learners was assigned to all pseudo-conditioned mice. As an independent analysis of behavioral performance, we also calculated a performance score (PS) for each mouse. PS was defined as the ratio of CR frequency to spontaneous blink frequency. For the identification of spontaneous blinks, four 600 ms time-windows (2400 ms totally) before tone onset were considered.

The rest of the trials after learning trial were used to calculate the ridge to background ratio scores for calculating the reliability score.

The prv for a single frame (current frame) from one of the remaining trials was taken. The dot product of the current frame prv with each of the expected prvs was then computed. The decoder’s performance was scored by taking the dot product corresponding to the current frame number (correct frame) and dividing it by the summed dot products corresponding to in-correct frame numbers, weighted by distance from the correct frame. The correct frame dot product was given a weight equal to the total weight given to incorrect frame dot products. Incorrect frame dot product weights increased linearly with distance from correct frame, starting two frames away. As a control, dot-product vectors were randomly scrambled and performance score calculated. This was repeated 500 times and averaged to get the mean random-control performance score.

These meta-clusters were then iteratively combined using pair-wise correlation coefficient as a criterion, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dombeck et al., 2009</xref>) to yield the final clusters. Since the final clusters are formed by iterative pooling of meta-clusters, the number of clusters does not need to be pre-specified.

This is because overlap expected by chance depends on the numbers and sizes of clusters. The ratio of these two overlap measures was defined as the similarity score.

The calculation of intervals accounts for the increased chances of type-1 errors due to multiple comparisons. Since 99% confidence intervals were calculated, the chance of error is smaller than 1%. Hence, p values were reported as &lt;0.01.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Robert Cannon, Sachin Deshmukh, Niraj Dudani and Aditya Gilra for valuable inputs and discussions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor (Eve Marder) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments from the three reviews to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript uses imaging to examine activity dynamics generated in area CA1 of the hippocampus while animals learn a conditioned eyeblink response. Since the US and CS are separated in time, they must be linked by neural activity in the intervening period. The authors find that relatively uncoordinated activity in CA1 reorganizes into a reliable sequential firing pattern that spans the time between CS and US, which they propose bridges this time interval. This paper offers two main contributions. First, observing these firing patterns during eyeblink conditioning expands the range of behavioral paradigms where sequences are observed, emphasizing their generality and hippocampal involvement in linking time-separated events. Second, the authors directly observe how sequential activity emerges over training. They find parallel changes in the structure of spontaneous correlations, implying changes in functional connectivity of the hippocampal network. While as the authors note, correlations do not definitively establish the nature of these changes, it does point towards redistributed functional interactions.</p><p>There were, however, several concerns and recommendations by the reviewers that should each be addressed in a revision:</p><p>1) The measure of learning – the trial on which the peak conditioned eyelid response is observed – is not intuitive and crude. It might be expected that the magnitude of the eyelid response might continue to grow long after learning, so a measure of when the first reliable CRs occur likely provides a more sensitive measure of initial learning. An even better approach would incorporate the sophisticated learning curve analysis used by Wirth et al. (Science, 2003) which tracks correct learning responses and would likely allow you to use eyeblink magnitude directly without setting an arbitrary threshold for CR or no-CR. This is viewed as important because you use the trial on which learning occurs to make conclusions about whether time cells precede or follow learning.</p><p>2) The reliability and temporal decoder scores are not intuitive. Reviewers had no idea whether a score of “3” is highly reliable or just statistically significant but a small effect. And it's not clear what statistical tests were used to generate p-values shown for these findings.</p><p>3) Why did the K-means analysis only test 2-4 clusters? Perhaps there are many?</p><p>4) It is not clear what the analyses of inter-trial-interval (ITI) correlations mean. Is this aimed to test whether time cell firing sequences are a “synfire” chain? How does correlation during the ITI imply anything about firing chains during the trace interval? A closer connection between connectivity and time cell sequences might be made if they were able to show that high ITI correlations occur only in strong time cells and not in other cells that do not exhibit temporally specific trace period firing.</p><p>5) A major strength of the paper is that it follows changes through training. These data could help address whether learning increases reliability of pre-existing responses already tied to specific time points (i.e., reinforces a pre-existing sequence), vs reconfigures activity by shifting peaks in time or generating new responses. The data point strongly to reconfiguration but some more in-depth analysis addressing this could be a nice addition. For example: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows an interesting single-cell example where firing occurs at similar times across trials, but more reliably after learning. The reliability score will tend to collapse differences in probability at the same time, vs changes in timing (or reliability of timing) of peaks, into a single number. It would be useful to address these separately – e.g., comparing the variability in peak times for each neuron across trials, before and after training and/or comparing the change in peak time. Does learning primarily affect mean timing of activity, variability of timing across trials, or reliability at a specific time point?</p><p>6) A central focus of the manuscript is changes in activity dynamics before and after learning. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B and 2D</xref> show clear strong peaks sequentially ordered across the CS-US interval. The heading of section 3 could be taken to mean that this structure is absent before learning. However, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> shows clearly observable, albeit less complete, activity sequences. A side-by-side comparison of these data could help the reader evaluate the strength of learning-dependent effects. The reordering shown in supplemental panels A/B is a particularly striking learning outcome.</p><p>7) The authors have a substantial dataset of spontaneous activity, analyzed for noise correlations but not temporal structure. Depending on strength and timing of events, sorting by peak response could lead to apparent ordering of even randomly occurring activity. As a baseline, it would be useful to know the results of using the same sorting analysis for epochs of spontaneous data. Beyond this, it may even be possible to ask whether spontaneous activity gains any temporal structure resembling the stimulus-triggered sequences after training.</p><p>8) The authors describe the emergence of novel temporal sequences starting at the beginning of the CS (tone presentation) and evolving in time in the “learner” group and relate them to learning. For comparison, they use a control group that underwent a “pseudo-conditioning”. However, if one of the main goals is to investigate the neuronal dynamics underlying learning, the best control for the learner group should be the non-learner group that underwent the exact training protocol, but failed to learn the association. The authors should include the non-learner group in all of the relevant analyses and in the comparisons with the learner group. This could get them one step closer to understanding the neuronal correlates of learning.</p><p>9) The cellular activity was imaged at 11-16 Hz resulting in 70-90 ms-long frames. This is a quite large time interval for cellular physiology. How do the authors relate the long calcium transients to the spiking activity of the neurons occurring within such transients? Many possible different neuronal sequences can occur within each of the 7-8 frames composing the 600 ms interval between CS and US. For instance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> frames 5 and 6 contain neurons 25-35 and 36-52, respectively which can fire in multiple different sequences within frames 5 and 6, across trials undetectably. Also, scale and units should be added to the x-axis (Time) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p><p>10) Were the neurons that were active during the tone after training also active during the tone in the pre-training? How do we know the neuronal sequences in CA1 bear any meaning to this task? Does the non-learner group also exhibit neuronal sequences bridging the CS and US?</p><p>11) How do the authors explain that the noise correlations (NC) declined toward the end of the session? Were the animals maintaining equal attention to the task toward the end? The authors should also refer and relate to the trial by trial correlations in spiking activity of place cells in spatial environments that show steady increases with more training (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013</xref>, eLife; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Frank, 2008</xref>, Neuron).</p><p>12) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, the Trace group shows average Reliability Score values around 3. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, the same variable ranges from a minimum of ∼1 in early trials to a maximum of ∼1.4. The numbers in 3D and 3F don't match. Please explain the difference.</p><p>13) What is being displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>? Please explain in more detail. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, spikes should not go in time beyond the time of air puff delivery as they could by emitted in response to the air puff. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, late in the training session (bottom), if increased correlations should be considered a mark of learning, why do they decline with more training? Please explain. Figure 6–figure supplement 1; why are NC values in trace conditioning group of mice that fail to learn in the beginning as high as the maximum NC values of learners later during training? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>; color coding and labeling is not entirely clear. Are these different image frames at which the cell responded?</p><p>Also panels D and E in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> have no legend. These appear to show the number of cells active for each time epoch before learning. Again a direct side-by-side comparison of this data before and after learning could be valuable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01982.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The measure of learning – the trial on which the peak conditioned eyelid response is observed – is not intuitive and crude.

This is viewed as important because you use the trial on which learning occurs to make conclusions about whether time cells precede or follow learning</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the helpful comment and for recommending a previously used algorithm to help address the issue. The reviewers correctly pointed out that using the peak of the moving-window averaged behavioral response curve as the trial where learning occurred would be ill-defined and arbitrary. In the study recommended by the reviewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wirth, Yanike, et al., 2003</xref>), and a subsequent article with many of the same authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith, Frank, et al., 2004</xref>), we found an analysis algorithm that allowed us to address the problem of rigorously identifying the learning trial for each mouse. We describe the use of this algorithm in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We next re-analyzed and re-plotted all our data that depended on the learning trials of mice and found that all the conclusions in our original submission remain un-changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3 D-J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>The reviewers additionally state that our classification of individual trials as response or failure depends on an ‘arbitrary’ threshold. We would like to clarify that the threshold for blink classification is based on a two standard deviation criterion, where we compare blink responses during training to the pre-training blink responses to the tone stimulus. The threshold defined in our original manuscript (Materials and methods – Data analysis) and used in the revised submission as well is given by the equation below:</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>threshold</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>µ</mml:mtext><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>blink</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>pre</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>2s</mml:mtext><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>blink</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>pre</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula></p><p>where µ(blink<sub>pre</sub>) is the mean size of the blink response to the tone, prior to training and σ(blink<sub>pre</sub>) is the standard deviation of pre-training blink response size. In fact, in the study recommended by the reviewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wirth, Yanike, et al., 2003</xref>), the authors first obtain binary response vectors and then use the algorithm described above. This is the methodology we have adopted as well in this revision.</p><p><italic>2) The reliability and temporal decoder scores are not intuitive. Reviewers had no idea whether a score of “3” is highly reliable or just statistically significant but a small effect</italic>.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have expanded on the reliability and temporal decoder scores. A new plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1 A</xref>) deals with the principle underlying the reliability score. We have also related the reliability score to experimental observations reproduced in the manuscript to make it more intuitive. As explained in the revised manuscript, in Results: “After learning, area CA1 cells show reliably timed, sequential calcium-responses”.</p><p>With regard to the time decoder scores, we have expanded the Results section of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>And it's not clear what statistical tests were used to generate p-values shown for these findings</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for indicating that this point was not clear. We now discuss it in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Why did the K-means analysis only test 2-4 clusters? Perhaps there are many</italic>?</p><p>The reviewers have raised a concern regarding the forcing of a clustering algorithm to allot cells into a pre-defined number of clusters. However, we would like to point out that the meta k-means clustering algorithm used in our study does not need the user to pre-specify the number of clusters that cells are allotted to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ozden, Lee, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dombeck, Graziano, et al., 2009</xref>). The algorithm relies on an initial step of repeated clustering by the k-means++ algorithm with pre-specified numbers of clusters (step 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). This is the k value range of 2-4 referred to by the reviewers. After 2000 randomly initialized runs of the k-means++ algorithm, we get many different sets of clusters. The meta k-means algorithm then identifies cells that are co-clustered in more than 80% of k-means ++ runs and groups them into meta clusters initially. These meta clusters are then iteratively merged, based on the similarity of their averaged, activity traces, to yield a variable, unspecified number of final clusters, of un-specified sizes. The average number of correlation clusters we obtained using this algorithm ranged from 2 to 8, whereas the k-value used to initialize k-means++ was 3. Furthermore, we would like to point out that the central finding we report does not depend on the number of clusters per se, but rather on their relative spatial organization and whether or not they change during learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figure 5 F and 6 A-C</xref> in the revised manuscript).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic describing how the meta k-means clustering algorithm works.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01982-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>For the purposes of clarity, we have included here a schematic diagram describing how the algorithm works (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). This diagram explains how the number of clusters is not pre-determined. To highlight this fact, we have also expanded the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) It is not clear what the analyses of inter-trial-interval (ITI) correlations mean. Is this aimed to test whether time cell firing sequences are a “synfire” chain? How does correlation during the ITI imply anything about firing chains during the trace interval? A closer connection between connectivity and time cell sequences might be made if they were able to show that high ITI correlations occur only in strong time cells and not in other cells that do not exhibit temporally specific trace period firing</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out a potential source of confusion. As mentioned in the original manuscript, in Results (Noise-correlations increase transiently during learning, especially between similarly time-tuned neurons) and the Discussion, we have used changes in spontaneous activity correlations as a proxy for changes in network connectivity. We reported that when considering only neurons with high reliability scores, neurons sharing the same time-tuning showed higher spontaneous activity correlations than random neuron-pairs (Results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 B</xref>). As described in the Discussion of the original manuscript, CA1 neuron synfire chains are unlikely, given the extremely low CA1-CA1 connection probability (Andersen, Morris, et al., 2007). Instead, as described, we feel that the altered spontaneous correlations reflect changes in upstream, CA3-CA3 or CA3-CA1 connectivity. We have additionally done the analysis recommended by the reviewers, and included it in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref>. This figure is discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) A major strength of the paper is that it follows changes through training. These data could help address whether learning increases reliability of pre-existing responses already tied to specific time points (i.e., reinforces a pre-existing sequence), vs reconfigures activity by shifting peaks in time or generating new responses. The data point strongly to reconfiguration but some more in-depth analysis addressing this could be a nice addition. For example:</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3A</italic></xref> <italic>shows an interesting single-cell example where firing occurs at similar times across trials, but more reliably after learning. The reliability score will tend to collapse differences in probability at the same time, vs changes in timing (or reliability of timing) of peaks, into a single number. It would be useful to address these separately – e.g., comparing the variability in peak times for each neuron across trials, before and after training and/or comparing the change in peak time. Does learning primarily affect mean timing of activity, variability of timing across trials, or reliability at a specific time point</italic>?</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their suggestions on analysis. It is correctly pointed out that the reliability score for CA1 cell activity peak timing in the original manuscript does not distinguish between two possible phenomena. A cell may have a fixed activity peak timing from the beginning of the session, but not fire on every trial. In such a case, if the cell gradually started firing with higher probability at the same, fixed peak-timing, its reliability score would increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2 A</xref>).. As pointed out by the reviewers, the cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 A</xref> is one such example. Alternatively, the proportion of trials on which the cell fires may not change with training. Instead, the timing of peak activity itself might change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2 B</xref>) and such a cell would show an increase in reliability score as well.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram depicting two possible patterns of learning related changes in timing of activity peaks. <bold>A</bold> Activity peak timing is fixed from the beginning of the session, only reliability of trial to trial activity increases with learning. <bold>B</bold> Activity peak timing changes with training, with reliable activity at a fixed timing being seen only towards the end of the session.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01982-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>As already demonstrated in the original manuscript, there is extensive re-distribution of activity peak- timings with learning. The distribution of peak timings is heavily skewed towards the tone period in the pre-training, tone alone session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 G</xref> in the revised manuscript). Early in the training session, with the introduction of the air-puff stimulus, this distribution shifts markedly, with a peak near the time of puff presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 H</xref> in the revised manuscript). This extensive re-organization of activity peak timings is also evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">figure 2 F</xref>. Here, averaged traces from the pre-training, tone alone session have been sorted as per the cells’ peak-timings after learning. The lack of sequentially timed peaks with this ordering indicates that peak timings change during learning.</p><p>We address this issue in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) A central focus of the manuscript is changes in activity dynamics before and after learning.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figures 2B and 2D</italic></xref> <italic>show clear strong peaks sequentially ordered across the CS-US interval. The heading of section 3 could be taken to mean that this structure is absent before learning. However, the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>shows clearly observable, albeit less complete, activity sequences. A side-by-side comparison of these data could help the reader evaluate the strength of learning-dependent effects. The reordering shown in supplemental panels A/B is a particularly striking learning outcome</italic>.</p><p>The figure panels <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1 A-B</xref> from the old version of the manuscript have now been moved to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> as recommended by the reviewers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, E-F</xref> in the revised manuscript) to allow side by side comparison.</p><p><italic>7) The authors have a substantial dataset of spontaneous activity, analyzed for noise correlations but not temporal structure. Depending on strength and timing of events, sorting by peak response could lead to apparent ordering of even randomly occurring activity. As a baseline, it would be useful to know the results of using the same sorting analysis for epochs of spontaneous data</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers have pointed out the possibility that the sorting analysis used to determine activity peak timings could lead to apparent ordering of even randomly occurring activity. The baseline test suggested is to use the same analysis with data from the spontaneous activity periods, rather than from the stimulus presentation periods. We would like to clarify that this analysis had already been done in the originally submitted manuscript. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3 D, E, F and J</xref> all have spontaneous period activity analyzed in the same manner, to serve as a control. In all these cases, stimulus period data from trace learners showed significantly higher scores for sequential activity than spontaneous period data.</p><p><italic>Beyond this, it may even be possible to ask whether spontaneous activity gains any temporal structure resembling the stimulus-triggered sequences after training</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers make the interesting suggestion that there might be sequence replay events during spontaneous period activity. To check for this, we performed additional calculations, the results of which are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1 C</xref>. This is discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>8) The authors describe the emergence of novel temporal sequences starting at the beginning of the CS (tone presentation) and evolving in time in the “learner” group and relate them to learning. For comparison, they use a control group that underwent a “pseudo-conditioning”. However, if one of the main goals is to investigate the neuronal dynamics underlying learning, the best control for the learner group should be the non-learner group that underwent the exact training protocol, but failed to learn the association. The authors should include the non-learner group in all of the relevant analyses and in the comparisons with the learner group. This could get them one step closer to understanding the neuronal correlates of learning</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the utility of direct comparisons between learners and non-learners. We discuss this in our originally submitted manuscript, and now in the revised manuscript. We would like to re-iterate that non-learners likely consist of a heterogeneous group of mice, at various stages of learning and thus, with different extents of learning-related changes in multiple brain regions. Hence, pooling CA1 activity data from such a heterogeneous group is likely to be confounded with conflicting data from each mouse. However, for the sake of completeness, we had included data from non-learners in all major analyses and placed these plots in supplementary figures. Out of deference to the reviewers’ recommendation, these panels have now been shifted to the main text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig6">Figures 3 D, J; 4 A; 6 C</xref> in the revised manuscript). Non-learner data has also been included in some new figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1 E-F</xref>).</p><p><italic>9) The cellular activity was imaged at 11-16 Hz resulting in 70-90 ms-long frames. This is a quite large time interval for cellular physiology. How do the authors relate the long calcium transients to the spiking activity of the neurons occurring within such transients? Many possible different neuronal sequences can occur within each of the 7-8 frames composing the 600 ms interval between CS and US. For instance in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref> <italic>frames 5 and 6 contain neurons 25-35 and 36-52, respectively which can fire in multiple different sequences within frames 5 and 6, across trials undetectably. Also, scale and units should be added to the x-axis (Time) in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref>.</p><p>The reviewers have correctly pointed out that the time-resolution of our calcium-imaging read-out of neuronal activity does not allow us to capture all possible neurophysiological phenomena. We discuss this in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript. Hence, we maintain that the claims made in our study are not affected by this caveat. A time label has been added to the time-scale bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 D</xref>.</p><p><italic>10) Were the neurons that were active during the tone after training also active during the tone in the pre-training</italic>?</p><p>48% of cells with high reliability scores were active during the tone period in the pre-training, tone only session. Post-learning, while 40.0 % of cells had peak times during tone presentation, only 19.2 % of high reliability cells were tone-responsive both prior to and post learning. This is indicative of extensive changes in activity timing due to learning. See the detailed response to reviewer comment 5. There, we discuss analyses that show that the activity peak timings for neurons change during training.</p><p><italic>How do we know the neuronal sequences in CA1 bear any meaning to this task? Does the non-learner group also exhibit neuronal sequences bridging the CS and US</italic>?</p><p>It is only the learner group who form reliably timed activity sequences. As shown in the originally submitted manuscript, trace learners have higher reliability scores for sequentially timed activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 D</xref> in the revised manuscript), as well as higher time-decoder prediction scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 J</xref> in the revised manuscript) than pseudo-conditioned mice as well as non-learner mice that failed to learn the association. Hence, we concluded that the emergence of sequential activity is related to learning the behavioral task.</p><p><italic>11) How do the authors explain that the noise correlations (NC) declined toward the end of the session? Were the animals maintaining equal attention to the task toward the end</italic>?</p><p>The reviewers have highlighted an interesting phenomenon. As learning progressed, we observed an elevation in cell-cell spontaneous activity correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 A-B</xref> in the revised manuscript). However, these correlations went back down towards the end of the session.</p><p>We explain this in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>The authors should also refer and relate to the trial by trial correlations in spiking activity of place cells in spatial environments that show steady increases with more training (e.g.,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"><italic>Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013</italic></xref><italic>, eLife;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"><italic>Cheng and Frank, 2008</italic></xref><italic>, Neuron)</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers have cited two studies of high relevance to ours that we failed to cite in the original manuscript.

We speculate that the initially elevated noise correlations are a signature of a pre-existing network state that is detrimental to the rapid acquisition of trace conditioning.</p><p>We ruled out two possible, trivial reasons for the high NC in the first trial bin. First, we showed that the elevated NC is not due to a few, high outliers skewing the reported mean. The box and whisker plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3A</xref> depicts the same data as that plotted for the noise correlations curve for non-learners (cyan curve) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 A</xref> of the revised manuscript. The box and whisker plot shows that the higher mean seen in the first trial bin is not due to outliers, but is in fact, a result of most of the correlation values for that bin being higher. The upper quartile, as well as the highest data value within 1.5 quartiles of the upper quartile, are far higher for the first bin than for subsequent bins. Second, we ruled out the trivial possibility that what we measure as noise-correlations using data acquired 4 seconds after puff stimulus delivery are in fact, correlations in long-sustained responses to the puff stimulus. We calculated peak response widths for each cell in the same manner as for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 B</xref> in the revised manuscript. To look for sustained activity after the puff stimulus during trials 1 to 5 for non-learners, we calculated response widths in the 4 s period immediately after the puff for trials 1 to 5. We found that no cell’s response width was longer than 1 s. This rules out the possibility of sustained, puff stimulus responses 4 s later, during the segment of data used to calculate noise correlations.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p><bold>A</bold> Mean noise correlations for non-learners are high in the first trial bin.
