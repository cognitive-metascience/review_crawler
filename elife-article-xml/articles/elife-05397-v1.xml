Available microbicides that target viral components have proven largely ineffective in preventing sexual virus transmission. In this study, we establish that CLR01, a ‘molecular tweezer’ specific for lysine and arginine residues, inhibits the formation of infectivity-enhancing seminal amyloids and remodels preformed fibrils. Moreover, CLR01 abrogates semen-mediated enhancement of viral infection by preventing the formation of virion–amyloid complexes and by directly disrupting the membrane integrity of HIV and other enveloped viruses. We establish that CLR01 acts by binding to the target lysine and arginine residues rather than by a non-specific, colloidal mechanism. CLR01 counteracts both host factors that may be important for HIV transmission and the pathogen itself. These combined anti-amyloid and antiviral activities make CLR01 a promising topical microbicide for blocking infection by HIV and other sexually transmitted viruses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05397.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05397.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05397.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a sexually transmitted virus that can cause a serious disease that weakens the immune system. The virus is most commonly transmitted between individuals in semen, the male reproductive fluid. Semen contains deposits of protein fragments called amyloid fibrils, which can increase the transmission of HIV by trapping viral particles. This helps the virus to attach to the membranes surrounding human cells, which increases the risk of infection. Therefore, therapies that reduce the levels of amyloid fibrils in semen might be able to reduce the transmission of HIV.</p><p>Drugs that prevent amyloid formation are already being developed because structurally similar fibrils can also form in the brains of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases. One such molecule—called CLR01—works by binding to particular sites on the proteins that form fibrils in the brain. This inhibits fibril formation and slowly disassembles the fibrils that have already formed. CLR01 physically interacts with these residues in a way that resembles a tweezer.</p><p>The peptides in the amyloid fibrils in semen also have these sites, which suggests that CLR01 might also disrupt amyloid fibrils from forming in semen. Here Lump and Castellano et al. show that CLR01 can both disrupt fibril formation and remodel fibrils that have already formed. In addition, CLR01 prevents HIV particles from interacting with these fibrils and can displace the virus particles that have already bound to the fibrils. In the presence of CLR01, human cells exposed to semen that contained HIV were less likely to become infected with the virus.</p><p>Unexpectedly, CLR01 also directly destroys HIV and other enveloped viruses such as HCV or HSV particles by disrupting the membranes that surround the virus. Therefore, Lump and Castellano et al.'s findings reveal that CLR01 has considerable potential to be used as an agent for reducing the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted viral diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05397.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05397.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

This HIV-enhancing activity is attributed to seminal amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Münch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Usmani et al., 2014</xref>) that form by self-assembly of proteolytic fragments of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP248-286 and PAP85-120) and the homologous proteins semenogelin 1 (SEM1) and semenogelin 2 (SEM2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Münch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castellano and Shorter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Münch et al., 2014</xref>). Seminal amyloid fibrils are highly cationic, and the positively charged fibrils capture HIV virions, increase viral attachment rates to target cells, and augment fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Usmani et al., 2014</xref>). By doing so, fibrils promote HIV infection in vitro by several orders of magnitude, whereas the corresponding monomeric peptides have no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Münch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, the stimulatory effect of seminal amyloid is the greatest at low virus concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Münch et al., 2007</xref>), and semen and PAP248-286 fibrils (termed SEVI for Semen-derived Enhancer of Virus Infection) may facilitate vaginal virus transmission after exposure to low viral doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miller et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neildez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Münch et al., 2013</xref>). HIV transmission rates are relatively low, occurring as infrequently as 1 in 200 to as low as 1 in 10,000 coital acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, counteraction of infectivity promoting amyloids in semen should reduce or even prevent HIV transmission via the sexual route.</p><p>The lysine- and arginine-specific molecular tweezer, CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fokkens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klärner et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2010</xref>), inhibits amyloid fibrillization by engaging specific lysine, arginine, or both residues within a variety of disease-associated amyloidogenic proteins including amyloid-β protein (Aβ), tau, islet amyloid polypeptide, transthyretin, and α-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sinha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, CLR01 has even been found to slowly remodel preformed Aβ and α-synuclein fibrils over the course of several weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</xref>). CLR01 binds lysine residues with a <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> of ∼10 µM and also binds arginine residues, albeit with ∼10-fold lower affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fokkens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dutt et al., 2013</xref>). The unprecedented high specificity of CLR01 for basic amino acids relies on a unique binding mode in which the tweezer draws the cationic side chains into its torus-shaped cavity and engages the ammonium cation of lysine or the guanidinium cation of arginine with its anionic phosphate group in a tight ion pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klärner and Schrader, 2013</xref>). No other amino acids fulfill the requirements for this threading mechanism. The structure of the CLR01-lysine complex and the precise mechanism of lysine threading into the CLR01 guest cavity and subsequent ion pairing have been extensively characterized by NMR spectroscopy, crystal structure, molecular dynamics, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dutt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klärner and Schrader, 2013</xref>). Importantly, CLR01 appears only to complex with readily accessible lysine or arginine residues on protein surfaces, as evidenced by crystal structures and NMR experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bier et al., 2013</xref>). This restriction makes CLR01 more selective for lysine or arginine residues found in intrinsically unfolded proteins or protein sequences.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05397.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CLR01 binds to lysine and arginine residues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structures of CLR01 and CLR03.

Here, we establish that CLR01 inhibits amyloidogenesis of PAP and SEM peptides, neutralizes the cationic surface charge of seminal amyloid, and rapidly remodels preformed SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils. Strikingly, CLR01 also exhibits a direct antiviral effect by selectively disrupting the membrane of enveloped viruses. Thus, CLR01 represents an unprecedented candidate for further development as a microbicide as it not only inactivates HIV and other enveloped viruses but also antagonizes host-encoded seminal amyloids that enhance viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CLR01 inhibits spontaneous assembly of seminal amyloid fibrils</title><p>Lysine residues in PAP248-286, PAP85-120, SEM1, and SEM2 peptides are frequently found within or immediately adjacent to hexapeptides predicted to form self-complementary β-strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, underlined residues), termed steric zippers, which often comprise the spine of amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nelson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldschmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sievers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castellano and Shorter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frohm et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the wealth of basic residues in PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>) led us to hypothesize that the lysine- and arginine-specific tweezer, CLR01, but not its derivative CLR03, which lacks hydrophobic sidewalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), might bind to these residues and interfere with fibril assembly. To test this hypothesis, we first performed replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations using the available structure of PAP248-286, the best characterized of the amyloid-forming peptides in semen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Münch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castellano and Shorter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">French and Makhatadze, 2012</xref>). This analysis revealed that in silico, CLR01 bound at least seven of the eight positively charged residues in PAP248-286 without grossly altering peptide secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Indeed, CLR01 engaged Lys251, Lys253, Lys281, and Lys282 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>), which all reside in predicted steric zippers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castellano and Shorter, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, CLR01 bound Arg257, Lys281, and Lys282 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>), which form part of the cross-β SEVI fibril core defined by hydrogen–deuterium exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">French and Makhatadze, 2012</xref>). The CLR01 interaction was very similar among all the different lysine and arginine binding sites as indicated by similar (X-P) distances between the lysine ammonium or arginine guanidinium groups (X) and the bound phosphate group (P) in CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). By contrast, CLR03 only established more distant and variable interactions with lysine and arginine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Thus, CLR01 but not CLR03 tightly shielded lysine and arginine residues in PAP248-286 suggesting that CLR01 could prevent PAP248-286 assembly into SEVI fibrils.</p><p>To test this prediction, CLR01 was assessed for its ability to inhibit the spontaneous amyloidogenesis (i.e., assembly in the absence of preformed fibril seeds) of PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Münch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2012</xref>). Using the fluorescence of the diagnostic dye Thioflavin-T (ThT), which increases upon amyloid binding, we found that CLR01, but not CLR03, inhibited fibril assembly of all three peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) of CLR01 inhibition of PAP248-286 and SEM1(45-107) fibrillization were ∼1.19 µM and ∼16.2 µM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> for inhibition of PAP248-286 fibrillization was significantly lower than the IC<sub>50</sub> for inhibition of SEM1(45-107) fibrillization (one-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting that lysine, arginine, or both residues are more critical for PAP248-286 fibrillization. Moreover, inhibition of PAP248-286 and SEM1(45-107) fibrillization exhibited shallow dose–response curves with Hill slopes of ∼0.6 for PAP248-286 and ∼0.44 for SEM1(45-107) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F</xref>), indicating negative co-operativity or CLR01 binding to multiple sites with different affinities. Importantly, these shallow dose responses provide evidence against a non-specific mechanism of inhibition involving colloidal CLR01 aggregates, as aggregating inhibitors tend to exhibit steep dose response curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shoichet, 2006</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> of CLR01 to impede PAP85-120 assembly was significantly higher at ∼228 µM (one-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The higher IC<sub>50</sub> is likely due to the lower number of lysine or arginine residues in the PAP85-120 sequence located in hexapeptides predicted to have high amyloid propensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castellano and Shorter, 2012</xref>). Indeed, PAP85-120 has 1 lysine or arginine located in predicted steric zippers, whereas PAP248-286 has 4 and SEM1(45-107) has 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The Hill slope was ∼1.26, indicating weak positive co-operativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), but was still below the ∼1.5–2 range that might indicate a mechanism of inhibition involving colloidal CLR01 aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shoichet, 2006</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05397.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CLR01 inhibits formation of seminal amyloid fibrils.</title><p>CLR01 inhibits fibril formation by PAP248-286 (1 mM) (<bold>A</bold>), PAP85-120 (1 mM) (<bold>B</bold>), and SEM1(45-107) (500 µM) (<bold>C</bold>).

Since the structures that formed in the presence of CLR01 were not ThT-reactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) they most likely represent non-amyloid aggregates.

PAP248-286(Ala) formed amyloid fibrils in the presence of CLR01, CLR03, and buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). To further analyze the effect of CLR01 on PAP248-286(Ala) assembly, we employed a sedimentation assay. This assay revealed that equal amounts of PAP248-286(Ala) entered the pellet fraction when the peptide was incubated with buffer or CLR01, indicating that the formation of PAP248-286(Ala) amyloid fibrils is unaffected by CLR01 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, it is likely that in the presence of CLR01, PAP248-286(Ala) assembles into a subtly distinct set of cross-beta structures or fibril ‘strains’ that are less ThT-reactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). Amyloidogenesis by PAP85-120(Ala) was also unaffected by CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). The PAP248-286(Ala) and PAP85-120(Ala) peptides spontaneously assemble into amyloid more rapidly than the wild-type peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,G,I</xref>). However, we have been unable to establish conditions (e.g., higher CLR01 concentrations) where CLR01 prevents assembly of PAP248-286(Ala) and PAP85-120(Ala) into amyloid fibrils (data not shown). These findings suggest that CLR01-lysine contacts, CLR01-arginine contacts, or both, are essential for inhibition of fibrillization.</p><p>Next, we tested if an excess of free lysine or poly-L-lysine could interfere with the ability of CLR01 to block fibrillization of PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Both 20 mM lysine and 1 mM poly-L-lysine completely abrogated CLR01 inhibition of fibril formation by these three peptides. These results strongly support direct interaction of the tweezer with lysine, arginine, or both residues in PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107) as the underlying mechanism of CLR01 inhibition. We suggest that these specific interactions preclude the conformational rearrangements necessary for amyloidogenesis.</p><p>Some small molecules must form higher order colloidal aggregates to inhibit amyloid assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Young et al., 2015</xref>).

Additionally, colloidal small-molecule aggregates can be precleared via centrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGovern et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we used these two techniques to test whether inhibition of PAP248-286, PAP85-120, or SEM1(45-107) aggregation could be mediated via unexpected colloid formation by CLR01. CLR01 was found to inhibit PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107) fibril assembly in the presence of BSA (10 mg/ml) or when solutions containing CLR01 were centrifuged at 16,100×<italic>g</italic> for 20 min before adding the supernatant solution to the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, CLR01 is not inhibiting PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107) fibril assembly via a mechanism that involves colloidal CLR01 aggregates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CLR01 inhibits assembly of SEVI seeded by preformed fibrils</title><p>The addition of a small amount of preformed SEVI fibrils to soluble PAP248-286 seeds polymerization and eliminates the lag phase for assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ye et al., 2009</xref>) (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Remarkably, in addition to obstructing unseeded PAP248-286 assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), CLR01 also completely inhibited seeded fibrillization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J,K</xref>). Dose–response analysis established an IC<sub>50</sub> of ∼15.3 µM for CLR01 inhibition of seeded PAP248-286 assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>) compared to ∼1.19 µM for spontaneous PAP248-286 assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, higher concentrations of CLR01 are required to inhibit PAP248-286 assembly once SEVI fibrils have formed. Interestingly, the Hill slope for inhibition of seeded PAP248-286 assembly was ∼3.1 indicating positive co-operativity and was steeper than the Hill slope of ∼0.6 for inhibition of spontaneous PAP248-286 fibrillization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,L</xref>). This dissimilarity might indicate a mechanistic difference in how CLR01 inhibits seeded and spontaneous PAP248-286 fibrillization. However, this difference is not likely to be due colloidal CLR01 aggregates, as inhibition of seeded assembly by CLR01 was unaffected by BSA or by preclearing CLR01 solutions via centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).

Thus, inhibition of seeded PAP248-286 assembly by CLR01 likely requires specific interaction with lysine, arginine, or both residues. Importantly, because CLR01 impedes both unseeded and seeded PAP248-286 assembly, it likely acts at multiple stages of the fibrillization process including the initial nucleation and fibril elongation steps. These observations also indicate that lysine, arginine, or both residues play an important role in the primary nucleation and subsequent elongation of PAP248–286 fibrils.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CLR01 remodels preformed SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils</title><p>Semen-derived fibrils are abundant in liquefied fresh ejaculates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Usmani et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, agents that not only inhibit fibril formation but also remodel preformed fibrils would be advantageous for microbicide development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castellano and Shorter, 2012</xref>). To test whether CLR01 could remodel seminal amyloid, SEVI, PAP85-120 and SEM1(45-107) fibrils were treated with CLR01 or CLR03, and ThT fluorescence intensity was monitored. Brief incubations with CLR01 (10–20 min) had no effect, indicating that CLR01 did not simply displace ThT from fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). After 2 hr, however, CLR01 treatment of SEVI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and PAP85-120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) but not SEM1(45-107) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) fibrils resulted in a reduction in ThT fluorescence intensity by more than 50%. Even after 24 hr, SEM1(45-107) fibrils were not remodeled by CLR01 (data not shown). SEVI and PAP85-120 fibril remodeling was confirmed by TEM, which showed few intact fibrils and predominately smaller nonfibrillar species after CLR01 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). By contrast, TEM revealed that SEM1(45-107) fibrils were still abundant after prolonged CLR01 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This observation confirms that CLR01 does not simply prevent fibrils from adsorbing to the EM grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similar results were obtained by fluorescence microscopy (CoM) of samples stained with Proteostat, a red fluorescent aggregate sensing dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Usmani et al., 2014</xref>). These effects of CLR01 were remarkably rapid in comparison to the slow disassembly of Aβ or α-synuclein fibrils by CLR01, which required several weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, CLR01 can remodel SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils on a time scale that would be useful for prevention of HIV infection, which usually takes place within the first hours after deposition of semen in the anogenital tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shattock and Moore, 2003</xref>).</p><p>We next performed circular dichroism experiments to examine the effect of CLR01 on the amyloid cross-β structure. Untreated SEVI fibrils or SEVI fibrils treated with CLR03 exhibited a pronounced minimum indicative of a characteristic β-sheet rich structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). By contrast, SEVI fibrils incubated with CLR01 showed a loss in the β-sheet minimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>), confirming that CLR01 alters the cross-β architecture of SEVI fibrils. Furthermore, SEVI fibrils remodeled by CLR01 were less effective seeds for polymerization of monomeric PAP248-286 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, CLR01 remodels SEVI fibrils into alternative non-templating conformers.</p><p>A dose–response curve for CLR01-mediated remodeling of SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils revealed a half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) value of ∼0.89 µM and ∼1.41 µM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). Interestingly, in both cases the Hill slope was similar, approximately −0.6 for SEVI and approimately −0.726 for PAP85-120, indicating negative co-operativity or CLR01 binding to multiple sites with different affinities. These shallow dose–response curves provide evidence against a colloidal mechanism of CLR01 action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shoichet, 2006</xref>). Previous studies have reported that a 10-fold molar excess of CLR01 could remodel preformed Aβ40, Aβ42, or α-synuclein fibrils slowly over a time period of weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</xref>). It is therefore remarkable that CLR01 remodels SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils with such alacrity and at sub-stoichiometric concentrations (relative to peptide monomers).</p><p>To elucidate the role of lysine- and arginine-tweezer interactions in CLR01-mediated remodeling of SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils, experiments were performed with fibrils comprised of PAP248-286(Ala) or PAP85-120(Ala). CLR01 was unable to remodel preformed SEVI(Ala) or PAP85-120(Ala) fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–L</xref>). Indeed, we have been unable to establish conditions (e.g., higher CLR01 concentrations) where CLR01 remodels SEVI(Ala) or PAP85-120(Ala) fibrils (data not shown). Furthermore, addition of excess free lysine or poly-L-lysine to CLR01 prevented its SEVI and PAP85-120 amyloid-remodeling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, CLR01-lysine, CLR01-arginine, or both contacts are critical for the remodeling process. By contrast, CLR01 retained SEVI and PAP85-120 amyloid-remodeling activity in the presence of BSA (10 mg/ml) or if CLR01 solutions were precleared via centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, colloidal CLR01 aggregates do not contribute to the amyloid-remodeling activity of CLR01. Taken together, our findings suggest that the lysine- and arginine-specific molecular tweezer CLR01 prevents formation of seminal amyloid and remodels mature PAP85-120 and SEVI fibrils via binding to lysine and arginine residues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CLR01 abrogates the interaction of seminal amyloids with viral particles and diminishes their infection enhancing property</title><p>Since the infectivity-enhancing activity of seminal amyloid fibrils is due to their positive surface charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2012</xref>), we examined next whether CLR01 affected this property. To prevent fibril remodeling from occurring in these experiments, fibrils were mixed with CLR01, CLR03, or buffer, and samples were immediately centrifuged to remove unbound CLR01 and CLR03 molecules. Subsequently, the surface charge of resuspended fibrils was determined by zeta potential measurements. We found that CLR01, but not CLR03, neutralized the positive surface charge of SEVI, PAP85-120, and SEM1(49-107) fibrils within minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Notably, pre-treatment of CLR01 with lysine or poly-L-lysine abrogated the fibril neutralizing activity of CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which further supports previous findings concerning the specificity underlying these interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fokkens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klärner et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2010</xref>).

Importantly, DLS overemphasizes large particles because the scattered-light intensity is proportional to the square of the particle mass. The scattering intensity in the solutions of CLR01 (1 mM) in PBS was ∼3% that of similar samples containing Mg<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>) colloids (10 mM Mg<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)) or SDS micelles (2% SDS (wt/vol)), suggesting that the observed species represented a small fraction of the CLR01 molecules (data not shown). Thus, under all assay concentrations the vast majority of the tweezer molecules are monomeric. Minute amounts of dimers or higher order species may be present at high concentrations of CLR01 in some cases in PBS (fibril assembly buffer) but are absent from the HEPES buffer (fibril remodeling buffer). Thus, it is highly unlikely that colloidal CLR01 aggregates contribute to the observed activity of the tweezer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>CLR01 exhibits broad antiviral activity against enveloped viruses</title><p>CLR01 exhibited a surprising ability to disrupt viral membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5A, 6A,C–F</xref>), but did not affect cell viability like various non-ionic and anionic surfactants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Various biological polyanions such as heparin or other glycosaminoglycans can prevent these cationic fibrils from enhancing HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roan et al., 2009</xref>). Unfortunately, however, such anionic polymers have been unsuccessful in past clinical microbicide trials due to their poor bioavailability and induction of inflammatory responses in the genital tract, which actually augment HIV transmission by recruiting HIV-susceptible target cells to the genital mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lüscher-Mattli, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van de Wijgert and Shattock, 2007</xref>). We have suggested that future microbicide endeavors should focus on agents that simultaneously and safely target HIV and the host factors that are exploited by the virus to facilitate its transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castellano and Shorter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zirafi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roan and Münch, 2015</xref>).

These diverse activities made us concerned that CLR01 might disrupt amyloidogenesis and viral infection via a non-specific mechanism involving the formation of colloidal CLR01 aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGovern et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shoichet, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, multiple lines of evidence argue against a non-specific, colloidal mechanism of CLR01 activity. First, using a variety of biophysical techniques, we were unable to detect significant quantities of colloidal CLR01 aggregates under the conditions employed in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Second, the anti-amyloid and antiviral activity of CLR01 was unaffected by high concentrations of BSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2 fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), which would adsorb and quench the activity of any potential colloidal micelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGovern et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2008</xref>). Third, attempts to preclear CLR01 solutions by centrifugation to remove any colloidal aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGovern et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2008</xref>) had no effect on CLR01 anti-amyloid or antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Fourth, the shallow CLR01 dose–response curves are not typical of colloidal aggregate inhibitors, which typically exhibit steep dose–response curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shoichet, 2006</xref>). Finally, a feature of small molecules that form colloidal aggregates is that they are non-specific inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGovern et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2008</xref>). By contrast, CLR01 displays specificity for amyloidogenesis by peptides that harbor lysine and arginine residues. Thus, if the lysine and arginine residues of PAP248-286 or PAP85-120 are replaced with alanine, then CLR01 can neither inhibit fibril assembly nor remodel preformed fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2G–I, 3I–L</xref>). Likewise, the antiviral activity of CLR01 is restricted to enveloped viruses and CLR01 is ineffective against non-enveloped viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This specificity is inconsistent with an indiscriminate, non-specific mechanism of action mediated by colloidal CLR01 aggregates. Importantly, the anti-amyloid and antiviral activity of CLR01 could be eliminated by excess lysine or poly-L-lysine. Thus, the lysine-binding cavity of CLR01 plays an important role in both anti-amyloid and antiviral activity.</p><p>The ability of CLR01 to antagonize seminal amyloid in the presence of BSA and to prevent HIV infection in the presence of seminal fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) raises another question. Why is CLR01 activity not quenched by lysine or arginine residues on the surface of BSA or on other proteins abundant in seminal fluid? Here, it is important to consider the profound difference between freely accessible lysines on intrinsically unstructured domains, which can all be complexed by the tweezers, and lysines in folded proteins whose surface often prohibits the sterically demanding tweezer molecule to approach a lysine residue close enough for the threading mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The interaction between free lysine and CLR01 has a <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> of ∼10 µM, with fast on and off rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fokkens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dutt et al., 2013</xref>). On folded proteins, however, only a few lysines are accessible for the relatively large molecular skeleton of the tweezers. For example, only 5 of 17 surface lysines in a 14-3-3 protein are most likely to be complexed by CLR01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bier et al., 2013</xref>). Even in an unstructured small protein, such as Aβ, CLR01 has clear preference for the free Lys16 over Lys28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>) because the latter is engaged in stabilizing hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Petkova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lazo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, because of the high on and off rates, CLR01 is expected to only disrupt relatively weak interactions as well as events that depend on critical and accessible lysine or arginine residues. Therefore, the tweezer has shown selectivity in multiple cases that on first impression may appear counter-intuitive. For example, inhibition of abnormal protein aggregation is typically achieved at ∼1:1–1:5 protein:CLR01 concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2014</xref>), whereas disruption of controlled protein polymerization, for example, of tubulin, requires ∼55-fold excess CLR01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attar et al., 2014</xref>) and enzyme inhibition requires ∼1000-fold excess CLR01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Talbiersky et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, in vivo, CLR01 shows no toxicity at doses 2–3 orders of magnitude above those needed to enable clearance of amyloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, selectivity for lysine-bearing amyloid conformers in complex biological fluids is achieved by CLR01.</p><p>We suggest that the lysine-rich nature of seminal amyloid peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>) makes them unusually sensitive to CLR01 activity. Indeed, substoichiometric CLR01 concentrations (relative to peptide monomers) suffice to inhibit PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107) fibrillization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). Remarkably, substoichiometric CLR01 concentrations (relative to peptide monomers) also sufficed to effectively remodel SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). Curiously, SEM1(45-107) fibrils could not be remodeled by CLR01. Why SEM1(45-107) fibrils were refractory to CLR01 remains unclear and requires further study. CLR01 may require longer time periods to remodel SEM1(45-107) fibrils as with remodeling of Aβ fibrils, which required several weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>). It will also be important to determine whether some lysine and arginine residues in PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107) are more critical than others for CLR01 activity.</p><p>How does CLR01 directly antagonize viral infection? Since the CLR03 control, which has a similar negative charge as CLR01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>), was entirely ineffective at blocking viral infection, a purely polyanion-like mechanism that prevents the interaction of virions and cells by increasing charge repulsions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neurath et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weber et al., 2005</xref>) could be excluded. Instead, we demonstrate that CLR01 selectively disrupts membranes containing elevated levels of sphingomyelin and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Envelopes of HIV-1, herpes viruses, and HCV differ significantly from the cellular plasma membrane as they are more highly enriched in these and other lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van Genderen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brügger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lorizate et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merz et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the HIV membrane possesses a highly unusual lipid composition, which is distinct even from the detergent-resistant microdomains typically found in the plasma membrane, indicating that HIV budding involves a specific lipid raft clustering process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brügger et al., 2006</xref>). For example, although HIV membrane resembles lipid raft microdomains in that it is enriched for saturated lipids, phosphatidylserine, plasmalogen-phosphatidylethanolamine, cholesterol, and sphingolipids, it is also enriched for the unusual sphingolipid dihydrosphingomyelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brügger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lorizate et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2013</xref>). The unique lipid composition of viral membranes may render them uniquely sensitive to CLR01.</p><p>Importantly, unlike various non-ionic and anionic surfactants, CLR01 has minimal effects on cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, CLR01 might leverage a therapeutic opportunity provided by the physiological difference between static viral membranes and biogenic cellular membranes capable of self-repair. Static viral membranes are unable to withstand disruption by CLR01, whereas cells can likely repair lipid-raft-rich regions of the plasma membrane that might be disrupted by CLR01. In this regard, CLR01 may possess similarities to other broad-spectrum antivirals such as LJ001, a lipophilic aryl methyldiene rhodanine derivative, which selectively disrupt diverse viral membranes but are ineffective against non-enveloped viruses, and also do not disrupt cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wojcechowskyj and Doms, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wolf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vigant et al., 2013</xref>). We investigated whether the tweezer might recognize the charged lipid head groups but found via NMR chemical-shift experiments that this was not the case (data not shown). However, experiments on various phase boundaries strongly indicated that the tweezer could migrate into lipid bilayers due to its amphiphilic character (data not shown). A pronounced destabilizing effect may be triggered if this happens at the edge of lipid rafts that are enriched in virion membranes. Importantly, HSV-2, HCMV, and HCV can also be transmitted via sexual intercourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Handsfield et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rapp, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tedder et al., 1991</xref>). Thus, a CLR01-based microbicide may not only protect from HIV-1 acquisition but also from other major human pathogens.</p><p>CLR01 binding to lysine residues could potentially disrupt normal protein function leading to toxicity or side effects. However, CLR01 showed no signs of cytotoxicity in this study and has previously been safely employed in multiple cell and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attar et al., 2014</xref>). For example, transgenic mice that were given 10 mg CLR01 a day per 1 kg body weight intraperitoneally for 30 days showed no apparent toxicity or adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attar et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, it is conceivable that the application of CLR01 on mucosal surfaces should be even safer compared to its systemic administration.</p><p>Unlike previous microbicide candidates that block HIV infection by a single mechanism, a CLR01-based formulation would interfere with various essential steps in sexual HIV transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). On a minute time frame, the tweezer destroys infectious HIV particles that are present in semen, prevents the formation of amyloid–virus complexes by neutralization of the fibril surface charge, and also displaces pre-bound virions from fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). On a longer time frame (hours), CLR01 not only prevents the formation of infection-enhancing seminal amyloids upon ejaculation but also remodels fibrils that are already abundant in semen after ejaculation or formed during semen liquefaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Given the time frame of these effects, we suggest that the primary mechanism of CLR01 action is via its direct effect on the virus, and that the anti-amyloid effects, although potent, play a secondary role. Regardless, these combined antiviral and anti-amyloid activities and the encouraging safety data make CLR01 a promising broad-spectrum, topical microbicide against HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted viruses. We anticipate that large-scale synthesis of CLR01 could be relatively inexpensive (less than $1 per mg), which would enable facile development as a broad-spectrum antiviral microbicide.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Computational details</title><p>The interactions of PAP248-286 with the molecular tweezer CLR01 and the spacer CLR03 were investigated using Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD) simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sugita and Okamoto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okabe et al., 2001</xref>) performed with Gromacs 4.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hess et al., 2008</xref>) and the CHARMM27 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mackerell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bjelkmar et al., 2010</xref>).

The samples were rinsed with PBS and imaged in PBS on a Nanowizard 3 AFM (JPK) in Quantitative Imaging mode using silicon nitride cantilevers with a spring constant of 0.03 N/m (Bruker, Billerica, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Giant unilamellar vesicles</title><p>Sodium dihydrogen phosphate, chloroform, and cholesterol (Chol) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Lissamine rhodamine B 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (<italic>N</italic>-Rh-DHPE), ATTO 647 were purchased from Life Technologies and ATTO-TEC, respectively. 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), sphingomyelin (SM), and 23-(dipyrrometheneboron difluoride)-24-norcholesterol (Bodipy-Chol) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All chemicals used were of the highest analytical grade available and used without further purification.</p><p>Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) were prepared by electroformation on optically transparent and electrically conductive indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides (SPI Supplies) in a preparation chamber consisting of a closed bath imaging chamber RC-21B affixed to a P-2 platform (both Warner Instruments Co.) topped with a flow-through temperature block. A solution of pure DOPC-containing 0.2 mol% <italic>N</italic>-Rh-DHPE or a lipid mixture of DOPC/SM/Chol (45/25/30 mol%) containing 0.2 mol% <italic>N</italic>-Rh-DHPE and 0.1 mol% Bodipy-Chol in chloroform was spread on an ITO-coated cover slip (20 μl, 1 mg/ml), spin-coated at 800 rpm for 1 min, and subsequently dried under vacuum for at least 2 hr. Afterwards, the lipids were hydrated in 10 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.6, containing the water-soluble fluorophore ATTO 647 (5 μM) within the preparation chamber. The electroformation of pure DOPC and the DOPC/SM/cholesterol mixture was performed at room temperature and 60°C, respectively, by applying a frequency alternating current field (500 Hz, 100 mV for 10 min, 1 V for 20 min and 1.6 V for 2.5 hr) to the ITO electrodes by a function generator (Thurlby Thandar Instruments TG315). Afterwards, the preparation chamber was cooled down to room temperature in the case of the lipid mixture and carefully rinsed with 10 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.6, to remove the water-soluble ATTO 647 that was not enclosed in the interior of the vesicles. Once a region of interest for imaging of the GUVs was chosen under the microscope, ∼500 µl of CLR01 (150 µM) in 10 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.6, was added. Images were recorded by a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Biorad MRC 1024) coupled via a side port to an inverted microscope (Nikon; Eclipse TE-300DV) enabling fluorescence excitation in the focal plane of an objective lens (Nikon Plan Apo 60× WI, NA 1.2). Fluorescence of Bodipy-Chol, <italic>N</italic>-Rh-DHPE, and ATTO 647 was sequentially acquired by alternating the excitation with the 488, 568, and 647 nm lines of a Kr/Ar laser (Dynamic Laser, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). Signals were detected in three different PMT channels (emission band pass filters 522 nm/FWHM [full width at half-maximum] 35 nm, 580 nm/FWHM 32 nm, and 680 nm/FWHM 32 nm). Image acquisition was controlled by the software LaserSharp2000 (Biorad). Analysis of the data was performed using the software Fiji (Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science e.V., Munich, Germany). Images were background and brightness/contrast corrected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Atomic force microscopy of lipid bilayers</title><p>The phospholipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and sphingomyelin (egg, chicken) (SM) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). Sodium dihydrogen phosphate, chloroform, and cholesterol (Chol) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Steinheim, BW, Germany). Stock solutions of 10 mg/ml lipids (DOPC, SM, Chol) in chloroform were dissolved to obtain 1.95 mg of total lipid with the composition of DOPC (100 mol%) and DOPC/SM/Chol (45/25/30 mol%) for the liquid AFM experiments. The majority of the chloroform was evaporated with a nitrogen stream and the rest of the solvent was removed afterwards by drying under vacuum overnight. The sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer was filtered through filters of 0.02-µm pore size (Whatman, Dassel, Germany) before use. The dry lipid films were hydrated with 1 ml of 10 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.6. Afterwards, the lipid mixtures were vortexed, kept in a water bath at 65°C for 15 min, and then sonicated for 10 min. After five freeze-thaw-vortex cycles and brief sonication, large multilamellar vesicles were formed and transformed to large unilamellar vesicles of uniform size by use of an extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, USA) with polycarbonate membranes of 100 nm pore size at 65°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weise et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">2011</xref>). The vesicle fusion on mica was carried out by depositing 35 µl of the extruded lipid vesicle solution together with 35 µl of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> buffer on freshly cleaved mica and incubation in a wet chamber at 70°C for 2 hr. After the vesicle fusion, the samples were rinsed carefully with NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> buffer to remove unspread vesicles. For the tweezer–membrane interaction studies, 800 µl of 150 µM CLR01 in NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> buffer were slowly injected into the AFM fluid cell at room temperature and allowed to incubate for different time periods (1 min and 1 hr). Afterwards, the fluid cell was rinsed carefully with NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> buffer before imaging to remove unbound tweezer. The measurements were performed on a MultiMode scanning probe microscope with a NanoScope IIIa controller (Bruker, Camarillo, CA, USA) and usage of a J-Scanner (scan size 125 µm). Images were obtained by applying the tapping mode in liquid with sharp nitride lever (SNL) probes mounted in a fluid cell (Bruker, Camarillo, CA, USA). Tips with nominal force constants of 0.24 N m<sup>−1</sup> were used at driving frequencies around 9 kHz and drive amplitudes between 343 and 570 mV. Slow scan frequencies between 1.0 kHz and 1.97 kHz were required for high-resolution images. The height and phase images of sample regions were acquired with resolutions of 512 × 512 pixels. All AFM measurements were carried out at room temperature and the partitioning of the tweezer was analyzed by using analysis and NanoScope version 5 processing software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weise et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Kelly Jordan-Sciutto, Mickey Marks, Mariana Torrente, Alice Ford, Elizabeth Sweeny, Korrie Mack, Annie Chen, Aaron Gitler, and Sandra Maday for helpful suggestions on the manuscript, Mary Leonard for artwork, and Dr Aleksey Lomakin for help with the DLS experiments.

Colloidal aggregation of organic small molecules can disrupt protein fibrils, by protein sequestration by the colloid (Feng et al., Nature Chem. Biol., 2008). Such a mechanism must be controlled for, especially given the peculiar efficacy of the compounds against the virion membranes themselves. Second, the authors should look to see if free lysine competes for CLR01 binding, disrupting its ability to act on the fibrils and the virions. There are few statistical analyses performed, so the relevance of comparing EC50 values is often unclear. On top of that, many of the raw data sets are of too low quality to produce accurate EC50 values, e.g. the lack of a saturation plateau. All three reviews are pasted below and the questions and suggestions in the reviews should be addressed if the authors choose to submit a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>These results appear to be incredible, and they may be. There are several critical controls that appear to be lacking, as indicated below. If the data hold up after these controls, then I am enthusiastic. Amyloid fibrils in seminal fluid composed of at least 4 cationic proteins are established to enhance HIV transmission through intercourse by binding virons augmenting fusion efficiency. The Lys-binding molecular tweezer CLR01 delays the aggregation of PAP248-286 and SEM1(45-107) fibrillization, half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of CLR01 inhibition exhibited were 2.6 μM and 18.8 μM, respectively. By contrast, the IC50 to impede PAP85-120 assembly was significantly higher at 970 μM. Have the authors controlled for the possibility that CLR01 is functioning through colloid formation? It is important that the authors show that CLR01 is not impeding the adsorption of the aggregates to the EM grid, which can distort what is in solution. If these reactions are run for more than 30h, does aggregation into fibrils eventually occur? Does seeded aggregation eventually occur? The critical control that CLR01 is not displacing ThT from the fibrils needs to be performed. The analog in which all eight lysine and arginine residues are replaced by alanine appears to be far from a perfect control in that this variant is anticipated to be much more amyloidogenic? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the critical control that CLR01 is not displacing ThT from the fibrils and inhibiting fibril adsorption to the grids needs to be run-the rapidity of disassembly is surprising, is it really disassembly? The result that CLR01 destroys retroviral particles with IC50 values between 10-20 μM by compromising virion integrity further suggests that CLR01 might be functioning as a colloid. CLR01 decreased viral infectivity of semen in a concentration-dependent manner, while CLR03 had no impact on semen-mediated infection enhancement. At a CLR01 concentration of 31 μM, the enhancing effect of semen was completely abolished. Thus, CLR01 prevents HIV infection in the presence of semen. If this is occuring through monomeric CLR01 this is incredible, but I suspect the authors' inhibitor is a micelle or colloid. The data are so impressive that I am concerned that these results are unlikely due to the monomeric molecular tweezer, but my hypothesis could be incorrect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>Seminal amyloids are known to concentrate HIV virions and enhance infectivity. In this report, the authors use a recently identified, general inhibitor of amyloid formation (the molecular tweezer CLR01) to understand whether it also inhibits model seminal amyloids: SEVI, PAP85-120 and SEM1. CLR01 is known to work by docking to exposed lysine and arginine residues and this molecule has found use as a probe for biophysical chemistry and protein folding studies. Lump et al. first test CLR01 as a possible inhibitor of seminal amyloids in vitro, using EM and a ThT assay. They then test whether the molecules can reverse pre-formed amyloids using similar methods. Next, they test whether CLR01 might block binding of mock virions to fibrils and find that the compound seems to disrupt virions themselves. They use AFM and microscopy in vesicles and virus particles to test this idea – concluding that CLR01 seems to disrupt virion membranes, similar to a detergent. Somehow, this membrane disruption effect seems to be exclusive to viral membranes, but the mechanism remains cloudy (and somewhat confusing). They find that CLR01 blocks the infectivity-enhancing activity of seminal fibrils, both with and without addition of BSA. Based on these results, the possibility of using CLR01 for the prevention of viral spread are discussed. However, there are concerns (and even contradictions) about the lack of mechanistic knowledge and the nature of the CLR01-amyloid interaction is not well understood. The null hypotheses – that CLR01 is a non-specific lysine interactor or even a detergent – are not adequately tested. Without deeper mechanistic insight and more rigorous exploration of the binding events, publication of the work seems premature.</p><p>1) There are few statistical analyses performed, so the relevance of comparing EC50 values is often unclear. On top of that, many of the raw data sets are of too low quality to produce accurate values. For example, the value of 970 uM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) has no saturation plateau, so one assumes that the value has a very large error. Similar problems can be seen in the raw data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> and all of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. These results cannot be adequately fit because of sparse datapoints, so comparing (or even reporting) the half-maximal values is not advised.</p><p>2) One of the major problems with the manuscript is the uncertain mechanism of the compounds and the selectivity of the recognition. If CLR01 is simply blocking cationic charge of lysine and arginine residues, as the zeta potential and all-alanine mutant results imply, than one could presumably achieve this outcome faster, cheaper and more effectively with abundant biological polyanions, such as heparin or nucleic acids (DNA/RNA). What is the effect of these biological polyanions on the assembly of seminal amyloids and infectivity?</p><p>3) The hypothesis of CLR01 binding to individual lysine and arginine residues is not experimentally tested outside of a rather crude comparison of an all-alanine replacement peptide (which likely doesn't conform to the same structure as the native peptide). Does free lysine, arginine or other free organic cations (or even divalent cations) compete for CLR01 binding? Does systematic replacements of lysine residues would provide insight into what the key interactions might be? What is the affinity of these interactions? Presumably there are countless free lysine residues in true seminal fluid, so how can CLR01 have the selectivity required to identify the seminal amyloids (especially given the rather weak EC50 values in the mid-micromolar)?</p><p>4) The ability of the compounds to block fibril-induced virion activity in the presence of BSA doesn't appear to make logical sense. CLR01 was created as a general lysine/arginine probe – so why wouldn't the compound be adsorbed onto the surface of BSA, which carries surface-exposed nucleophiles? The affinity of CLR01 for the seminal amyloid peptides and BSA (as a stand-in for biological fluids) needs to be carefully performed – by NMR, ITC or other method.</p><p>5) The lack of CLR01-induced toxicity in mammalian cells is confusing, given the effects on vesicles and virion membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The mammalian cells have numerous cholesterol-rich, raft-like domains, so that argument doesn't work. Presumably, the mammalian membranes would be disrupted just like in the vesicle and virion studies, but not leading to toxicity. What is going on here? Is calcium flux activated? Do the cells change shape? What is the affinity of CLR01 for viral membranes, vesicles and mammalian membranes? What lipid is being bound? By what mechanism do the membranes dissolve? Normally, such questions could be addressed in subsequent work, but the readers of this document would be expected to have major concerns about the logical gas and contradictions in the datasets, making careful and unbiased discussion an important requirement.</p><p>6) What is the CMC equivalent of CLR01? In other words, at what concentration does it form micro-aggregates or micelles? Some (perhaps many?) of the observed activities could be a result of non-specific activities, as described by the Shoicet group. DLS studies and detergent competition experiments need to be performed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>Lump and colleagues describe the activity of a host-guest cavitand-like molecule, CLR01, in disassembling seminal protein fibrils and directly disrupting the membrane of HIV (and related) virions, much reducing HIV virus infectivity. The cavitand-like CLR01 acts by binding to lysine or arginine amino acids (the guests), with previously measured affinities in the 20 μM range, and presumably this activity is what leads to de-fibrilization (although exactly why binding should lead to defibrilization is unclear; presumably binding is improved in the soluble form, though this is not stated in the manuscript). In principle this is an interesting story, and certainly a novel use of a cavitand-like molecule, one that might inspire other efforts to repurpose such molecules, which are well-known to chemists, for similar effects. The manuscript could have substantial impact. Before it is published, I suggest the authors address the following concerns:</p><p>1) My major concern regards the mechanism of action. The authors postulate that classic host-guest complexes are forming with the cationic amino acids, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, and this is important to the specificity and ultimate usefulness of the compounds. Currently, however, the manuscript lacks two controls that would help establish this mechanism:</p><p>A) First, the authors should control for colloidal aggregation on the part of the CLR01 itself. Colloidal aggregation of organic small molecules can disrupt protein fibrils, by protein sequestration in the small molecule colloid (Feng et al., Nature Chem. Biol., 2008). Such a mechanism must be controlled for, especially given the peculiar efficacy of the compounds against the virion membranes themselves (this is hard to square with a host-guest type interaction, but would make sense for colloidal aggregates). To do so, the authors should do one or more of the following i. Look to see if CLR01 is forming colloids in the 10 - 30 μM range, for instance by dynamic light scattering. ii. Add a mild, non-ionic detergent such as Tween-100 to disrupt the colloidal aggregates. This would right-shift the efficacy curves (assuming the detergent doesn't disrupt the fibrils directly). iii. Before addition to the fibrils, spin down the aqueous “solution” of CRL01 (not the DMSO one) in a microfuge at its highest speed for 20 minutes. Use the supernatant as the CLR01 solution for efficacy testing (colloids will typically pellet over this time). iv. Add 10 mg/ml BSA to the fibril mixture, before addition of CLR01. BSA will prophylacticly coat colloids, disrupting their actions.</p><p>B) Second, the authors should look to see if free lysine competes for CLR01 binding, disrupting its ability to act on the fibrils and the virions. If it does not, or the effect is small, this would cast doubt on the mechanism proposed by the authors. This to me is an obvious control, and I worry that it was in the manuscript and I just overlooked it – if I did I apologize. If not, it should be done.</p><p>Both controls should be done for both the effects on the protein fibrils and on the direct effects of the virus membrane. Whereas I hesitate to put authors to more work, I believe that these controls will substantially strengthen the manuscript, and should take more than a few days to perform.</p><p>2) Minor points:</p><p>A) I thought many of the dose response curves could be higher in quality, and should be re-done at better resolution.</p><p>B) In the third paragraph of the subsection “CLR01 disaggregates preformed SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils” the authors write that CLR01 acts sub-stoichiometrically. How do they know what the concentration of the relevant fibril species is? What is the stoichiometry?</p><p>C) In the Discussion, the authors speculate on the use of CLR01 in vivo, as a drug or drug lead. Probably the only way such a molecule could be used is topically. It will not be orally absorbed (in all likelihood), and an intravenous route would lead to low compliance. If they are to speculate on this, as they do now, they should alert the readership to these points.</p><p>D) I was unconvinced by the Concentration-Response curves, which are crucial to the efficacy arguments for CLR01. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the curve should go through 0 (not 25%...how is this possible at no compound?). More observations are needed in the transition region, and the authors should certainly sample every half-log, not every log10 in concentration. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, they should calculate a curve that actually goes through their points. I assume they fixed the Hill coefficient to 1, which doesn't seem to be supported by the curve. Here too, they need more points. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the Y-axis of the concentration-response curves should be on a linear scale, not a log scale. If it were, the reader would quickly notice that the curves are quite steep, which can be informative, and sometimes concerning.</p><p>Notwithstanding these concerns, the manuscript is interesting and could have wide impact. If the authors can address the concerns of the missing controls, I would support its publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05397.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All reviewers concur that the significance of the work is potentially there.

We agree that it is critical to exclude the possibility that CLR01 is acting via a non-specific mechanism that involves colloidal CLR01 aggregates. Colloidal aggregates formed by certain organic small molecules can inhibit fibril assembly by various amyloidogenic proteins, but to the best of our knowledge have not been reported to disrupt preformed amyloid fibrils (also mentioned by reviewer 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, in all our experiments performed with CLR01 during the past 8 years, no hint of colloidal aggregate formation has been found.</p><p>Here, to rule out any participation of colloidal aggregates, we performed five independent experiments to assess potential aggregate formation by CLR01 (documented and discussed in detail in the revised manuscript (subsection “CLR01 does not form colloidal aggregates”), new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). All experiments were performed in exactly the same buffer compositions as used in the manuscript:</p><p>1) NMR dilution titrations provided experimental evidence for a very weak CLR01 dimer formation (K<sub>a</sub> = ∼60M<sup>-1</sup>) in PBS buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4), with ∼5% CLR01 dimers present at 500 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>).

Thus, CLR01 is predominantly monomeric.</p><p>2) Diffusion NMR (DOSY) experiments in both buffers revealed hydrodynamic radii of ∼0.9 to 1.0 nm, slightly above the monomeric species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>3) Microcalorimetric dilution titrations revealed only minute endothermic heat changes, strongly contradicting an extensive aggregation process (data not shown).</p><p>4) Pyrene fluorescence revealed that no critical micelle concentration (cmc) could be determined in a wide concentration range (0-500 µM CLR01) encompassing fibril assembly and remodeling conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>5) Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), which overemphasizes the presence of large aggregates because the intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the square of the mass, revealed a very small fraction of CLR01 formed particles with hydrodynamic radius <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>H</italic></sub> ∼5–8 nm in PBS at concentration between 200–1,000 μM, plus a very minor fraction of particles with a <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>H</italic></sub> ∼ 20–40 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We did not observe CLR01 particles with an <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>H</italic></sub> of ∼95-400 nm, which is the size range typically associated with colloidal small-molecule aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGovern et al., 2002</xref>). By contrast, no CLR01 particles could be detected at 10 or 50 μM in PBS (data not shown). Moreover, no CLR01 particles were detected in HEPES buffer up to 1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>Thus, under all assay concentrations the vast majority of the tweezer molecules are monomeric. Minute amounts of dimers or higher order species may be present at high concentrations of CLR01 in some cases in PBS buffer (fibril assembly and cell culture buffer), but are absent from the HEPES buffer (fibril remodeling buffer). Thus, it is highly unlikely that colloidal CLR01 aggregates contribute meaningfully to the observed activity of the compound.</p><p>We have also performed experiments to exclude the possibility that the minute quantities of CLR01 that might form colloidal aggregates were the active species. Thus, the ability of CLR01 to: (a) inhibit fibril assembly by PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107); (b) remodel preformed SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils; and (c) directly inhibit HIV infection (in the absence of seminal amyloid) was not affected by:</p><p>1) BSA (10-50mg/ml), which would adsorb to the surface of any colloidal CLR01 aggregates and quench their activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2 fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 2 and 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGovern et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>2) Preclearing buffers containing CLR01 by centrifugation at 16,100-20,000g for 20min, which would remove any colloidal CLR01 aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGovern et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>These data strongly suggest that the small quantities of colloidal CLR01 aggregates that might be present are not the active species.</p><p>Finally, a feature of small molecules that form colloidal aggregates is that they are non-specific inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGovern et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGovern et al., 2003</xref>). By contrast, however, CLR01 displays specificity for amyloidogenesis by peptides that harbor lysine and arginine residues. Thus, if the lysine and arginine residues of PAP248-286 or PAP85-120 are replaced with alanine, then CLR01 can neither inhibit fibril assembly nor remodel preformed fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figure 2-I, 3I-L</xref>). This specificity is not consistent with an indiscriminate, non-specific mechanism of action mediated by colloidal CLR01 aggregates.</p><p><italic>Second, the authors should look to see if free lysine competes for CLR01 binding, disrupting its ability to act on the fibrils and the virions</italic>.</p><p>We have now established that free lysine or poly-L-lysine disrupt the anti-amyloid and antiviral activities of CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1;</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>).

There are several critical controls that appear to be lacking, as indicated below. If the data hold up after these controls, then I am enthusiastic. Amyloid fibrils in seminal fluid composed of at least 4 cationic proteins are established to enhance HIV transmission through intercourse by binding virons augmenting fusion efficiency. The Lys-binding molecular tweezer CLR01 delays the aggregation of PAP248-286 and SEM1(45-107) fibrillization, half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of CLR01 inhibition exhibited were 2.6 μM and 18.8 μM, respectively. By contrast, the IC50 to impede PAP85-120 assembly was significantly higher at 970 μM.

When we mix CLR01 (or buffer) with preformed SEVI, PAP85-120, or SEM1(45-107) fibrils for 10 min (a time at which no fibril remodeling occurs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>) and then adsorb them to the EM grid, we observe abundant fibrils in both the CLR01 and buffer control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, it is evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, that CLR01 does not affect adsorption of SEM1(45-107) fibrils to the EM grid. Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that CLR01 does not impede adsorption of peptide conformers to the grid.</p><p><italic>If these reactions are run for more than 30h, does aggregation into fibrils eventually occur? Does seeded aggregation eventually occur</italic>?</p><p>We have run the spontaneously fibril assembly reactions for 68 h for PAP248-286 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and 72 h for SEM1(45-107) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and observe very little fibril assembly in the presence of CLR01. We have now also run the PAP85-120 fibril assembly reaction for 68 h and observe very little fibril assembly in the presence of CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, under these conditions CLR01 is a potent inhibitor, which prevents spontaneous PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107) fibril assembly.</p><p><italic>The critical control that CLR01 is not displacing ThT from the fibrils needs to be performed</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this key control. We have addressed this question in two ways. First, we have monitored early time points (0 min, 10 min and 20 min) in SEVI and PAP85-120 fibril remodeling by CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). At these times, robust ThT fluorescence is still observed indicating that CLR01 is not simply displacing ThT from SEVI or PAP85-120 fibrils. Indeed, fibrils are still prevalent at these early times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, CLR01 is not simply competing for ThT binding as we would expect an instantaneous effect on ThT fluorescence as is observed, for example, with another small molecule EGCG and ABeta40 fibrils (Palhano et al., 2013). In this regard, it is also important to note that ThT fluorescence of SEM1(45-107), SEVI(Ala), and PAP85-120(Ala) fibrils is unaffected by CLR01 at various times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, 3I, 3L</xref>). Thus, CLR01 is not a general inhibitor or competitor of ThT binding to amyloid fibrils.</p><p>In a second approach, we employed a ThT displacement assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lockhart et al., 2005</xref>). Here, preformed SEVI, PAP85-120, or SEM1(45-107) fibrils (5 µM monomer) were preincubated with ThT (25 µM) for 30min at room temperature. Buffer, CLR01 (250 µM), or a known competitor of ThT binding, BTA-1 (250 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lockhart et al., 2005</xref>) were then added and incubated for 10min at room temperature. ThT displacement was then assessed by fluorescence. BTA-1 effectively displaced ThT, whereas CLR01 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings establish that CLR01 does not simply displace ThT from SEVI, PAP85-120, or SEM1(45-107) fibrils. Thus, any reduction in ThT fluorescence caused by CLR01 can be attributed to an inhibition of fibril assembly or remodeling of fibrils into conformers unable to bind ThT. Inhibition of fibril assembly by CLR01 has also been assessed by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). Likewise, fibril remodeling by CLR01 has also been assessed by: EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>), Proteostat staining, a red fluorescent aggregate sensing dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>), seeding activity of remodeled conformers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), and circular dichroism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>). By employing multiple approaches, we thus establish that CLR01 inhibits amyloid assembly of PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107), and remodels preformed SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils.</p><p><italic>The analog in which all eight lysine and arginine residues are replaced by alanine appears to be far from a perfect control in that this variant is anticipated to be much more amyloidogenic</italic>?</p><p>We have demonstrated that PAP248-286(Ala) and now the PAP85-120(Ala) peptide readily assemble into ThT-reactive fibrils in the presence of CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G-I</xref>). Moreover, SEVI(Ala) and PAP85-120(Ala) fibrils are resistant to remodeling by CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I-L</xref>). Thus, the activity of CLR01 cannot be attributed to a general ability to displace ThT from fibrils (and see above response). Indeed, CLR01 also has no effect on the ThT fluorescence of preformed SEM1(45-107) fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Rather, the PAP248-286(Ala) and PAP85-120(Ala) results suggest that CLR01 is unable to inhibit fibrillization or remodel fibrils when the target polypeptide is devoid of lysine and arginine residues. The PAP248-286(Ala) and PAP85-120(Ala) peptides spontaneously assemble into amyloid more rapidly than the wild-type peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B, G, I</xref>). However, we have been unable to establish conditions (e.g. higher CLR01 concentrations) where CLR01 prevents assembly of PAP248-286(Ala) and PAP85-120(Ala) into amyloid fibrils. Likewise, we have been unable to establish conditions (e.g. higher CLR01 concentrations) where CLR01 remodels SEVI(Ala) or PAP85-120(Ala) fibrils. These results are consistent with our suggestion that CLR01 is inactive against polypeptides devoid of lysine or arginine residues.</p><p><italic>In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, the critical control that CLR01 is not displacing ThT from the fibrils and inhibiting fibril adsorption to the grids needs to be run-the rapidity of disassembly is surprising, is it really disassembly</italic>?</p><p>As discussed above, we have demonstrated that CLR01 does not affect amyloid adsorption to EM grids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>) or displace ThT from fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). Although rapid, we now show that fibril remodeling by CLR01 is not instantaneous. Indeed, SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils resist remodeling for ∼20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). However, to be more cautious we now avoid the term fibril disassembly, and instead use the term fibril remodeling, which more accurately describes the observed effects.</p><p><italic>The result that CLR01 destroys retroviral particles with IC50 values between 10-20 μM by compromising virion integrity further suggests that CLR01 might be functioning as a colloid. CLR01 decreased viral infectivity of semen in a concentration-dependent manner, while CLR03 had no impact on semen-mediated infection enhancement. At a CLR01 concentration of 31 μM, the enhancing effect of semen was completely abolished. Thus, CLR01 prevents HIV infection in the presence of semen. If this is occuring through monomeric CLR01 this is incredible, but I suspect the authors' inhibitor is a micelle or colloid. The data are so impressive that I am concerned that these results are unlikely due to the monomeric molecular tweezer, but my hypothesis could be incorrect</italic>.</p><p>As outlined in the response to the editor, CLR01 does not form colloids, micelles, or other large aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We agree that the µM activity of CLR01 against HIV-1 in the presence of semen is remarkable. However, this is not due to formation of colloidal CLR01 aggregates as human seminal fluid contains abundant quantities of protein, which would be anticipated to quench the activity of a non-specific colloidal aggregate by adsorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, CLR01 activity against the virus is preserved in the presence of BSA (10 mg/ml; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2 fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 2 and 3</xref>) and is retained in the soluble fraction after centrifugation of CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4</xref>), two established methods to eliminate the activity of non-specific small molecule colloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, CLR01 exerts powerful inhibitory effects on amyloid accumulation of Abeta and TTR in vivo in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>) and alpha-synuclein aggregation in zebrafish models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</xref>). This potent activity in vivo makes a colloidal-based mechanism extremely unlikely. Taken together, these data suggest that CLR01 is not acting via a mechanism involving non-specific colloidal CLR01 aggregates.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[… The authors] find that CLR01 blocks the infectivity-enhancing activity of seminal fibrils, both with and without addition of BSA. Based on these results, the possibility of using CLR01 for the prevention of viral spread are discussed. However, there are concerns (and even contradictions) about the lack of mechanistic knowledge and the nature of the CLR01-amyloid interaction is not well understood. The null hypotheses – that CLR01 is a non-specific lysine interactor or even a detergent – are not adequately tested. Without deeper mechanistic insight and more rigorous exploration of the binding events, publication of the work seems premature</italic>.</p><p>We agree that further mechanistic insight would enhance our study. Hence, we have now added several experiments that provide deeper insight into the mechanism of CLR01 action. We can now exclude the possibility that CLR01 is acting via a non-specific mechanism mediated by colloidal CLR01 aggregates or detergent-like CLR01 micelles (see response to editor). We also demonstrate that the lysine-binding cavity of CLR01 plays an important role in both the anti-amyloid and antiviral activities of CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, it is important to note that the specificity of CLR01 binding to lysine or arginine is well established. CLR01 was tested against almost all naturally occurring amino acid residues in model compounds, and does not bind to any other amino acid side chain except for lysine (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>∼10 µM) and arginine (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>∼50 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fokkens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klärner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klärner et al., 2010</xref>). The structure of the CLR01-lysine complex and the precise mechanism of lysine threading into the CLR01 guest cavity and subsequent ion pairing have been extensively characterized by NMR spectroscopy, crystal structure, molecular dynamics, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dutt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klärner and Schrader, 2013</xref>). Importantly, CLR01 has no effect on formation or remodeling of SEVI(Ala) or PAP85-120(Ala) fibrils in which all lysine and arginines residues are exchanged to alanines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figure 2G-I, 3I-L</xref>). Thus, CLR01 does not inhibit amyloid formation or remodel amyloid fibrils in a non-specific way but rather requires that the polypeptides bear arginine or lysine residues. Moreover, the presence of arginine or lysine residues in the target peptide also does not guarantee that CLR01 will be able to remodel amyloid fibrils. Indeed, CLR01 could not remodel preformed SEM1(45-107) fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating a specific effect of CLR01 on SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Importantly, we now also show that free lysine or poly-L-lysine abrogate the anti-amyloid activity of CLR01, further demonstrating specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, CLR01 does not exert cytotoxic effects on cells, unlike non-ionic and anionic detergents such as TX-100, nonoxyl 9, or SDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>). Collectively, these data establish that CLR01 is not acting in a non-specific manner that involves detergent-like CLR01 micelles.</p><p><italic>1) There are few statistical analyses performed, so the relevance of comparing EC50 values is often unclear.

If CLR01 is simply blocking cationic charge of lysine and arginine residues, as the zeta potential and all-alanine mutant results imply, than one could presumably achieve this outcome faster, cheaper and more effectively with abundant biological polyanions, such as heparin or nucleic acids (DNA/RNA). What is the effect of these biological polyanions on the assembly of seminal amyloids and infectivity</italic>?</p><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point. However, it is important to note that CLR01 and CLR03 have identical negative charge, but only CLR01 exerts an anti-amyloid or antiviral effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig5 fig6 fig8 fig9">Figure 2A-C, 3A-C, 5A, 6A, 8A-C, 9A, B</xref>). We can therefore exclude the possibility that the effects of CLR01 are a trivial consequence of being anionic. Simply being anionic is not sufficient for anti-amyloid or antiviral activity, as CLR03 lacks activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig5 fig6 fig8 fig9">Figure 2A-C, 3A-C, 5A, 6A, 8A-C, 9A, B</xref>). This can be rationalized by the fact that, at the molecular level, the interaction of CLR01 with Lys residues is based on the formation of inclusion complexes in which Lys is trapped inside the tweezer’s cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dutt et al., 2013</xref>). The chemical structure of CLR03 does not allow for the formation of such inclusion complexes. Thus, as shown by the simulations reported in this paper, CLR03 interactions with the Lys residues of PAP are not preserved, unlike CLR01, which forms conserved inclusion complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>).</p><p>With regard to the effect of biological polyanions on HIV infectivity, it is well established that heparin (Ito et al., 1987; Rider, 1997; Vives et al., 2005) or oligodeoxynucleotides (Matsukura et al., 1987; Stein et al., 1993; Vaillant et al., 2006) can inhibit HIV-1 infection by binding to viral envelope glycoproteins, cellular receptors, or both. By contrast, CLR01 directly disrupts the viral membrane thereby eliminating the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-D</xref>). Hence, CLR01 and polyanions directly inhibit HIV infection by very different mechanisms.</p><p>It has also been demonstrated that heparin binds SEVI or PAP85-120 fibrils by electrostatic interactions, rendering the fibril surface negatively charged, thereby preventing enhancement of HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roan et al., 2009</xref>). Even though CLR01 is also negatively charged, it binds to SEVI, PAP85-120, or SEM1(49-107) fibrils via specific interaction with lysine or arginine residues making the fibrils neutrally charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, CLR01 prevents SEVI, PAP85-120, or SEM1(45-107) fibril formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>) and remodels preformed SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>), whereas polyanions such as heparin accelerate the formation of SEVI fibrils (Tan et al., 2013). Thus, CLR01 and polyanions inhibit the viral infection enhancing activity of amyloids fibrils by different mechanisms.</p><p>Polyanions, including heparin and various other glycosaminoglycans, have been investigated as HIV microbicides for decades, as they are also thought to exert direct anti-HIV activity by inhibiting the binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120, to its major cell surface receptor CD4 (Callahan et al., 1991; Rider, 1997; Witvrouw and De Clercq, 1997). Unfortunately, such anionic polymers have proven to be unsuccessful in past clinical trials due to their poor bioavailability and induction of inflammatory responses in the genital tract, which instead augment HIV transmission by recruiting HIV-susceptible target cells to the genital mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lüscher-Mattli, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van de Wijgert and Shattock, 2007</xref>). Moreover, it has recently become clear that the HIV-enhancing activity of semen diminishes the efficacy of diverse anti-HIV microbicides, including several polyanions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zirafi et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, CLR01 retains potent antiviral activity in the presence of semen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Thus, CLR01 antagonizes seminal amyloid and HIV via distinct mechanisms to polyanions and retains high activity in semen, which is likely an advantageous property for a potential microbicide candidate. We now discuss some of these issues in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) The hypothesis of CLR01 binding to individual lysine and arginine residues is not experimentally tested outside of a rather crude comparison of an all-alanine replacement peptide (which likely doesn't conform to the same structure as the native peptide)</italic>.</p><p>We have established that CLR01 is ineffective in preventing amyloid formation by PAP248-286(Ala) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H</xref>), and is also unable to remodel preformed SEVI(Ala) fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I-K</xref>). We have now extended these experiments to a PAP85-120 peptide, PAP85-120(Ala), where all the lysines and arginines are replaced by alanine. CLR01 is unable to inhibit the amyloidogenesis of PAP85-120(Ala) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) and is unable to remodel preformed PAP85-120(Ala) fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). These findings strongly suggest that lysine and arginine residues are critical for CLR01 activity against PAP248-286 and PAP85-120.</p><p>It is important to note that it is well established that CLR01 selectively binds lysine in amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sinha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). We have examined several complexes between CLR01 and peptides/proteins with multiple lysines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fokkens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klärner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klärner et al., 2010</xref>). 2D NMR and MS experiments have revealed, for example, that the tweezer molecule sits exclusively on both lysines and to a smaller extent on the single arginine of Αβ1-40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, we have shown that some enzymes with lysine residues around the active site can be inhibited by CLR01, and start to work again, after addition of free lysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Talbiersky et al., 2008</xref>). As mentioned above, the interaction between CLR01 and lysine has been studied and it is structurally well characterized: threading of the lysine side chain through the tweezer cavity, plus ion pair formation between the lysine ammonium cation and the tweezer phosphate anion produces a <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> of ∼10 µM for the 1:1 complex between one lysine side chain and one tweezer molecule, as determined by NMR and fluorescence titration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klärner and Schrader, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively, these precedents provide further support for a critical role for CLR01 interactions with lysine or arginine residues in the effects we observe on seminal amyloid peptides.</p><p><italic>Does free lysine, arginine or other free organic cations (or even divalent cations) compete for CLR01 binding</italic>?</p><p>To provide evidence that the anti-amyloid activity of CLR01 depends on the specific interaction with lysine, we performed competition experiments with free lysine or poly-L-lysine. As now shown in the revised manuscript, pretreatment of CLR01 with free lysine or poly-L-lysine abrogates the tweezers’ ability to: block amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>), remodel amyloid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>), neutralize amyloid surface charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>), and directly antagonize viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Does systematic replacements of lysine residues would provide insight into what the key interactions might be? What is the affinity of these interactions</italic>?</p><p>The reviewer makes great suggestions here. It will be extremely interesting to systematically replace the various lysine and arginine residues in PAP248-286, PAP85-120, and SEM1(45-107) to determine which lysines or arginines are critical for CLR01 to prevent amyloid assembly by these peptides. Likewise, it will be very interesting to systematically replace the various lysine and arginine residues in PAP248-286 and PAP85-120 to determine which are critical for fibril remodeling by CLR01. How these alterations affect the affinity of CLR01 for the various peptides will also be very interesting to determine. However, this is a very large set of studies, which we suggest is beyond the scope of this initial manuscript. We plan to perform these for a separate study where we dissect CLR01 mechanism in further detail.</p><p><italic>Presumably there are countless free lysine residues in true seminal fluid, so how can CLR01 have the selectivity required to identify the seminal amyloids (especially given the rather weak EC50 values in the mid-micromolar)</italic>?</p><p>The reviewer raises a very interesting point. The interaction between a single lysine residue and CLR01 has a <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> of ∼10µM, with fast on and off rates. On proteins, however, only a few lysines are well accessible for the relatively large molecular skeleton of the tweezers. For example, ITC and MD+QM/MM calculations have revealed that only 5 of 17 surface lysines in a 14-3-3 protein are complexed by CLR01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bier et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, a key point is that, because of the high on–off rate, CLR01 disrupts only relatively weak interactions as well as events that depend on critical and accessible lysine or arginine residues. Therefore, the tweezer has shown selectivity in multiple cases that on first impression may appear counter-intuitive. For example, inhibition of abnormal protein aggregation is achieved at 1:1–1:5 protein:CLR01 concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sinha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>), whereas disruption of controlled protein polymerization, e.g., of tubulin, requires 55-fold excess CLR01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attar et al., 2014</xref>) and enzyme inhibition requires ∼1,000-fold excess CLR01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Talbiersky et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, in vivo, CLR01 shows no toxicity at doses 2–3 orders of magnitude above those needed to enable clearance of amyloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prabhudesai et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, selectivity for lysine-bearing amyloid conformers in complex biological fluids is achieved by CLR01. We now discuss the issue (Discussion).</p><p>To experimentally address this question, we have tested the effect of BSA on the ability of the tweezer to antagonize virus infection. Neither coated nor free BSA affected the antiviral activity of CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2 fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplements 2 and 3</xref>). Of note, all cell culture experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig8 fig9">Figure 4G, 5A, 8A-C, 9B</xref>) were performed in the presence of 10% FCS which contains abundant proteins, further demonstrating that free lysines at the surface of bulk, structured proteins do not affect CLR01 function. Likewise, CLR01 retains antiviral activity in the presence of seminal fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), which also contains abundant proteins bearing lysine residues. Moreover, inhibition of amyloid assembly or amyloid remodeling by CLR01 was unaffected by BSA, indicating that surface lysines and arginines on BSA are not effective competitors of CLR01 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The ability of the compounds to block fibril-induced virion activity in the presence of BSA doesn't appear to make logical sense. CLR01 was created as a general lysine/arginine probe – so why wouldn't the compound be adsorbed onto the surface of BSA, which carries surface-exposed nucleophiles? The affinity of CLR01 for the seminal amyloid peptides and BSA (as a stand-in for biological fluids) needs to be carefully performed – by NMR, ITC or other method</italic>.</p><p>There is a profound difference between freely accessible lysines on non-structured protein domains, which can all be complexed by the tweezers, and folded proteins, whose surface often does not allow the sterically-demanding tweezer molecule to approach a lysine residue close enough for the threading mechanism. The interaction of CLR01 with seminal fibrils has been discussed above. To experimentally address whether BSA affects the antiviral activity of the tweezer and its ability to antagonize fibril-mediated infectivity enhancement (the two main mechanisms to prevent sexual viral transmission) we performed competition experiments. As mentioned above, we found that physiologically relevant concentrations of coated or free BSA do not affect the direct antiviral activity of CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2 fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplements 2 and 3</xref>). These results are in agreement with our previous data showing that the tweezer is active in the presence of semen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). BSA also failed to antagonize inhibition of amyloid assembly or amyloid remodeling by CLR01, suggesting that surface lysines and arginines on BSA are ineffective competitors of CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) The lack of CLR01-induced toxicity in mammalian cells is confusing, given the effects on vesicles and virion membranes (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>). The mammalian cells have numerous cholesterol-rich, raft-like domains, so that argument doesn't work. Presumably, the mammalian membranes would be disrupted just like in the vesicle and virion studies, but not leading to toxicity. What is going on here? Is calcium flux activated? Do the cells change shape? What is the affinity of CLR01 for viral membranes, vesicles and mammalian membranes? What lipid is being bound? By what mechanism do the membranes dissolve? Normally, such questions could be addressed in subsequent work, but the readers of this document would be expected to have major concerns about the logical gas and contradictions in the datasets, making careful and unbiased discussion an important requirement</italic>.</p><p>As mentioned by the reviewer, we suggest that a thorough analysis of the interaction of the tweezer with cellular and viral membranes is beyond the scope of this study. We like to point out, however, that we have extensively studied possible cytotoxic effects of CLR01 in vitro and in vivo, but have never observed significant effects at concentrations up to 500 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>). We now also show in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>, that CLR01 is far less cytotoxic than various detergents, including Triton X-100, SDS, or N9. The tweezer also has been tested <italic>in vivo</italic> in multiple experiments, as mentioned above, and was found to have a high safety margin in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attar et al., 2014</xref>). As recommended, we now discuss possible mechanisms of membrane disruption in the revised Discussion. Finally, it is important to note that the HIV membrane possesses a highly unusual lipid composition, which is distinct even from the detergent-resistant microdomains typically found in the plasma membrane, indicating that HIV budding involves a specific lipid raft clustering process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brügger et al., 2006</xref>). For example, although the HIV membrane resembles lipid raft microdomains in that it is enriched for saturated lipids, phosphatidylserine, plasmalogen-phosphatidylethanolamine, cholesterol, and sphingolipids, it is unusually enriched for the unusual sphingolipid dihydrosphingomyelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brügger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lorizate et al., 2009</xref>). This unusual lipid raft composition could make the viral membrane uniquely susceptible to the action of CLR01. In our future work, we intend to address this interesting point in greater detail.</p><p><italic>6) What is the CMC equivalent of CLR01? In other words, at what concentration does it form micro-aggregates or micelles? Some (perhaps many?) of the observed activities could be a result of non-specific activities, as described by the Shoicet group. DLS studies and detergent competition experiments need to be performed</italic>.</p><p>As outlined in detail in the response to the editor, we performed a series of experiments to exclude that CLR01 forms detergent-like micelles or colloidal aggregates. Thus, we show that even at millimolar concentrations the tweezers are present as predominantly monomeric species; only in PBS buffer does a very weak dimerization occur and minute amounts of higher-order species can be observed by DLS, due to the strong bias of this technique for large particles. No cmc could be determined using pyrene fluorescence. These experiments are summarized in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. We have also performed a series of experiments to exclude the possibility that the minute quantities of higher order CLR01 structures are the active species, i.e.: CLR01 activity is not affected by BSA (which would adsorb to the colloid and quench activity) or by preclearing any colloidal aggregates by centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2 fig5s3 fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 2, 3, and 4</xref>). Likewise, CLR01 is highly active in the presence of FCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig8">Figure 4E, 8A-C</xref>) and semen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), complex multiprotein mixtures that would also be predicted to quench the non-specific activity of colloidal CLR01 aggregates. Unfortunately, we were unable to perform the suggested experiments with non-ionic detergents as these exerted inhibitory effects on amyloidogenesis by seminal peptides, which conflated analysis. A similar issue of detergent incompatibility with amyloid assembly was encountered by Feng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>[…] The manuscript could have substantial impact. Before it is published, I suggest the authors address the following concerns</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) My major concern regards the mechanism of action. The authors postulate that classic host-guest complexes are forming with the cationic amino acids, as shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>, and this is important to the specificity and ultimate usefulness of the compounds. Currently, however, the manuscript lacks two controls that would help establish this mechanism</italic>:</p><p><italic>A) First, the authors should control for colloidal aggregation on the part of the CLR01 itself. Colloidal aggregation of organic small molecules can disrupt protein fibrils, by protein sequestration in the small molecule colloid (Feng et al., Nature Chem. Biol., 2008). Such a mechanism must be controlled for, especially given the peculiar efficacy of the compounds against the virion membranes themselves (this is hard to square with a host-guest type interaction, but would make sense for colloidal aggregates). To do so, the authors should do one or more of the following i. Look to see if CLR01 is forming colloids in the 10 - 30 μM range, for instance by dynamic light scattering. ii. Add a mild, non-ionic detergent such as Tween-100 to disrupt the colloidal aggregates. This would right-shift the efficacy curves (assuming the detergent doesn't disrupt the fibrils directly). iii. Before addition to the fibrils, spin down the aqueous “solution” of CRL01 (not the DMSO one) in a microfuge at its highest speed for 20 minutes. Use the supernatant as the CLR01 solution for efficacy testing (colloids will typically pellet over this time). iv. Add 10 mg/ml BSA to the fibril mixture, before addition of CLR01. BSA will prophylacticly coat colloids, disrupting their actions</italic>.</p><p>As outlined above in the response to editor, we now provide evidence that CLR01 is not functioning through colloidal aggregate formation. Thus, CLR01 is predominantly monomeric and only forms minute quantities of colloidal aggregates in PBS buffer, and does not form them at all in HEPES buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Even then, CLR01 activity is unaffected by BSA or by preclearing aqueous solutions of CLR01 (incidentally, stock CLR01 solutions were made in water or PBS and not DMSO, p. 23) via centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2 fig5s3 fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 2, 3, and 4</xref>), indicating that even if present, colloidal CLR01 particles cannot be the active species. Unfortunately, we were unable to perform the suggested experiments with non-ionic detergents as these exerted inhibitory effects on amyloidogenesis by seminal peptides, which conflated analysis. A similar issue of detergent incompatibility with amyloid assembly was encountered by Feng et al.

If it does not, or the effect is small, this would cast doubt on the mechanism proposed by the authors. This to me is an obvious control, and I worry that it was in the manuscript and I just overlooked it – if I did I apologize. If not, it should be done</italic>.</p><p><italic>Both controls should be done for both the effects on the protein fibrils and on the direct effects of the virus membrane. Whereas I hesitate to put authors to more work, I believe that these controls will substantially strengthen the manuscript, and should take more than a few days to perform</italic>.</p><p>As outlined above in the response to the editor, we performed these important controls. As expected from all previously published data on CLR01, we found that free lysine and poly-L-lysine abrogate the anti-amyloid and antiviral effects of CLR01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Minor points</italic>:</p><p><italic>A) I thought many of the dose response curves could be higher in quality, and should be re-done at better resolution</italic>.</p><p>We have now included additional replicates and tested additional concentrations of CLR01 to improve the accuracy of our IC<sub>50</sub> and EC<sub>50</sub> measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figure 2D, E, F, L, 3G, H</xref>).</p><p><italic>B) In the third paragraph of the subsection “CLR01 disaggregates preformed SEVI and PAP85-120 fibrils” the authors write that CLR01 acts sub-stoichiometrically.
