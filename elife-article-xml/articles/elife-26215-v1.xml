pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26215.001</object-id><p>Detachment of newborn neurons from the neuroepithelium is required for correct neuronal architecture and functional circuitry. This process, also known as delamination, involves adherens-junction disassembly and acto-myosin-mediated abscission, during which the centrosome is retained while apical/ciliary membranes are shed. Cell-biological mechanisms mediating delamination are, however, poorly understood. Using live-tissue and super-resolution imaging, we uncover a centrosome-nucleated wheel-like microtubule configuration, aligned with the apical actin cable and adherens-junctions within chick and mouse neuroepithelial cells. These microtubules maintain adherens-junctions while actin maintains microtubules, adherens-junctions and apical end-foot dimensions. During neuronal delamination, acto-myosin constriction generates a tunnel-like actin-microtubule configuration through which the centrosome translocates. This movement requires inter-dependent actin and microtubule activity, and we identify drebrin as a potential coordinator of these cytoskeletal dynamics. Furthermore, centrosome compromise revealed that this organelle is required for delamination. These findings identify new cytoskeletal configurations and regulatory relationships that orchestrate neuronal delamination and may inform mechanisms underlying pathological epithelial cell detachment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26215.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain and spinal cord begin as a tube that runs the length of the developing embryo.

Actin maintained the microtubules, which in turn maintained the acto-myosin cable. As newborn neurons delaminated, the actin cable constricted and the microtubules condensed, forming a tunnel that allowed a structure that organises the microtubules – the centrosome – to move, and the cell to detach. A protein called Drebrin, which links actin to microtubules, was identified as a potential coordinator of the process.</p><p>These findings not only further our understanding of nervous system development, but may also shed light on the development of human diseases.

It is a fundamental process underlying epithelial tissue morphogenesis that is linked to cell state change during normal differentiation and also to cancer cell dispersal. Cells undergoing neuronal differentiation delaminate from the proliferative domain of the neuroepithelium and this involves loss of adhesion between neighbouring cells at the ventricular surface. This process is required for correct neuron placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kriegstein and Noctor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh and Solecki, 2015</xref>), and this in turn is necessary for subsequent formation of functional neuronal circuitry. Neuronal delamination defects are collectively known as periventricular heterotopias and lead to a spectrum of deficits including epilepsy, dyslexia and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lian and Sheen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Passarelli and Moreira, 2014</xref>).</p><p>A genetic basis for human periventricular heterotopia has been mapped to the actin cross-linking protein, FilaminA and the ADP-ribosylation factor guanine exchange factor 2 ARFGEF2/BIG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lian and Sheen, 2015</xref>). The interaction between these proteins has implicated them in vesicle trafficking and stability/turnover of cell adhesion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). These data are consistent with work linking mutation of cadherins FAT4 and DCHS1 with a periventricular heterotopia phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badouel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cappello et al., 2013</xref>). Experiments in animal models implicate further regulators of cell adhesion in neuronal delamination, including Slit/Robo, which also acts by attenuating N-cadherin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wilsch-Bräuninger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wong et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borrell et al., 2012</xref>). Overall, many such proteins associated with apically localised adherens junctions (AJs) have been linked to the delamination process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cappello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Imai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kadowaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh and Solecki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stocker and Chenn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stocker and Chenn, 2015</xref>). AJs are required for the integrity of the entire neuroepithelium and so delamination defects and precocious neuronal differentiation are most readily seen following cell-autonomous deletion of associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stocker and Chenn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stocker and Chenn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Woodhead et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). However, despite such manipulations we know little about the cell biological mechanisms that mediate delamination as AJs disassemble.</p><p>Recent high-resolution live tissue-imaging of chick spinal cord has revealed that detachment of the newborn neuron from the ventricle is mediated by a novel cell sub-division mechanism, apical abscission, which leads to shedding of the apical tip of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das and Storey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das and Storey, 2014b</xref>). The apical poles of neuroepithelial cells are characterised by the presence of a contractile sub-apical acto-myosin cable which is mechanically and biochemically linked to cadherin-containing AJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe and Takeichi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marthiens and ffrench-Constant, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Maul et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miyamoto et al., 2015</xref>). Apical abscission is triggered by acto-myosin cable constriction following attenuation of N-cadherin; this process is blocked by N-cadherin mis-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das and Storey, 2014</xref>) while repression of <italic>N-cadherin</italic> transcription downstream of the neurogenic transcription factor cascade, which promotes neuronal differentiation, leads to loss of cell<underline>–</underline>cell contact at the ventricular surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rousso et al., 2012</xref>). Similar transcription factor activity that promotes neuronal delamination in the brain involves regulation of cadherin/apical polarity proteins by Snail superfamily members (and others) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acloque et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Itoh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Singh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh and Solecki, 2015</xref>). Importantly, such proteins also induce cell-cell detachment during epithelial to mesenchymal transition in other tissues and in oncogenic contexts suggesting operation of shared downstream cell biological mechanisms.</p><p>In some respects, apical abscission resembles cytokinesis, where a contractile acto-myosin ring generates the forces that separate the two daughter cells. A key structure regulating this cytokinetic ring is the central spindle, which consists of an array of antiparallel microtubules as well as de novo synthesized microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fededa and Gerlich, 2012</xref>). This raises the possibility that microtubules regulate the apical acto-myosin cable in neuroepithelial cells during delamination. Like actin, microtubules are also associated with AJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ligon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stehbens et al., 2006</xref>) and cadherin-mediated adhesion can recruit and stabilize microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stehbens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Waterman-Storer et al., 2000</xref>). Conversely, AJs are destabilized by microtubule de-polymerisation in a variety of cell types in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mary et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yap et al., 1995</xref>). This microtubule support for AJs involves kinesin-based transport of cadherin containing vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mary et al., 2002</xref>) and specifically in neuroepithelial cells by the KIF3 motor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Teng et al., 2005</xref>), although this transport role is context dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stehbens et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, microtubule de-polymerisation or stabilisation can block AJ disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ivanov et al., 2006</xref>) suggesting a more complex relationship between cadherin supply and AJ integrity. Little is known about the organisation of microtubules and their relationship with actin and AJs in the neuroepithelial cells or how they might regulate neuronal delamination.</p><p>A relationship between regulation of AJs and cell cycle exit is suggested by findings that link AJs to mitogenic signalling via Notch and Wnt pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hatakeyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). In the chick spinal cord, apical abscission is preceded by dis-assembly of the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das and Storey, 2014</xref>) and loss and or retraction of ciliary membrane is also associated with delaminating zebrafish retinal neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lepanto et al., 2016</xref>). Mediators of the mitogenic Sonic hedgehog pathway are processed into activated forms in the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2009</xref>) and so this may be a further way in which cell biological mechanisms associated with delamination link this process to cell state change. Following cilium disassembly, the centrosome is retained in the withdrawing neuronal cell process while ciliary and apical membrane are shed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das and Storey, 2014</xref>). Centrosome retention is then critical for subsequent neuronal differentiation: for neuronal migration to form the cortical plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Higginbotham and Gleeson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tsai and Gleeson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xie et al., 2003</xref>), as a microtubule organising centre during axonogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Anda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zmuda and Rivas, 1998</xref>), and in defining where dendrites will elongate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Puram and Bonni, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Puram et al., 2011</xref>), although this is context dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kuijpers and Hoogenraad, 2011</xref>). The role of the centrosome in delamination and the mechanism that ensures its retention in newborn neurons are, however, not known. Here, we use live-tissue imaging and super-resolution microscopy to elucidate the cytoskeletal architecture of the apical end-foot of neuroepithelial cells and to dissect the regulatory relationships which underpin cytoskeletal dynamics underlying neuronal delamination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A wheel-like microtubule configuration in the neuroepithelial cell apical end-foot</title><p>To localise microtubules within neuroepithelial cells, we carried out immunocytochemistry in sections of chick spinal cord (at Hamburger and Hamilton stage HH17-8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>) to detect the stable microtubule marker, acetylated α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Perdiz et al., 2011</xref>), the AJ-associated protein N-cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton using phalloidin.

This confirmed cessation of EMTB-GFP accumulation and subsequent failure to detach from the apical surface. These EMTB-GFP dynamics were then quantified by measuring GFP fluorescence intensity at the sub-apical poles of these cells following exposure to this drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, quantified in B’’ grey dashed line, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>, 12 cells in 10 slices).

We then monitored overall actin dynamics in cells expressing GFP-GPI, pCIG-Neurog2 and F-tractin-mKate2 that were poised to delaminate. We observed that while some cells in taxol-treated slices exhibited sub-apical constriction as judged by local cell shape change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> white arrowheads,16/34 cells in 21 slices), this dynamic of sub-apical actin accumulation and subsequent loss ceased as indicated by fluorescence intensity measurements and such cells remained attached at the ventricular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, quantified in C’’ (grey dashed line), <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video4">Figure 6—video 4</xref>, 20 cells in 16 slices). In contrast, actin intensity in cells imaged in medium containing only DMSO increased at the abscission site and was then rapidly lost from the withdrawing cell-process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C’</xref>, quantified in C’’ (black dashed line), <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video5">Figure 6—video 5</xref>, 12 cells in 11 slices), consistent with our previous report of actin dynamics during this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das and Storey, 2014</xref>).</p><p>We then carried out the converse experiment, in which cells expressing mKate2-GPI, pCIG-Neurog2 and EMTB-GFP that were poised to delaminate were cultured in medium containing 20 μM ML-7 to inhibit acto-myosin constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Saitoh et al., 1987</xref>). We observed that the majority of the EMTB-GFP electroporated cells were now unable to initiate sub-apical constrictions (19/25 cells in 18 slices) and progress through to abscission, and that sub-apical EMTB-GFP labelling no longer exhibited its characteristic pattern of accumulation followed by loss. This was confirmed by measuring sub-apical GFP fluorescence intensities in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and quantified in D’’ (grey dashed line), <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video6">Figure 6—video 6</xref>, 16 cells in 13 slices).

These findings indicate that microtubule and actin conformational dynamics are inter-dependent; loss of actively growing microtubules blocked stable accumulation of actin at the presumptive abscission site and loss of acto-myosin activity abolished enrichment of microtubules at this location. Consistent with this inter-dependence, inhibition of either acto-myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das and Storey, 2014</xref>) or microtubule activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) reduced the incidence of neuronal delamination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The actin and microtubule cross-linking protein drebrin is required for neuronal delamination</title><p>A number of proteins have been proposed to link actin and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coles and Bradke, 2015</xref>).

To address whether Drebrin is a candidate mediator for actin-microtubule interaction during neuronal delamination we first assessed localisation of endogenous protein using IHC in transverse sections of the neural tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We found widespread cytoplasmic localisation of endogenous Drebrin, including in the apical end-foot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–A’’’</xref>, 3 sections from each of 4 embryos).

This suggests that it passes through the sub-apical actin/microtubule tunnel-like configuration that we observed in cells poised to delaminate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>). To investigate this possibility further, we measured the diameter of the ring formed by rim microtubules visualised with acetylated alpha tubulin (17 cells in 2 explants from 2 embryos, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). This gave an average diameter of 0.89 ± 0.18 μm with an average centrosome diameter measured with IFT88, at the base of the ciliary membrane, of 0.32 ± 0.06 μm (36 cells in 2 explants from 2 embryos). However, the latter only identifies the ciliary axoneme and centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Robert et al., 2007</xref>) and so may under-estimate the full extent of the centrosomal material. Measurement of centrosomal γ-tubulin (which includes peri-centriolar material) revealed an average size of 0.98 ± 0.12 (21 cells, data not shown), consistent with centrosome size of 0.82 ± 0.17 μm in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fu and Glover, 2012</xref>). These data therefore support the possibility that the centrosome moves through a tunnel-like cytoskeletal configuration formed by apical microtubules and the constricting actin cable.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26215.047</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Centrosome translocation during apical abscission depends on actin and microtubule dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The centrosome (labelled with PACT-TagRFP, red) undergoes a basal translocation through a thinned region of membrane (labelled with GFP-GPI, green).

To verify centrosome disruption using this approach, cells were first transfected with PACT-KillerRed and PACT-YFP.

We uncover a conserved wheel-like microtubule organisation, composed of rim and radial microtubules nucleated by the centrosome, which spans the apical end-foot and aligns with the actin cable and linked AJs. We show that apical actin maintains these microtubules, which are in turn required for maintenance of AJs and that apical actin serves to define end-foot dimensions. This apical cytoskeleton then changes dramatically in newborn neurons as they undergo apical abscission and delaminate following downregulation of N-Cadherin. The apical microtubules condense led by the constricting actin cable and together these form a tunnel-like configuration through which the centrosome then transits as it moves basally. We demonstrate that this enrichment of microtubules at the abscission site depends on acto-myosin activity and that dynamic microtubules are in turn required for effective acto-myosin constriction. We additionally identify the actin-microtubule cross-linking protein Drebrin as a potential coordinator of microtubule and actin dynamics and demonstrate its requirement for neuronal delamination. Furthermore, inter-dependent actin and microtubule dynamics were required for centrosome translocation and subsequent cell detachment. Indeed, compromise of centrosome microtubule-nucleating capacity decreased the incidence of delamination, indicating that this organelle is a critical promoter of new microtubules mediating this step. These data demonstrate that neuronal delamination is an active process; it is not sufficient to downregulate N-cadherin, nucleation of apical microtubules and inter-dependent microtubule and actin dynamics are needed to drive this process and to retain the centrosome in the newborn neuron.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Neuroepithelial apical end-foot architecture relies on actin and microtubule maintenance of adherens junctions</title><p>One of the major challenges in neural development as well as cell biology is to elucidate the mechanisms regulating cytoskeletal interactions that direct neuroepithelial integrity and neuronal morphology. We provide evidence here for a microtubule wheel-like organization nucleated by the centrosome of the primary cilium in neuroepithelial apical end-feet and for conservation of this configuration across species and regions of the central nervous system. A similar wheel-like arrangement of microtubules has been observed in kidney epithelial (MDCK) cells in vitro and cochlear epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellett et al., 2009</xref>). Here centrosomal microtubules were orientated with plus-ends towards the AJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellett et al., 2009</xref>) and by tracking the trajectories of EB3-GFP comets we observed a similar configuration in neuroepithelial cells. One explanation for this structure is the recruitment of microtubule plus-ends by AJs/cell cell contact, which has been demonstrated in several epithelial cell lines in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stehbens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Waterman-Storer et al., 2000</xref>). However, in myoblasts, microtubules are directed towards cell contacts by their plus-ends, and here they are then locally repelled at N-cadherin adhesion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Plestant et al., 2014</xref>). This indicates that AJ capture of microtubules is context dependent; indeed this can involve association with minus- rather than plus-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meng et al., 2008</xref>) and that other mechanisms might also account for plus-end growth towards the cell periphery. We show here that in neuroepithelial cells microtubule wheel-like ‘rim’ microtubules interface with the actin cable and that this configuration is generated by dynamic centrosome generated microtubules that bend and grow along the actin cable. This may reflect bio-physical properties of microtubules when they encounter the epithelial cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gomez et al., 2016</xref>) and/or regulation by proteins transported by microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mata and Nurse, 1997</xref>), but it also suggests that interaction between these two cytoskeletal components influences overall microtubule conformation. Our data support such a regulatory relationship, demonstrating microtubule depletion in the apical end-foot following inhibition of actin polymerisation and increased accumulation of actin within the cell following depletion of microtubules; indicating that microtubules regulate actin localisation, although levels of actin at the adhesion belt were unaffected in the timeframe of our assay. Such interactions may be mediated directly by proteins that bind actin and microtubules, these may include formins, IQGAP, dynein/dynactin complex and unconventional myosins as well as Drebrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazellières et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geraldo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goode et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Merriam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rodriguez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trivedi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate here that Drebrin is localised in apical end-feet of neuroepithelial cells in a distribution similar to that in apical intestinal epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazellières et al., 2012</xref>) that includes the sub-apical actin cable, which we show is also aligned with apical microtubules. Drebrin is therefore in a position to link and so coordinate changes in the acto-myosin cytoskeleton and microtubules during neuronal delamination. Furthermore, <italic>Drebrin</italic> knock-down clearly indicated that this protein is required for neuronal delamination. Experiments should now be focused on elucidating Drebrin dynamics during this process in relation to those of actin and microtubules. In particular, it will be important to establish whether Drebrin serves to direct EB3 comets emerging from the centrosome to actin cable and so create the interface between apical microtubules and sub-apical actin, much as observed during neuronal cell nucleokinesis and migration movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trivedi et al., 2017</xref>). Drebrin binding of the AJ protein Afadin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rehm et al., 2013</xref>) also raises the interesting possibility that changes in Drebrin localisation as these junctions disassemble, underpins coordinated condensation of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton during delamination.</p><p>In other cellular contexts, emphasis has been placed on microtubule regulation of AJs. There is evidence that microtubules promote accumulation of E-cadherin at epithelial cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stehbens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Waterman-Storer et al., 2000</xref>), but this did not reflect a role in conveying E-cadherin to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stehbens et al., 2006</xref>). However, these researchers demonstrated a requirement for microtubules for myosin phosphorylation at sites of E-cadherin accumulation in MCF7 cells and so linked microtubules to actin-mediated organisation of AJs. In contrast, N-cadherin transport to the cell membrane requires the microtubule kinesin based motor in a range of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mary et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Teng et al., 2005</xref>) and neuroepithelial cells in mice mutant for the KIF3 motor complex protein KAP3, lack membrane localised N-Cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Teng et al., 2005</xref>). Our data demonstrate that within an hour of microtubule depletion N-Cadherin levels drop dramatically at AJs, consistent with microtubule transport of N-cadherin in the neuroepithelial end-foot.</p><p>Importantly, actin is required to maintain these apical microtubules and both actin and microtubules maintain the AJs, so actin may act directly and/or indirectly to promote these junctions. Unlike nocodazole treatment, acute inhibition of actin filament assembly reduced actin levels at the adhesion belt and resulted in a smaller end-foot size and so indicated that it is the actin cable that determines apical end-foot dimensions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neuronal delamination is driven by acto-myosin constriction and dynamic microtubules</title><p>This delicately balanced apical cytoskeletal architecture changes dramatically as newborn neurons delaminate from the neuroepithelium. This involves the process of apical abscission, which takes place following N-cadherin downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das and Storey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rousso et al., 2012</xref>). We show here that this includes enrichment of microtubules as well as actin in a composite tunnel-like configuration at the presumptive abscission site. It is interesting that blocking microtubule growth with taxol, while not abolishing acto-myosin contractility, interferes with stable accumulation of actin and that this correlates with reduced cell delamination. This regulatory relationship appears similar to that of the central spindle during cytokinesis, which specifies assembly of the acto-myosin ring by delivering the small GTPase RhoA to the equatorial cortex, that in turn triggers local actin polymerisation and acto-myosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eggert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Piekny et al., 2005</xref>). This relationship is also consistent with failure to disassemble AJs and impaired acto-myosin constriction in calcium-free conditions (which disrupt trans-cadherin dimers) in renal and intestinal cells treated with taxol in vitro, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ivanov et al., 2006</xref>); which additionally suggests a further role for active microtubules in AJ disassembly.</p><p>Importantly, downregulation of N-Cadherin during neuronal delamination involves not simply transcriptional repression downstream of the neurogenesis transcription factor cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rousso et al., 2012</xref>), but also mechanism(s) that remove N-Cadherin protein, as plasmid driven N-Cadherin is attenuated by such proneural gene activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das and Storey, 2014</xref>). One possibility is that rearrangement of apical microtubules during apical abscission may reduce microtubule-AJ association and so further facilitate loss of N-cadherin protein. This may additionally involve regulation of endocytosis/cadherin turnover and there is evidence that actin can also influence this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cavey and Lecuit, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Georgiou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ivanov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Izumi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">West and Harris, 2016</xref>). For example, in a cell free assay trans-acting E-Cadherin activates the actin Rac1/Cdc42/IQGAP1 pathway that inhibits E-Cadherin endocytosis and so maintains AJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Izumi et al., 2004</xref>); when such cell-cell interactions are lost then cadherin endocytosis increases. This mechanism is consistent with the phenotype of <italic>Cdc42</italic> deletion in the developing mouse cortex, which leads to loss of AJs and mis-localisation of neuroepithelial cells away from the ventricular/apical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cappello et al., 2006</xref>) and with the involvement of heterotopia-associated genes FilaminA and ARFGEF2/BIG2 in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sheen, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In previous work, we established that acto-myosin constriction was required for apical abscission and here we show that inhibition of acto-myosin activity with ML-7 also blocks accumulation of microtubules at the presumptive abscission site. Together with the requirement for microtubules for stable actin accumulation, these findings suggest that active actin is upstream of microtubule conformational change during this process and that these microtubules then act back to promote effective acto-myosin constriction. Importantly, these data demonstrate that microtubules and actin continue to influence each other even when N-Cadherin/AJs are disassembled in a delaminating cell, further supporting involvement of cross-linking proteins which directly coordinate these cytoskeletal components. An intriguing possibility is that microtubules act here during delamination to augment myosin II phosphorylation, as reported at cell-cell contacts in MCF7 cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stehbens et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Centrosome retention is linked to the abscission mechanism</title><p>The continued generation of radial comets from the centrosome in cells with small apical end-feet suggests that microtubule nucleation persists as the actin cable constricts and that this may result in formation of the microtubule/actin tunnel-like configuration through which the centrosome eventually passes. This is supported by our finding that both acto-myosin contractility and microtubule turnover are required for centrosome translocation. Furthermore, by specifically compromising centrosome-mediated microtubule nucleation using targeted CALI, we demonstrate that delamination requires centrosome generated microtubules. To our surprise, we further found that centrosome translocation takes place late in the abscission process, in highly constricted cells. Together these findings suggest a mechanism which places the centrosome at the centre of the abscission process and its own retention during neuronal delamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26215.058</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Summary of cytoskeletal configuration and dynamic changes in the apical end-foot during neuronal delamination.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26215-fig10-v1"/></fig><p>This sequence of events has some similarity to that taking place during cytokinesis observed in Hela cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Piel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Piel et al., 2001</xref>); here, following cleavage furrow and midbody formation, movement of the mother centriole into the midbody bridge triggers release of central spindle microtubules, while disassembly of the actin ring and plasma membrane scission take place after it moves away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Piel et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, experiments which compromise the centrosome inhibited final cytokinetic abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Piel et al., 2001</xref>) or, in our experiments, neuronal delamination and this suggests that the centrosome provides molecular cues that prompt common final abscission steps. A critical function for the centrosome in neuronal delamination predicts that mouse mutants affecting the centrosome should exhibit heterotopias in which neurons remain ectopically attached in the region of the ventricle. Phenotypes in such mice vary depending on which centrosomal gene is targeted as well as the timing and extent of gene loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Insolera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lizarraga et al., 2010</xref>). However, Sas4/Cenp2 mutant mouse cortex exhibits mis-localisation of mitotically stalled neural progenitors away from the ventricle and also some neuronal heterotopias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Insolera et al., 2014</xref>), consistent with the findings reported here following compromise of the centrosome specifically in presumptive neurons.</p><p>Cell delamination from within epithelial sheets is a fundamental cell behaviour linked to both differentiation and disease (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kesavan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Slattum and Rosenblatt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nikitas and Cossart, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vasioukhin, 2012</xref>). Our data uncover novel cytoskeletal architecture and cell biological mechanisms that mediate this process in the neuroepithelium. It is important now to determine whether these cytoskeletal configurations and regulatory relationships are conserved in other cell types and if they are perturbed in pathological contexts. Indeed, our findings are consistent with recent work demonstrating microtubule network remodelling prior to centrosome reorientation in cells undergoing EMT-like polarity inversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burute et al., 2017</xref>). It therefore seems likely that the apical microtubule-actin alignment uncovered here is a common feature of epithelial cells and that the interdependency of effective acto-myosin constriction and dynamic microtubules during apical constriction is a shared mechanism which may ensure retention of the apically localised centrosome characteristic of many epithelial cell types. These findings further show that delamination is an active process downstream of AJ loss and may open up new opportunities to manipulate delamination by targeting context specific proteins that orchestrate actin and microtubule interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>In ovo electroporation and plasmids</title><p>Fertilized chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) eggs were obtained from Winter Egg Farm (Hertfordshire - Royston SG8 7RF, UK) and incubated at 38°C to Hamburger and Hamilton stages 10–12.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Phillip Gordon-Weeks (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Kasioulis, Das and Storey examines the role of microtubule and actin interaction in neuronal delamination from a chick spinal cord germinal zone niche. The authors use time-lapse imaging to document cytoskeletal rearrangement during delamination and hypothesize that microtubule/actin cooperation underlies a series of events occurring during delamination. Ultimately, the authors propose that acto-myosin contraction coupled with microtubule dynamics creates a centrosome/microtubule translocation event essential for delamination.</p><p>The experiments are well designed and the results for the most part convincing. Conceptually, the idea that microtubule-actin interactions control a complex morphogenic event is interesting and rather timely. In general, the field of neuronal morphogenesis focuses on either the activity of microtubules and actin in isolation. Thus, the implications of the study are very important to an area that has struggled to analyze higher order cytoskeletal integration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Key genetic manipulations are needed to bolster some of the experiments done only with cytoskeletal drugs. While drugs like nocodazole, taxol or ML7 are accepted in the field they possess limitations: they can have off-target consequences and in this situation treating an entire tissue with drugs will have non-cell autonomous impacts on the experiments in question. This requires additional manipulation of the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton. Over-expression of Stathmin, which depolymerizes microtubules, and a Dominant Negative Rock Kinase construct, which inhibits actomyosin contractility, are methods that have used by others to cell autonomously perturb the relevant cytoskeletal systems. Addition to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref> are sufficient for such experiments.</p><p>2) Currently, some claims regarding cytoskeletal interactions are on balance descriptive. Thus, conclusions and the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> model should be moderated in the cases where the cytoskeletal relationship are only defined by correlative imaging. Most imaging of the study is done with confocal microscopy, which has a poor axial resolution to detect such interactions. Therefore, claims of cytoskeletal interaction should also be buttressed by a mechanistic manipulation of a candidate microtubule-actin linking factor. A cell permeable IQGAP1 inhibitor (Oblander SA, Brady-Kalnay SM. Mol Cell Neurosci. 2010 May;44(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>):78-93) or a drebrin shRNA (Dun et al. Mol Cell Neurosci. 2012 Mar;49(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>):341-50) are useful tools validated in chick for these studies. Addition to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref> are sufficient for such experiments.</p><p>3) Additional statistical analysis would add strength to many of the author's claims beyond some of the single examples shown. In most cases, the degree of delamination is only stated as a percentage of imaged cells, a measure that does not reveal mechanistic subtly of possible phenotypes. Measuring the soma directed movement of apically anchored processes in existing data as a time course is an appropriate surrogate for delamination of processes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and 8. Statistical representation of the relationships in existing data displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref> is needed. Finally, key experiments such as those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref> have very low experimental observations compared to other figures where 30-50 cells were examined.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26215.061</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Key genetic manipulations are needed to bolster some of the experiments done only with cytoskeletal drugs.

To achieve this, plasmids are injected into the lumen of the neural tube and electroporation across the embryo leads to transfection of cells – most often these are mitotic cells which present the largest surface area at the lumen/apical surface. These cells will have first to make the proteins encoded by these constructs and in many cases will have re-entered the cell cycle and require transit through mitosis before differentiation. This reflects the nature of this tissue, it is a proliferative neuroepithelium in which neurons are born and it is this process that we are studying. As we are sure you will appreciate, we have found that introducing constructs that interfere with microtubules or acto-myosin and monitoring their effects in cells poised to delaminate has been difficult; we have succeeded for microtubules, but not for acto-myosin.</p><p>a) We have mis-expressed Stathmin-GFP and found that this reduced delamination of cells poised to abscise; this new data is presented in the last paragraph of the subsection “Microtubules are required for neuronal delamination” and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video7">Figure 5—videos 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video8">8</xref>). Targeting Stathmin-GFP to cells poised to delaminate required significant optimization and was achieved eventually by carrying out many transfections at low plasmid concentrations to be able to monitor sufficient cells in this state for this analysis. The data we present indicates that this genetic approach replicates the results generated using taxol or nocodazole and validates use of these small molecules to investigate the role of microtubules in this assay. Given the difficulties we encountered targeting this construct to cells about to differentiate we did not extended this approach to assessing effects of Stathmin-GFP on EMTB, F-tractin and centrosome dynamics.</p><p>b) Experiments to genetically manipulate acto-myosin contractility in presumptive neurons have proved particularly challenging. Initially, we transfected cells with mKate2-GPI, Ngn2-IRES-mApple and a dominant negative Rock Kinase-GFP fusion construct to inhibit acto-myosin contractility. This construct was driven by a promoter that works weakly in avian cells (CMV). Upon imaging we were unable to detect significant levels of GFP expression, although transfected progenitor cells expressing mKate2-GPI, Neurog2-IRES-mApple were seen undergoing mitosis and later neuronal delamination. The latter observation suggested that expression of this plasmid, at such low levels, was unable to interfere with acto-myosin constriction in this assay. We therefore next used a further construct with a more active promoter. This involved use of a non-activatable version of myosin light chain 2 (MRLC2<sup>T18AS19A</sup>-GFP) (which attenuates actin constriction and mimics effects of blebbistatin, Miklavc et al. 2015, JCS 128, 1193-1203). As expression from the MRLC2<sup>T18AS19A</sup>-GFP construct is driven by the CAGGS promoter, which induces robust expression in avian cells, we expected to observe higher levels of MRLC2<sup>T18AS19A</sup>-GFP. However, when transfected tissue was imaged, we found very few transfected cells amidst a background of cell debris, suggesting that mis-expression of this construct has a detrimental effect on cell viability. Indeed, we managed to image a small number of cells (6 cells, 6 slices, 6 embryos) which were able to initiate mitosis, but quickly experienced cell death following this. We conclude that to disrupt acto-myosin contractility in cells poised to delaminate it is necessary to use methods that allow very precise temporal control. At present, the most efficient approach available to achieve this is the use of chemical inhibitors, whose application to the imaging medium can be controlled in a precise manner.</p><p>In conclusion, we have addressed the requested experiments and we have been able to show that genetic interference with microtubule polymerisation inhibits neuronal delamination. We have been unable to extend this genetic approach to manipulation of acto-myosin activity, in large part because we could not interfere with this process without also targeting the preceding mitosis. It is informative here that Stathmin-GFP does not affect progression through mitosis due to its increased phosphorylation during this phase of the cell cycle (Brattsand et al. 1994, Eur J Biochem 220, 359-368; Luo et al. 1994, JBC 14, 10312-10318; Gavet, O et al. 1998, JCS 111, 3333-3346). Recent experiments where Stathmin was over-expressed in the zebrafish retina showed similar effects on newborn neurons while sparing mitosis (Icha et al. 2016, JCB 215, 259-275). This may explain why we were eventually able to target prospective neurons with low level Stathmin-GFP, but could not use this mis-expression approach with an acto-myosin interfering construct. So, while we have been unable to carry out all the experiments requested here, this is in large part due to the biological constraints inherent in this tissue based assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Currently, some claims regarding cytoskeletal interactions are on balance descriptive. Thus, conclusions and the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> model should be moderated in the cases where the cytoskeletal relationship are only defined by correlative imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moderated conclusions relating to actin and microtubule interaction and the text in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> (formerly labeled as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) as requested. We have shown that microtubules are required for acto-myosin constriction and that conversely that acto-myosin activity is required for normal microtubule dynamics; these two cytoskeletal components are therefore inter-dependent during delamination, but we agree that we have not identified direct interactions. We have accordingly replaced “interact” with phrases indicating an inter-dependent regulatory relationship. This includes changing the title to “Inter-dependent apical microtubule and actin dynamics orchestrate centrosome retention and neuronal delamination”, the last sentence of the Abstract and of the Introduction, first and last lines of the Discussion and the final paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Most imaging of the study is done with confocal microscopy, which has a poor axial resolution to detect such interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a mis-understanding here. We do not use confocal microscopy, but rather a widefield Δ-Vision imaging system. We take images at 1.5uM intervals through a 50uM deep Z stack and these are subject to deconvolution to remove out of focus fluorescence. These data are presented as maximum intensity projections in images provided for figures, but many movies are also provided. Although the axial resolution achieved through widefield microscopy is modest, this technique facilitates image acquisition at superior signal-to-noise, enabling us to capture very fine and dim sub-cellular structures in living tissue. Capturing such detail is often impossible using the other available techniques such as confocal or other super-resolution techniques due to photo-bleaching of these dim and dynamic signals. We do complement this approach with fixed super-resolution techniques (SIM and STED) to confirm the wheel-like microtubule configuration and the close association between sub-apical actin and microtubules during neuronal delamination. Combined, these approaches provide a detailed view of the cytoskeletal re-arrangements that occur during the process we are studying.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, claims of cytoskeletal interaction should also be buttressed by a mechanistic manipulation of a candidate microtubule-actin linking factor. A cell permeable IQGAP1 inhibitor (Oblander SA, Brady-Kalnay SM. Mol Cell Neurosci. 2010 May;44(1):78-93) or a drebrin shRNA (Dun et al. Mol Cell Neurosci. 2012 Mar;49(3):341-50) are useful tools validated in chick for these studies.

We have, however, carried out extensive experiments to characterize Drebrin localization and its relationship to actin and microtubules in the developing neuroepithelium. We found that Drebrin has a widespread cytoplasmic distribution in neuroepithelial cells and that it co-localises with the sub-apical actin belt in the apical end-foot, subsection “The actin and microtubule cross-linking protein Drebrin is required for neuronal delamination”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A-C</xref>. Knockdown of Drebrin using short hairpin RNA resulted in a reduction in the number of cells delaminating; Drebrin shRNA (4/27- 15%) and Scrambled sh-control (7/10- 70%), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. We were not able to extend this analysis to monitor EMTB and centrosome dynamics in the presence of Drebrin shRNA because it is difficult to live-image three different fluorescent labels in the same experiment (EMTB or centrosome or actin marker, membrane marker, Neurog2-NLS-GFP and Sh-Drebrin-GFP) and given this technical complexity we felt these further experiments were beyond of the scope of this paper. The experiments we do present here identify Drebrin as a potential microtubule-actin linking factor expressed at the right time and place to regulate neuronal delamination and demonstrate its requirement for this process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additional statistical analysis would add strength to many of the author's claims beyond some of the single examples shown. In most cases, the degree of delamination is only stated as a percentage of imaged cells, a measure that does not reveal mechanistic subtly of possible phenotypes.

We mis-express Neurog2 (raised levels of which promote neuronal differentiation) and we then look for and monitor cells with a basally located nucleus that possess an attached apical cell-process. As we monitor these cells we can see whether the nucleus changes position (i.e. moves apically and so has re-entered the cell cycle – this is not seen in <italic>Neurog2</italic> mis-expressing cells in this configuration). Inclusion of cells that have a basally moving nucleus would increase our numbers, but there is a possibility that some of these cells might re-enter the cell cycle beyond the imaging period. We would prefer to only include cells with a static basally positioned nucleus. As described below, we have carried out further experiments to increase the number of cells for some experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistical representation of the relationships in existing data displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref> is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out the detailed statistical analyses requested by the reviewers.
