(P)-bodies that binds the DCP2 decapping enzyme and stimulates mRNA decay. EDC4 also interacts with mammalian MARF1, a recently identified endoribonuclease that promotes oogenesis and contains a number of RNA binding domains, including two RRMs and multiple LOTUS domains. How EDC4 regulates MARF1 action and the identity of MARF1 target mRNAs is not known. Our transcriptome-wide analysis identifies bona fide MARF1 target mRNAs and indicates that MARF1 predominantly binds their 3’ UTRs via its LOTUS domains to promote their decay. We also show that a MARF1 RRM plays an essential role in enhancing its endonuclease activity. Importantly, we establish that EDC4 impairs MARF1 activity by preventing its LOTUS domains from binding target mRNAs. Thus, EDC4 not only serves as an enhancer of mRNA turnover that binds DCP2, but also as a repressor that binds MARF1 to prevent the decay of MARF1 target mRNAs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mRNA decay</kwd><kwd>RNA binding protein</kwd><kwd>mRNA decapping</kwd><kwd>endonuclease</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-130425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fabian</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2015-03712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fabian</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Chercheurs-boursiers Junior two</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fabian</surname><given-names>Marc R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New Investigator award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fabian</surname><given-names>Marc R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Crosslink immunopreciptiation (iCLIP) studies reveal important mechanistic insights into how MARF1 post-transcriptionally regulates targeted mRNAs and uncover a novel mode by which EDC4 regulates mRNA metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The regulated decay of eukaryotic mRNA populations plays an important role in the post-transcriptional control (PTC) of gene expression. These PTC programs are, in turn, critical for regulating a number of biological processes, including during early development, cell proliferation and immune response. The major mRNA decay pathway in eukaryotes initiates with the shortening of the mRNA poly(A) tail (deadenylation), which is carried out by the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). mRNA deadenylation is then followed by recruitment of the DCP1-DCP2 decapping complex that hydrolyzes the mRNA 5’-cap structure. This complex is comprised of the DCP2 decapping enzyme, DCP1 (associates with DCP2) and enhancers of mRNA decapping (EDC) proteins (i.e. EDC3 and EDC4). EDC4 enhances mRNA decapping by binding both DCP1 and DCP2 stimulating DCP2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2014</xref>). Once the 5’-cap is removed to yield a 5’ monophosphate, the mRNA is committed for degradation by the 5’-to-3’ exonuclease XRN1. Many proteins that play a role in mRNA metabolism, including EDC4 and other mRNA decapping factors, are found associated with processing (P)-bodies, cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules that contain translationally repressed mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Standart and Weil, 2018</xref>). In addition to binding DCP1 and DCP2, human EDC4 also interacts with the RNA binding protein MARF1 (meiosis regulator and mRNA stability factor 1), a recently characterized endonuclease that promotes oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanemitsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nishimura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Su et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian MARF1 proteins contain a NYN endonuclease domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that adopts a PIN-like fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nishimura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Su et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to its NYN domain, MARF1 also contains a number of RNA binding modules, including two RRMs and eight tandem winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) LOTUS (Limkain, Oskar, and Tudor containing proteins 5 and 7) domains. <italic>Drosophila</italic> MARF1 also contains several tandem LOTUS domains, but has only one RRM and lacks a nuclease domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Instead, the first of its LOTUS domains recruits the CCR4-NOT complex to initiate deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay. In contrast, mammalian MARF1 does not directly associate with the CCR4-NOT complex but rather uses a C-terminal motif to physically interact with EDC4, DCP1 and DCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nishimura et al., 2018</xref>).

In addition to regulating the development of the mammalian germline, MARF1 is also expressed in the developing brain where it has been reported to regulate neuronal differentiation in the embryonic cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanemitsu et al., 2017</xref>). While knocking out MARF1 in oocytes dramatically alters gene expression, it is currently unclear which mRNAs are directly targeted by MARF1 and which of its RNA binding modules mediate target RNA recognition.</p><p>To investigate which mRNAs are directly targeted by MARF1 and how MARF1 interfaces with them, we carried out transcriptome-wide analysis of MARF1-targeted mRNAs by individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP). We demonstrate that MARF1 interacts with a select set of mRNAs by predominantly binding to their 3’UTRs. We further show that MARF1 utilizes its tandem LOTUS domains to bind target mRNAs, with several core LOTUS domain being essential. While the MARF1 LOTUS domains are involved in target recognition, we further show that RRM1 plays a critical role in NYN-mediated decay of targets following initial MARF1 binding. Importantly, we demonstrate that EDC4 binding to MARF1 impairs MARF1-mediated repression by preventing MARF1 from binding to target mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human MARF1 protein binds to the 3’UTR of target mRNAs</title><p>To comprehensively identify MARF1-associated mRNAs, we performed iCLIP using engineered HEK293 cells stably expressing a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible FLAG-tagged MARF1 that lacks RNAse activity (F-MARF1<sup>ΔNYN</sup>). Briefly, F-MARF1<sup>ΔNYN</sup> -expressing cells were UV-crosslinked, cell lysates were partially digested with RNAseI and MARF1-RNA complexes were subsequently immunoprecipitated with a FLAG antibody. RNA fragments bound to MARF1 were then isolated, converted into cDNA libraries and analyzed by deep sequencing. We also carried out a parallel iCLIP experiment with a FLAG antibody using control HEK293 cells that do not express a FLAG-tagged MARF1 protein. This allowed us to stringently control for non-specific background in FLAG immunoprecipitations. Recovered RNAs from two biological experiments were sequenced, PCR artifacts and multi-mapping reads were removed and primary genome-aligned reads were clustered to generate peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This analysis identified only 108 high-confidence mRNAs bound by F-MARF1<sup>ΔNYN</sup> with the vast majority of assigned peaks mapping to 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The observation that most of the crosslinked reads derived from exonic sequences is consistent with the cytosolic localization of MARF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloch et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>It was recently reported that disruption of the <italic>Marf1</italic> gene by genetrap (GT) or inserting an inactivating mutation into the MARF1 NYN domain (D272A) led to dramatic changes in oocyte gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). A comparison of our iCLIP data with these gene expression datasets identified 34 iCLIP targets that were upregulated in <italic>Marf1<sup>GT/GT</sup></italic> or <italic>Marf1<sup>D272A/D272A</sup></italic> oocytes, with the majority of these targets (29) being upregulated in both contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These include <italic>Maml1</italic>, <italic>Zfp36l2</italic>, <italic>Atxn7l3</italic>, <italic>Faf2</italic>, <italic>Pgam1</italic>, <italic>Igf2bp1</italic> and <italic>Cpsf7</italic>, whose levels were increased anywhere from 5- to 261-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Full-length λNHA-MARF1 efficiently represses a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (RL) reporter mRNA in HEK293 cells when it is artificially tethered via the bacteriophage λN-BoxB tethering system to its 3’UTR (RL-5BoxB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> through C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nishimura et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, this repression is NYN-dependent as a MARF1 mutant lacking the NYN domain (λNHA-MARF1<sup>ΔNYN</sup>) did not efficiently silence the RL-5BoxB reporter. To determine if MARF1 has the potential to repress targets identified by iCLIP, we constructed a set of RL reporters containing 3’UTRs of MARF1 targets, including those of <italic>Maml1</italic>, <italic>Notch2</italic>, <italic>Zfp36l2</italic>, <italic>Atxn7l3</italic>, <italic>Faf2</italic>, <italic>Pgam1</italic>, <italic>Igf2bp1</italic> and <italic>Cpsf7</italic>. We also generated a RL reporter with the 3’UTR of Interleukin 6 (IL-6), an mRNA 3’UTR that was not identified as a MARF1 target. MARF1-expressing plasmids were transfected along with RL-3’UTR constructs and a FL construct as a transfection control. In keeping with our results using the RL-5BoxB reporter, full-length λNHA-MARF1 efficiently repressed these reporters in a NYN-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, repression was specific to <italic>bona fide</italic> targets, as MARF1 was not able to silence the IL-6 reporter. This repression also appeared to be at the level of mRNA decay, as full-length MARF1 significantly reduced the steady state levels of RL-MAML1 and RL-NOTCH2 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and the stability of RL-MAML1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) in a NYN-dependent manner, as assessed by RT-qPCR. Similarly, overexpressing wild-type MARF1 resulted in marked decrease of the steady-state levels of both endogenous <italic>Notch2</italic> and <italic>Maml1</italic> mRNAs as compared to cells expressing MARF1<sup>ΔNYN</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Although our iCLIP data demonstrated MARF1 binding to numerous mRNA 3’UTRs, we were not able to identify any short sequence motifs enriched in MARF1 peaks. This suggests that structural motifs in the target RNAs and/or other positional elements are likely to determine the 3’UTR binding specificity of MARF1.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>MARF1 represses target mRNAs via their 3’UTRs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the basic <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (RL)-encoding mRNA reporter, containing five 19-nt BoxB hairpins, interacting with <bold>λ</bold>N-HA-MARF1, as well as a RL reporter with a 3’UTR from endogenous mRNAs.

We set out to determine how MARF1 recognizes target mRNAs by generating a number of C-terminal deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A MARF1 mutant lacking the decapping factor interaction motif (ΔC-term) efficiently silenced both the RL-MAML1 and the RL-5BoxB reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, a MARF1 N-terminal fragment (<bold>λ</bold>NHA-MARF1<sup>N-term</sup>) that lacks both the LOTUS domains and the decapping factor interaction motif efficiently silenced RL-5BoxB but failed to repress the RL-MAML1 reporter. Sequence alignment of human MARF1 protein LOTUS domains revealed that the central LOTUS domains 3 and 5 are highly conserved in MARF1 homologs, including <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Dario rerio</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, human MARF1 LOTUS domains 3 and 5 also share a high degree of sequence identity with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on these data, we hypothesized that specific LOTUS domains may play a more important role in MARF1-mediated repression than others. To determine which LOTUS domains in MARF1 are required for target RNA repression, we deleted each LOTUS domain individually from full-length <bold>λ</bold>NHA-MARF1 and tested their abilities to repress RL-MAML1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed that MARF1 mutants lacking LOTUS domains 1, 2, 6, 7 or eight efficiently silenced RL-MAML1 and RL-5BoxB mRNAs. However, MARF1 mutants lacking LOTUS domains 3, 4 or 5 were unable to efficiently silence RL-MAML1. Nevertheless, MARF1 proteins lacking LOTUS domains 3, 4 or 5 efficiently repressed the RL-5BoxB reporter mRNA, suggesting that deleting these core LOTUS domains did not impact MARF1 nuclease activity but rather its binding to endogenously targeted mRNA 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Previous studies established that RRM1 binds single-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). To assess if the RNA-binding capacity of RRM1 plays a role in MARF1-mediated repression we mutated a number of amino acid residues on the predicted canonical RNA-binding surface of the RRM1 domain (Y515A, Y517A, I552A, F582A), which would be expected to abolish its RNA binding capacity (<bold>λ</bold>NHA-MARF1<sup>RRM1mut</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

To this end, we used immunofluorescence microscopy to assess the subcellular localization of our HA-tagged wild-type and C-terminal deletion mutant MARF1 proteins in HeLa cells expressing V5-tagged EDC4. Full-length λNHA-MARF1 localized to P-bodies, as determined by co-localization with EDC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left panels), whereas a λNHA-MARF1 mutant lacking its C-terminal motif did not localize with EDC4 to P-bodies but rather exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, middle panels). To test whether the interaction between EDC4 and MARF1 is what is responsible for EDC4 impairing the repressive activity of MARF1, we took advantage of the MARF1 C-terminal motif, which is sufficient on its own to interact with EDC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nishimura et al., 2018</xref>) and also co-localizes with EDC4 in P-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Our iCLIP analysis of MARF1 in HEK293 cells identified 108 mRNAs bound by MARF1 and demonstrates that MARF1 binds to the majority of these mRNAs via their 3’UTRs. Moreover, we provide evidence using mRNA reporters containing 3’UTRs of endogenous target mRNAs that MARF1 represses them in a NYN-dependent manner. While luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that MARF1 represses gene expression in a NYN-dependent manner, some degree residual repression of the reporters was observed in cells expressing a MARF1 variant lacking its endonuclease NYN domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). It is possible that MARF1<sup>ΔNYN</sup> binding to select mRNA 3’UTRs may alter 3’UTR topology in such a way as to impair reporter mRNA translation without altering their stability. This is further supported by the fact that MARF1<sup>ΔNYN</sup> did not significantly repress mRNA levels of several target mRNAs as compared to LacZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, many MARF1-targeted mRNAs identified by iCLIP are upregulated in MARF1 knockout mouse oocytes as compared to wild-type oocytes. Notwithstanding the validation of a number of MARF1-targeted mRNAs, prediction algorithms including DREME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey, 2011</xref>) did not identify a motif within the iCLIP peaks, suggesting that MARF1 may recognize structural motifs rather than specific nucleotide sequences. Our CLIP experiments were carried out in the presence of endogenous EDC4, which we now know is sufficient to partially inhibit MARF1 from interfacing with target mRNAs in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It is possible that MARF1-targeted mRNAs are underrepresented in our CLIP dataset due to the presence of endogenous EDC4. It will therefore be important to determine if altering EDC4-MARF1 dynamics identifies a larger set of MARF1 target mRNAs.</p><p>Our data indicate that MARF1 is recruited to target mRNAs via its tandem LOTUS domains.

MARF1 proteins contain several (between six and eight) tandem LOTUS domains. <italic>Drosophila</italic> MARF1 protein lacks a NYN domain; however, its first LOTUS domain has been reported to recruit the CCR4-NOT complex to bring about deadenylation of targeted mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Both mouse and human MARF1 proteins contain eight LOTUS domains.

Moreover, tethering an N-terminal fragment of human MARF1 that contains the NYN domain and RRMs but lacks all eight LOTUS domains efficiently represses a reporter mRNA when artificially tethered to it (RL-5BoxB). Although mammalian MARF1 proteins contain eight LOTUS domains, our deletion analyses suggest that certain core LOTUS domains (3 through 5) are critical for MARF1-mediated repression, whereas other adjacent LOTUS domains are not. Importantly, while all MARF1 proteins contain between 6 and 8 LOTUS domains, LOTUS domains 3 and 5 are not only highly conserved across MARF1 orthologs but also share an extremely high degree of homology to each other. While our data does not exclude the possibility that adjacent LOTUS domains also bind to target mRNAs, they do suggest that the central LOTUS domains are critical for the initial steps of target mRNA recognition. Exactly how LOTUS domains 3 and 5 contact MARF1 target elements remains to be explored.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>RRM1 is a NYN coactivator module</title><p>All MARF1 proteins that contain a NYN domain (with <italic>Drosophila</italic> MARF1 being the exception) also contain two RRMs, the functions of which are not known.

MARF1 mutants lacking RRM1 or containing amino acid substitutions within its putative RNA binding surface are unable to efficiently silence reporter mRNAs containing MARF1-targeted 3’UTRs. Importantly, these mutants were also unable to silence the RL-5BoxB reporter when artificially tethered to it. In marked contrast to this, a MARF1 deletion mutant lacking its LOTUS domains, which could repress the RL-5BoxB construct was unable to silence reporters with endogenous 3’UTR sequences targeted by MARF1. All in all, these data suggest that RRM1 does not play a role in initial target mRNA recognition but rather in subsequent NYN-mediated cleavage of a targeted mRNA. We speculate that RRM1 may function to properly position the NYN domain on a target mRNA in order to promote efficient cleavage.

Overexpressing EDC4 impairs MARF1 repression of target RNAs but has no effect on the silencing potential of a MARF1 mutant that cannot bind EDC4. In addition, depleting endogenous EDC4 or preventing MARF1 association with EDC4 enhances MARF1-mediated repression. Importantly, our data indicate that EDC4 only impairs MARF1 repression only when it is recruited to a target mRNA via its LOTUS domains, whereas EDC4 association with MARF1 has no impact on MARF1 repression when it is artificially tethered to a reporter mRNA in a LOTUS-independent manner (i.e. λN-BoxB tethering). Moreover, RNA immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that EDC4 negatively regulates MARF1-mediated repression by preventing target mRNA association as opposed to inhibiting NYN-mediated target cleavage. Based on these data, we hypothesize that EDC4 binding to the MARF1 C-terminal motif precludes the LOTUS domains from binding to endogenous MARF1 target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first example of the mRNA decapping machinery stabilizing mRNAs (albeit indirectly) by inhibiting an RNA binding protein from interacting with its targets, rather than promoting their turnover.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for MARF1-mediated mRNA decay.</title><p>MARF1 recognizes target mRNAs via LOTUS domains 3 through 5. Subsequently, RRM1 enhances NYN-mediated cleavage of target mRNAs, potentially by assisting in positioning the NYN domain on target. EDC4 regulates MARF1-mediated repression by interacting with the MARF1 C-terminus, segregating MARF1 to P-bodies and preventing MARF1 from binding target mRNAs, potentially by interfering with LOTUS domain-RNA interactions.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54995-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>While metazoan cells contain a number of mRNA-targeting endonucleases including SMG6 and Regnase, MARF1 is unique in that it physically interacts with mRNA decapping factors. Moreover, SMG6 does not require decapping proteins to promote nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boehm et al., 2016</xref>). We speculate that this form of regulation may serve to prevent MARF1 protein from binding to mRNAs when MARF1 is expressed at low levels. Only when MARF1 gene expression is dramatically upregulated, as is the case during certain stages of oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Su et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Su et al., 2012b</xref>) and bind to target mRNAs in a LOTUS domain-dependent manner. Whether EDC4 has a similar mode of action for other RNA binding proteins remains to be investigated.</p><p>EDC4 is a core component of P-bodies, membraneless granules that contain proteins involved in mRNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Standart and Weil, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yu et al., 2005</xref>). However, instead of promoting mRNA decay, mRNAs trapped in P-bodies exist in a translationally-repressed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>). Our data demonstrate that the MARF1 endonuclease localizes to P-bodies via its interaction with EDC4. However, it also suggests that MARF1 is ‘trapped’ in P-bodies and unable to interface with endogenous target mRNAs. Taken together, these data suggest that P-bodies may also regulate mRNA metabolism by impounding specific effectors of mRNA decay (e.g. MARF1) such that they are unable to efficiently bind target mRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Concurrently, cells were transfected with either plasmids coding for GFP (control) or V5-tagged EDC4. 24 hr post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS and UV crosslinked at 150 mJ cm<sup>−2</sup>. Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 100 mM NaCl; 1% NP40 (Igepal CA630); 0.1% SDS; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; protease inhibitor; in RNase-free water). Lysates were incubated overnight with empty protein G magnetic beads (control) or beads coupled to FLAG antibody. Aliquots were taken for RNA and Protein inputs. Beads were then magnetized and stringently washed as outlined in the eCLIP protocol. 20% of the washed beads were taken for validation by western blot with the ‘Protein Input’ samples. The remaining beads were Proteinase K treated for 20 min at 37C, shaking at 1200 rpm. Post-proteinase K treatment, input and IP samples were RNA-extracted using EZ-10 Spin Column RNA Miniprep Kit (Biobasic). Extracted RNA was DNaseI-treated (Invitrogen) for 1 hr and inactivated using inactivating reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamer following the protocol for Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Thermofisher). Quantitative PCR on the generated cDNAs was carried out with GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega) and primers (IDT) against the ORF of our RL-MAML1 and FL (control) plasmids. To measure MARF1-target mRNA enrichment levels, the input and IP samples were first analyzed separately. The CT values of the RL-MAML1 mRNA as determined by qPCR were first normalized to the FL mRNA CT values (ΔCT). This ΔCT value for the FLAG immunoprecipitation samples was then normalized to the ΔCT value of the uncoupled beads (ΔΔCT). Finally, the relative fold-change of the ΔΔCT value was determined by calculating 2<sup>-ΔΔCT</sup>. After the relative fold-changes were calculated, the enrichment between the IP and input values was determined by dividing the IP relative fold-change by the input relative fold-change.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>mRNA stability assays</title><p>HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids coding for RL-MAML1, FL and various λNHA-expressing proteins using PEI reagent (Polysciences). 24 hr later, cells were treated with Actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) for various amounts of time and lysed. Total RNA was extracted and RT-qPCR was performed on these samples as outlined above with primers against the coding sequences of RL and FL.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank members of the Fabian lab for their input into the project, including Tamiko Nishimura for generating HEK293 cells stably expressing doxycycline-inducible F-MARF1<sup>ΔNYN</sup>.

previously shown to be required for normal oogenesis in mice, is negatively regulated by a core component of the mRNA decapping complex, EDC4. In addition, the potential RNA targets of the MARF1 endonuclease are identified by iCLIP, disclosing important mechanistic insights into MARF1 ribonuclease function, its regulation, and its targets in somatic cells.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A non-canonical role for the EDC4 decapping factor in regulating MARF1-mediated mRNA decay&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While the reviewers consider the manuscript to represent a solid and interesting study disclosing important mechanistic insight into the nuclease function of MARF1, they also raise important reservation about the biological relevance. This criticism mostly concerns the uniform use of the luciferase reporter to address mRNA decay relationships as well as the use of somatic cells, where MARF1 has to be overexpressed to allow its study. To consider the manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, revision is therefore required addressing the below points.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) According to the model, EDC4 inhibits MARF1 mRNA binding. Since iCLIP was performed in the presence of endogenous EDC4, the low number of identified mRNAs might reflect that over expressed MARF1 is in a rather inactive state. The authors should perform iCLIP with the ΔC-term mutant and compare the results with the full-length dataset (ΔNYN). Alternatively, EDC4 knock down could be performed and MARF1 could be clipped. This would solidify the presented model and add further physiologically relevant data to the study.</p><p>2) Nearly all reported effects of MARF1 activity on mRNA decay is provided by reporter constructs with a protein read-out (luciferase activity), and in all cases exogenously expressed MARF1. It is essential to demonstrate, at least initially, that the luciferase output reflects mRNA steady-state levels, and preferably also mRNA decay rates. Also, the demonstrated effects of manipulation with EDC4 expression on luciferase reporters elicited by MARF1 (EDC4 knockdown and EDC4 overexpression; e.g. Figure 5) needs to be recapitulated with endogenous targets.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54995.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) According to the model, EDC4 inhibits MARF1 mRNA binding.

However, our figure labels didn’t clearly reflect this, a mistake that we have now rectified. In addition, we have also assessed the mRNA decay rate for the RL-MAML1 reporter mRNA with actinomycinD pulse experiments (Figure 2F). Our new data demonstrate that wild-type MARF1 destabilizes the RL-MAML1 mRNA, whereas the MARF<sup>ΔNYN</sup> has no effect on transcript decay rates.</p></body></sub-article></article>
