We utilized whole genome sequencing and Bayesian statistics to analyze the evolutionary history, temporal emergence of resistance and transmission networks of MDR <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex isolates from Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan (2001–2006). One clade (termed Central Asian outbreak, CAO) dating back to 1974 (95% HPD 1969–1982) subsequently acquired resistance mediating mutations to eight anti-TB drugs. Introduction of standardized WHO-endorsed directly observed treatment, short-course in Karakalpakstan in 1998 likely selected for CAO-strains, comprising 75% of sampled MDR-TB isolates in 2005/2006. CAO-isolates were also identified in a published cohort from Russia (2008–2010). Similarly, the presence of mutations supposed to compensate bacterial fitness deficits was associated with transmission success and higher drug resistance rates. The genetic make-up of these MDR-strains threatens the success of both empirical and standardized MDR-TB therapies, including the newly WHO-endorsed short MDR-TB regimen in Uzbekistan.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38200.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, often shortened to MDR-TB, is a public health crisis with close to half a million patients falling ill each year globally. Some strains of the bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, which causes tuberculosis disease, are resistant to the two most effective drugs used to treat the infection. As a result, patients with MDR-TB require a longer treatment of up to two years, often with severe side effects and a low chance of cure. Resistant strains of the bacteria are usually weaker than drug-susceptible strains. So, for a long time, large MDR-TB epidemics were considered to be unlikely and outbreaks of MDR-TB were often regarded as locally contained phenomenona.</p><p>Recent research has shown that MDR-TB strains are often just as likely as drug-susceptible strains to be transmitted and therefore just as likely to cause large country-wide outbreaks. It has also become clear that the resistant bacteria acquire additional mutations over time to compensate for any weakness. However, a lack of detailed history of outbreaks has meant the role of the genetics of MDR-TB bacteria has not been fully understood. Without this knowledge, prevention of future outbreaks and containment of the most successful strains in areas with a high burden of disease is difficult.</p><p>To address this, Merker, Barbier et al. reconstructed the evolutionary history of MDR-TB strains obtained in 2001–2006 from an outbreak in Uzbekistan. Whole genome sequencing followed by statistical analysis highlighted one predomininant strain that likely emerged in the mid-1970s, when the country was part of the former Soviet Union. This strain has since acquired mutations that make it resistant to eight different drugs. The most successful bacterial strains found also had compensatory mutations that seem to aid their survival.</p><p>In 1998, the health authorities implemented a TB treatment program in the region without knowing the true extent of the MDR-TB outbreak at that time. Testing for drug resistance was not routinely available, and Merker, Barbier et al. saw that MDR-TB strains resistant to the drugs used spread in the study region and were later also found independently in Russia.</p><p>A lack of routine testing for drug resistance in TB remains common in many countries with high burdens of the disease. These findings emphasize the need for universal access to tests for TB drug resistance, therapies tailored for individual patients, and access to new and repurposed drugs to reduce the risk of future outbreaks of drug-resistant TB.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>M. tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd><kwd>MDR-TB</kwd><kwd>compensatory evolution</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Leibniz Science Campus Evolutionary Medicine of the Lung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merker</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Niemann</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The genetic make-up of dominating MDR-TB clades in Central Asia is shaped by programmatic and socio-economic changes that led to fixation of resistance and bacterial fitness related mutations in the Soviet era.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC) strains that are resistant to the first-line drugs isoniazid and rifampicin, represent a threat to global TB control. Barely 20% of the estimated annual 480,000 new MDR-TB patients have access to adequate second-line treatment regimens. The majority of undiagnosed or ineffectively treated MDR-TB patients continue to transmit their infection and suffer high mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">WHO, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Based on early observations that the acquisition of drug resistance could lead to reduced bacterial fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Middlebrook and Cohn, 1953</xref>), it was hypothesized that drug-resistant MTBC-strains had a reduced capacity to transmit, and would not widely disseminate in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borrell and Gagneux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billington et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dye and Espinal, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson and Levin, 1999</xref>). This optimistic scenario has been invalidated by the now abundant evidence for transmission of MDR and extensively drug-resistant MTBC-strains (XDR-TB; MDR-TB additionally resistant to at least one fluoroquinolone and one injectable aminoglycoside) in healthcare and community settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borrell and Gagneux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gagneux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pym et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comas et al., 2012</xref>). In former Soviet Union countries, which experience the highest MDR-TB rates worldwide, the expansion of drug-resistant MTBC-clones is thought to be promoted by interrupted drug supplies, inadequate implementation of regimens, lack of infection control and erratic treatment in prison settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balabanova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casali et al., 2014a</xref>). Continued transmission is thought to be aided by the co-selection of mutations in the bacterial population that compensate for a fitness cost (e.g. growth deficit) associated particularly with the acquisition of rifampicin resistance mediating mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borrell and Gagneux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson and Levin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gagneux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pym et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comas et al., 2012</xref>). The compensatory mechanism for rifampicin-resistant MTBC-strains is proposed to be associated with structural changes in the RNA-polymerase subunits <italic>RpoA</italic>, <italic>RpoB</italic>, and <italic>RpoC</italic> that increase transcriptional activity and as a consequence enhance the growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comas et al., 2012</xref>). However, the impact of these bacterial genetic factors on the epidemiological success of MDR-MTBC strains and implications for current and upcoming MDR-TB treatment strategies remain unexplored.</p><p>We utilized whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to retrace the longitudinal transmission and evolution of MTBC-strains toward MDR/pre-XDR/XDR geno- and phenotypes in Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan. In this high MDR-TB incidence setting, the proportion of MDR-TB among new TB-patients increased from 13% in 2001 to 23% in 2014 despite the local introduction of the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended DOTS strategy in 1998 and an initially limited MDR-TB treatment program in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ulmasova et al., 2013</xref>). We expanded our analyses by including a WGS dataset of MDR-MTBC isolates from Samara, Russia (2008–2010) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casali et al., 2014a</xref>) to investigate clonal relatedness, resistance and compensatory evolution in both settings.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study population and MTBC phenotypic resistance (Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan)</title><p>Despite differences in sampling for cohort 1 (cross-sectional, 2001–2002) and cohort 2 (consecutive enrollment of MDR-TB patients, 2003–2006) (see Materials and methods), patients showed similar age, sex distributions, and proportion of residence in Nukus, the main city in Karakalpakstan (Uzbekistan) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix—table 1</xref>). While the majority of strains from both cohorts were phenotypically resistant to additional first-line TB drugs (i.e. beyond rifampicin and isoniazid), combined resistance to all five first-line drugs was significantly greater in cohort 2 (47% in cohort 2 compared to 14% in cohort 1, p&lt;0.0001). The same was true for resistance to the second-line injectable drug capreomycin (23% in cohort 2 compared to 2% in cohort 1, p=0.0001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix—table 1</xref>). This finding was surprising as the isolates from cohort two patients - who were treated with individualized second-line regimens predominately comprising ofloxacin as the fluoroquinolone and capreomycin as the second-line injectable - were all obtained before the initiation of their treatment. In addition, there was no formal MDR-TB treatment program in Karakalpakstan prior to 2003. These elements imply that the higher rate of resistance to capreomycin was attributable to infection by already resistant strains (i.e. to primary resistance).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MTBC population structure and transmission rates</title><p>Utilizing WGS, we determined 6979 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) plus 537 variants located in 28 genes and upstream regions associated with drug resistance and bacterial fitness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Strikingly, CAO-isolates were also found also in Samara, Russia, and vice versa isolates belonging to the second largest clade in Samara (Beijing clade B, i.e. European/Russian W148 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casali et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Merker et al., 2015</xref>) were identified in Karakalpakstan, suggesting that the MDR-TB epidemic in this world region is driven by few outbreak clades. During the three last decades, these strains gradually accumulated resistance to multiple anti-TB drugs that largely escaped phenotypic and molecular diagnostics, and reduced treatment options to a restricted set of drugs that often cause severe side effects. In addition, our results suggest that compensatory mutations (in RNA-polymerase subunit coding genes) that are proposed to ameliorate growth deficits in rifampicin resistant strains in vitro are also crucial in a global epidemiological context allowing MDR and pre-XDR strains to form and maintain large transmission networks. The predominance of these strain networks, seen in two distant geographic regions of the former Soviet Union clearly limit the use of standardized MDR-TB therapies, for example the newly WHO endorsed short MDR-TB regimen, in these settings.</p><p>Temporal reconstruction of the resistance mutation acquisition and of changes in bacterial population sizes over three decades demonstrates that MDR outbreak strains already became resistant to both first- and second-line drugs in the 1980s. Fully first-line resistant strains massively expanded in the 1990s, a period that shortly preceded or immediately followed the end of the Soviet Union, years before the implementation of DOTS and programmatic second-line MDR-TB treatment. This is in line with the known rise in TB incidence that accompanied the economic breakdown in Russia during the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Institute of Medicine Forum on Drug Discovery, Development, and Translation and Russian Academy of Medical Science, 2011</xref>).</p><p>From a bacterial genetic point of view, our data show that particular MDR and pre-XDR clades are highly transmissible despite accumulation of multiple resistance mutations. The acquisition of compensatory mutations after introduction of low fitness cost resistance mutations (e.g. <italic>katG</italic> S315T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pym et al., 2002</xref>), <italic>rpoB</italic> S450L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gagneux et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>rpsL</italic> K43R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Böttger et al., 1998</xref>) seems the critical stage allowing for higher transmission rates. Multiple regression analyses further strengthened this hypothesis by demonstrating that the presence of fitness compensating variants was positively associated with transmission success in different settings and outbreak clades, independently of the accumulation of resistance mutations. Compensatory evolution thus appears to play a central role in driving large MDR-TB epidemics such as that seen with the Beijing CAO-clade.</p><p>A particular concern is the high prevalence of mutations conferring resistance to second-line drugs currently included in treatment regimens, among the dominant MDR-MTBC strains. Their detected emergence in a period preceding DOTS implementation, for example in Karakalpakstan, can be explained by past, largely empirical treatment decisions or self-medication. For instance, high frequencies of mutations in the <italic>ribD</italic> promoter region, and <italic>folC</italic> among Beijing-CAO isolates, associated with para-aminosalicylic acid resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), are a likely consequence of the use of para-aminosalicylic acid in failing treatment regimens in the late 1970s to the early 1980s in the Soviet Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">USSR Ministry of Health, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">USSR Ministry of Health, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mishin, 2008</xref>). Likewise, the frequent independent emergence of mutations in the <italic>eis</italic> promoter and of rare variants in the upstream region of <italic>whiB7</italic>, both linked to resistance to aminoglycosides (mainly streptomycin and kanamycin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zaunbrecher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reeves et al., 2013</xref>), probably reflects self-administration of kanamycin that was available in local pharmacies. Of note, prominent mutations such as <italic>katG</italic> S315T or <italic>rpoB</italic> S450L might have occurred multiple times independently in a bacterial population and inferring the common ancestor could lead to an overestimate of the TMRCA. However, this is not the case for rare and more diverse mutations, for example conferring resistance to pyrazinamide, PAS or kanamycin, thus further strengthening the historic fixation mentioned above.</p><p>The pre-existence of fully first-line resistant strain populations (e.g. CAO-Beijing in Karakalpakstan) likely contributed to the poor treatment outcomes observed among MDR-TB patients following the implementation of first-line DOTS treatment in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox et al., 2006</xref>). This period coincides with a detected CAO population size increase, likely reflecting the absence of drug susceptibility testing and therefore appropriate second-line treatment during extended hospitalization at the time, resulting in prolonged infectiousness of TB-patients and further spread of these strains.</p><p>The frequencies of fluoroquinolone resistance, mediated by <italic>gyrA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic> mutations, remained low among the Karakalpakstan MDR-MTBC isolates, which is consistent with the notion that such drugs were rarely used for treating TB in former Soviet Union countries (see Discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casali et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">USSR Ministry of Health, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">USSR Ministry of Health, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mishin, 2008</xref>). This observation explains the generally favorable MDR-TB treatment outcomes observed with the use of individualized second-line regimens, including a fluoroquinolone, in the latter MDR-TB treatment program in the Karakalpakstan patient population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lalor et al., 2011</xref>). However, fluoroquinolone resistance, representing the last step towards XDR-TB, is already emerging as reported for strains in Beijing clade A and B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casali et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the (pre-) existence and wide geographic dissemination of highly resistant and highly transmissible strain populations most likely contributes to increasing M/XDR-TB incidence rates despite scaling up of the MDR-TB programs in some Eastern European and Russian regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ulmasova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Institute of Medicine Forum on Drug Discovery, Development, and Translation and Russian Academy of Medical Science, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Medecins Sans Frontiere, 2013</xref>). Importantly, from the large spectrum of resistance detected among dominating strains in this study, it can be predicted that standardized therapies, including the newly WHO endorsed short MDR-TB regimen in Uzbekistan, are/will be largely ineffective for many patients in Samara and Karakalpakstan, and likely elsewhere in Eurasia. In order to successfully control the worldwide MDR-TB epidemics, universal access to rapid and comprehensive drug susceptibility testing, best supported by more advanced technologies, will be crucial for guiding individualized treatment with existing and new/repurposed TB drugs and to maximize chances of cure and prevention of further resistance acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study population, Karakalpakstan (Uzbekistan)</title><p>A total of 277 MDR-MTBC isolates derived from two separate cohorts were sequenced.

Obtained reads were mapped to the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv reference genome (GenBank ID: NC_000962.3) with BWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). Alignments were refined with GATK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>) and Samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2009</xref>) toolkits with regard to base quality re-calibration and alignment corrections for possible PCR artefact. We considered variants that were covered by a minimum of four reads in both forward and reverse orientation, four reads calling the allele with at least a phred score of 20, and 75% allele frequency. In the combined datasets, we allowed a maximum of 5% of all samples to fail the above-mentioned threshold criteria in individual genome positions to compensate for coverage fluctuations in certain genome regions; in these cases, the majority allele was considered. Regions annotated as ‘repetitive’ elements (e.g. PPE and PE-PGRS gene families), insertions and deletions (InDels), and consecutive variants in a 12 bp window (putative artefacts flanking InDels) were excluded. Additionally, 28 genes associated with drug resistance and bacterial fitness (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were excluded for a conservative and robust phylogenetic reconstructions. The remaining single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were considered as valid and used for concatenated SNP alignments. Further detailed methods of the phylogenetic reconstruction, molecular resistance prediction, strain-to-strain genetic distance, and Bayesian models are given as Appendix 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Transmission index</title><p>Based on the distance matrix (SNP distances), we further determined for every isolate the number of isolates that were in a range of 10 SNPs or less (in the following referred to as ‘transmission index’). This 10 SNP-threshold was used to infer the number of recently linked cases, as considered within a 10-year time period, based on previous convergent estimates of MTBC genome evolution rate of ≈ 0.5 SNPs/genome/year in inter-human transmission chains and in macaque infection models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ford et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roetzer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Walker et al., 2014</xref>). This can include direct transmission events among the study population but also cases which are connected by a more distant contact which was not sampled. In the latter case, we assumed that two isolates with a maximum distance of 10 SNPs share a hypothetical common ancestor that is 5 SNPs apart from the two sampled isolates (considering a bifurcating phylogeny) and thus covers a timeframe of 5 SNPs over 0.5 SNPs/year equals 10 years between the two actual samples and a shared recent ancestor node/case (see also Appendix 1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Genotypic drug resistance prediction</title><p>Mutations (small deletions and SNPs) in 34 resistance-associated target regions (comprising 28 genes) were considered for a molecular resistance prediction to 13 first- and second-line drugs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Mutations in genes coding for the RNA-Polymerase subunits <italic>rpoA</italic>, <italic>rpoB</italic> (excluding resistance mediating mutations in the rifampicin resistance determining region (RRDR), and in codons 170, 400, 491), and <italic>rpoC</italic> were reported as putative fitness compensating (e.g. in vitro growth enhancing) variants for rifampicin-resistant strains as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Comas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Vos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casali et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>). A detailed overview of all mutations considered as genotypic resistance markers is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Mutations that were not clearly linked to phenotypic drug resistance were reported as genotypic non wild type and were not considered as genotypic resistance markers. When no mutation (or synonymous, silent mutations) was detected in any of the defined drug relevant target regions the isolate was considered to be phenotypically susceptible.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Phylogenetic inference (maximum likelihood)</title><p>We used jModelTest v2.1 and Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion (AIC and BIC) to find an appropriate substitution model for phylogenetic reconstructions based on the concatenated sequence alignments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5">Appendix—table 5</xref>). Maximum likelihood trees were calculated with FastTree 2.1.9 (double precision for short branch lengths) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Price et al., 2010</xref>) using a general time reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model (best model according to AIC and second best model according to BIC), 1000 resamplings and Gamma20 likelihood optimization to account for evolutionary rate heterogeneity among sites. The consensus tree was rooted with the ‘midpoint root’ option in FigTree (resulting in the expected tree topology of lineage 2–4 strains) and nodes were arranged in increasing order. Variants considered as drug resistance markers (see above) and putative compensatory variants were analyzed individually and mapped on the phylogenetic tree to define resistance patterns of identified phylogenetic clades.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Molecular clock model</title><p>In order to compute a time scaled phylogeny and employ the Bayesian skyline model (see below) for the identified Central Asian outbreak (CAO) clade, we sought to define an appropriate molecular clock model (strict versus relaxed clock) and a mutation rate estimate. Due to the restricted sampling timeframe of the Karakalpakstan dataset (2001–2006), we extended the dataset for the model selection process with CAO isolates from Samara (2008–2010) and ‘historical’ CAO isolates from MDR-TB patients in Germany (1995–2000) thus allowing for a more confident mutation rate estimate. The strength of the temporal signal in the combined dataset, assessed by the correlation of sampling year and root-to-tip distance, was investigated with TempEst v1.5 (44). Regression analysis was based on residual mean squares, using a rooted ML tree (PhyML, GTR substitution model, 100 bootstraps), R-square and adjusted p-value are reported. For the comparison of different Bayesian phylogenetic models, we used path sampling with an alpha of 0.3, 50% burn-in and 15 million iterations (resulting in mean ESS values &gt; 100), marginal likelihood estimates were calculated with BEAST v2.4.2 (45), and Δ marginal L estimates are reported relative to the best model.</p><p>First, we employed a strict molecular clock fixed to 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup> substitutions per site per year as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ford et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roetzer et al., 2013</xref>) without tip dating, a strict molecular clock with tip dating and a relaxed molecular clock with tip dating. BEAST templates were created with BEAUti v2 applying a coalescent constant size demographic model, a GTR nucleotide substitution model, a chain length of 300 million (10% burn-in) and sampling of 5000 traces/trees.</p><p>Second, we ran different demographic models (i.e. coalescent constant size, exponential, and Bayesian skyline) under a relaxed molecular clock using tip dates and the same parameters for the site model and Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) as described above.</p><p>Third, we tested and compared the best models for the Karakalpakstan CAO-clade under a strict molecular clock prior including the upper and lower 95% HPD interval (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix—table 2</xref>).</p><p>Inspection of BEAST log files with Tracer v1.6 showed an adequate mixing of the Markov chains and all parameters were observed with an effective sample size (ESS) &gt;200 for the combined dataset (n = 220) and in the thousands for the Karakalpakstan CAO clade (n = 173), suggesting an adequate number of effectively independent draws from the posterior sample and thus sufficient statistical support. Other priors between the model comparisons were not changed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Bayesian skyline plot</title><p>Changes of the effective population size of the CAO clade in Karakalpakstan over the last four decades were calculated with a Bayesian skyline plot using BEAST v2.4.2 (45) using a tip date approach with a strict molecular clock model of 0.94 × 10<sup>−7</sup> substitutions per site per year (best model according to path sampling results, see above), and a GTR nucleotide substitution model. We further used a random starting tree, a chain length of 300 million (10% burn-in) and collected 5000 traces/trees. Again adequate mixing of the Markov chains and ESS values in the hundreds were observed. A maximum clade credibility genealogy was calculated with TreeAnnotator v2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Impact of resistance-conferring and compensatory mutations on transmission success</title><p>We used multiple linear regression to examine the respective contributions of antimicrobial resistance and putative fitness cost-compensating mutations to the transmission success of tuberculosis. To take transmission duration into account, we computed, for each isolate and each period length <italic>T</italic> in years (from 1 to 40y before sampling), a transmission success score defined as the number of isolates distant of less than <italic>T</italic> SNPs, divided by <italic>T</italic>. This approach relied on the following rationale: based on MTBC evolution rate of 0.5 mutation per genome per year, the relation between evolution time and SNP divergence is such that a cluster with at most <italic>N</italic> SNPs of difference is expected to have evolved for approximately <italic>N</italic> years. Thus, transmission success score over <italic>T</italic> years could be interpreted as the size of the transmission network divided by its evolution time, hence as the average yearly increase of the network size. For each period <italic>T</italic>, the transmission success score was regressed on the number of resistance mutations and on the presence of putative compensatory mutations. The regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals were computed and plotted against <italic>T</italic> to identify maxima, that is, time periods when the transmission success was maximally influenced by either resistance-conferring or –compensating mutations. These analyses were conducted independently on outbreak isolates of the Beijing-CAO clade in the Karakalpakstan cohort and of the Beijing-A clade in the Samara cohort.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Differences between cohorts and numbers of sampled isolates per year category were performed using Chi-squared analysis (mid-P exact) or Fisher’s exact test, while comparison of median age was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. p-Values for pairwise comparisons of groups regarding pairwise genetic distances, number of resistant DST results and number of resistance related mutations were calculated with an unpaired t-test (Welch correction) or a t-test according to the result of the variances comparison using a F-test.

isolate the number of isolates that were in a range of 10 SNPs or less (in the following referred to as ‘transmission index’, see figure below).</p><p>The rationale to implement a ‘transmission index’ was the need to link each isolate with a continuous parameter (for further analysis) which reflects the number of recently linked cases, that is the extend of a putative transmission network. These networks are better reflected with a minimum spanning tree (rather than bifurcating phylogenies) which allows the visualization of super spreaders for instance as central nodes (see figure below). Thus an isolate with a high transmission index might well be linked to a patient that infected multiple secondary cases. The benefit compared to a categorical parameter like ‘clustered’ and'not clustered’ is that the transmission index has the potential to indicate transmission hotspots within an outbreak scenario and is independent from a phylogenetic clade definition, which in turn would be difficult to assign due to the close genetic relationship in MTBC outbreaks and low bootstrap values for small sub-groups at the tips of a tree. The figure below illustrates the transmission index calculation per isolate. The upper left isolate for instance just has one sampled isolate within 10 SNP distance. A direct transmission event is relatively unlikely with that distance and both isolates rather share a common ancestor/linked case that was not sampled in the study period or study area. This common ancestor would be then in a four and five SNP distance, respectively that is translated to an infection event eight and ten years ago assuming an evolutionary rate of ≈ 0.5 SNPs/genome/year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ford et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roetzer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Walker et al., 2014</xref>). The central isolate has five other sampled isolates in proximity, which might indicate a super spreader patient and/or a particularly transmissible strain.</p></sec><sec id="s7-2"><title>Genotypic drug resistance prediction</title><p>Mutations (small deletions and SNPs) in 34 resistance associated target regions (comprising 28 genes) were considered for a molecular resistance prediction to 13 first- and second-line drugs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Mutations in genes coding for the RNA-Polymerase subunits <italic>rpoA</italic>, <italic>rpoB</italic> (excluding resistance mediating mutations), and <italic>rpoC</italic> were reported as putative fitness compensating (e.g. in vitro growth enhancing) variants for rifampicin resistant strains. A detailed overview of all mutations considered as genotypic resistance marker is given as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Mutations that were not clearly linked to phenotypic drug resistance were reported as genotypic non wild type and were not considered as genotypic resistance markers. When no mutation (or synonymous, silent mutations) was detected in any of the defined drug relevant target regions the isolate was considered to be phenotypically susceptible.</p></sec><sec id="s7-3"><title>Phylogenetic inference (maximum likelihood)</title><p>We used jModelTest v2.1 and Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion (AIC and BIC) to find an appropriate substitution model for phylogenetic reconstructions based on the concatenated sequence alignments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5">Appendix—table 5</xref>). Maximum likelihood trees were calculated with FastTree 2.1.9 (double precision for short branch lengths) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Price et al., 2010</xref>) using a general time reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model (best model according to AIC and second best model according to BIC), 1000 resamplings and Gamma20 likelihood optimization to account for evolutionary rate heterogeneity among sites. The consensus tree was rooted with the ‘midpoint root’ option in FigTree and nodes were arranged in increasing order. Variants considered as drug resistance marker (see above) and putative compensatory variants were analyzed individually and mapped on the phylogenetic tree to define resistance patterns of identified phylogenetic subgroups.</p></sec><sec id="s7-4"><title>Molecular clock model</title><p>In order to compute a time scaled phylogeny and employ the Bayesian skyline model (see below) for the identified Central Asian outbreak (CAO) clade we sought to define an appropriate molecular clock model (strict versus relaxed clock) and a mutation rate estimate. Due to the restricted sampling timeframe of the Karakalpakstan dataset (2001 – 2006) we extended the dataset for the model selection process with CAO strains from Samara (2008 – 2010) and ‘historical’ CAO strains isolated from MDR-TB patients in Germany (1995 – 2000) thus allowing for a more confident mutation rate estimate. The strength of the temporal signal in the combined dataset, assessed by the correlation of sampling year and root-to-tip distance, was investigated with TempEst v1.5 (44). Regression analysis was based on residual mean squares, using a rooted ML tree (PhyML, GTR substitution model, 100 bootstraps), R-square and adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value are reported. For the comparison of different Bayesian phylogenetic models we used path sampling with an alpha of 0.3, 50% burn-in and 15 million iterations (resulting in mean ESS values &gt; 100), marginal likelihood estimates were calculated with BEAST v2.4.2 (45), and Δ marginal L estimates are reported relative to the best model.</p><p>First, we employed a strict molecular clock fixed to 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup> substitutions per site per year as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ford et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roetzer et al., 2013</xref>) without tip dating, a strict molecular clock with tip dating and a relaxed molecular clock with tip dating. BEAST templates were created with BEAUti v2 applying a coalescent constant size demographic model, a GTR nucleotide substitution model, a chain length of 300 million (10% burn-in) and sampling of 5000 traces/trees.</p><p>Second, we ran different demographic models (i.e. coalescent constant size, exponential, and Bayesian skyline) under a relaxed molecular clock using tip dates and the same parameters for the site model and Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) as described above. Inspection of BEAST log files with Tracer v1.6 showed an adequate mixing of the Markov chains and all parameters were observed with an effective sample size (ESS) in the hundreds, suggesting an adequate number of effectively independent draws from the posterior sample and thus sufficient statistical support.</p></sec><sec id="s7-5"><title>Bayesian Skyline Plot</title><p>Changes of the effective population size of the CAO clade in Karakalpakstan over the last four decades were calculated with a Bayesian skyline plot using BEAST v2.4.2 (45) using a tip date approach with a strict molecular clock model of 0.94 × 10<sup>−7</sup> substitutions per site per year (best model according to path sampling results, see above), and a GTR nucleotide substitution model. We further used a random starting tree, a chain length of 300 million (10% burn-in) and collected 5000 traces/trees. Again adequate mixing of the Markov chains and ESS values in the hundreds were observed. A maximum clade credibility genealogy was calculated with TreeAnnotator v2.</p></sec><sec id="s7-6"><title>Impact of resistance-conferring and compensatory mutations on transmission success</title><p>We used multiple linear regression to examine the respective contributions of antimicrobial resistance and putative fitness cost-compensating mutations to the transmission success of tuberculosis. To take transmission duration into account, we computed, for each isolate and each period length <italic>T</italic> in years (from 1 to 40y before sampling), a transmission success score defined as the number of isolates distant of less than <italic>T</italic> SNPs, divided by <italic>T</italic>. This approach relied on the following rationale: based on MTBC evolution rate of 0.5 mutation per genome per year, the relation between evolution time and SNP divergence is such that a cluster with at most <italic>N</italic> SNPs of difference is expected to have evolved for approximately <italic>N</italic> years. Thus, transmission success score over <italic>T</italic> years could be interpreted as the size of the transmission network divided by its evolution time, hence as the average yearly increase of the network size.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Merker et al. presents a detailed analysis of circulating MDR/pre-XDR/XDR strains in a region of Uzbekistan. By expanding the analyses to a previously reported dataset from Samara (Russia) the authors generalize the conclusions to &quot;central Asia&quot;. The authors found high transmission of MDR/XDR strains and that high transmission is linked to compensatory mutations. The authors also show that population sizes of the main clade changed over time in parallel to important changes on TB control policies or political/historical events. One major conclusion is that the newly endorsed WHO regimen for MDR-TB will have very limited impact on the region given that strains circulating there are already resistant to many of the relevant antibiotics.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is very well written and the phylodynamic approach to addressing these pertinent questions is timely in terms of both its methodology and its conclusions. We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Bayesian model selection</p><p>The use of Path Sampling to correctly identify the model is commendable. However, while the model used was a strict clock with a Bayesian skyline, this model was never tested. Thus, the substitution rate selected for the analyses was also not from the best model; it was part of the relaxed lognormal clock with the Bayesian skyline demographic. This may lead to mutation rate differences as outlined below. Related to this, the ESS for each model comparison is quite low. Generally, BEAST analyses should aim for an ESS &gt; 200. For such an important foundation of the paper, the authors should test the utilised model and ensure there is sufficient sampling for higher ESS values.</p><p>It is also not stated if the authors ran the finally selected model (strict + skyline) under the prior for comparison to their posterior runs. This should be undertaken to ensure the model is not driving the output, especially in the face of a moderate time signal.</p><p>2) Mutation rate</p><p>Stemming from the above point, the estimates of the mutation rate seem odd compared to previous estimates. While the overall dating analysis is robust and root-to-tip distance is significant, it looks rather modest in terms of R<sup>2</sup>. This value indicates a weak clock-like structure and should be noted in the manuscript (e.g. see Discussion and Figure 1 in Duchêne et al. 2016). This weak signal is rightly expected for MTB though, and consequently a mutation rate with broad HPDs is inferred in the Bayesian analyses. This uncertainty surrounding the mutation rate is unfortunately ignored for subsequent analyses due to the strict clock selection. Authors should comment on how this uncertainty is accounted for and why their rate is so much faster than previous estimates, which tend to be closer to 10-8.</p><p>3) Phylogenetics and SNP alignment</p><p>The higher mutation rate above may be a result of the way the alignment was input for the phylogenetics. It is unclear if authors used SNP alignments or reconstituted whole genome alignments. If the former, the SNP alignments should be corrected for invariant site counts in their ML tree (e.g. by the Stamatakis ascertainment bias correction method) and in the BEAST analyses (e.g. using the constant sites parameter). If not, the branch lengths will likely be incorrect, potentially leading to incorrect date estimates as outlined by Leaché et al. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604835/). This would also lead to much higher mutation rates compared to whole genome estimates. Authors should redo the analyses with these corrections to ensure their time estimates are correct.</p><p>In line with this, while unlikely to be significant, the removal of 28 complete genes from the data is a bit odd and may affect the mutation rate. What of non-DR causing mutations in these genes? Certain genes, such as gyrA contain lineage defining SNPs and would skew SNP distances between isolates if removed (affecting transmission clusters as discussed below). Authors should comment on why this approach was chosen.</p><p>4) Transmission clusters</p><p>The rationale for the transmission success score and transmission index is not clear. With a SNP rate of 0.5/year we would expect that N SNPs would have evolved over N/0.5 years and therefore a 10 SNP threshold indicates a timeline of 20 years. Please clarify the rationale or where necessary adjust the calculations and figures accordingly for transmission. Additionally, in a setting like this where most of the strains are clustered, it would be of benefit to test if the different transmission clusters are monophyletic, so distance and phylogeny converge to the same delineated clusters.</p><p>Authors should also outline how a transmission cluster was defined (i.e. how did transmission indices group together to form delineated clusters). This is important as in the subsection “Impact of compensatory variants on transmission networks”, the authors identify an association between CAO + compensatory with higher number of DR mutations. This is not identified in non-CAO strains even with compensatory mechanisms. This may be because the numbers for CAO strains is &quot;inflated&quot; by including strains from the same transmission cluster.</p><p>5) Statistics</p><p>The use of statistics throughout the manuscript is very appreciated. However, the authors should justify the use of the t-test when it is unlikely that the underlying data is normally distributed. Authors should either test for normality or apply a Mann-Whitney test instead.</p><p>Also, while the CAO higher transmission potential and link to higher numbers of resistant mutations/phenotypes is very clear, the way it is calculated may not be correct. Do the authors take into account every strain in the dataset irrespective to whether they belong to the same cluster of transmission? Clustering may inflate the number of strains with resistance and thus the clades with higher transmission will be more likely to have more resistances. It may be better to choose from each transmission cluster one strain representative of each resistant profile and then re-run the analyses with those cluster representatives plus the unique cases.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Compensatory evolution drives multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Central Asia&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>While the authors response to reviewer point (4) Transmission clusters clarifies the 10-year timeline based on 0.5 SNPs/year this was not incorporated into the manuscript in the same way. It appears that the key assumption is that the study isolates are not the result of direct transmission and the minimum pairwise SNP difference is from a common ancestor of any two isolates. Including this assumption and indicating this distance is from a common ancestor and therefore the calculation is 0.5 SNPs/yr x 2 genomes would make it easier for readers to follow the calculation of the transmission index.</p><p>Similarly, the &quot;transmission index&quot; is also a little bit confusing as they do it per strain, not clade, and thus by using pairwise distances this means that the same case can contribute to the transmission index of several strains what seems at least weird. I may have been missing something, also the new sketch is not clear about whether they use the threshold per strain or per cluster although text suggests per strain.</p><p>The number and size of CAO clusters is not reported in the manuscript which would be helpful to understand how inflated some statistics may be due to a particular strain. These could be included in the appendix or where key statistics related to CAO strains are reported indicate how much is due to a specific number of clusters. For example, in the subsection “Impact of compensatory variants on transmission networks”, 56% of CAO-isolates had <italic>rpoC</italic> variants. Is this due to a single large transmission cluster over-representing <italic>rpoC</italic> mutations? Or a number of different strains?</p><p>A citation of Duchêne 2016 to support the proposed moderate temporal signal would be appreciated.</p><p>The first sentence of the subsection “MTBC population structure and transmission rates” differentiates between variants and polymorphisms; however, throughout the remainder of the manuscript it appears these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Please clarify if there is indeed a difference and adjust terminology if necessary for consistency.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38200.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Bayesian model selection</p><p>The use of Path Sampling to correctly identify the model is commendable.

The mean node ages of the most recent common ancestor of the CAO-clade from Karakalpakstan and one major split (acquisition of <italic>rpoC</italic> N698S mutation, described in the main text) are mentioned in an amended Appendix—Table 2. The mean age of the MRCA was in the range of 1966-1982 with 1974 reported in the main text. Also the subclade <italic>rpoC</italic> N698S mean node age differed marginally between 1987-1994 with 1990 reported in the main text.</p><p>The mentioned ESS values were derived from the path sampling approach. We now mention the mean ESS of all parameters from the respective Beast run. All model comparisons were further run with the same priors. To clarify these points we amended Appendix—Table 2 and the Materials and methods section as follows:</p><p>“Third we tested and compared the best models for the Karakalpakstan CAO-clade under a strict molecular clock prior including the upper and lower 95% HPD interval (Appendix—Table 2).</p><p>Inspection of BEAST log files with Tracer v1.6 showed an adequate mixing of the Markov chains and all parameters were observed with an effective sample size (ESS) &gt;200 for the combined dataset (n=220) and in the thousands for the Karakalpakstan CAO clade (n=173), suggesting an adequate number of effectively independent draws from the posterior sample and thus sufficient statistical support. Other priors between the model comparisons were not changed.”</p><p>Further sentences were added to describe the new results in Appendix—Table 2:</p><p>“Comparing different demographic models for the CAO-Karakalpakstan dataset (n=173) an exponential growth model and a Bayesian skyline model were superior over the constant size demographic prior.”</p><p>“To further account for uncertainties of substitution rates and thus fixation of drug resistance within the CAO-clade we ran the best models (Bayesian skyline and exponential growth) with the upper and lower HPD interval of the best clock estimate (see above). Similarly, the most recent fixation of the putative compensatory mutation <italic>rpoC</italic> N698S was 1994 (95% HPD 1992-1996), still years before implementation of the systematic DOTS-program in Karakalpakstan in 1998.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Mutation rate</p><p>Stemming from the above point, the estimates of the mutation rate seem odd compared to previous estimates.

This uncertainty surrounding the mutation rate is unfortunately ignored for subsequent analyses due to the strict clock selection. Authors should comment on how this uncertainty is accounted for and why their rate is so much faster than previous estimates, which tend to be closer to 10-8.</p></disp-quote><p>We are referring to a short-term mutation rate of 10-7 which has been confirmed several times for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> outbreak scenarios (Eldholm et al., PNAS 2017, Cohen et al., 2015, Walker et al., 2013, Ford et al., Natgen 2013, Merker et al., 2015, Roetzer et al., 2013) and experimental models (Fortune et al., Natgen 2011). In the above mentioned paper by Duchêne et al. the values for lineage 2 and lineage 4 MTB strains also rather span 10-7, with a slightly higher rate for lineage 2. Slower rates are reported for ancient DNA samples or other dating approaches for instance from Comas et al., Natgen 2013 aiming to infer the evolutionary history of MTB strains. Our short-term rate is in line with other reports (see Figure 5 as overview in Eldholm et al., PNAS 2016) and we confirmed this rate with the extended CAO dataset covering a larger sampling interval and partially overcome the mentioned weak molecular clock signal. We state that this is indeed a ‘moderate’ signal, however the mentioned paper by Duchêne et al., 2016 also concludes that: “Importantly, however, even though they [i.e. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> substitution rates] were relatively low, these rates were sufficiently rapid to be accurately estimated using genomic-scale data.”</p><p>Furthermore, the main issue here is not to wonder if <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is a measurably evolving population or not. Simply, the rather narrow time-window of the outbreak limits the power of detection of this signal. This can be easily observed as a general process. When one does plot the regressions of the root-to-tip genetic distance against the sampling time intervals for 36 whole genome data sets from Duchêne et al., 2016 (removing the deviant ancient DNA containing data-sets), there is a highly significant positive correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.25). This highlights the fact that the chances and power to detect a molecular clock decrease with narrower sampling dates, but does not imply that there is no MEP signature.</p><p>With regard to the overall manuscript length we prefer not to elaborate more on this point further. As mentioned in the response to point 1 we included further results to take uncertainties of substitution rates more into account with respect to node ages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Phylogenetics and SNP alignment</p><p>The higher mutation rate above may be a result of the way the alignment was input for the phylogenetics. It is unclear if authors used SNP alignments or reconstituted whole genome alignments. If the former, the SNP alignments should be corrected for invariant site counts in their ML tree (e.g. by the Stamatakis ascertainment bias correction method) and in the BEAST analyses (e.g. using the constant sites parameter). If not, the branch lengths will likely be incorrect, potentially leading to incorrect date estimates as outlined by Leaché et al. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604835/). This would also lead to much higher mutation rates compared to whole genome estimates. Authors should redo the analyses with these corrections to ensure their time estimates are correct.</p><p>In line with this, while unlikely to be significant, the removal of 28 complete genes from the data is a bit odd and may affect the mutation rate. What of non-DR causing mutations in these genes? Certain genes, such as gyrA contain lineage defining SNPs and would skew SNP distances between isolates if removed (affecting transmission clusters as discussed below). Authors should comment on why this approach was chosen.</p></disp-quote><p>The correction methods suggested above are indeed important, particularly when a large fraction of the SNPs are not considered, if the sampling is not representative and the taxa rather divergent. Yet this is not the case here. Furthermore, the implementation of such extra-analyses will probably only affect marginally our results and the corrected parameters would stay within our HPD intervals.</p><p>We used a SNP alignment and similar exclusion criteria (e.g. PPE/PGRS genes) as previous manuscripts utilizing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> dating approaches, e.g. Eldholm et al., PNAS 2017, Cohen et al., 2015, Walker et al., 2013, or Ford et al., Natgen 2013. The reported mutation rates are all covering 10-7 substitutions per site per year or translated into an outbreak scenario 0.3-0.5 mutations per genome per year. Thus we’re confident that our variant calling and the derived alignment is robust and results in well supported branch lengths and node ages.</p><p>The exclusion of entire drug resistance genes removed 85 phylogenetic informative sites, plus 537 positions (including InDels) that were used for resistance prediction purposes and might have further influenced the tree topology. In order to have the most robust phylogeny not affected by unknown resistance marker under positive selection, we therefore chose to remove all positions within these genes. To clarify this part, we modified the section as follows:</p><p>“We considered variants that were covered by a minimum of 4 reads in both forward and reverse orientation, 4 reads calling the allele with at least a phred score of 20, and 75% allele frequency. […] The remaining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were considered as valid and used for concatenated SNP alignments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Transmission clusters</p><p>The rationale for the transmission success score and transmission index is not clear. With a SNP rate of 0.5/year we would expect that N SNPs would have evolved over N/0.5 years and therefore a 10 SNP threshold indicates a timeline of 20 years. Please clarify the rationale or where necessary adjust the calculations and figures accordingly for transmission. Additionally, in a setting like this where most of the strains are clustered, it would be of benefit to test if the different transmission clusters are monophyletic, so distance and phylogeny converge to the same delineated clusters.</p><p>Authors should also outline how a transmission cluster was defined (i.e. how did transmission indices group together to form delineated clusters). This is important as in the subsection “Impact of compensatory variants on transmission networks”, the authors identify an association between CAO + compensatory with higher number of DR mutations. This is not identified in non-CAO strains even with compensatory mechanisms. This may be because the numbers for CAO strains is &quot;inflated&quot; by including strains from the same transmission cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>We rather consider the “transmission index” as a gradual measurement of the relatedness of patient isolates in a setting as a proxy or surrogate marker for their recent transmission success. Samples within a defined distance, likely are secondary cases which have been infected within the same network some time ago. It’s not strictly a monophyletic cluster/clade, but the higher the mean “transmission index” values are within a defined clade for instance, the lower the genetic diversity, and the more recent transmission events likely have occurred.</p><p>We chose 10 SNPs as maximum pairwise distance which would translate in a recent common ancestor node age of 10 years (assuming 5 individual SNPs per isolate differentiating from their progenitor strain). Thus, this would cover the extent of transmission events that occurred within the last 10 years.</p><p>To clarify this term further, we added a sketch to the Appendix 1 (extended Materials and methods section) and one sentence to the main Materials and methods section as follows:</p><p>“The transmission index was implemented as a proxy for the recent transmission success of defined clades, i.e. the higher the mean transmission index of a clade, the more transmission events have occurred in the past.”</p><p>By its nature the measurement is indeed linked with the number of strains. As mentioned by the reviewer, the resolution of phylogenetic trees, respectively the number of well supported branches declines towards the tips of such outbreaks. To set cut-offs here with regard to genetic distances would also lead to an arbitrary cluster definition. Thus we, decided in favour for this gradual measurement to count the number of phylogenetically related strains without considering the topology at the tips but highlighting hotspots of very low diversity in the outbreak itself. In addition this allowed us to implement a parameter linked to cluster size/low genetic diversity/transmission success for further calculations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Statistics</p><p>The use of statistics throughout the manuscript is very appreciated. However, the authors should justify the use of the t-test when it is unlikely that the underlying data is normally distributed. Authors should either test for normality or apply a Mann-Whitney test instead.</p><p>Also, while the CAO higher transmission potential and link to higher numbers of resistant mutations/phenotypes is very clear, the way it is calculated may not be correct. Do the authors take into account every strain in the dataset irrespective to whether they belong to the same cluster of transmission? Clustering may inflate the number of strains with resistance and thus the clades with higher transmission will be more likely to have more resistances. It may be better to choose from each transmission cluster one strain representative of each resistant profile and then re-run the analyses with those cluster representatives plus the unique cases.</p></disp-quote><p>For the first point, in all comparisons where statistics were used, we compared larger sample sizes (n&gt;40) so the violation of a normal distribution should not cause major problems. In Figure 3 the data almost follow normal distributions (perfect normal distributions do not exist).</p><p>For the second point, these are real data, and in an epidemic settings, indeed MDR strains spread faster and therefore generate higher transmission indices. We understand the kind of tautological concern raised by the reviewer. However, applying the strategy he mentioned would probably be misleading. To provide a proxy it is like evaluating the demographic change of a suite of let’s say 20 successful (expanding) populations by only considering one strain per population. This new Bayesian tree analysis with 20 strains would unlikely detect an expansion.</p><p>We would also like to enhance that the statistics were done by pooling multiple clusters, an approach that should minimize local deviations.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>While the authors response to reviewer point (4) Transmission clusters clarifies the 10-year timeline based on 0.5 SNPs/year this was not incorporated into the manuscript in the same way.

To improve the understanding for this parameter with regard to the timing and pairwise distances we added the following lines in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“This can include direct transmission events among the study population but also cases which are connected by a more distant contact which was not sampled. In the latter case we assumed that two isolates with a maximum distance of 10 SNPs share a hypothetical common ancestor that is 5 SNPs apart from the two sampled isolates (considering a bifurcating phylogeny) and thus covers a timeframe of 5 SNPs over 0.5 SNPs/year equals 10 years between the two actual samples and a shared recent ancestor node/case (see also Appendix 1).”</p><p>In addition we extended the Appendix section with further explanations on the rationale to use the strain specific “transmission index” instead of a clade dependant cluster definition:</p><p>“In the context of this manuscript, we determined for every isolate the number of isolates that were in a range of 10 SNPs or less (in the following referred to as “transmission index”, see figure below). […] The central isolate has 5 other sampled isolates in proximity, which might indicate a super spreader patient and/or a particularly transmissible strain.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The number and size of CAO clusters is not reported in the manuscript which would be helpful to understand how inflated some statistics may be due to a particular strain.

For example, in the subsection “Impact of compensatory variants on transmission networks”, 56% of CAO-isolates had rpoC variants. Is this due to a single large transmission cluster over-representing rpoC mutations? Or a number of different strains?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above in the new text passages, we did not define strict clusters within the outbreak but a gradual measurement (i.e. transmission index) per isolate that indicates in which parts of the outbreak topology the majority of transmission events might have occurred over the last 10 years. With regard to putative compensatory mutations, the two variants <italic>rpoC</italic> N698S (n=79) and <italic>rpoB</italic> I488V (n=18) deeply rooted in the CAO phylogeny (see Figure 2), accounted for a large proportion of the CAO cases with putative compensation (n=124). A possible causative link between <italic>rpoC</italic> N698S with transmission success is then discussed in the manuscript.
