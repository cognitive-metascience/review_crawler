clinical problem, exacerbated by insufficient development of new antibiotics. Drug efflux pumps play important roles in intrinsic or acquired drug resistance to a wide variety of currently available antimicrobial agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pu et al., 2016</xref>). In Gram-negative bacteria, some of these pumps form multi-protein assemblies that span the cell envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du et al., 2015a</xref>). The components of these assemblies include an outer membrane protein, a plasma membrane-spanning protein and a periplasmic protein that connects the two trans-membrane components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Du et al., 2015b</xref>). AcrAB-TolC is a RND-based tripartite efflux pump, comprised of the outer membrane protein TolC, the periplasmic membrane fusion protein AcrA, and the inner membrane transporter AcrB, which cycles through three different conformational states during the drug transport process: access (L), binding (T) and extrusion (O) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du et al., 2015a</xref>). A small peptide, AcrZ, has been identified that modifies the activity of AcrB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hobbs et al., 2012</xref>). Previous electron microscopy studies of the AcrAB-TolC pump have revealed the overall shape of the pump and the relative arrangement of its components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daury et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeong et al., 2016</xref>). Due to the limited resolution, these studies were unable to identify the detailed interaction interfaces between the components. Moreover, the mechanism of pump assembly and channel opening is presently unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Müller and Pos, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zgurskaya et al., 2015</xref>) and requires detailed structural information of the pump in the different conformational states that accompany drug translocation. In this study, we report the near-atomic resolution cryoEM structures of the AcrAB-TolC pump captured in both resting and drug transport states. The data reveal the detailed tertiary and quaternary structural changes associated with the transition from apo to ligand-bound states. The quality of the cryoEM maps enable unambiguous modeling of all components and identification of the conformational asymmetry in AcrB in the presence of antibiotic that underpins the molecular mechanism of drug translocation. Our study provides a structural framework for understanding the mechanism underlying drug efflux.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CryoEM structure determination</title><p>Preparation of the intact AcrAB-TolC for structural studies has been a challenge. Previously, the fully-assembled pump was stabilized by tandem fusion and cross-linking of its components using the ‘GraFix’ method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2014</xref>). The fusion was co-expressed with AcrZ, a hydrophobic helical peptide that affects AcrB efflux activity for a subset of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hobbs et al., 2012</xref>) and interacts with AcrB in the transmembrane portion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2014</xref>). To pursue a higher resolution structure, we improved the purification procedure. The ratio of detergent to total membrane protein was optimized to extract AcrAB-TolC from the cellular membrane, and the detergent was exchanged with amphipol A8-35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Popot, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tribet et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zoonens and Popot, 2014</xref>). Ligands were used in an effort to favor conformational uniformity and/or to capture structures corresponding to different ligand transport states. The purified pump was imaged in the presence of pyranopyridine inhibitor MBX3132 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sjuts et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) or substrate puromycin, as described in Materials and methods.</p><p>We also have developed a new procedure to stabilize the full pump using disulphide-linkages that were chosen from the proximity of residues S273 in the β-barrel domain of AcrA and S258 in the β-hairpin motif of the DN subdomain of AcrB seen in the cryo-EM structure of the full pump. We introduced single cysteine-substitutions in the individual AcrA and AcrB components (AcrA-S273C and AcrB-S258C) without flexible engineered linkers. Consistent with the model based on the fusion constructs, we observed disulfide bond formation between the two free components. Moreover, the disulfide bond-stabilized AcrAB can recruit TolC (and three additional AcrAs, which are not expected to be cysteine-crosslinked) to form a stable tripartite complex in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This complex was prepared without co-expression of AcrZ. The full pump assembly, stabilized through the disulfide-bond linked AcrAB, was imaged in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2, B and C</xref>).</p><p>The cryo-EM structures of the apo pump and the pump/ligand complexes reveal different conformational states of the full pump. These structures have been solved at different subnanometer and near atomic resolutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The maps of the full pump at 3.6 Å resolution can be readily segmented into a TolC trimer, a periplasmic AcrA hexamer, and an AcrB trimer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). The corresponding domains and subdomains of the four protein components derived from the cryoEM maps are delineated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>.

The periplasmic component of the pump, AcrA, forms a hexamer through the trimerization of two conformationally distinct protomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We refer to the two distinct subunits as ‘protomer-I’ and ‘protomer-II’. In both AcrA protomers, a short helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif interacts in a tip-to-tip manner with the HTH motif of the TolC coiled-coils at their periplasmic ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel). Because each subunit of TolC has an internal structural repeat, the trimer has 6 HTH motifs, which interact with the 6 HTH motifs of the AcrA hexamer in a quasi-equivalent manner: AcrA protomer-I and the adjacent protomer-II interdigitate with the intra- and inter-protomer grooves of TolC, respectively. The two distinct conformations of the HTH motif loops of AcrA protomers I and II structurally conform to the slightly different contact surfaces of TolC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel). This interaction is consistent with functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Song et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2010</xref>) and structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daury et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), but differs in detail from that proposed for the open state of the pump reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeong et al., 2016</xref>), as we will describe further below. A gap is present at the interfaces between adjacent AcrA dimer pairs, so that the AcrA helical hairpin, lipoyl and β-barrel domains do not pack tightly to seal the channel from the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). This gap must be closed in the transport process to prevent leakage of substrates into the periplasm. AcrB adopts a symmetric state (LLL) in the pump assembly, as seen in the crystal structure of apo AcrB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murakami et al., 2002</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24905.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The structure of disulfide-bond stabilized AcrAB-TolC pump with closed channel at 6.5 Å resolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CryoEM map of the pump with closed-state TolC, visualized in side view along the membrane plane (left).

The 3D map for the pump/MBX3132 complex was initially generated without any imposed symmetry and exhibited an apparent 3-fold symmetric pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, refinements were performed with 3-fold symmetry, which produced the final 3D reconstruction at ~3.6 Å resolution. This dataset was further subjected to focused 3D classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2015</xref>) of a targeted region of AcrB to reveal its structural variations in response to the presence of the inhibitor. We found that 73% of the particles within the dataset have their three AcrB subunits in the same (TTT) conformation (Materials and method and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). Subsets of particles show AcrB conformations in LLL (1.4%), LLT (6.2%) and LTT (18.6%) states, respectively, while none of the subunits was identified in an ‘O’ state. Therefore, this inhibitor-bound pump conformation primarily represents a T-saturated state of the AcrB. The C3 symmetry imposed reconstruction using the subset of particles with TTT state (24,597 particles) also achieved 3.6 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>).

Our cryoEM structure shows the presence of residue pairs at the interface between AcrA and TolC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) that were predicted to have co-evolved in the homologous proteins in a different efflux pump MdtNOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harley and Saier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ovchinnikov et al., 2014</xref>). 3D classification identified a small subset of particles, in which TolC rotates by 60 degrees with respect to AcrA, but the alternative interface still retains the key contacts described above. As observed in the apo state, there are two distinct conformations of the HTH motif loops of AcrA protomers I and II that structurally conform to the slightly different contact surfaces of TolC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The flexibility of the HTH is consistent with observations from crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mikolosko et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the six protomers of AcrA, the lipoyl and β-barrel domains form a stack of two continuous rings. The lipoyl domains have no interaction with either AcrB or TolC, and the β-barrel domains contact only the docking domain of AcrB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The membrane-proximal (MP) domain of AcrA interacts with both the docking domain and the top of the pore domain of AcrB. Each AcrB protomer makes two non-equivalent interactions with AcrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ntreh et al., 2016</xref>); <italic>i.e.</italic> each pair of AcrA protomers makes two conformationally distinct interfaces with AcrB, as was found with the interaction between AcrA and TolC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). AcrA protomer-I makes extensive interactions with AcrB. The β-barrel domain of AcrA protomer-I docks on the DN and DC subdomains of AcrB, while its MP domain interacts with the PC1 subdomain, the linker region between PC2 and DC, and an extended loop of the DN subdomain from an adjacent AcrB protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>). The spatial orientation of a β-hairpin motif, in the DN subdomain of AcrB, differs between the cryoEM and crystal structures. This conformational difference facilitates the interactions between AcrB and the β-barrel domain of AcrA protomer-II and a short α-helix of the DC subdomain from the adjacent AcrB protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and D</xref>). This contact resembles the interactions observed between the metal transporter subunits CusB and CusA, which are homologs of AcrA and AcrB, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Su et al., 2011</xref>).

The quasi six-fold symmetry of the interface between AcrA helical hairpin and open-state TolC reduces to three-fold symmetry in the apo-form. The rearrangements of AcrA repack the β-barrel and membrane proximal domains in a different orientation on the surface of the AcrB and seal the gaps to the periplasm. Conformational changes in the periplasmic headpiece of AcrB instigate repacking of all four of the AcrA domains, and this causes the reorganization of the coiled-coiled domain of AcrA, which is the key step to organize the HTH motifs and open the TolC channel. Thus, the pump is a highly allosteric system in which conformational changes associated with ligand binding by the apo state of AcrB are communicated over a long distance to TolC through the repacking of protein-protein interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer and Kandt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zgurskaya and Nikaido, 1999</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24905.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Comparison of AcrA-TolC interactions in puromycin-bound and apo state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of AcrAB-TolC/puromycin pump visualized in side view.

We propose that the apo-form of the pump with a closed TolC represents a resting state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), while the pump assemblies with opened TolC in the presence of transportable ligands represent transport states, in which the AcrB trimer adopts asymmetric LLT, LTT or LTO conformations. The three pump components undergo significant conformational changes when the assembly switches from the resting-state to the transport-states. In the transport-states, ligand binding is associated with large conformational changes in AcrB for both PN1/PC2 and PN2/PC1 structural modules that form the drug-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eicher et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the interfaces between TolC and AcrA, and between AcrA and AcrB do not change significantly in the different transport states (LTO, LTT, LLT). We propose that ligand binding in the apo state instigates quaternary structural changes in AcrB that are communicated to AcrA, which in turn repacks to trigger tertiary structural changes in TolC that open the channel from a sealed resting state. The repacking to AcrA is critical to seal the gaps in the pump, which would otherwise allow substrate to leak into the periplasm. Thus, the long-distance allosteric coupling between AcrB and TolC, mediated through AcrA, ensures that TolC channel opening is synchronized with closing the assembly to the periplasm. When substrate is absent, the pump assembly returns to its resting state. The above conformational changes are accompanied by a contraction of the pump along the long axis in its transport state by nearly 10 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We anticipate that the transition from the resting state to the transport states will entail a local compression of the periplasm to accommodate the axial contraction of the pump, and local curvature of the outer membrane and inner membrane near the portal of AcrB. These changes may have impact on the energetics and kinetics of the transport process.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24905.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic cartoon of the transport mechanism.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The resting state of the apo pump with TolC in closed-state and the AcrB trimer in LLL conformation.

Cycling is obligatory for unidirectional transport, driven by coupling with transmembrane proton conduction through the TM domain (red arrow).

Efflux pump inhibitors could be used as adjunct therapies to increase the potency of existing antibiotics and counter the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria. Efforts have been focused on the development of inhibitors for the transporter components. Due to the capacity of the transporters to recognize a broad range of substrates, such compounds are particularly difficult to identify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Opperman and Nguyen, 2015</xref>). In the presence of inhibitor MBX3132, the AcrB trimer is predominantly trapped in the symmetric TTT conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), possibly because the inhibitor has high affinity to AcrB and cannot be transported. Thus, the cryoEM structure suggests that inhibitors like MBX3132 could effectively inhibit AcrAB-TolC efflux through saturated binding and blocking all sites and prevent AcrB from cycling through different states. It may be possible to block drug translocation by targeting the assembly or conformational switching of the tripartite pumps themselves. In this regard, the interaction interfaces between components, which are well resolved in our cryoEM structure, may be important drug-targeting sites to inhibit the assembly of this and other tripartite pumps.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of vectors for overexpression of disulfide-bond stabilized AcrAB–TolC complex</title><p>The cysteine-substitutions were introduced for residues AcrA_S273 and AcrB_S258 into the individual components by site-directed mutagenesis using plasmid pAcBH as a template and primers AcrA<sub>S273C</sub>_F: 5’- GAT CAG ACC ACT GGG TGT ATC ACC CTA CGC GCT ATC ttc-3’/AcrA<sub>S273C</sub>_R: 5’-GAA GAT AGC GCG TAG GGT GAT ACA CCC AGT GGT CTG ATC-3’, AcrB<sub>S258C</sub>_F: 5’-GTG AAT CAG GAT GGT TGT CGC GTG CTG CTG CGT GAC-3’ /AcrB<sub>S258C</sub>_R: 5’-GTC ACG CAG CAG CAC GCG ACA ACC ATC CTG ATT CAC-3’, resulting in the construct pAcBH-<italic>AcrA<sub>S273C</sub>AcrB<sub>S258C</sub></italic>.

The templates were lowpass filtered to 20 Å to limit model bias. Then initial runs of 2D and 3D classifications were used to remove the heterogeneous particles, as well as the false positive particles from the auto-picking. We selected good particles for further analysis based on the quality and high resolution in the 2D and 3D classification.</p><p>For the AcrABZ-TolC/MBX3132 pump, 65,256 particles were picked automatically from a total of 1150 micrographs. After initial 2D and 3D classifications, a homogenous subset of 33,587 particles was selected for a first 3D auto-refinement, generating a reconstruction with a resolution of 6.67 Å. After per-particle motion correction and radiation-damage weighting, the polished particles were submitted to a second round of 3D auto-refinement by applying a soft mask around the TolC, AcrA and the periplasmic headpiece of AcrB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scheres, 2016</xref>). These polished particles gave a reconstruction with a resolution of 3.6 Å based on the Gold-standard FSC 0.143. In the case of apo AcrAB-TolC pump, 95,410 particles were picked automatically from a total of 2292 micrographs. After initial 2D classification and two rounds of 3D classifications, 13,544 homogeneous particles were selected for 3D auto-refinement, which generated a map with a resolution of 6.5 Å based on the Gold-standard FSC 0.143. 3D classification also identified a small subset of particles, in which TolC is rotated by 60 degrees with respect to AcrA.</p><p>All 3D classifications and refinements were started from a 50–60 Å low-pass filtered initial model, the first of which was made from our previous 16 Å resolution map. The density map was sharpened by applying a negative B-factor estimated by automated procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</xref>). Local resolution variations were estimated using ResMap and visualized with Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Symmetry release and focused classification</title><p>The density map generated from RELION was used to assess the structural asymmetry of the pump by performing focused classification. A soft mask of the targeted region of this map was generated using <italic>relion_mask_create</italic> with a soft edge extension of 5 pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We used this masked volume to set to zero the density of the targeted region from the 3D map of the whole pump, and generated a modified map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This altered density map was rotated by 120 and 240 degrees about the molecular three-fold axis. The three resulting 3D density maps represent the entire pump with the deletion of each of the three-targeted regions (i.e. each of the three subunits of AcrB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, each of these three altered density maps was projected in 2D in the corresponding orientations of each of the raw particle images and subtracted from the original image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Altogether, the particle images (33,337 for the pump with MBX3132 and 67,436 for the pump in presence of puromycin) used in the final reconstruction generated three times that many subtracted particle images. Each of the three subtracted projections from an individual particle image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) was assigned appropriate Euler angles so that they are all in the same orientation in the 3D map to permit 3D classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The soft mask generated in the beginning of this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) was used for the 3D classifications to remove density outside the mask. We ran rounds of 3D classifications using the particle alignment parameters of the symmetry-imposed map of the pump. Each round was iterated 25 times and classified into several subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Focused classification of pump with MBX3132 result in two populations different in the binding site of MBX3132 according to crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Subsets of original and unmodified particle images with different putative ligand binding sites were selected for 3D refinement with no imposed symmetry. We carried out the similar approach on the data of the pump in presence of puromycin. After 3 rounds of 3D classification, we identified two significant conformations. Both class 1 and 2 have a conformation in the pore domain that is closed towards the periplasm. In contrast, the pore domain in class four shows an opened conformation facing the periplasm. We selected the original and unmodified pump particle images that assign only one member from class 1 and 2 for another round of 3D refinement without symmetry constraint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Model docking and optimization</title><p>The crystal structures of trimeric AcrBZ (PDB code: 4C48) and trimeric TolC (PDB code: 1EK9) were docked into the cryoEM map by using Chimera. Both the TolC and AcrBZ models were adjusted manually to optimize the local fit to density using Coot. Individual domains of AcrA from the crystal structure (PDB code: 2F1M) including β-barrel domain, lipoyl domain and α-helical hairpin domain were fitted to the density map using Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). A homology model of the MP domain of AcrA was built based on the structure of MexA (PDB code: 2V4D) and fit to the density. Four conformationally different structures of the α-helical hairpin domain (Chain A-D in the crystal structure) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) were evaluated for their fit into the density map of our two protomers. The α-helical hairpin structures from chains A and D fit best into the density map for AcrA protomer-I and for protomer-II in the pump assembly, respectively. The model for the complete pump was optimized using Phenix real-space refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) with three-fold symmetry imposed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The model of the whole pump complex was validated by computing a FSC with the density map. It is 4.1 Å at 0.5 FSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) statistics were computed to ensure proper stereochemistry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>The 5.9 Å resolution map calculated from the particle subset in class 1 and 2 without symmetry restraint was fit with the symmetric model based on the 3.9 Å density map. We found that TolC and AcrA did not show conformational change. We noticed during the modeling process of TolC alone that the TolC and AcrA interface is polymorphic, with a slight majority of TolC rotated 60 degrees with respect to the dominant configuration seen in the inhibitor bound pump structure, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>However, the region for the AcrB in the new map revealed significant mismatch to the symmetric model. A better fit was obtained using the asymmetric AcrBZ crystal structure. Model optimization was then done with Phenix real-space refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) using stronger secondary-structure restraints parameters to maintain proper stereochemistry where weak density exists. Moreover, atomic displacement parameters (B-factors) were computed to determine the level of resolvability throughout the map, which correlated well with Resmap results. The Coot adjustments and Phenix model optimization were iterated one additional round to ensure that the model was a good representation of the map.</p><p>For the modeling of the apo state AcrAB-TolC pump, resolved to 6.5 Å resolution, a similar method to modeling of the asymmetric maps was utilized. Crystal structures were rigid-body fit into the density map and model optimization was then carried out with Phenix real-space refine. Again, due to the weaker resolution stronger stereochemical and secondary structure restraints were used to ensure that α-helices and β-sheets did not deviate far from their expected geometry. Manual adjustments were kept to a minimum to reduce human bias in the modeling procedure, with Coot only being used to fix obvious errors such as C-beta deviations. A final check of MolProbity and cross-correlation was done to ensure model quality.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>Accession codes: cryoEM maps and models of AcrABZ-TolC have been deposited in EMDB under accession code EMD-8636 (apo form), EMD-8640 (puromycin), EMD-3636 (MBX3132 inhibitor), and in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 5V5S(apo form), 5V78 (puromycin), and 5NG5 (MBX3132).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An allosteric transport mechanism for the AcrAB-TolC Multidrug Efflux Pump&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Olga Boudker, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Martin Picard (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers were all very enthusiastic about your work and had suggestions that were editorial in nature:</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>In the manuscript, the authors present a series of Cryo-EM and crystal structures that illuminate the allosteric coupling in RND family of transporters. They describe the structures of the apo, and the substrate- or inhibitor-bound states of AcrAB-TolC complex. In the apo state, the protein channel that extends through the periplasmic space is closed at the AcrA-TolC juncture. Binding of the substrate or inhibitor to AcrB is coupled to conformational changes through AcrA to the opening of the constriction at AcrA-TolC interface. The presented structures are informative and the work seems solid. I have only comments that are editorial in nature:</p><p>1) The physiological role of AcrZ and why it was used in the studies of the substrate-bound pump need to be described in more detail.</p><p>2) It is not clear whether there are any structural changes that would propagate through AcrA between substrate- and inhibitor-bound pumps.</p><p>3) More detailed figures fro Apo pump showing differences between two conformations of AcrA and their packing with TolC. Also, showing the openings to the periplasm.</p><p>4) Show puromycin density in Figure 3—figure supplement 3.</p><p>5) Figure 3—figure supplement 3: spelling &quot;deepinding&quot;.</p><p>6) Show more detailed comparison of AcrA- TolC interactions in ligand-bound and apo state.</p><p>7) A bit more detailed description of what are the overall structural changes between closed apo to open substrate-bound state?</p><p>8) Switch the order of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and 3.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> could be clearer if the structures in A and B were shown on the same scale and in the same orientation.</p><p>10) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, which structure is shown in B?</p><p>11) Subsection “The structure of pump in complex with inhibitor MBX3132 reveals the interaction interfaces between pump components at atomic resolution” paragraph two, did you mean <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>?</p><p>12) Please show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> the location of the VGL motif in TolC and the interacting residues of AcrA.</p><p>13) In subsection “The structure of pump in complex with inhibitor MBX3132 reveals the interaction interfaces between pump components at atomic resolution” paragraph three what are the residue pairs?</p><p>Reviewer 2</p><p>The Cambridge group earlier was successful in elucidating, for the first time, the structure of the AcrAB-TolC tripartite efflux complex. Here they report, together with other scientists, on a more refined structure of this complex both in its resting state and in the presumably transport-engaged state, and show how the closed end of the TolC channel may become opened in association of the altered conformation of the pump AcrB. Improvement in technology that led to these wonderful results included many features, such as substitution of Amphipol for conventional detergents and use of focused classification in selecting images. The manuscript is fine. I have only mostly minor comments.</p><p>Subsection “CryoEM structure determination” paragraph one. Citing the two papers where amphipol was successfully used would not be enough, especially the journal is targeted toward diverse audience (and also because these two papers do not even cite the original Jean-Luc Popot 1996 PNAS paper on amphipol!).</p><p>Paragraph two of the same section. I suppose that disulfide-linked AcrAB recruits not only TolC, but also additional AcrA monomers, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>.</p><p>In the last line of paragraph two: I believe that this should be <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2, B and C</xref>.</p><p>Even with the non-intuitive naming convention of supplementary figures, it does not help that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> supplement comes before <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> supplement. Please fix this confusing numbering system for the supplementary figures.</p><p>Subsection “The structure of pump in complex with inhibitor MBX3132 reveals the interaction interfaces between pump components at atomic resolution”. Inhibitor MBX3132 gave such wonderful results precisely because it binds very tightly to the binding pocket, as seen in the very large negative values of its calculated binding energy in Sjuts et al., 2016 The high affinity of this compound must be mentioned somewhere.</p><p>In paragraph three of the same section: conserved Val-Gly-Leu/Thr element in AcrA? It may be obvious, but it would be better to specify AcrA because TolC is also discussed in the same paragraph.</p><p>Also in this paragraph, the tip-to-tip interaction of AcrA and TolC HTH motifs is made very clear with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. However, non-specialists will miss the absence of discussion (and especially figure!) on what happens to these residues in the complex containing a closed TolC conformer. Also, the closed conformer of TolC is supposed to be stabilized by multiple interactions between coiled coils. Are the tip-to-tip interactions enough to overcome these pre-existing multiple interactions?</p><p>Paragraph four of the same section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. This is very nice and informative, but I miss the comparison with the situation in the apo complex. The next paragraph talks about &quot;overlays&quot;, but again there is no figure showing such overlays (especially for the AcrA-TolC interface) even in the supplement.</p><p>Discussion section. If TolC-AcrA interface does not change significantly by the binding of the substrate to AcrB, how could the TolC gate become open in the normal operation of the pump? This reminds us that the &quot;open&quot; complex was seen only when MBX3132 was bound to all three of the trimers, and could be an artifact of the experimental setup.</p><p>Reviewer 3</p><p>The manuscript by Wang et al.et al. describes the near atomic cryoEM structure of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump from E. coli<italic>E. coli</italic>. Structures of the full pump assembly have been obtained in the apo state and in the presence of a substrate or of an inhibitor. For the first time the authors describe the pump under its closed and open conformations. To do so, they have optimized the biochemical procedure to stabilize the genuine complex, by inserting cysteine residues where the contacts between partners of the pumps are anticipated to take place and by subjecting the pump to disulphide crosslinking. The assembly is stabilized by amphipols. The structures have been obtained by crystallography (AcrBZ in the presence of substrate) and cryoEM (tri-quadripartite structures) using the latest technical developments and methodologies.</p><p>This work is a real tour de force and will undoubtedly have a great impact in the field. Hence we fully recommend it to be published in eLIFE<italic>eLife</italic> without further additional experiments to be performed. We only point below minor comments in order for the manuscript to be fully acceptable.</p><p>AcrZ seems to be present in the structures obtained in the presence of puromycin and in that in the presence of the inhibitor but absent in the apo states. The authors do not comment upon that point. Could it be that indeed AcrZ is recruited differently whether the substrate is present or not? What could be the possible role of AcrZ on the transport and/or activity?</p><p>Note that we advise the authors not to color AcrZ in purple because it is difficult (in particular for a daltonian reviewer) to see it in the very middle of an AcrB molecule colored in blue!</p><p>Subsection “The transport state of the full pump with opened channel” first paragraph: Could the authors give the reference to the paper mentioning that puromycin is a validated transport substrate of AcrB?</p><p>We believe that here and there, additional papers could be mentioned, see below:</p><p>Subsection “CryoEM Structure determination”: There are more and more papers showing that amphipols are indeed very useful in the EM field. The authors refer to the work by Baker, Fan and Serysheva, 2015 and by Liao, Cao, Julius and Cheng, 2013. We suggest to also cite the following review by J-L Popot (Zoonens and Popot, 2014), so that the lab where this molecule was developed is also acknowledged.</p><p>Subsection “The structure of pump in complex with inhibitor MBX3132 reveals the interaction interfaces between pump components at atomic resolution”, paragraph two: Maintenance of TolC thanks to the interprotomer network involving R367, T152, D153 and Y362 was already shown thanks to electrophysiology (Andersen et al., 2002), microbiology (Augustus et al., 2004) and crystallography (Bavro et al., 2008).</p><p>Paragraph four of the same section: Non equivalent interactions between each AcrB promoter and each pair of AcrA promoter is reminiscent to the work by the laboratory of Helen Zgurskaya on the related pump TriABC-OpmH (Ntreh, Weeks, Nickels and Zgurskaya, 2016)</p><p>In paragraph five of the section: Wang et al. comment on the fact that the pump is a highly allosteric system in which conformational changes associated with ligand binding by AcrB are communicated to TolC.

In the substrate- and inhibitor-bound pumps, AcrB adopts LTO and TTT states respectively. The interaction interfaces between AcrA and AcrB in these two pump assemblies are slightly different, and the conformation of AcrA protomers is slightly different to adapt to the conformation of AcrB. However, the interfaces between AcrA and TolC are similar. In the case of the switch from apo- to ligand-bound states, the AcrA helical hairpins repack, as a result of changes in the interactions between the AcrA and AcrB.

If TolC-AcrA interface does not change significantly by the binding of the substrate to AcrB, how could the TolC gate become open in the normal operation of the pump? This reminds us that the &quot;open&quot; complex was seen only when MBX3132 was bound to all three of the trimers, and could be an artifact of the experimental setup.</italic> </p><p>It is not true that the open complex was seen only in the presence of the inhibitor; it is also seen in the presence of substrate puromycin. The interfaces are similar in the substrate-bound and inhibitor-bound pumps with an opened TolC channel. In the transport-state, the interface does not change significantly as AcrB cycles through the three conformations, LTO. However, the TolC-AcrA interface does change significantly between the apo and substrate-bound pumps, with a closed and opened TolC channel, respectively.</p><p>In the switch from the apo- to the ligand-bound states, the conformational changes in AcrA are effectively quaternary structural adjustments. These entail repacking of the AcrA helical hairpin domains between adjacent protomers in the tube-like portion of the pump, and repacking of the membrane proximal and β-barrel domains with the surface of AcrB. We think that ligand binding by AcrB triggers changes in its periplasmic headpiece, and this in turn changes the interaction surface with the AcrA membrane proximal and β-barrel domains that results in a rotation movement of those domains.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] AcrZ seems to be present in the structures obtained in the presence of puromycin and in that in the presence of the inhibitor but absent in the apo states. The authors do not comment upon that point. Could it be that indeed AcrZ is recruited differently whether the substrate is present or not? What could be the possible role of AcrZ on the transport and/or activity?</italic> </p><p>Yes, it is correct that AcrZ is present in the puromycin and inhibitor bound structures but not in the apo-structure. AcrZ is a modulator of AcrB for the efflux of substrate puromycin. We used the his- tagged AcrZ to pull down the full assembly to prepare the ligand-bound structures. We did not co- express AcrZ with the disulphide-stabilised construct. We have changed the text to make this clearer. AcrZ may not be recruited differently depending on the presence of ligand, based on comparisons of our crystal structure of AcrZ/AcrB complex in the absence of ligand (Du et al., 2014) and the AcrZ/AcrB/puromycin complex reported here. The functional role of AcrZ in the complex is still unclear.</p><p><italic>Note that we advise the authors not to color AcrZ in purple because it is difficult (in particular for a daltonian reviewer) to see it in the very middle of an AcrB molecule colored in blue!</italic> </p><p><italic>Subsection “The transport state of the full pump with opened channel” first paragraph: Could the authors give the reference to the paper mentioning that puromycin is a « validated transport substrate » of AcrB ?</italic> </p><p>The reference is Hobbs et al., (2012).</p><p><italic>We believe that here and there, additional papers could be mentioned, see below:</italic> </p><p><italic>Subsection “CryoEM Structure determination”: There are more and more papers showing that amphipols are indeed very useful in the EM field.
