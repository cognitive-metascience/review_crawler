Eps8 is an actin bundling and capping protein whose capping activity is inhibited by Erk, a key MAP kinase that is activated by oncogenic signaling. We tested the hypothesis that Eps8 acts as an Erk effector to modulate actin cortex mechanics and thereby mediate bleb-based migration of cancer cells. Cells confined in a non-adhesive environment migrate in the direction of a very large ‘leader bleb.’ Eps8 bundling activity promotes cortex tension and intracellular pressure to drive leader bleb formation. Eps8 capping and bundling activities act antagonistically to organize actin within leader blebs, and Erk mediates this effect. An Erk biosensor reveals concentrated kinase activity within leader blebs. Bleb contents are trapped by the narrow neck that separates the leader bleb from the cell body. Thus, Erk activity promotes actin bundling by Eps8 to enhance cortex tension and drive the bleb-based migration of cancer cells under non-adhesive confinement.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08314.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08314.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08314.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells within an animal have to be able to move both during development and later stages of life. For example, white blood cells have to move around the body and into tissues to fight off infections. Normally, cell movement is heavily controlled and will only happen when it is necessary to keep an animal healthy. However, cancer cells can bypass these controls and ‘metastasize’, or spread to new sites in the body.</p><p>Cells can move in several different ways: on the one hand, cells can use ‘mesenchymal’ movement, in which the skeleton-like scaffolding of molecules within a cell rearranges to push the cell forward. On the other hand, cells can employ ‘amoeboid’ movement, in which they squeeze their way forward by building up pressure in the cell. Although these different types of movement are only used by some healthy cells and not others, cancer cells can switch between the two. How they do this is still unclear, but now Logue et al. have studied this question using several microscopy techniques.</p><p>Logue et al. watched skin cancer (or melanoma) cells migrating between a glass plate and a slab of agar, which mimics the confined spaces that cancer cells have to move through within the body. The images showed that the cancer cells formed so-called ‘leader blebs’, finger-like projections that put cells on the right track. The experiments revealed that a protein called Eps8 was responsible for making the skin cancer cells move in this amoeboid fashion. The ‘blebbing’ caused by Eps8 is turned on by another protein called Erk that is often overactive in melanoma cells. Furthermore, Erk can accumulate near and within the cell blebs and this leads to the increased movement of the skin cancer cells.</p><p>Studying cell movement in melanoma is particularly important because it is the metastatic tumors that kill patients. Therefore, increasing our basic understanding of how cells migrate could eventually lead to better treatment options that stop cancer cells from spreading.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08314.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08314.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>adhesion-independent cell migration</kwd><kwd>bleb</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>Erk</kwd><kwd>Eps8</kwd><kwd>cancer cell biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waterman</surname><given-names>Clare M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chadwick</surname><given-names>Richard S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Eps8, a specific effector of oncogenic signaling, organizes the cortical actin cytoskeleton of cancer cells to promote mechanical properties that favor a newly identified mode of confined, adhesion-independent cell migration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell migration mediates critical physiological processes including development and the immune response, and is de-regulated during cancer metastasis. Cells move by orchestrating their extracellular interactions with intracellular cytoskeleton-dependent changes in shape and force generation; protruding forward, grasping sites in the environment, and pulling themselves along (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lauffenburger and Horwitz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Papusheva and Heisenberg, 2010</xref>). Although the pulling forces driving cell movement are well known to be mediated by myosin-based contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>), recently it has become clear that migrating cells can utilize multiple mechanisms to drive protrusion and interaction with their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lammermann and Sixt, 2009</xref>). Protrusion of the cell's plasma membrane boundary can be driven by either actin polymerization or by pressure-driven membrane blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charras and Paluch, 2008</xref>), while grasping the environment can be mediated by specific adhesion receptors that bind to the extracellular matrix (ECM) or other cells, or by non-specific friction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lammermann and Sixt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergert et al., 2015</xref>). These multiple modes of migration are adopted by different cell types in different contexts. For example immune cells utilize adhesion-independent migration during tissue surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lammermann et al., 2008</xref>), while endothelial cells utilize polymerization-driven protrusion during angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lamalice et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Recent evidence indicates that physical confinement in a non-adhesive environment may drive a change of migration modes. In particular, contractility and extracellular pressure can drive a switch from polymerization/adhesion-based to bleb/friction-based motilities known as the mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition (MAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruprecht et al., 2015</xref>). Cancer cells are known to be highly contractile, making them prone to blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergert et al., 2012</xref>), while tumors are known to be sites of high turgor pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jain, 1987</xref>), both properties being conducive to MAT. Indeed, intravital imaging revealed that melanoma and breast cancer cells migrate by blebbing in live mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tozluoglu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, metastatic cancer cells are hypothesized to be susceptible to MAT in vivo, with the plasticity of their migration modes and lack of specificity in adhesion contributing to their high invasivity and difficulty targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lammermann and Sixt, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Polymerization-driven mesenchymal migration and bleb-based amoeboid migration are mechanistically distinct. In mesenchymal migration, actin polymerization initiated by localized activation of a filament-nucleating factor drives the formation of actin networks or bundles that mediate lamellipodial or filopodial membrane protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skau and Waterman, 2015</xref>). In contrast, in blebbing cells, membrane protrusion is mediated by myosin II contractility-induced hydrostatic pressure that drives a bubbling-out of the plasma membrane at a site of local weakness in the cortical actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charras et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charras and Paluch, 2008</xref>). While the molecular mechanisms mediating polymerization-based protrusion and contractility-induced pressure are reasonably well understood, the molecules responsible for local changes in the actin cortex that allow bleb formation are not known. It is hypothesized that blebs could form either by local down-regulation of membrane-cytoskeleton linkers such as those of the ezrin/radixin/moesin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Estecha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lorentzen et al., 2011</xref>), or by local weakening of sites in the cortical actin network itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Charras et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, experiments using actin depolymerizing drugs have shown cortex integrity to be an important factor in regulating blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Charras et al., 2006</xref>). Local inhomogeneity in cortical integrity could be mediated by regulation of actin filament number or organization. In turn, filament number could be controlled by modulating the activity of filament nucleators, cappers or depolymerizers, while actin organization could be regulated by filament crosslinkers, bundlers or motor proteins. However, the proteins critical to regulating actin cortical organization and mechanics during blebbing are not known.</p><p>In this study, we focused on identifying the mechanism for regulating the actin cortex of cancer cells during MAT and bleb-based migration. Many highly invasive cancers are known to be caused by mutations that activate the oncogenic EGF/Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Downward, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roberts and Der, 2007</xref>). It is well-known that Erk-mediated activation of myosin II promotes cell contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klemke et al., 1997</xref>). Accordingly, we concentrated on actin regulatory proteins downstream of this pathway that may synergize with contractility to affect blebbing. <underline>E</underline>pidermal growth factor receptor <underline>p</underline>athway <underline>s</underline>ubstrate 8 (Eps8) is an actin bundling and capping protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Disanza et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hertzog et al., 2010</xref>) that plays a critical role in development of the nervous, auditory and reproductive systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menna et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manor et al., 2011</xref>) and its upregulation in cancers correlates with invasivity and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griffith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2012</xref>). Eps8 was originally identified as an actin binding protein downstream of the EGF receptor and to regulate actin through a complex with SOS1 and Abi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazioli et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scita et al., 1999</xref>). Additionally, the actin filament capping activity of Eps8 is inhibited by Erk through phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menna et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the dual actin regulatory functions and targeting by Erk make Eps8 a good candidate for regulating the cortex downstream of oncogenic signaling.</p><p>By combining imaging of fluorescently tagged proteins and atomic force microscopy (AFM) with targeted mutations in Eps8, the work described here tests the hypothesis that Eps8 acts as a key effector of Erk to modulate actin cortex mechanics and thereby mediate bleb-based migration of cancer cells. We find that Eps8 bundling activity promotes cortex tension and pressure to drive MAT in non-adherent, confined cells, which migrate with a characteristic ‘leader-bleb’ morphology. Within leader blebs, Eps8 capping and bundling activities act antagonistically, and phosphorylation by Erk mediates this effect. Using a FRET biosensor for Erk, we document a massive concentration of kinase activity within leader blebs and find that leader bleb contents are trapped by the bleb neck that separates the bleb from the cell body. Our results identify a mechanism by which Eps8 may promote the transition to rapid, unregulated migration of cancer cells in confinement that may be critical to their highly invasive behavior in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Eps8 is recruited early to bleb membranes and forms a gradient across the length of a ‘leader bleb’</title><p>To determine the role of Eps8 in cancer cell blebbing and migration, we utilized human A375 melanoma cells which carry a mutation in B-Raf (V600E) that activates the Raf/MEK/Erk pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 2002</xref>). We imaged Eps8 and the actin cytoskeleton by spinning disk confocal microscopy in cells that were fixed and stained with fluorescent phalloidin and either immunolabeled with antibodies to Eps8 or expressing Emerald-tagged mouse Eps8 (Emerald-mEps8). When cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips to promote adhesion and spreading, actin formed a dense meshwork in the lamellipodia near the cell edge, and circumferential arcs and stress fibers in the lamella and cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both endogenous and Emerald-mEps8 localized primarily to lamellipodia and arcs, but were absent from stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine Eps8 distribution in a non-adhesive environment, A375 cells co-expressing Emerald-mEps8 and FusionRed-tagged F-tractin (an actin filament binding peptide, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schell et al., 2001</xref>]) were plated on uncoated glass. Here, cells were rounded, and confocal sections midway through the cell Z-axis revealed a dense band of cortical actin at the periphery of the cell body. From this cortical band extended many blebs that possessed thin, continuous rims of cortical actin at their membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Eps8 was absent from the dense cortical band of the cell body, but localized with actin in punctae along the peripheral rim of actin in blebs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). Co-expression of FusionRed-F-tractin and EGFP-tagged myosin II regulatory light chain (GFP-MII-RLC, a marker of myosin II isoforms) in non-adherent cells showed that myosin II was concentrated on the dense cortical band and was at very low levels or absent from the bleb periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

To mark the position of the cell membrane in negative-image, cells were mounted in media containing red fluorescent dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Analysis of time-lapse image series showed that similar to previous studies, ezrin appeared rapidly on the newly protruded bleb membrane at ∼5 s after bleb formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Recruitment of Eps8 and actin to the membrane occurred on a similar timescale as ezrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E,H</xref>). In contrast, MII-RLC appeared ∼30 s after protrusion, and coincided with the onset of bleb retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). These results indicate that in non-adherent cells, Eps8 recruitment to bleb membranes occurs concurrently with actin assembly.</p><p>To induce migration of non-adherent melanoma cells, we confined A375 cells expressing Emerald-mEps8 and FusionRed-F-tractin between an agarose pad and uncoated glass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergert et al., 2012</xref>). Strikingly, cells in these conditions had reduced blebbing on the cell body, but formed a single very large sausage-shaped bleb that generally excluded the nucleus, and which was defined by a thin neck at the junction between the large bleb and the spherical cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). This morphology was very similar to the ‘A2’ or ‘stable bleb’ phenotypes recently described for non-adherent cells migrating under confinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruprecht et al., 2015</xref>). Long-term imaging showed that ∼40% of non-adherent, confined cells exhibited apparently rapid migration in the direction of the very large bleb, which we will thus call a ‘leader bleb’ (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Indeed, A375 cells adhered to fibronectin-coated coverslips (either 5 or 50 µg/ml) did not migrate, while leader bleb-based migration of confined non-adherent cells was very fast at 1.15 ± 1.02 µm/min (mean ± SE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="AVI" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-08314-media1.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08314.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Human melanoma A375 cells form a single prominent bleb when confined under an agar pad.</title><p>Comparison of central Z-plane confocal time-lapse videos of Emerald-mEps8 dynamics in A375 cells plated on human plasma fibronectin coated glass (left), uncoated glass (middle) and confined between uncoated glass and an agar pad (right).

To analyze the spatial distribution of actin and Eps8 within the leader bleb, we determined their average intensities within five regions of interest (ROIs), each representing 20% of the length of the leader bleb from neck (region 1) to distal tip (region 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).

Eps8 localized in a punctate manner along actin bundles, forming a gradient, with the highest concentration near the neck connecting the bleb to the cell body and the lowest level at the distal tip of the leader bleb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Similar imaging of EGFP-MII-RLC showed that myosin II was distributed around the cortical band of the cell body, highly concentrated in the narrow neck at the bleb neck where the bleb connected to the cell body, and nearly absent from the distal half of the leader bleb, similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruprecht et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these results show that in non-adherent cells, Eps8 localizes rapidly to bleb membranes as actin assembles. When non-adherent cells are confined, actin and Eps8 concentrate in leader blebs where they exhibit a directional assembly gradient and rearward flow towards the contractile bleb neck, and this cortical flow is coordinated with rapid cell movement directed by the leader bleb.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-08314-media3.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08314.008</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Eps8 and actin flow towards the bleb neck in leader blebs.</title><p>Ventral Z-plane confocal time-lapse video of Emerald-mEps8 (green) and FusionRed-F-tractin (red) dynamics showing their coordinated flow towards the bleb neck in an A375 cell confined between uncoated glass and an agar pad.

To test this, we used a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to human Eps8 that resulted in 76 ± 2.1% (mean ± SE) depletion of the protein in A375 cells after 24 hr (Eps8-KD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Expression of FusionRed-F-tractin in non-adherent Eps8-KD cells confined under an agar pad followed by confocal imaging revealed that Eps8 depletion generally inhibited the formation of large leader blebs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Instead, confined non-adherent cells resembled unconfined non-adherent cells, with a distribution of various-sized protruding and retracting blebs around their perimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and the fraction of cells that underwent leader bleb-based migration was reduced by nearly half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We tested this in U2OS human osteosarcoma that are deleted for the cell cycle regulatory gene CDKN2A (Catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer), and human lung cancer A549 cells that carry the K-Ras G12S oncogenic mutation (Catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer). When plated on uncoated glass, both U20S and A549 cells rounded up and exhibited blebbing around their peripheries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). When transfected with EGFP as a soluble marker and confined between uncoated glass and agar and subjected to time-lapse confocal microscopy, 36% of U20S cells and 46% of A549 cells took on a leader bleb morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and underwent rapid migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To test the requirement for Eps8 in this transition, we used siRNA to reduce Eps8 level by 53% and 57% in U20S and A549 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Analysis of confocal videos showed that Eps8 depletion generally inhibited the formation of large leader blebs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), and quantitation confirmed that the fraction of both cell types that underwent leader bleb-based migration was reduced by more than half, and leader bleb area was reduced by 34% and 43% in U20S and A549 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Expression of Emerald-mEps8 rescued leader bleb size and migration in U20S and A549 cells that had been treated with Eps8 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Thus, Eps8 is required for leader bleb formation to drive migration of confined, non-adherent cells in several cancer cell types, independent of the defect driving transformation.</p><p>To analyze the effects of Eps8-KD on cytoskeletal organization in A375 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>), we utilized metrics that quantified both the density and bundle organization of the cytoskeleton in confined, non-adherent cells. For filament density, we measured average F-tractin intensity in both the dense cortical actin band of the cell body and in the leader bleb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). To quantify bundle organization, we determined the local alignment (‘anisoptropy’) of F-tractin bundles within the leader bleb via the ImageJ plugin, FibrilTool, which uses the concept of nematic tensor to provide a local quantitative description of the anisotropy of fiber arrays and their average orientation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boudaoud et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). To quantify the spatial variation in these parameters, we determined their values in five ROIs along the leader bleb length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). This showed that compared to control, Eps8-KD induced a slight but significant reduction in the density of the cortical actin band in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,G</xref>), but had no significant effect on the density or distribution of actin within leader blebs, where actin exhibited a gradient with the highest concentration at the neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,H</xref>). Regional analysis of F-tractin anisotropy showed that in control cells, actin bundle alignment also formed a gradient in the leader bleb, but in the opposite direction as the density gradient, such that bundles consistently were most highly aligned towards the distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H″</xref>), and decreased towards the neck. Knockdown of Eps8 did not destroy the anisotropy gradient, but made actin bundle organization highly variable along the largest bleb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H″</xref>). Examination of the localization of EGFP-MII-RLC in Eps8-KD cells showed that similar to control, myosin II concentrated in the dense cortical band of actin around the cell body and at the neck of the largest bleb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In agreement, western blotting for myosin II regulatory light chain phosphorylated on serine 19 (pS19 MLC) as a marker of activated myosin II showed no significant difference in myosin II activity between control and Eps8-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Together, these results show that in confined, non-adherent cells, Eps8 promotes enlargement of leader blebs independent of myosin II activity, where it acts to promote actin bundling towards the distal bleb tip, and is required for leader bleb-based migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cortex tension and intracellular pressure are maintained by Eps8</title><p>Since leader bleb formation is mediated by intracellular pressure induced by contractility in the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruprecht et al., 2015</xref>), we next sought to determine the role of Eps8 in regulation of cortical cytoskeleton mechanical properties. We utilized an atomic force microscope (AFM)-based assay in which rounded, non-adherent cells are subjected to a minimal deformation with a tipless cantilever (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischer-Friedrich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramanathan et al., 2015</xref>), and cortex tension and intracellular pressure can be extracted from the resulting force–displacement curves using measurements of the cell radius and actin cortex thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2013</xref>) and a theory derived from a simple force balance of the applied cantilever normal force with the force due to intracellular pressure and the force from cortex tension (see ‘Materials and methods’). We first validated the approach using cells treated with the myosin II ATPase inhibitor blebbistatin. This showed that inhibition of myosin II did not significantly affect cell radius or cortical actin thickness, but cortex tension and intracellular pressure were both significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tinevez et al., 2009</xref>). Similar measurements showed that compared to non-targeting control, Eps8-KD resulted in significant decreases in cortex tension and intracellular pressure, although these effects were not as strong as those induced by blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Thus, Eps8 promotes cortex tension and increases intracellular pressure.

Accordingly, Eps8-KD cells expressing Emerald-mEps8Δbund exhibited a more than 50% decrease in the fraction of cells migrating under confinement compared to Eps8-KD cells reconstituted with Emerald-mEps8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Even stronger effects on leader bleb size were observed in wild-type A375 cells over-expressing Emerald-mEps8Δbund (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>), indicating it acts as a dominant negative, likely by dimerizing with endogenous Eps8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kishan et al., 1997</xref>). We thus used a dominant negative approach where appropriate to negate the possibility of off-target effects induced by siRNAs. Because cells carrying defects in Eps8 bundling activity lacked a large bleb, we were unable to determine the effects of this mutation on actin density or anisotropy in the leader bleb. However, analysis of actin density in the cortical band of the cell body showed that over-expression of Emerald-mEps8Δbund had no effect compared to over-expression of Emerald-mEps8 alone, and caused no detectable changes in the organization of MII-RLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). AFM analysis showed that while over-expression of Emerald-mEps8 had no effect on cortical tension and intracellular pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), over-expression of Emerald-mEps8Δbund significantly reduced cortex tension and intracellular pressure compared to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We over-expressed the actin bundling protein α-actinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Podlubnaya et al., 1975</xref>) tagged with EGFP together with FusionRed-F-tractin in either WT or Eps8-KD cells under non-adherent confinement. Confocal imaging of EGFP-α-actinin in either WT or Eps8-KD cells showed a remarkably similar localization as Emerald-mEps8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>), with α-actinin concentrated in leader blebs where it was localized in a gradient along circumferential actin bundles, although the labelling of the bundles was more continuous and less punctate than that of Emerald-mEps8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed that in Eps8-KD cells, over-expression of α-actinin was sufficient to partially rescue their defect in leader bleb size, but not to the same extent as expression of Emerald-mEps8Δbund (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In addition, α-actinin over-expression in Eps8-KD cells partially rescued the effects of loss of Eps8 in cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). AFM analysis showed that over-expression of α-actinin increased cortical tension and intracellular pressure by more than 50% compared to either untreated cells or cells over-expressing Emerald-mEps8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These results demonstrate the critical role of actin bundling in promoting cortical tension and generating intracellular pressure to mediate the formation of leader blebs, however they show that other functions or regulation of Eps8 cannot be compensated by α-actinin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Eps8 actin capping activity limits leader bleb size by decreasing actin density and mechanical properties in the cell body cortex, and antagonizing actin bundling at the leader bleb tip</title><p>We next sought to determine whether the actin filament capping activity of Eps8 is required for leader bleb formation, cytoskeletal organization, and cellular mechanical properties. We made aspartic acid substitutions within the C-terminus of Emerald-tagged mouse Eps8 (V689D/L693D, referred to as Emerald-mEps8Δcap) which have been previously shown to specifically block Eps8 capping activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hertzog et al., 2010</xref>) and regulate blebbing during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Werner et al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, when confined under agar, Eps8-KD cells expressing Emerald-mEps8Δcap formed significantly larger leader blebs and the proportion of cells migrating nearly doubled compared to either untransfected controls or to Eps8-KD cells expressing Emerald-mEps8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). Over-expression of Emerald-mEps8Δcap similarly increased leader bleb area compared to over-expression of Emerald-mEps8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Confocal imaging of confined Eps8-KD cells and analysis of re-expressed protein distribution together with FusionRed-F-tractin or -MII-RLC showed that unlike the gradient of Emerald-mEps8 with the highest level at the leader bleb base, Emerald-mEps8Δcap was equally distributed along the length of the leader bleb or slightly concentrated at the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,G</xref>). Analysis of actomyosin organization showed that compared to expression of Emerald-mEps8, expression of Emerald-mEps8Δcap in Eps8-KD cells decreased the level of actin in the dense cortical band of the cell body, although the density gradient of actin along the leader bleb and the distribution of MII-RLC was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F,G′</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, the actin bundle anisotropy gradient in the leader bleb was highly enhanced, with Eps8-KD cells expressing Emerald-mEps8Δcap exhibiting nearly fivefold higher actin bundle anisotropy near the tips of their leader blebs compared to Eps8-KD cells expressing Emerald-mEps8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G″</xref>). AFM analysis of cortex mechanics showed that compared to over-expression of Emerald-mEps8, over-expression of Emerald-mEps8Δcap significantly increased cortex tension and intracellular pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Together, these results show that the capping activity of Eps8 decreases actin density and mechanical properties of the cortex in the cell body, but acts to antagonize actin bundle formation in the distal region of leader blebs, and together this limits leader bleb size. This further suggests that the capping activity of Eps8 may be regionally regulated to maintain a gradient of actin bundle organization in the leader bleb.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08314.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Eps8 actin capping activity limits leader bleb size by decreasing actin density and mechanical properties in the cell body cortex, and antagonizing actin bundling at the leader bleb tip.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>I</bold>) Images and analyses of A375 cells plated on glass and confined under an agar slab.

This analysis showed, as expected, that U0126 inhibited Erk activation independent of the expression of Eps8 constructs. Similarly, U0126 strongly reduced the pS/T level in immunoprecipitated Emerald-mEps8 compared to untreated cells.

We localized endogenous Eps8 and actin in cells plated on poly-L-Lysine to mediate non-specific adhesion during immunostaining. This showed that U0126 treatment caused cells to flatten out at their base where they attached to the coverslip and to form actin bundles in the cell center and lamellipodia and filopodia with Eps8 on their tips, although they still possessed small blebs containing Eps8 on their dorsal surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). When cells co-expressing FusionRed-F-tractin and EGFP-MII-RLC were confined under non-adherent conditions and perfused with U0126, this remarkably induced rapid retraction of leader blebs and formation of actin bundles in the center of the cell body that lacked myosin II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). Quantification showed that compared to untreated control, U0126 significantly reduced leader bleb area and density of the cortical actin band in the cell body, and completely blocked leader-bleb based migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E,F</xref>).

These results illustrate two important points. First, they show that Erk activity mediates spatial regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, such that it promotes actin density in the cortex and inhibits actin bundling in the cell center. Second, Erk activity is required for maintaining cortical tension and intracellular pressure to drive leader bleb formation for adhesion-independent migration under confinement.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media6" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-08314-media6.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08314.023</object-id><label>Video 6.</label><caption><title>MEK/Erk activity regulates the organization of the actin cortex and is required to form large leader blebs.</title><p>Ventral Z-plane confocal time-lapse video showing actin (FusionRed-F-tractin, red) and myosin II (EGFP-myosin II regulatory light chain, RLC, green) dynamics and leader bleb retraction in an A375 cell confined between uncoated glass and an agar pad.

We generated a non-phosphorylatable mutant of Emerald-mEps8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, S624A/T628A, referred to as Emerald-mEps8-SATA) that has been shown to have constitutive capping activity in vitro and inhibit filopodia formation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menna et al., 2009</xref>). We expressed Emerald-mEps8 or Emerald-mEps8-SATA in either control or Eps8-KD cells and subjected them to confinement under non-adhesive conditions. This showed that either reconstitution of Eps8-KD or over-expression with Emerald-mEps8-SATA blocked leader bleb formation, significantly reducing leader bleb size by ∼50% and strongly inhibiting cell migration compared to expression of Emerald-mEps8 in either wild type or Eps8-KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>).

Interestingly, expression of Emerald-mEps8-SATA together with FusionRed-F-tractin showed that the Eps8 phospho-mutant was depleted from the cortex and instead formed thick bundle structures in the cell center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), similar to the actin bundles seen in cells treated with U0126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), but the bundles were not labeled with F-tractin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). However, fixation and staining with antibodies to vimentin or with fluorescent phalloidin showed that the Emerald-mEps8-SATA cables did not co-localize with intermediate filaments, but were dense with actin, suggesting that F-tractin and Eps8 may compete for the same binding site in actin bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Analysis of fluorescent phalloidin intensity in the cortical band of the cell body showed that Emerald-mEps8-SATA did not alter actin density compared to Emerald-mEps8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). In addition, co-expression of Emerald-mEps8-SATA together with FusionRed MII-RLC in Eps8-KD cells showed that myosin II continued to localize to the peripheral cortex, but the central Eps8/actin bundles lacked myosin II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Quantification of the percentage of cells with Eps8/actin bundles showed that expression of F-tractin did not induce bundle formation, while over-expression of Emerald-mEps8 or Emerald-mEps8-SATA induced bundles in ∼30% or ∼70% of cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). This indicates that Emerald-mEps8-SATA promotes the formation of excessive non-contractile actin bundles in the cell center. Together with our previous results, this suggests that the S624 and T628 Erk phosphorylation sites in Eps8, are required for suppressing central actin bundles, while other targets of MEK/Erk regulate cortical actin density.</p><p>We then sought to determine how the S624A/T628A mutations in Eps8 mediated their effects on the cytoskeleton. We first tested whether this was due to a lack of Erk-mediated regulation on these sites. Treatment of non-adherent cells expressing either Emerald-mEps8 or Emerald-mEps8-SATA with 10 μM U0126 for 90 min followed by fixation and phalloidin staining showed that Erk inhibition induced Eps8/actin cables to the same extent, independent of the S624A/T628A mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>). Because phosphorylation of S624 and T628 are known to inhibit the actin capping activity of Eps8, and yet non-phosphorylatable mutation of these sites (which would be expected to have constitutive capping) produced an ectopic actin cable effect, we wondered if the formation of Eps8/actin cables induced by Erk inhibition required either the capping or bundling activities of Eps8. Over-expression of either Emerald-mEps8Δcap or Emerald-mEps8Δbund in either the presence or absence of U0126 did not induce Eps8/actin cables, indicating that both capping and bundling activities are required for cable formation induced by Erk inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>). Furthermore, over-expression of Emerald-mEps8Δcap in cells treated with U0126 and confined under agar could not rescue the loss of leader blebs induced by perfusion of Erk inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that Erk promotes leader blebs by other mechanisms in addition to down-regulation of Eps8 capping activity. Finally, we found that over-expression of an S624E/T628E Eps8 mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menna et al., 2009</xref>) could not recapitulate the effects of Emerald-mEps8Δcap in cells, suggesting that the E substitutions do not act as phospho-mimics to inhibit Eps8 capping activity in cells (not shown). However, together our results show that MEK/Erk-mediated phosphorylation of Eps8 on S624 and T628 inhibits the bundling- and capping-dependent formation of central actin cables by Eps8. This also suggests that in addition to directly regulating actin capping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menna et al., 2009</xref>), these sites may affect the bundling activity of Eps8 in cells by an indirect mechanism.</p><p>We then tested the role of S624 and T628 of Eps8 and their regulation by Erk in cortex mechanics. AFM analysis showed that compared to untreated or cells expressing Emerald-mEps8, Emerald-mEps8-SATA expression reduced cortex tension and intracellular pressure to a level similar to treatment with U0126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 7I,J, 6G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This was surprising, considering that this mutant had no effect on cortical actin density. However, it is possible that the cortical mechanics could be altered by the redistribution of mutant Eps8 from the cortex to central actin bundles. Together, these results suggest that Erk-mediated phosphorylation of S624 and T628 coordinates the local co-regulation of Eps8 capping and bundling activities to control cortical tension and intracellular pressure to mediate leader bleb formation and migration of confined cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Erk activity is concentrated in a gradient across leader blebs and its mobility is restricted by a diffusion barrier at the bleb neck</title><p>Our demonstrations that Erk activity and regional regulation of Eps8 activity are essential to leader bleb formation suggests that Erk activity itself may be regionally regulated in migrating melanoma cells. Because immunofluorescense (of phospho-Eps8 or active Erk) is not possible in cells confined under agar, we turned to a Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based biosensor of active Erk called ‘Erk Kinase Activity Reporter containing EV linker’ (EKAREV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harvey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Komatsu et al., 2011</xref>). In short, a CFP-tagged phospho-peptide-binding domain is connected by a FRET-optimized ‘EV linker’ to a YFP-tagged Erk substrate peptide, and FRET is obtained when the substrate is phosphorylated by Erk. We first used the reporter to localize Erk activity in cells adhered to fibronectin-coated glass. Confocal imaging showed that EKAREV (CFP channel) was soluble, excluded from membranous organelles, and diffusely localized throughout the cell, while YFP/CFP ratio imaging revealed a low FRET signal indicating low Erk activity throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In contrast, in non-adherent, blebbing cells, although the EKAREV reporter was evenly distributed, the ratio image showed heightened levels of FRET indicating higher Erk activity specifically in blebs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). Importantly, treatment with U0126 reduced the EKAREV FRET ratio to minimal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Remarkably, time-lapse ratio imaging at 5 s intervals showed that a flash of high FRET appeared in the bleb periphery just after protrusion, and was maintained until bleb retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Thus, EKAREV reveals spatially and temporally localized Erk activity in blebs of non-adherent cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08314.028</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Erk activity is concentrated in a gradient across leader blebs by a diffusion barrier at the bleb neck.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>, <bold>G</bold>) A375 cells expressing the EKAREV biosensor in which a CFP-tagged phospho-peptide-binding domain is connected by the EV linker to a YFP-tagged Erk substrate peptide and FRET is obtained when the substrate is phosphorylated by Erk.

Furthermore, regional analysis of the magnitude of FRET signal distribution within leader blebs showed a shallow gradient, with Erk activity highest at the distal tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). To determine if this effect could be caused by an enrichment of signaling proteins within leader blebs, we localized either soluble EGFP, or EGFP tagged versions of Erk, MEK or activated B-Raf (V600E) in cells confined under agarose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Quantification showed that EGFP alone as well as EKAREV were enriched by ∼10–12% in the leader bleb relative to the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Although Erk, MEK and B-Raf (V600E) were all enriched within leader blebs by 15–20% relative to the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F,G</xref>), this was not significantly higher than the enrichment of EGFP alone. Therefore, slight enrichment of soluble proteins within leader blebs may be a general phenomenon, likely because membranous organelles that exclude cytoplasmic markers are largely excluded from the leader bleb and maintained in the cell body. Together, our results show that in confined non-adherent cells, Erk activity is highly concentrated in leader blebs where it forms a gradient with peak activity at the bleb tip.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media8" mime-subtype="AVI" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-08314-media8.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08314.030</object-id><label>Video 8.</label><caption><title>The EKAREV biosensor reveals concentrated Erk kinase activity within large leader blebs.</title><p>Comparison of central Z-plane confocal time-lapse videos of Erk kinase activity in A375 cells plated on human plasma fibronectin coated glass (left), uncoated glass (middle) and confined between uncoated glass and an agar pad (right).

To test this, we utilized soluble monomeric Eos which converts from green to red fluorescence upon exposure to UV light. Using a localized pulse of 405 nm light, we photo-converted mEos in a rectangular region within the leader bleb a short distance away from the neck and then imaged the redistribution of red fluorescence by diffusion within the bleb and cell body.

We demonstrate that, in contrast to cells adhered to ECM where Eps8 associates with filopodia and lamellipodia, in non-adherent melanoma cells, Eps8 localizes to bleb membranes as actin assembles. A novel, bleb-based mode of migration was recently described by several labs that occurs when non-adherent, highly contractile cells are squeezed in 3D confinement. The pressure induced by such an environment induces cells to undergo a MAT and adopt a characteristic polarized morphology where rapid cell motility is driven by cortical cytoskeletal flow that generates extracellular friction along a large sausage-shaped ‘leader bleb’ that drags along the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruprecht et al., 2015</xref>). We show here that in cancer cells, the actin capping and bundling scaffold protein Eps8 is required to promote this morphological transition under confinement by enhancing cortical tension and promoting increased intracellular pressure. Our manipulations of Eps8 level and activities that defined its requirement for leader bleb formation and migration did not perturb the organization or activity of myosin II. This, together with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruprecht et al., 2015</xref>), indicates that both contractility and proper organization of the cytoskeleton are critical to generating the cortical mechanical properties conducive to leader bleb-based migration under non-adhesive confinement.</p><p>Our experimental results suggest a speculative model for how Eps8 mediates leader bleb-based migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). We find that the bundling activity of Eps8 is required for promoting the mesenchymal-to-leader bleb transition in confined, non-adherent melanoma cells. This identifies a critical role for actin bundles in promoting the cortical inhomogeneity and cellular pressure that have been postulated to mediate symmetry breaking to drive this drastic polarized cell shape change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruprecht et al., 2015</xref>). Once the morphology transition occurs, we find that Eps8 and actin both form a gradient within the leader bleb, decreasing with distance from the neck, but absent from the very tip. Our demonstration the Eps8 localizes to bleb membranes on a similar timescale as ezrin suggests that their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zwaenepoel et al., 2012</xref>) may be critical to Eps8 cortical recruitment. Analysis of actin bundle anisotropy shows that actin bundling forms an opposing gradient, with the most organized actin bundles towards the bleb tip. Actin bundles wrapping around the short axis of the bleb are likely responsible for maintaining the sausage/allantoid shape. Our demonstration that inhibition of Eps8 capping activity further enhances actin bundle organization towards the leading bleb tip suggests that Eps8's bundling and capping activities act antagonistically, such that when capping is down-regulated, Eps8 may be a more efficient bundler. Thus, local regulation of Eps8 capping activity could promote polarization of actin organization with opposing gradients in actin density and bundling along the leader bleb. However, by manipulating Erk activity or the Erk phosphorylation sites in Eps8, we demonstrate that Erk-mediated phosphorylation of S624 and T628 not only down-regulates the capping activity of Eps8 as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menna et al., 2009</xref>), but may in fact coordinate the regulation of Eps8 capping and bundling activities. Our use of a FRET biosensor surprisingly shows that Erk activity is massively concentrated in leader blebs, although the mechanism for this concentration is not clear. However, the high activity is likely trapped there by a diffusion barrier at the bleb neck, and within the leader bleb forms a shallow gradient with peak activity at the bleb tip. This suggests that Erk-mediated down-regulation of Eps8 capping activity at the leader bleb tip could drive the formation of opposing gradients in actin bundling and density along the bleb length. This gradient in actin organization, in turn, may be required for spatial organization of cortical tension, which we predict would mirror the gradient in actin bundling, to maintain the allantoid shape and drive cortical flow in the leader bleb. The increased cortical tension at the bleb tip would be opposed at the bleb neck by myosin II contractility, and the depletion of myosin II and actin from the very tip of the leader bleb would provide a site where high intracellular pressure could promote local protrusion of the leading membrane to mediate the leader-bleb-based migration of confined cells. Thus, our results identify a mechanism by which spatial regulation of Eps8 actin regulatory activities by Erk may promote the rapid, unregulated migration of melanoma cells that may be critical to their highly invasive behavior in vivo.</p><p>The confinement of cells simulated here by an under agarose assay is thought to occur in animal cells during intraepithelial migration, within the perivascular space and between muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charras and Sahai, 2014</xref>). Additionally, leader bleb-based migration may be important to migration between tightly packed cells found in solid tumors. Our observation that inhibition of Erk activity is capable of blocking formation of large leader blebs is consistent with the notion that effectors of the pathway, such as Eps8, are important to the migration of confined cancer cells. The Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk pathway is one of the most frequently upregulated pathways in cancer. In melanoma, this pathway is particularly active because of a commonly found activating mutation in B-Raf V600E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 2002</xref>) that bypasses Ras and the negative feedback that normally restrains MEK/Erk activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Logue and Morrison, 2012</xref>). This feature predisposes melanoma cells to blebbing by supporting a Raf/MEK/Erk/MLCK/RLC/myosin contractility cascade. Drugs that target B-Raf V600E (e.g., vemurafenib) have been shown to have remarkable effects in the short-term. Compensatory upregulation of the pathway by cancer cells frequently limits their effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Logue and Morrison, 2012</xref>). However, our work shows that other mechanisms for activating Erk, including via oncogenic Ras mutations in lung cancer cells or via serum factors in osteosarcoma cells also lead to Eps8-dependent bleb-based migration. The work described here elucidates the importance of a specific Erk effector, Eps8, in the migration of confined melanoma cells. Therefore, targeting specific effectors as opposed to canonical signaling enzymes may have therapeutic value. Effectors that impact cell architecture through the regulation of the cytoskeleton could be particularly attractive targets especially for prevention of metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>A375, A549 and U2OS cells were all obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and all were maintained for up to 15 passages in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, GlutaMAX (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), antibiotic-antimycotic (Life Technologies) and 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4.

Briefly, cells were double-labeled with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Life Technologies) and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated phalloidin. Spinning disk confocal images through the central Z-plane of the cell were acquired using a 100× (1.4 NA) objective lens.

The hybrid microscope instrument was placed on an acoustic isolation table (Kinetic Systems, Boston, MA). A heating stage (Veeco) was used to maintain cells at 37C. Cells were located by EGFP fluorescence while cell radii were measured using bright-field images taken with a 40× (0.6 NA Plan Fluor) objective lens and a QuantEM EMCCD camera (Photometrics). After location of cells, a soft and tipless rectangular silicon nitride cantilever (length: 350 ± 5 µm, width: 32.5 ± 3 µm, thickness: 1 ± 0.5 µm; MikroMasch, Bulgaria) was brought to close proximity. The cantilever stiffness was first calibrated by performing a force curve on the stiffer glass-bottom dish to estimate the photodetector deflection sensitivity, and then by using the thermal noise fluctuation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hutter and Bechhoefer, 1993</xref>). The estimated spring constants for cantilevers used in force curves were 0.08–0.11 N/m. After calibration, the AFM cantilever was moved on top of a cell and lowered to gently deform it. Approximately ten successive force curves were performed in the same location on each cell per condition using 4 µm ramps with up to ∼1 nN applied force at 0.5 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Analysis of AFM data</title><p>All AFM force spectroscopy measurements were analyzed to extract the cell mechanical properties using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA).

We discarded noisy force curves and/or curves that presented jumps possibly due to cantilever slippage or very weakly adhered and moving rounded cells. For initial contact estimation, user-dependent determination was employed, selecting the location when the force curves increased substantially from zero. This method does not require prior knowledge or assumption about the material and geometrical properties of the cell.

Many cancer cells apply bleb-based amoeboid migration in tissue environment, but the mechanisms controlling the organization and mechanics of cortical actomyosin structures during blebbing are incompletely understood. Here Logue et al. provide evidence that actin filament bundling and capping protein, Eps8, has an important role in bleb formation. A375 cells, under confined migration, undergo a switch toward a blebbing type of locomotion characterized by the extension of a prominent large bleb that drives cells forward. Eps8 concentrates to and forms a gradient along the leader bleb, and depletion of this protein leads to defects in proper organization of actin filament bundles and bleb-based migration. RNAi-rescue and over-expression studies further demonstrated that both actin filament bundling and capping activities are important in regulation of leader bleb dynamics, and provided evidence that spatiotemporally controlled phosphorylation of Eps8 through Erk is important in coordinating these activities in cells. The data thus support a model whereby Eps8 is a major target of Erk activity in the MAT switch of migration.</p><p>The majority of the data presented in the manuscript are of good technical quality, and the work provides important new information concerning mechanisms of bleb-based migration and the role of Eps8 in regulating the cortical actin cytoskeleton to control cortex tension. This study will thus be an important contribution for the cell migration and cancer communities. However, there are few key assumptions and some experimental limitations that prevent the generalization of findings that are otherwise interesting and novel. Therefore, additional experiments and clarifications (see 'essential revisions' below) are required to further strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The entire dataset was generated by using A375 melanoma cells. These cells express mutated BRAF begging the question as to whether Eps8 requirement for leader bleb formation specifically depends on this genetic alteration (that is expected to affect Erk levels). Thus, the authors should use some other cell lines to test whether Eps8 is generally required for leader bleb formation (or other related processes) or whether this is specific for A375 melanoma.</p><p>2) The authors assumed that Eps8 is phosphorylated in an Erk-dependent fashion in A375 cells, but there were no experiments to directly demonstrate this. The use of an Eps8 phospho-deficient mutant provides indirect evidence in this direction. However, it is unclear whether treatment with Erk inhibitors is effective in preventing Eps8 phosphorylation. Thus, it will be necessary to directly test if Eps8 is indeed phosphorylated in Erk-dependent fashion in A375 cells. Previously, 2D gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menna et al., 2009</xref>) was applied to provide evidence that Eps8 is indeed phosphorylated in an Erk-dependent fashion following BDNF stimulation of neurons. A similar approach might be employed here by comparing untreated A375 cells and A375 cells treated with Erk inhibitor.</p><p>3) The mechanism by which Eps8 is recruited to small blebs in 'non-confined' cells and/or to the leader bleb in 'confined' cells remains elusive. Is this because Erk is also concentrated to the leader bleb or does Eps8 just follow F-actin (or some actin-associated protein such as ezrin)? The authors should at minimum discuss this in the manuscript (unless there are no easy experiments that could be performed to address this issue).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08314.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The entire dataset was generated by using A375 melanoma cells.

We performed experiments in human osteosarcoma U20S cells that are deleted for the cell cycle regulatory gene CDKN2A, and human lung cancer A549 cells, which are known to harbor the K-Ras G12S oncogene. siRNA depletions and rescues performed with Emerald tagged mouse Eps8 were performed in these cells lines, and we quantified leader bleb area and percent of cells that are migratory under non-adhesive confinement. The quantitative data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and images of cells are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>. The results of these experiments indicate, first, that Walker and A549 cells undergo a morphological transition to a leader bleb morphology and exhibit leader bleb-based migration when confined against a non-adhesive coverslip under agar, and second, that normal expression level of Eps8 is required for this behavior. This demonstrates that our findings are not specific to melanoma or a single cell line, but are a more general property of cancer cells. We have added a new paragraph describing these experiments and their results in the Results section as follows: “We then sought to determine whether the requirement for Eps8 […] independent of the defect driving transformation.”</p><p>We have also added the following to the Discussion: “The Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk pathway […] lead to Eps8-dependent bleb-based migration.”</p><p><italic>2) The authors assumed that Eps8 is phosphorylated in an Erk-dependent fashion in A375 cells, but there were no experiments to directly demonstrate this.

As our lab is not expert in 2D gel electrophoresis, we chose to examine the effect of the Erk inhibitor U0126 on the level of serine and threonine phosphorylation (pS/T) in Eps8 constructs immunoprecipitated from A375 cells by western blot. The results of these experiments are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and clearly demonstrate that under normal conditions pS/T level is high for immunoprecipitated wild type Emerald-tagged Eps8, while treatment with U0126 abolished Erk phosphorylation on T202/Y204 in cell lysates, and reduced pS/T level in immunoprecipitated Eps8. We have added a new paragraph to the Results section that describes these experiments, the results, and conclusions (“We first exploited the highly specific inhibitor U0126 […] blocks Erk-mediated Eps8 phosphorylation.”).</p><p><italic>3) The mechanism by which Eps8 is recruited to small blebs in 'non-confined' cells and/or to the leader bleb in 'confined' cells remains elusive.

The authors should at minimum discuss this in the manuscript (unless there are no easy experiments that could be performed to address this issue)</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the mechanism of Eps8 recruitment to the cortex is an important question. First of all, we show in the manuscript that Erk is soluble and not localized to the membrane or concentrated in the leader bleb. Regarding whether Eps8 is recruited to the cortex by ezrin or actin, we had performed a few experiments to begin to address this prior to the first submission, and had begun to find that it is not as simple as one might expect based on the literature. Indeed, we are very interested in teasing this out, but feel that it is beyond the scope of the current study, and thus we choose to leave this question for the future. However, for the sake of the reviewers, we will describe the results of our preliminary experiments here.</p><p>First, we sought to determine the role of the ezrin-Eps8 interaction in recruitment of Eps8 to the bleb cortex. We utilized the ezrin Y477F mutant previously reported to disrupt the ezrin-Eps8 interaction in gut epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zwaenepoel et al., 2012</xref>). We found that this mutant had no apparent effect on Eps8 localization to the cortex, but surprisingly we found that this mutant still immunoprecipitated with Eps8 from A375 lysates, similar to wild-type ezrin. Thus, within the context of leader bleb-based migration in cancer cells, a more detailed study will be required to understand the significance of the Ezrin-Eps8 interaction.</p><p>Second, we sought to determine the role of the Eps8-actin interaction in recruitment of Eps8 to the bleb cortex. We made the quadruple mutant L757A/K759A/V689D/L693D to inhibit both the capping and bundling activities of Eps8 (Δbund/Δcap). We tested whether these mutations affected the ability of Eps8 to bind to ezrin, and found that they had no effect on the ability of Eps8 to co-IP with ezrin. When we expressed the mutant in cells, we found that it exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic localization and did not concentrate on the cortex. These are interesting preliminary results suggesting that Eps8 may be recruited to the cortex by binding directly to actin, however whether this is through ezrin is not possible to rule out. In the text, we state: “Our demonstration the Eps8 localizes to bleb membranes on a similar timescale as ezrin suggests that their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zwaenepoel et al., 2012</xref>) may be critical to Eps8 cortical recruitment.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
