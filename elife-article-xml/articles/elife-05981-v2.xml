rhodopsin. Timely rhodopsin desensitization depends on phosphorylation and arrestin binding, which quenches G protein activation. Rhodopsin phosphorylation has been measured biochemically at C-terminal serine residues, suggesting that these residues are critical for producing fast, low-noise responses. The role of native threonine residues is unclear. We compared single-photon responses from rhodopsin lacking native serine or threonine phosphorylation sites. Contrary to expectation, serine-only rhodopsin generated prolonged step-like single-photon responses that terminated abruptly and randomly, whereas threonine-only rhodopsin generated responses that were only modestly slower than normal. We show that the step-like responses of serine-only rhodopsin reflect slow and stochastic arrestin binding. Thus, threonine sites play a privileged role in promoting timely arrestin binding and rhodopsin desensitization. Similar coordination of phosphorylation and arrestin binding may more generally permit tight control of the duration of GPCR activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05981.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05981.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05981.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>‘Rod’ cells in the eye enable us to see in starlight. Inside these cells, a protein called rhodopsin is activated by light, which leads to an electrical signal being produced that travels to the brain. The duration of the electrical signal depends on the time it takes for the rhodopsin to be deactivated. Rhodopsin is a member of a large class of receptor proteins known as G protein-coupled receptors that regulate many processes throughout the body.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that rhodopsin is deactivated by the attachment of phosphate groups to the protein. This allows another protein called arrestin to bind to rhodopsin. The phosphates can be attached to particular amino acids—the building blocks of proteins—at one end of rhodopsin. Three of these are a type of amino acid called serine. Previous work has shown that light increases the speed at which phosphate groups are added to these serines, suggesting that they are important for producing rapid electrical signals. The other three amino acids are of a different type—called threonine—but it is less clear what role they play in deactivating rhodopsin.</p><p>Here, Azevedo et al. studied mutant forms of rhodopsin that were missing the serines or threonines in mice. The experiments show that loss of the serines only slightly slowed the electrical signals. However, loss of the threonines resulted in much slower electrical signals that ended at random times. This was due to rhodopsin being less able to bind to arrestin.</p><p>Azevedo et al. propose a new model for how rhodopsin is deactivated. Once light activates the protein, phosphate groups are rapidly added to the serines, which begins to lower the activity of rhodopsin. However, it is the slower addition of phosphates to the threonines that is essential to promote arrestin binding and fully deactivate the protein. Other proteins belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor family also have these serines and threonines, and thus, may be regulated in a similar way.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

(GPCRs) mediate an array of cellular responses with widely divergent kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lefkowitz and Shenoy, 2005</xref>). This diversity originates in part from differences in the processes controlling GPCR activity, which influence the duration and extent to which downstream pathways are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeWire et al., 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, all but a few GPCRs desensitize through a common set of reactions: phosphorylation by G protein receptor kinases (GRKs) followed by the binding of arrestin. Interestingly, the &gt;800 GPCRs expressed by humans are desensitized by only 7 GRKs and 4 arrestins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilden et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lohse et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pitcher et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2004</xref>). Given this apparent conservation of the desensitization reactions, how is diversity in GPCR lifetime achieved?</p><p>GPCR C-termini, where the desensitization reactions take place, typically have multiple possible phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krupnick and Benovic, 1998</xref>). Biochemical experiments indicate that some sites are more rapidly phosphorylated than others, for example, serine sites appear to be preferred in the case of the photopigment rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kennedy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maeda, 2003</xref>). The pattern of phosphorylation sites can control the effect of arrestin binding on the receptor, that is, whether arrestin promotes receptor desensitization or internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Key et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ren et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butcher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>). The variety of patterns exhibited by different GPCRs has been compared to identification by different bar codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tobin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobles et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that, similarly, the pattern of phosphorylation sites may determine the active receptor lifetime, and hence the duration of the resulting signals.</p><p>Desensitization of the photopigment rhodopsin provides a unique opportunity to study GPCR desensitization because the signal produced by the activation of a single GPCR can be measured directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baylor et al., 1979</xref>). Furthermore, past work characterizing responses produced by the activation of single rhodopsin molecules has identified an unexpected property of how this GPCR desensitizes: the signals produced by single rhodopsin activations vary much less than expected from other familiar signals controlled by single molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baylor et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rieke and Baylor, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Whitlock and Lamb, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Field and Rieke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doan et al., 2006</xref>). This low variability requires precise control of the timing of rhodopsin desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doan et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2009</xref>). In particular, phosphorylation and arrestin binding need to work in a coordinated fashion so as to minimize brief rhodopsin activations produced by too rapid arrestin binding and long rhodopsin activations produced by too slow arrestin binding. How the required coordination between phosphorylation and arrestin binding works is unclear.</p><p>Here, we compare the roles of native serine and threonine sites in rhodopsin desensitization. Our experiments reveal an unexpected specificity of these reactions that underlies the tight coordination of phosphorylation and arrestin binding. Namely, native serine sites are phosphorylated rapidly and begin to lower rhodopsin's catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ohguro et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kennedy et al., 2001</xref>), but serine phosphorylation only weakly promotes arrestin binding; native threonine sites are phosphorylated more slowly but are essential to promote rapid arrestin binding. This coordination produces an orderly sequence of desensitization events and contributes to the precise control of rhodopsin's active lifetime. A similar interplay of serine and threonine sites may be an important general mechanism tuning the kinetics of arrestin binding and GPCR desensitization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The results are organized as follows. First, we show that single-photon responses (SPRs) from wild-type (WT), serine-only, and threonine-only rhodopsin differ substantially. Second, we show that, despite the large differences in responses, arrestin binding and receptor phosphorylation remain the critical reactions that desensitize the mutant receptors. Third, we show that the slow step-like responses generated by serine-only rhodopsin can be attributed to slow arrestin binding. Finally, we use the prolonged responses of serine-only rhodopsin to compare the kinetics of downstream steps in the transduction cascade with those of rhodopsin desensitization.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Serine-only rhodopsin produces prolonged SPRs</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> depicts the canonical molecules and reactions responsible for GPCR desensitization.

The flash strength was adjusted such that rods failed to respond to a majority of the flashes (‘failures’) but occasionally produced a quantized response. We used quantal analysis to isolate responses produced by the absorption of single photons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–G</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for isolation procedure). Average SPRs elicited by each type of rhodopsin differed, particularly in recovery kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, bottom). Time-to-peak and peak amplitude were not significantly different across rhodopsin types (p &gt; 0.14, Kruskal–Wallis test, corrected for multiple comparisons).</p><p>Individual responses to single rhodopsin activations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–G</xref>) reveal several features not apparent in the averages. In particular, T → A rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) produced responses that plateau and then terminate abruptly. Overlaying all SPRs gathered from a rod illustrates the extent of this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>); whereas responses elicited by Rho or S → A rhodopsin follow similar trajectories, the T → A responses plateau to a common level before terminating at random times. This gives rise to two bands, an upper one that thins over time as responses decay, and a lower one that collects the responses as they terminate. Thus, removal of serine vs threonine sites has quite different effects on SPR variability. Below, we characterize these differences to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Removing serine and threonine sites increases response variability</title><p>We first estimated the duration of each response by determining the time at which the response terminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, insets).

The pooled distributions are plotted below. Spread in the measurement is dominated by real variation in response duration across strains, as shown by two measures. First, the distributions are wider than the jitter produced by noise in the algorithm (see ‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>-bottom, gray dots). Second, the distributions of response durations for individual cells of a given strain more closely resemble the pooled distributions for that strain than those of a different strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The response duration distributions do illustrate an overlap in response properties across strains, for example, the briefest T → A responses are similar to Rho responses both in kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>) and duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

SPRs followed a consistent initial trajectory and then began to diverge near the time at which the mean response peaked. For all rhodopsin types, the variance peaked after the peak of the mean response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). This late peak of the variance reflects the fact that the rising phase and peak amplitude of the response vary little compared to the falling phase. The T → A mutant is an extreme case of this effect: the peak in the variance of the T → A responses coincides with the point at which approximately half of the responses have returned to baseline (2.9 s, compare to median duration 2.7 s in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This correspondence between the median response duration and the time at which the variance peaks is expected for a first-order decay process in which response duration is determined by a single stochastic step. Thus, the time course of the variance suggests that a single desensitization step is greatly prolonged for T → A rhodopsin.</p><p>Total response variability was quantified using the coefficient of variation (SD/mean) of the integrated SPRs, that is, the coefficient of variation of the response areas (CV<sub>area</sub>). This measure is insensitive to whether rhodopsin desensitization is fast or slow relative to the kinetics of downstream steps in the transduction cascade, whereas the variability of the response at a given time (e.g., the peak) depends on the underlying kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamer et al., 2003</xref>). The variance of the areas of the SPRs was corrected for the variance of the failures and then used to compute CV<sub>area</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doan et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2009</xref>). CV<sub>area</sub> for WT rods (0.37 ± 0.02) was comparable to that found previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doan et al., 2006</xref>). Responses of S → A rods had increased variability (CV<sub>area</sub> = 0.51 ± 0.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>); this increase in CV<sub>area</sub> is quantitatively consistent with a model in which total WT rhodopsin activity is controlled by a series of ∼7 kinetic steps, 3 of which have been removed in S → A rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doan et al., 2006</xref>). By comparison, the measured increase in variability is greater than that predicted by models that posit that non-linear amplification of the receptor activity contributes substantially to low-response variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caruso et al., 2011</xref>, their table S6).</p><p>The CV<sub>area</sub> for the T → A responses (0.78 ± 0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) was much higher, consistent with a strong disruption of the normally reproducible timing of rhodopsin desensitization. The different effects of removing threonines and serines were not predicted by previous models of rhodopsin desensitization; instead each kinetic step was assumed to represent identical or at least equivalent biochemical events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rieke and Baylor, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doan et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Thus, transgenic expression of phosphorylation site mutants produces SPRs with several salient features. S → A rods have longer and more variable single photon-responses than WT rods. T → A rods have much longer and dramatically more variable responses, which exhibit a characteristic plateau followed by an abrupt recovery; variability in the duration of this plateau suggests that a single step dominates the time course of desensitization of T → A rhodopsin. The dependence of the kinetics and variability of the response on both serine and threonine sites indicates that they play distinct roles in controlling rhodopsin desensitization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Desensitization of rhodopsin mutants requires phosphorylation and arrestin-1 binding</title><p>Do changes in the time course of responses produced by the mutant rhodopsins indicate desensitization through non-canonical mechanisms?

We next probed the mechanisms responsible for the slowed response kinetics in S → A rods and the abrupt cessation of T → A responses.</p><p>We hypothesized that the step-like T → A responses are terminated by the sudden desensitization of the GPCR via either abrupt phosphorylation or arrestin-1 binding. Phosphorylation consists of GRK1 binding and phosphate attachment, both of which can contribute to the rate of desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doan et al., 2009</xref>). Arrestin-1 serves both to quench rhodopsin activity and to modify the GRK1-binding rate by competing with GRK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doan et al., 2009</xref>). The long duration of the T → A responses suggests that GRK1 binding, phosphate attachment, or arrestin-1 binding is substantially slowed and limits the desensitization rate. We distinguished among these possibilities in both T → A and S → A rods by lowering separately the GRK1 or arrestin-1 concentration. If GRK1 binding is rate limiting, lowering the GRK1 but not the arrestin-1 concentration should further slow the responses. If arrestin-1 binding is rate limiting, lowering the arrestin-1 but not the GRK1 concentration should slow the responses. If phosphate attachment by bound GRK1 is rate limiting, the responses should be insensitive to lowering GRK1 and arrestin-1 concentrations.</p><p>We genetically lowered the concentrations of arrestin-1 or GRK1 in S → A rods by crossing S → A mice with either <italic>GRK1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>/<italic>Rho</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice or <italic>Arr1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>/<italic>Rho</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice to produce heterozygous strains that express less GRK1 or arrestin-1. Western blots confirmed reduced concentrations of arrestin-1 and GRK1 (data not shown).

Reduced GRK1 expression similarly did not noticeably change SPR kinetics or durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>).

In another hypothetical regime, rhodopsin desensitizes slowly compared to the rate of G protein decay such that the kinetics of the response recovery reflects the rate at which rhodopsin desensitizes.

First, the fastest response decay has a time constant ∼200 ms, similar to previous measurements of the rate of the G protein's GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krispel et al., 2006</xref>). Three types of responses share this fast decay: (1) all termination-aligned responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>); (2) the briefest flash-aligned responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>; 0.5 s bin); and (3) the longest flash-aligned responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>; 4 s bin). Flash-aligned traces of intermediate kinetics have substantially slower decay time constants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, τ<sub>flash</sub>; bins between 1 s and 3 s).

The slower recovery of flash-aligned, intermediate-duration WT responses is consistent with a combination of slower rhodopsin desensitization and G protein decay. This effect is clear in the T → A responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), where the slow decay of the average response reflects the long and variable response plateau; the analysis here indicates a similar picture that applies to WT responses.</p><p>To noticeably impact the recovery kinetics, rhodopsin must desensitize with comparable or slower kinetics than G protein decay. Consistent with this suggestion, the dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,D</xref> plot the decay time constant when all WT SPRs are averaged, the typical measure of the recovery time constant. The time constant of this average response is considerably slower than the fastest recovery time constants of the binned responses. Thus, our data support a model in which stochastic rhodopsin desensitization occasionally occurs quickly, such that the transduction cascade kinetics dominate the response kinetics, but desensitization often occurs more slowly and influences response kinetics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The importance of phosphorylation and arrestin binding for GPCR desensitization has been appreciated for several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stadel et al., 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilden and Kühn, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kühn et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maeda, 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, we lack a clear understanding of how these mechanisms support the observed diversity in GPCR signaling. Here, we investigated the role of different C-terminus phosphorylation sites in rhodopsin desensitization. We found that phosphorylation of native serines is rapid but ineffective in promoting rapid arrestin-1 binding. Phosphorylation of native threonines is slow but effective in promoting rapid arrestin-1 binding. Together, these properties ensure not only that several phosphorylation steps will complete before arrestin-1 will bind but also that after these steps complete, arrestin-1 will bind rapidly. These results challenge assumptions about the relative importance of serine and threonine sites and show how phosphorylation and arrestin binding can act in concert to tightly control the timing of rhodopsin desensitization.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Asymmetric roles of serine and threonine residues in rapid GPCR desensitization</title><p>An important concept for understanding desensitization reactions has been that accumulation of local charge at the C-terminus triggers arrestin activation and binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, normal arrestin-1 binding was not recapitulated in vitro by substituting charged residues for native phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ascano and Robinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ascano et al., 2006</xref>). Our results show that the precise residues at which charge accumulates have distinct mechanistic impacts on the desensitization process—further supporting the idea that specific residues and their phosphorylation are required.</p><p>Removal of C-terminal threonine sites (T → A) compromised arrestin-1 binding and dramatically prolonged SPRs. However, rhodopsin with only three serine sites remaining (T → A) recovered with a mean duration of ∼4 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), more than five times faster than responses from rhodopsin with only two serine sites remaining (S334/S338) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doan et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the addition of a single serine (at position 343) substantially speeds the response, likely because of faster arrestin-1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vishnivetskiy et al., 2007</xref>). This suggests that serine sites promote arrestin-1 binding, albeit much less effectively than threonine sites.</p><p>Removal of native C-terminal serine residues (S → A) modestly slowed SPRs and increased their variability. The kinetics of responses generated by threonine-only rhodopsin were insensitive to reducing the concentration of either GRK1 or arrestin-1. This behavior differs from the clear sensitivity of WT SPRs to reductions in either GRK1 or arrestin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doan et al., 2009</xref>). Among the reactions controlling rhodopsin desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), only the rate of phosphate attachment is insensitive to GRK1 and arrestin-1 concentration. Hence, the rate of desensitization of threonine-only rhodopsin appears to be limited by phosphate attachment by bound GRK1 rather than GRK1 or arrestin-1 binding. This is consistent with biochemical experiments indicating that threonine sites are more slowly phosphorylated than serine sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ohguro et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kennedy et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Comparison with biochemical studies of phosphorylation</title><p>Biochemical experiments implicate serines as preferred phosphorylation sites for rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ohguro et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kennedy et al., 2001</xref>). This work has led to a model in which rhodopsin is phosphorylated sequentially, beginning with the distal most serine (S343), where the C-terminus is most mobile and likely to encounter GRK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langen et al., 1999</xref>) and proceeding toward the most proximal site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kennedy et al., 2001</xref>). More recent experiments have detected threonine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vishnivetskiy et al., 2007</xref>), particularly in the absence of serine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendez et al., 2000</xref>). The isoelectric-focusing experiments described here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) are consistent with a preference for serine over threonine phosphorylation.</p><p>Rapidity of phosphorylation, however, need not equate with rapid arrestin binding. Several additional lines of evidence show that threonine phosphorylation preferentially promotes arrestin-1 binding. Maximizing the affinity of arrestin-1 binding has been found to require four or more phosphates, suggesting that phosphorylation of at least one threonine is necessary for normal desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vishnivetskiy et al., 2007</xref>). It also appears that regardless of where threonines are located in the C-terminal sequence, their presence leads to comparable degrees of receptor quenching in a cell-free assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brannock et al., 1999</xref>). Other GPCRs can function in a similar manner: the somatostatin subtype 2A receptor is phosphorylated at serine sites to a greater extent than at threonine sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hipkin et al., 1997</xref>), but threonine phosphorylation is required for normal desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the asymmetric role of threonine and serine sites may be a general mechanism tuning the affinity and binding kinetics of arrestin, controlling timely and reproducible desensitization of GPCR activity, and determining which intracellular pathways are activated.</p><p>Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the interactions between GPCRs and arrestin at the protein structure level. Our findings suggest that threonines play a privileged role in these interactions. Arrestins are composed of a C-domain and an N-domain, connected by a 12-residue ‘hinge’ region. These two domains are normally held fixed by the interaction of the arrestin C-terminus with the N-domain and the polar core, a network of charges paradoxically buried within the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Granzin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirsch et al., 1999</xref>). The phosphorylated C-terminus of the GPCR is suspected to disrupt the polar core, freeing the C-terminus and gate loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirsch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2004</xref>). Once free, arrestin's N-domain rotates relative to the C-domain, changing the relative positions of loops that form the receptor-binding interface, and perhaps permitting more dynamic movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shukla et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhuang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vishnivetskiy et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2014</xref>). In the context of this model, our results suggest that rhodopsin's native threonine sites more readily interact with arrestin's polar core to ‘activate’ arrestin. Other recent evidence points to arrestin's ‘139 loop’ as a critical mediator of selectivity for phosphorylated rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vishnivetskiy et al., 2013a</xref>). A crystal structure of arrestin-2 (β-arrestin-1) together with a phosphorylated C-terminus peptide from the V2R receptor shows that a critical lysine in the ‘middle loop’ (139 loop) is coordinated with a phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shukla et al., 2013</xref>). In this model, our data indicate that the arrangement of rhodopsin's C-terminal phosphorylation sites is important for this interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Reproducibility of the SPR</title><p>Most signals controlled by single molecules exhibit large trial-to-trial variability. Familiar examples are the charge flowing through an ion channel during a single opening and the time-to-decay of a radioactive particle. In these examples, variability results from stochastic fluctuations in the active lifetime of the molecule responsible. SPRs generated by vertebrate rods vary much less than expected from simple stochastic models for single molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baylor et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rieke and Baylor, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Whitlock and Lamb, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Field and Rieke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doan et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gross et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the effective lifetime of rhodopsin's catalytic activity appears to be tightly regulated.</p><p>While tight regulation is required to explain low variability in rhodopsin's lifetime, this does not constrain the average kinetics of rhodopsin desensitization. Rhodopsin's effective lifetime in mouse rods has been a matter of debate: some studies support fast rhodopsin desensitization, such that G protein decay determines the rate of response recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krispel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gross and Burns, 2010</xref>). In this case, variability in the timing of rhodopsin desensitization produces variable amplitude SPRs, with less variability in response time course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gross et al., 2012</xref>). Other studies find that the rate of rhodopsin desensitization is sufficiently slow to affect the rate of response recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doan et al., 2009</xref>). In this case, the time course of the SPRs will also vary. The different observations across studies appear to be due in part to differences in experimental conditions and the physiological state of the rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo and Rieke, 2011</xref>). The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> indicate that, under our experimental conditions, rhodopsin activity is occasionally short-lived but often persists sufficiently long to shape the SPRs (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baylor et al., 1984</xref>). This suggests that on average the kinetics of rhodopsin desensitization are closely matched to the kinetics of the transduction cascade.</p><p>In principle, low variability, or reproducibility, of the SPR can be achieved by having multiple steps in rhodopsin desensitization; averaging across kinetic steps reduces variability in rhodopsin's cumulative activity, and hence, in the SPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rieke and Baylor, 1998</xref>). Assuming that the transduction cascade acts linearly to convert rhodopsin activity to changes in current, replicating the measured low variability of the response requires 6–7 steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doan et al., 2006</xref>). Non-linearities in the transduction process could reduce the number of steps required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bisegna et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gross et al., 2012</xref>); nonetheless, a shared feature of all current explanations for reproducibility is that multiple events must work in a concerted fashion to control rhodopsin desensitization. In particular, arrestin-1 binding must be coordinated with phosphorylation so that it does not occur too quickly or too slowly.</p><p>Our results here provide a clearer biophysical picture for how such coordination could occur: serine sites are phosphorylated rapidly and begin to reduce rhodopsin's catalytic activity, but phosphorylation of serines is ineffective in promoting rapid arrestin-1 binding; threonine sites are phosphorylated more slowly, but promote rapid arrestin-1 binding. This model predicts few short-lived rhodopsin activations, since arrestin-1 would rarely bind until most of the C-terminus sites had been phosphorylated. Similarly, the model predicts few long-lived active molecules since arrestin-1 binds rapidly once threonine sites are phosphorylated. Thus, the different roles of C-terminus serine and threonine phosphorylation sites appear to ensure that the first events in vision produce low-noise quantal signals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse transgenesis and breeding</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care at the University of Washington.

The BspEI-PacI fragment including the coding region of the C-terminus was excised and mutagenized by PCR (Qiagen) to encode alanines in place of either all three serines (Tg(Rho<sup>S334A/S338A/S343A</sup>) or S → A) or all three threonines (Tg(Rho<sup>T336A/T340A/T342A</sup>) or T → A). In addition, the mutagenized PCR product encoded both the mutation A337V to produce a linear epitope for mAb 3A6, which recognizes the bovine rhodopsin C-teminus and silent EagI sites for genotyping by Southern blot.

Several factors could contribute to these different findings. First, we regenerated the S → A strain, beginning with the purification of the original constructs, thus, potentially altering rhodopsin expression, rod morphology, and response kinetics. Second, the electrical recordings were carried out using different tissue storage and culture media, factors that have been shown to have a large effect on SPR amplitude and kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo and Rieke, 2011</xref>). Indeed, when we replicated a subset of experiments using conditions similar to those used previously, we found larger differences in S → A and Rho responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed in MATLAB (Mathworks). Isolation of singles involved three steps: determining whether, on a given trial, the flash elicited zero, one or more rhodopsin isomerizations; determining when thermal events occurred; and linking responses that occasionally stretched across epochs.</p><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Field and Rieke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doan et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2009</xref>), each trial was assigned a whole number value (0, 1, or 2) that indicated whether the flash produced a ‘failure’, a ‘single’, or the response to multiple rhodopsin isomerizations. In brief, classification of responses was based on the correlation of each trial with the average response. These correlations across flashes were fit with a model that identified the most likely number of rhodopsin isomerizations for each individual response. All cells retained for analysis had a clear distinction between failures and singles, with a probability of misclassifying a failure as a single of &lt;1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Thermal activation of rhodopsin produces current responses identical to those produced by the absorption of a photon, though almost never at the time of the flash. We removed these trials to the extent possible by filtering the measure current records with the average response and looking for events that were within one standard deviation of the amplitude of the SPR.</p><p>Software limitations prevented continuous recording of long events in the T → A rods. Additional errors arose when a noise event towards the end of one trial continued to the next and interfered with the response in that trial. Thus, we linked trials containing responses that spanned the inter-trial interval and eliminated trials that did not start at baseline due to previous noise events.</p><p>One measure used to quantify responses was the distribution of response durations. We estimated the response duration using an algorithm developed to measure transition times of single-channel currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Draber and Schultze, 1994</xref>). Briefly, histograms of current values across SPRs in a given cell typically exhibited two peaks, one centered around 0 pA and another at ∼1 pA where the responses plateau, which approximate a ‘down state’ and an ‘up state’, respectively. Transitions from the up to down state were identified based on a transition parameter that depended on the baseline noise. Noise could cause the algorithm to detect multiple transitions, so we required the downstate to persist for at least 300 ms. Transitions were typically detected at a point before the response returned to baseline, so the response was deemed to end when the current dropped below the average of points in a 100-ms window following the identified transition time.</p><p>The accuracy of the response duration estimate is impacted by the extent to which baseline noise corrupts the estimate of the downward transition. This effect can be measured by adding the average SPR to the time course of trials identified as failures, and measuring the durations, which will vary only as a result of noise (shown as dotted gray line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>-bottom). Fifty failures from each WT rod make up this distribution in an attempt to represent the full range of baseline noise effects.</p><p>The duration algorithm detected the point when the response dropped below a threshold, which usually occurred when the noise caused a downward swing. Aligning the responses to the end points caused noise in multiple traces to become correlated, confounding our estimate of the recovery time constant. To avoid this effect, we averaged noise trials aligned to concocted end points, identified as above, which suffered the same correlation effect. The noise trace was then subtracted from the aligned singles to eliminate the coherent-noise effect and produce a smooth average falling phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This procedure did not inherently produce fast time constants as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, because when the average SPR was added to noise trials, the falling phase of the end-aligned simulated responses had a time constant of 307 ms, similar to that of the average SPR (data not shown).

The protein sequence was truncated at residue 535, followed by the sequence VDHHHHH to allow for purification by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA chromotography. Phosphorylation reactions were carried out in kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM Dithiothreitol or DTT, 0.5 mM ATP), with rhodopsin (0.6 μM), 11-cis retinal (3.75 μM), and GRK1 (1.6 μM) for 30 min at 22°C under constant illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vishnivetskiy et al., 2013b</xref>). In vitro transcription and translation of radio-labeled murine arrestin-1 was carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gurevich and Benovic, 1993</xref>). For the arrestin-binding assay, radio-labeled arrestin-1 (2 nM) was incubated with 0.3 μg of rhodopsin in 50-μl buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) for 5 min at 30°C, under room illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vishnivetskiy et al., 2007</xref>). The samples were cooled and bound arrestin-1 was separated from free arrestin-1 on Sephadex G-100 columns at 4°C. Arrestin-1 binding was quantified by liquid scintillation counting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blot and protein expression quantification</title><p>Retinal proteins from WT mice and heterozygous knock-out mice were separated on 4–15% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes. Membranes after blocking with 5% milk were probed with anti-arrestin and anti-β-tubulin polyclonal antibodies (NE Biolabs) with subsequent treatment with alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Signals from developed Western blots were evaluated by scanning densitometry using ImageJ software, and results were determined as background-corrected absorbance units.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the UW Transgenic Core and Dr Bryce Sopher for help generating the transgenic mice, and Dr Jane Sullivan for reagents and assistance; Richard Ahlquist for managing the mouse colony; Dan Possin, Jing Huang, and Ed Parker of the UW Vision Imaging Module (EY01730) for technical assistance; and Dr Rachel Wong for guidance in imaging photoreceptors.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors present a thorough electrophysiological and biochemical analysis of the kinetics of rhodopsin desensitization in genetically altered mice in which C terminal serines and threonines of rhodopsin are removed (S &gt; A or T &gt; A). The primary observation is that serine-only Rhodopsin gives rise to long duration highly variable quantal responses, whereas the kinetics of quantal responses for threonine-only Rhodopsin shows only modest alteration. The results further indicate that phosphorylation of serines is rapid compared to threonines but that arrestin binding is rapid only after thereonine phosphorylation.</p><p>The authors develop a model that posits that serine sites are phosphorylated rapidly, but these events are ineffective in promoting rapid arrestin binding; threonine sites are phosphorylated more slowly, but promote rapid arrestin binding. This model predicts tight control of the duration of quantal light responses thus ensuring that the first events in vision produce low-noise quantal signals.</p><p>The paper is well written and the logical flow is very clear. The data set is extensive and well-illustrated. The findings should be of wide general interest as they impact our understanding of desensitization of all GPCRs.</p><p>Consensus concerns:</p><p>1) The paper is highly technical in many aspects and contains much in the way of supplemental data. Important aspects of the supplemental data should be incorporated into the text for clarity and flow (e.g. Figure 2–figure supplement 4; Figure 3–figure supplement 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>2) There is real concern about expression levels in the mutants used. The authors remade StoA mutant strain, probably as a control to their TtoA mutant mice. Because Rhodopsin level determines response sensitivity, kinetics, and rods' health, it is disappointing that expression level and homogeneity of expression are not characterized. The StoA mutant probably express too many Rhodopsins as the “combo” breeding scheme resulted in “few visible rods”, indicative of unhealthy rods undergoing substantial degeneration at time of analysis. This is really the biggest caveat with the work and interpretation, because the data is interpreted that threonine phosphorylation is slow but triggers quick arrestin binding, while serine phosphorylation is fast but inefficient in triggering arrestin binding, a claim that must be supported by sufficient biochemical characterization of StoA mutant mice.</p><p>3) There is an on-going debate in the field regarding whether transducin's active lifetime or rhodopsin's active lifetime is the dominant time constant in the light-response's decay, with the senior author in the present paper leaning toward the latter. In this paper, the opposite viewpoint/finding by the other side of the debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krispel et al., 2006</xref>) is quote/utilized, but exactly how the current manuscript helps in resolving this puzzle is not clearly spelled out. The sentence “Replicating the measure low variability […] suggests that many of the steps are provided by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doan et al., 2006</xref>)” (in the subsection “Reproducibility of the single photon response”) is simply too short to deal with this point (see also above).

I don't understand why the authors ignore this very simple concept. In this MS, R* deactivation is of course a deciding factor because they deliberately slowed it down by making StoA and TtoA mutations, so now variability of R* deactivation, confounded in this work by degeneration issue and transgenic expression level, shows up in response duration and kinetics.”</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05981.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The paper is highly technical in many aspects and contains much in the way of supplemental data.

We have now added and/or highlighted three controls indicating that neither rhodopsin expression level nor possible compensatory changes in transduction cascade components are key factors in the results we report.</p><p>First, we have measured the collecting areas of recorded StoA rods, which provide an accurate measure of total rhodopsin content; these experiments are reported in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We prefer this measure to biochemical assays because it is made specifically on those rods that we select for physiological recordings rather than providing an average across all rods. Collecting areas are ∼1.3x larger in StoA compared to WT rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-C</xref>). The increase in collecting area can be accounted for by the larger volume of StoA rods, such that StoA rhodopsin is expressed at similar concentrations as Rho in WT rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The change in outer segment volume is too small to account for differences between the light responses of StoA and TtoA rods and between WT and StoA rods, as now noted in the text (please see the subsection entitled “Response differences are not due to alterations in the transduction cascade”).</p><p>Second, we compared StoA and WT responses using both our typical recording conditions and those used for recordings from the original StoA strain (the original strain was no longer available). The differences we see from our new strain, when using comparable recording conditions, are similar to those seen in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mendez et al. (2000)</xref>. This is documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> and in the the subsection “Response differences are not due to alterations in the transduction cascade”. We also refer to our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo and Rieke, 2011</xref>) that explains in detail the reason we chose the recording conditions used in the paper.</p><p>Third, we have analyzed the recovery trajectories of the StoA responses using the same analysis previously included for TtoA and WT rods (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis shows that StoA responses, when aligned to their recovery times, terminate with near-identical trajctories as TtoA and WT responses. This similarity indicates that the underlying kinetics of the transduction cascade is very similar across all strains studied here. This similarity argues against compensatory changes in StoA rods that could explain their slower light responses.</p><p><italic>3) There is an on-going debate in the field regarding whether transducin's active lifetime or rhodopsin's active lifetime is the dominant time constant in the light-response's decay, with the senior author in the present paper leaning toward the latter. In this paper, the opposite viewpoint/finding by the other side of the debate (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35"><italic>Krispel et al., 2006</italic></xref><italic>) is quote/utilized, but exactly how the current manuscript helps in resolving this puzzle is not clearly spelled out. The sentence “Replicating the measure low variability […] suggests that many of the steps are provided by phosphorylation (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"><italic>Doan et al., 2006</italic></xref><italic>)” (in the subsection “Reproducibility of the single photon response”) is simply too short to deal with this point (see also above). This important issue should be elaborated more</italic>.</p><p>Thank you. We have expanded the description of the experiments describing the recovery kinetics and their implications for rhodopsin’s lifetime both in the Results (“Rhodopsin desensitization and the transduction cascade have similar kinetics”) and in the Discussion (“Reproducibility of the single-photon response”). In brief, the trajectory of the final response recovery depends on the response duration, with the slowest final recovery trajectories occurring at intermediate response durations and the fastest final recoveries for the shortest and longest response durations. This dependence suggests that the final recovery trajectory is dominated by recovery of components of the transduction cascade downstream of rhodopsin (most likely transducin) for the shortest and longest duration responses, but that rhodopsin desensitization contributes to the recovery trajectory for intermediate duration responses. We hope this analysis and interpretation is now clear.</p><p><italic>Germane to this debate is a specific comment by one of the reviewers: “Under physiological condition(s), (the) rod single photon response is stereotypic because the recovery is governed not by the deactivation of one single R* molecule but by the average lifetime of many activated transducin, controlled by the level of GAP complex. I don't understand why the authors ignore this very simple concept.

The number of transducins activated should reflect rhodopsin’s active lifetime. Thus, trials in which rhodopsin is short-lived should produce fewer transducin activations than trials in which rhodopsin is long-lived. If the duration of rhodopsin’s activity is brief compared to the response, then variability in the number of transducins activated will produce variability in the response amplitude; the response time course, on the other hand, will vary little since it will be determined by transducin decay and hence reflect averaging across activated transducins. If the duration of rhodopsin’s activity is comparable to the response, then the resulting dispersion in times at which transducins are activated, together with variability in the number activated, will cause the response to vary in amplitude and in shape.</p><p>These issues are the reason why we use the response areas to quantify reproducibility: it captures both of these cases. Indeed, assuming the transduction cascade responds linearly and noiselessly to rhodopsin activity, the CV of the response areas is equal to the CV of the cumulative rhodopsin activity, independent of the relative lifetimes of rhodopsin and transducin. Variability associated with the finite number of transducins activated will only increase response variability and hence cause the CV of the response areas to underestimate reproducibility of rhodopsin itself. We have expanded our discussion of these issues in both the Results (“Removing serine and threonine sites increases response variability”) and Discussion (“Reproducibility of the single-photon response”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
