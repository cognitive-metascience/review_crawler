proteasome for degradation. We carried out a proteomic analysis of a B cell lymphoma-derived cell line, BJAB, that requires UBQLN1 for survival to identify UBQLN1 client proteins. When UBQLN1 expression was acutely inhibited, 120 mitochondrial proteins were enriched in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the accumulation of mitochondrial client proteins in the absence of UBQLN1 is cytostatic. Using a <italic>Ubqln1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse strain, we found that B cell receptor (BCR) ligation of <italic>Ubqln1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> B cells led to a defect in cell cycle entry. As in BJAB cells, mitochondrial proteins accumulated in BCR-stimulated cells, leading to protein synthesis inhibition and cell cycle block. Thus, UBQLN1 plays an important role in clearing mislocalized mitochondrial proteins upon cell stimulation, and its absence leads to suppression of protein synthesis and cell cycle arrest.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>B cell</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>ubiquilin</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>BCR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whiteley</surname><given-names>Alexandra M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01 DK098285</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulo</surname><given-names>Joao A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Harvard Brain Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Finley</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stimulation of cells with a mitochondria-depolarizing mitogen reveals a requirement for UBQLN1 expression in maintaining protein synthesis levels during cell cycle entry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The maintenance of optimal intracellular protein concentrations through regulated degradation is central to cellular homeostasis, and the proteasome mediates this process by recognizing ubiquitinated substrates and translocating them into its proteolytic core for degradation. Additional layers of control are added by the expression of ubiquitin receptors, which bind to the proteasome and regulate the degradation of client proteins. Ubiquilins (Ubqlns) belong to a family of UBL/UBA proteins that link proteasomes with ubiquitinated protein cargo through a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) that binds to the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elsasser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elsasser et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi et al., 2016</xref>) and a ubiquitin-binding domain (UBA) that is capable of binding mono- and polyubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Funakoshi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kleijnen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). While the UBA domain of Ubqlns appears to show limited specificity for particular ubiquitin linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), Ubqlns have one or more additional structural elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaye et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itakura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ford and Monteiro, 2006</xref>) that may direct the specificity of Ubqln-mediated protein degradation toward distinct client proteins. In yeast, the Ubqln ortholog <italic>DSK2 </italic> is required for proteasome-mediated degradation of a subset of polyubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Funakoshi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elsasser and Finley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lim et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with these studies in yeast, work on mammalian Ubqln proteins suggests a role in proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kleijnen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itakura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ford and Monteiro, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hjerpe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang and Monteiro, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stieren et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although the hypothesis that Ubqlns function to shuttle-specific proteins directly to protein degradation machinery has experimental support, the full repertoire of Ubqln client proteins, as well as the circumstances under which Ubqlns are required for their degradation, remain poorly understood. The prevailing theory of Ubqln function is that they assist in the degradation of aggregated or misfolded proteins through UBA domain and client ubiquitin chain interactions, with client protein specificity conferred by the central portions of Ubqln (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itakura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hjerpe et al., 2016</xref>). However, a comprehensive accounting for the proteins dependent on Ubqlns for their degradation, and of those which are pathological upon their accumulation, is lacking. This problem has previously been approached from two directions: by using ubiquitin as a marker of aggregated protein to identify the sensitive tissues and cells of Ubqln-deficient in vivo models, and by studying proteins that are known to aggregate and cause pathology in Ubqln-deficient model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hjerpe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stieren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">El Ayadi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ford and Monteiro, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Picher-Martel et al., 2015</xref>). By employing multiplexed proteomics on cells sensitive to UBQLN1 depletion, we now are able to determine the proteins that are dependent on UBQLN1 for their elimination in an unbiased fashion.</p><p>Recently, Itakura et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itakura et al., 2016</xref>) reported that UBQLN1 binds to a variety of mitochondrial transmembrane proteins and is necessary for the delivery of mislocalized mitochondrial proteins for proteasomal degradation. Membrane proteins that fail to be properly inserted into mitochondria due to defects or inefficiencies in the mitochondrial protein translocation machinery require UBQLN1 for their delivery to proteasomes. Under these conditions, the central portion of UBQLN1 is required to bind hydrophobic domains of mitochondrial proteins in order to promote their degradation via the proteasome.</p><p>However, Ubqln function is not limited to cytosolic aggregates and mitochondrial proteins: UBQLN1 also binds to the ER membrane protein Erasin, a membrane component of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lim et al., 2009</xref>), and Dsk2 binds to the E4 ubiquitin ligase UFD2, which transfers client proteins from CDC48 to the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Medicherla et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Richly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hänzelmann et al., 2010</xref>). UBQLN4 binds to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2013a</xref>) and colocalizes with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rothenberg et al., 2010</xref>) LC3, and the loss of Ubqln results in sensitivity to starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">N'Diaye et al., 2009b</xref>). In these systems, it appears that some Ubqlns may deliver ubiquitinated proteins to growing autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">N'Diaye et al., 2009a</xref>).</p><p>In addition to direct regulation of protein degradation via proteasomes and autophagy, Ubqlns have been indirectly linked to proteome stability through interactions with mTORc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu et al., 2002</xref>) and the calcium channel ORAI1 (30). Ubqlns also influence the signaling activity of TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biswas et al., 2011</xref>), and GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">N'Diaye et al., 2008</xref>). In these situations, it remains unclear whether the signaling activity of Ubqlns reflects an indirect effect of their role as proteasome receptors, or whether they play a distinct and non-proteolytic role in signal transduction.</p><p>Despite recent insight into UBQLN2’s role in diseases such as ALS-FTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hjerpe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang and Monteiro, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gorrie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Le et al., 2016</xref>), there is little understanding of how Ubqlns function in normal mammalian cell biology or physiology. To investigate this question, we examined <italic>UBQLN1</italic>, the most broadly expressed member of the Ubqln family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marín, 2014</xref>). Using a combination of targeted approaches and unbiased mass spectrometry analysis, we found that UBQLN1-deficient cells accumulate mislocalized mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol, leading to a loss in viability. To understand the importance of this function in normal physiology, we created and studied a <italic>Ubqln1</italic>-deficient mouse. In the absence of <italic>Ubqln1</italic>, there were abnormalities in B lymphocytes, including a decreased number of B1a B cells, which uniquely rely on BCR signaling for their self-renewal. <italic>Ubqln1</italic>-deficient B cells failed to proliferate in response to BCR ligation, a stimulus that uniquely depolarizes mitochondria, and accumulated mitochondrial proteins compared to their WT counterparts. <italic>Ubqln1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> B cells also did not increase the cell cycle proteins Cyclin D2 and Cyclin D3 normally after BCR ligation, which reflected a failure to upregulate protein synthesis, while protein synthesis downstream of other stimuli was still strongly upregulated. We hypothesize that a toxic combination of mitochondrial depolarization and defective protein degradation leads to the failure of protein synthesis upon stimulation of B cells via the BCR. Overall, these findings suggest that Ubqlns can serve as indirect regulators of protein synthesis and cell cycle progression, and highlight the sensitivity of stimulated cells to proteomes that have been perturbed as a consequence of mitochondrial depolarization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of <italic>UBQLN1</italic> leads to cytosolic accumulation of mitochondrial proteins</title><p>To generate a comprehensive understanding of the <italic>UBQLN1</italic>-regulated proteome, we used multiplexed proteomics of UBQLN1-depleted cells to identify proteins accumulated in the absence of <italic>UBQLN1</italic>. Doxycycline-inducible <italic>UBQLN1</italic>-targeted small hairpin RNAs were stably introduced into BJAB, a germinal center B cell diffuse large cell lymphoma (GCB DLBCL) cell line characterized by high expression of mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, including ATP5G1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">(Monti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brien et al., 2007</xref>). BJABs also exhibit tonic BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Young and Staudt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis et al., 2010</xref>), high AKT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pfeifer et al., 2013</xref>) and are sensitive to the loss of Cyclin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmitz et al., 2012</xref>) and c-MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pfeifer et al., 2013</xref>). After 48 hr of culture with doxycycline, BJABs expressing the <italic>UBQLN1</italic> shRNA construct had lost &gt;85% of UBQLN1 protein and roughly 35% of UBQLN2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Unlike other tested cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itakura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">N'Diaye et al., 2009b</xref>), BJAB survival and proliferation were profoundly sensitive to the loss of UBQLN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Loss of proliferation was due to depletion of UBQLN1, since the loss in cell proliferation was strongly correlated with the amount of UBQLN1 depletion for each shRNA tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> ), and the loss of proliferation was rapidly reversed upon removal of doxycycline from the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To determine the effect of UBQLN1 depletion on the proteome, we performed a TMT-MS3 analysis on isolated cytosol from BJAB cells expressing either <italic>UBQLN1</italic> or control shRNA. After 48 hr of dox induction, cytosolic proteins were isolated from cells and prepared for mass spectrometry. Then, triplicate samples from <italic>UBQLN1</italic> or control shRNA-expressing cells of three independent experiments were labeled with TMT reagents to allow for 6TMT multiplexing of the peptide libraries in one MS run. More than 5100 proteins were quantified, 1284 of which were significantly altered (p&lt;0.05 of a Student’s T test) between normal and Ubqln1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Confirming our results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, we found that both UBQLN1 and UBQLN2 were significantly depleted from BJABs expressing <italic>UBQLN1</italic> shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>DAVID pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2009</xref>) for the cellular compartment of proteins enriched by at least 2-fold upon UBQLN1 depletion (92 proteins) demonstrated a strong mitochondrial protein signature in the cytosol of UBQLN1-depleted cells, which was validated by cross-referencing our entire dataset with proteins annotated by Mitocarta 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calvo et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). All detected proteins were scored for their relative hydropathy using the GRAVY (GRand AVerage of HYdropathy) calculation, which divides the sum Kyte Doolittle hydropathy score for each amino acid by the length of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kyte and Doolittle, 1982</xref>). The GRAVY score for each protein was then plotted against the protein’s abundance in normal and UBQLN1-knockdown cytosol (see Materials and methods for details). We found an enrichment of hydrophobic proteins among those that accumulated in UBQLN1-depleted cytosol, many of which are known to be localized to the mitochondrion in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). None of the 12 mitochondrially encoded mitochondrial proteins were quantified in our dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), suggesting that the observed enrichment of mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol was not due to rupture of damaged mitochondria or to opening of the mitochondrial transition pore.

More recently, Ubqlns have been found to target mislocalized mitochondrial membrane proteins to the proteasome to be degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itakura et al., 2016</xref>). Presumably, this protects cells against the accumulation of hydrophobic proteins in the cytosol, where they could aggregate, bind non-specifically to membranes, or induce other cellular damage. Indeed, this role for Ubqlns may not be limited to mitochondrial membrane proteins, as UBQLN4 has recently been reported to have a general role in degradation of mislocalized tail-anchored proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suzuki and Kawahara, 2016</xref>) and UBQLN2 in the degradation of aggregation-prone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hjerpe et al., 2016</xref>). To discover how these potential roles for Ubqlns affected normal cell functions in vivo, we generated a cell line and mice deficient in <italic>Ubqln1</italic>, the most broadly and highly expressed member of the Ubqln family. The loss of <italic>UBQLN1</italic> from the BJAB B-cell lymphoma led to a rapid but reversible loss of proliferative capacity, and a comprehensive quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that the major effect of <italic>UBQLN1</italic> was to suppress the accumulation of hydrophobic mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol. This conclusion is consistent with the work of Itakura et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itakura et al., 2016</xref>), who reported an accumulation of the mislocalized mitochondrial protein ATP5G1 upon depletion of all Ubqlns (UBQLN1, UBQLN2, and UBQLN4). While there appeared to be significant downregulation of UBQLN2 in this experiment, this might result from the different subcellular localization of UBQLN1 and UBQLN2. UBQLN2 is reported to localize mostly to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hjerpe et al., 2016</xref>), and since Ubqlns are capable of dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ford and Monteiro, 2006</xref>), the depletion of UBQLN1 could lead to destabilization of the small cytosolic UBQLN2 pool, leading to the apparent difference in UBQLN2 loss from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (which measures only cytosolic UBQLN2) to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (which measures total cellular UBQLN2).</p><p>A major finding from BJAB cells was the profound effect of UBQLN1 depletion on proliferative capacity, which may reflect that BJAB cells are classified as an ‘Oxphos’ DLBCL subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brien et al., 2007</xref>), characterized by high expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Monti et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, it is possible that BJABs are hypersensitive to the loss of UBQLN1 due to high expression levels of mitochondrial proteins. BJAB cells may also be exceptionally dependent on UBQLN1, as opposed to other members of the Ubqln family, for degradation of mislocalized mitochondrial proteins. To understand this better, we studied primary B cells from <italic>Ubqln1</italic> deficient mice. In these mice, we found a defect only in B1a B cells; other B cell compartments were normal. B1a cells are characterized by a unique reliance on BCR stimulation for their self-renewal in the peritoneum, which strongly suggested that <italic>Ubqln1</italic> function was tied to BCR signaling-dependent proliferation. This conclusion was supported by the dependence of BJAB proliferation on constitutive tonic BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, BCR ligation in primary <italic>Ubqln1</italic>-deficient B cells led to a defect in cell cycle entry that comprehensive unbiased proteomic analysis showed was associated with accumulation of hydrophobic and mitochondrial proteins, as in BJAB.</p><p>The role of <italic>Ubqln1</italic> in degradation of mislocalized mitochondrial protein is particularly critical in murine B cells when BCR ligation initiates proliferation, as protein synthesis and proliferation in response to LPS were normal. A likely explanation for this specificity is that BCR ligation induces much greater and more prolonged mitochondrial depolarization than other mitogenic stimuli, such as TLR4 ligation. Since mitochondrial depolarization attenuates the import of mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schleyer et al., 1982</xref>), it is the specific accumulation of mislocalized protein that reveals a role for UBQLN1 in vivo. Both BCR and TLR4 stimulation increase mitochondrial mass and the production of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, but the mitochondrial depolarization induced by BCR signaling compromises import of nascent protein, which increases the importance of degradation of mislocalized proteins in order to maintain cellular homeostasis. The increased requirement for <italic>Ubqln1</italic> in BCR-stimulated B cells therefore appears to be dependent on the combination of increased mitochondrial protein synthesis and decreased mitochondrial protein import. Increased mitochondrial protein production alone is not sufficient to reveal a requirement for <italic>Ubqln1</italic> in B cell proliferation, as LPS-stimulated B cells proliferate normally. Stimulation of B cells with IL-4 (53,64) or CD40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eeva et al., 2003</xref>) in addition to anti-IgM ameliorates BCR signaling-induced mitochondrial depolarization, which could explain why the addition of these co-stimuli to anti-IgM rescued B-cell proliferation in the absence of <italic>Ubqln1</italic>. It is interesting that the mitochondria themselves show no obvious functional defect in the absence of Ubqln1 in BCR-stimulated cells. This suggests that under these conditions, the import machinery is capable of meeting the demand of increased mitochondrial biogenesis, and that nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins are made in excess to the mitochondrial requirements. In any case, the finding of normal mitochondrial function in <italic>Ubqln1</italic>-deficient cells emphasizes that the toxic event is not intrinsic to mitochondria but related to the cytosolic accumulation of mislocalized mitochondrial proteins.</p><p>How does the accumulation of mislocalized proteins lead to a defect in protein synthesis, cell cycle entry, and subsequent proliferation? The kinetics of mRNA induction following BCR stimulation were normal in the absence of Ubqln1, which suggests that UPR and other stress response pathways acting through effects on gene expression programs are unlikely to be effectors of this response. Instead, our results indicated that the important <italic>Ubqln1</italic>-dependent step in proliferation in response to BCR signaling was translation of at least some of the induced mRNAs, including Cyclin Ds, which are essential for progression out of G1. Accumulation of mislocalized mitochondrial proteins can depress cytosolic protein synthesis through initiation of a poorly understood cellular stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Topf et al., 2016</xref>). These studies demonstrated that inhibition of mitochondrial protein import in yeast leads to a general inhibition of cytosolic protein synthesis as measured by metabolic labeling with S<sup>35</sup> methionine. Wang et al. also quantified by mass spectrometry the proteome of yeast expressing a mutant ADP/ATP exchanger that collapses mitochondrial polarity and found a specific accumulation of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial proteins, two of which had MTS sequences still attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>). These studies support the hypothesis that the protein synthesis defect observed upon BCR stimulation in the absence of UBQLN1 is due to the accumulation of mislocalized mitochondrial protein and suggest that this is a more general phenomenon. B cells likely are exceptionally dependent on UBQLN1, as opposed to other members of the Ubqln family, for degradation of mislocalized mitochondrial proteins because of the high relative expression of Ubqln1 in these cells. We also considered the possibility that ER stress, inhibition of mTOR activity, or the loss of energy levels might contribute to the observed general inhibition of protein synthesis, but found no Ubqln1-dependent changes in EIF2α phosphorylation, UPR gene expression, mTOR pathway phosphorylation, and only slight changes in cellular ATP levels.</p><p>Further studies will be needed to determine the full extent of physiological stresses that reveal a requirement for Ubqln function. Mitochondrial depolarization downstream of calcium signaling, or calcium overload, have been implicated in receptor-mediated excitotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stanika et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">White and Reynolds, 1996</xref>) and hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carriedo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuchs et al., 2013</xref>), which are hallmarks of neurological diseases ranging from ischemic stroke to ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doble, 1999</xref>). Also, it appears that defects in mitophagy, an autophagic degradation of mitochondria that is triggered by mitochondrial depolarization, underlie familial Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Narendra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hauser et al., 2013</xref>). As in BCR-stimulated B cells, neurons stimulated with mitochondrial-depolarizing agents may require Ubqln expression to ameliorate the buildup of mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol. It is noteworthy that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>UBQLN2</italic>, which is highly expressed in neurons and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marín, 2014</xref>), appear to play an etiological role in some forms of familial ALS-FTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2011</xref>). Further tests are warranted to explore the cytosolic accumulation of mitochondrial proteins in neurons deficient of UBQLN2 function, and whether mitochondrial depolarization exacerbates this accumulation. In conclusion, we hypothesize that prolonged mitochondrial depolarization, paired with amplified expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, may represent a unifying stress that makes Ubqln expression essential for the continued health of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Anti-CD19 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2629813">AB_2629813</ext-link> (FITC), anti-IgM RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2075943">AB_2075943</ext-link> (Percp/Cy5.5), anti-CD21 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1953277">AB_1953277</ext-link> (PE/Cy7), anti-CD23 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2103307">AB_2103307</ext-link> (Pacific Blue), anti-CD5 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2563928">AB_2563928</ext-link> (APC), anti-CD138 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10960141">AB_10960141</ext-link> (APC), and anti-B220 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_313007">AB_313007</ext-link> (APC/Cy7) antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ivan Dikic (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>As a whole this manuscript has been well received by the reviewers, which further supports the initial decision of the main editor to send out for review. While this manuscript addresses interesting and important questions as well as also present a set of important data, the reviewers highlighted areas of improvement as detailed below. We believe that this data represents a reasonable request which is intended to improve the impact and the message of this manuscript. Aside from immunizations or antigenic challenges, which might take some time, all this data can be collected in a 2 months period.</p><p>General reviewers’ comments:</p><p>This study by Whiteley et al. has investigated the consequences of Ubqln1 knockdown and knockout in B cells and B cell derived cell lines. The primary finding is that acute knockdown of Ubqln1 in the BJAB cell line rapidly arrests growth, and this correlates with the accumulation in the cytosol of many hydrophobic proteins, many of which are intended for targeting to mitochondria. Subsequent studies in a subset of B cells isolated from Ubqln1 knockout mice verified this general phenomenon under conditions where BCR signaling was initiated. They find that BCR signaling, but not LPS stimulation, induces mitochondrial depolarization in addition to mitochondrial proliferation. The association of Ubiquilin1 with mitochondrial proteins has been previously established by Itakura et al., thus this aspect of the work represents a rather modest advance. The novelty comes from the analysis of Ubqln<sup>-/-</sup> mice which are purported to have a B cell restricted phenotype revealed by a diminution in B1 cells and impaired responsiveness to BCR-induced proliferation.</p><p>In general the topic is clearly of significant interest because this family of proteins is poorly understood and implicated in diseases via unknown mechanisms. The recent findings of a role in hydrophobic protein degradation were intriguing, but the physiologic situation(s) when such a function becomes critical was not known. The current study very nicely addresses this issue and serves to identify a specific physiologic situation where Ubqln1 becomes critical, and provides proteomic validation on a cell-wide scale of observations previously made for only a couple of model proteins.</p><p>Specific major points that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H-J</xref> should be better controlled in order for the authors to draw their intended conclusion. The best experiment would probably be to monitor eGFP translation rates when co-transfected with wild type versus signal-deleted ATP5G1. This would narrow the effect to non-imported ATP5G1 as opposed to an effect of simply over-expressing another protein in addition to eGFP. At the very least, some unrelated protein (e.g., mRFP) should be co-expressed in the control situation. As it currently stands, it appears the authors are comparing the situation where only eGFP is transfected, versus on where eGFP is co-transfected with the signal-disrupted ATP5G1. The observed effect on eGFP could be for reasons other than a specific inhibition of translation via a mis-targeted ATP5G1.</p><p>2) A potentially useful experiment would be to determine whether LPS stimulation combined with mitochondrial depolarization (e.g., with CCCP) shows a proliferation defect in Ubqln1 knockout cells. This would nicely establish that the key difference between LPS and BCR ligation is down to the latter's effect on mitochondrial depolarization. Because the central idea of this paper is that the double burden of mitochondrial biogenesis and attenuated import explains the phenotype of Ubqln1 deficient cells, the proposed experiment seems important.</p><p>3) Good characterization of the in vivo immune response to viral or antigen challenge. This is important to address the in vivo consequences of impaired BCR signaling and to support the notion that Ubiquilin 1 function is restricted to the BCR. Relatedly, is there an effect of Ubiquilin 1 loss on plasma cell differentiation due to an altered unfolded protein response? If so, would it also be relevant to the B-1 cell defect as the cells spontaneously secrete Ig?</p><p>4) The lack of a clear impact on mitochondrial function is surprising and weakens the mechanistic basis of the study. The authors should comment on this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26435.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific major points that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H-J</xref> should be better controlled in order for the authors to draw their intended conclusion.

We performed several variations on the experiment to address these issues. The protocol for the experiment is quite complicated, unfortunately involving perturbation of the cells’ physiology by electroporation, by ficoll gradient fractionation, and by AHA labeling. Apparently because of these elements in the design of the experiments, which we have not yet been able to bypass, we see noise levels that are problematic. These will take considerable additional time to resolve, and we think it will fit best into a subsequent study. Therefore, we have decided to remove <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8H-J</xref>. Note that we have removed and altered text in the Discussion, to reflect a more nuanced claim.</p><p>We have also expanded our discussion of the findings from Wrobel et al. and Wang et al., 2015 (1,2), in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, to better explain the excellent prior literature on the link between mitochondrial protein accumulation and protein synthesis. These two back-to-back Nature papers provide good evidence that accumulation of mislocalized mitochondrial proteins is sufficient to inhibit cytosolic protein synthesis in yeast. In these reports, it was found that inhibition of mitochondrial protein import – either by genetic mutation or deletion of mitochondrial protein import machinery, or of genes involved in maintaining mitochondrial polarity – leads to a general inhibition of cytosolic protein synthesis as measured by metabolic labeling with S<sup>35</sup> methionine. Wang et al. also quantified the proteome of yeast with collapsed mitochondrial polarity by mass spectrometry and found a specific accumulation of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial proteins, two of which had MTS sequences still attached.</p><p>We think that these findings support our hypothesis that the protein synthesis defect observed upon BCR stimulation in the absence of UBQLN1 likely results from the accumulation of mislocalized mitochondrial proteins. To improve on this line of inquiry, given the difficulties mentioned above and the high quality of the yeast literature, will require work at a depth that we consider beyond the scope of the current manuscript. With this in mind, we think that the removal of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8H-J</xref> does not significantly alter the conclusions of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A potentially useful experiment would be to determine whether LPS stimulation combined with mitochondrial depolarization (e.g., with CCCP) shows a proliferation defect in Ubqln1 knockout cells.

At first, we attempted to depolarize LPS-stimulated cells with the ETC uncoupler, CCCP. We found that at all doses that high enough to induce depolarization, the cells died within 24-48 hours, precluding analysis of effects on proliferation. We repeated the experiment using combinations of antimycin A and oligomycin in attempts to mitigate these toxicity problems, but found similar results.</p><p>As an alternative, we tested the effects ionomycin, which induces a calcium flux, on LPS stimulation. This stimulus also induced mitochondrial depolarization, in a way somewhat similar to BCR ligation, which also induces a prolonged increase in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Unfortunately, ionomycin strongly inhibited LPS-induced proliferation, even at doses that had little effect on mitochondrial polarization, and even in the presence of Ubqln1. Thus, although we find the reviewers’ suggested experiment would be helpful, we have not found a pharmacologic agent that allows testing of the hypothesis that mitochondrial depolarization alone is sufficient to inhibit cell cycle entry in the absence of <italic>Ubqln1</italic>. Each of the pharmacologic agents induces cytotoxicity at any dose that leads to mitochondrial depolarization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Good characterization of the in vivo immune response to viral or antigen challenge.

If so, would it also be relevant to the B-1 cell defect as the cells spontaneously secrete Ig?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ requests, and have included some new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We performed 3 independent in vivo immunizations of WT and -/- mice (n=5-7 mice per genotype) with a T-independent antigen (TNP-ficoll delivered IP) but did not find any Ubqln1-dependent defects in antibody production. Data from these experiments are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-G</xref> and discussed in the second paragraph of the Results subsection “Ubqln1 is required for cell cycle entry downstream of BCR stimulation”.</p><p>We are not certain why <italic>Ubqln1</italic>-deficient mice have normal antibody titers following TNP-ficoll immunization, but we speculate that there may be costimulatory signals in vivothat may compensate for the BCR-induced defect, as we observed in vitro(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H-I</xref>). The defect in B1a cells that we have found suggests that it would be possible to design experiments that explored their particular importance in immune responses, but we believe this is essentially a new direction and would take significant additional time to address.</p><p>In addition to the immunization study we performed, in our 3-day in vitro proliferation experiments, we looked at the phenotype of surviving cells to see whether the absence of <italic>Ubqln1</italic> influenced the character as opposed to the proliferation rate of stimulated B cells, using Syndecan1 as a marker for plasmablast cells. Syndecan1 was not upregulated following BCR stimulation; however, following LPS stimulation, a large proportion of the cells became Syndecan1-high (not shown). We did not see any differences in the proportion of Syndecan1+ cells, or the level of Syndecan1 expression (not shown), in <italic>Ubqln1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells following LPS stimulation.</p><p>We also examined stimulated cells for the induction of UPR via QPCR for HSPA5 and CHOP, but found no differences between WT and -/- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Like plasma cell differentiation, we saw much more induction of the UPR upon LPS stimulation compared to BCR stimulation, and like previous reports, we saw more induction of HSPA5 (BiP) compared to CHOP (DDIT3) (3,4).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>UPR gene expression following stimulation of primary B cells.</title><p>Splenic B cells from WT or -/- mice were isolated and stimulated as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> of manuscript. 24 hours after stimulation, cDNA samples were isolated for QPCR against HSPA5 and CHOP. Shown are mean ± SEM of biological triplicates.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26435-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>Thus, <italic>Ubqln1</italic> appears to not be necessary for resolution of the UPR under these conditions. Instead, we find that <italic>Ubqln1</italic> is necessary to resolve a stress downstream of signaling that induces mitochondrial depolarization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The lack of a clear impact on mitochondrial function is surprising and weakens the mechanistic basis of the study. The authors should comment on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We, too, were originally surprised to see no effect of <italic>Ubqln1</italic> loss on mitochondrial function in B cells, and we examined the mitochondria quite exhaustively in our attempts to identify a Ubqln-dependent defect. However, our results are consistent with the results from Itakura et al. which showed no change in mitochondrial morphology (Figure S3E of their study) or expression levels of respiratory chain complex proteins (Figure S4A of their study) upon deletion of Ubqlns 1, 2, and 4.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that these mitochondrially-targeted proteins are made in excess even in cases of mitochondrial biogenesis, and some copies of those excessively synthesized proteins fail mitochondrial insertion. Those ‘rejected’ proteins require UBQLN1 for their degradation, while the mitochondria remain capable of functioning normally with the proportion of those proteins that do get properly inserted. This point is made in the third paragraph of the Discussion, as requested.References:</p><p>1) Wrobel L, Topf U, Bragoszewski P, Wiese S, Sztolsztener ME, Oeljeklaus S, Varabyova A, Lirski M, Chroscicki P, Mroczek S, Januszewicz E, Dziembowski A, Koblowska M, Warscheid B, Chacinska A.
