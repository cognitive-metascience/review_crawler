elements that are observed proximal to the distal appendages (DAPs) in vertebrates. Despite the obvious presence of sDAPs, structural and functional understanding of them remains elusive. Here, by combining super-resolved localization analysis and CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation, we find that although DAPs and sDAPs are primarily responsible for distinct functions in ciliogenesis and microtubule anchoring, respectively, the presence of one element actually affects the positioning of the other. Specifically, we find dual layers of both ODF2 and CEP89, where their localizations are differentially regulated by DAP and sDAP integrity. DAP depletion relaxes longitudinal occupancy of sDAP protein ninein to cover the DAP region, implying a role of DAPs in sDAP positioning. Removing sDAPs alter the distal border of centrosomal Î³-tubulins, illustrating a new role of sDAPs. Together, our results provide an architectural framework for sDAPs that sheds light on functional understanding, surprisingly revealing coupling between DAPs and sDAPs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>subdistal appendages</kwd><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd><kwd>distal appendages</kwd><kwd>ODF2</kwd><kwd>CEP89</kwd><kwd>Ninein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107-2112-M-001-037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chong</surname><given-names>Weng Man</given-names></name><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>Tzu-Yuan</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Ting-Jui</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>You-Pi</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>T.

A centrosome consists of a pair of rod-shaped centrioles, i.e. a mother centriole and a daughter centriole, and the pericentriolar material (PCM). Î³âtubulin is considered as the major microtubule (MT)ânucleating factor of the PCM by forming the Î³-tubulin ring complex (Î³TuRC) as the nucleation template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moritz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pereira and Schiebel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wiese and Zheng, 1999</xref>). The size of the PCM indicated by the signal of Î³âtubulin changes with the cell cycle, from a tightly packed PCM in the interphase to a large aggregate during mitosis, with the mother and daughter centrioles as the core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robbins et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The mother centriole is structurally differentiated from the daughter centriole by the presence of two appendage structures close to its distal end, namely distal appendages (DAPs) and subdistal appendages (sDAPs). DAPs are essential for centriole-membrane docking and primary cilia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ye et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishikawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joo et al., 2013</xref>). We and others have identified a number of distal appendage (DAP) proteins, including C2CD3, CEP83, CEP89, SCLT1, FBF1 and CEP164 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ye et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sillibourne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joo et al., 2013</xref>). We have also used super-resolution microscopy to map the molecular architecture of mammalian DAPs toward the distal end of the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Super-resolved images showed that DAPs are composed of DAP blades of nine-fold symmetry, as observed in electron microscopy (EM), and the novel structure of the DAP matrix between adjacent blades. TheÂ Loncarek group further used correlative super-resolution microscopy and EM to show theÂ precise localization of DAP proteins relative to the electron dense structure of DAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowler et al., 2019</xref>), improving the architectural mapping of the DAPs. We also found that CEP89 occupies two longitudinal layers, one close to the DAP region and the other close to the putative subdistal appendage (sDAP) region, proximally adjacent to the DAP region shown in a number of EM images of the mother centrioles.</p><p>Some EM images showed variations in the number of sDAPs, such as 2 to 12 sDAP stems in human endotheliocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bystrevskaya et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bystrevskaya et al., 1988</xref>), illustrating the dynamic nature of sDAPs. That is, in contrast to an exact number of nine DAPs per centriole, the number of sDAPs may be different in different centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Uzbekov and Alieva, 2018</xref>). Even when sDAPs do form a complete ring of nine-fold symmetry, their morphology is different from that of DAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paintrand et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Uzbekov and Alieva, 2018</xref>). Each sDAP stem is composed of one pair of electron-dense signals on the sides, where one ofÂ theseÂ signals is associated with the A-tubule of a MT triplet of the mother centriole and the other is associated with the C-tubule of an adjacent MT triplet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bystrevskaya et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paintrand et al., 1992</xref>). TheÂ longitudinal positions of mammalian sDAPs may also vary along the mother centriole. For centrioles of motile cilia, the structure at the longitudinal position proximal to the DAPs is the basal foot, a âbadminton-shapedâ structureÂ thatÂ is largely different from the sDAPs in the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bornens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bystrevskaya et al., 1988</xref>). The basal foot is oriented to align with the beating direction of motile cilia, suggesting its role in mechanical coupling or anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibbons, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clare et al., 2014</xref>). We and others have identified a series of sDAP proteins, including ODF2, CEP128, centriolin, CCDC68, CCDC120, ninein and CEP170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guarguaglini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakagawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mogensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">SchrÃ¸der et al., 2012</xref>). AlthoughÂ the structural presence of sDAPs are routinely observed in EM images, detailed geometrical information to describe the locations of these proteins relative to each other remains largely missing.</p><p>Although DAPs and sDAPs are mostly adjacent to each other in mammalian centrioles, their functions are distinct. DAPs are responsible for ciliogenesis and ciliary vesicle docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joo et al., 2013</xref>). sDAPs are mostly considered to serve roles in MT anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vorobjev and Chentsov, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bystrevskaya et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bornens, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delgehyr et al., 2005</xref>). EM images showÂ that MTs terminate at the tips of sDAPs, but one can also see many other MTs around the centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vorobjev and Chentsov, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mogensen et al., 2000</xref>). Direct functional evidence remains to be shown. Centriole MT aster reformation after MT depolymerization is delayed in ninein or CEP170 knockout or knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delgehyr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guarguaglini et al., 2005</xref>). However, both ninein and CEP170 have two localization populations, one at the centriole proximal end, and the other in the region close to sDAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it cannot be confirmed whether the phenotypes are due to abolished sDAPs or toÂ a damaged centriole proximal end. It is also unclear whether the MT anchoring of the sDAPs requires Î³âtubulin or Î³TuRC as a nucleating factor. Other functional roles of sDAPs have also been reported. We have previously shown that, despite being dispensable for ciliogenesis,Â depletionÂ of sDAPsÂ together with the loss of theÂ centriole proximal end protein CNAP1 results in theÂ detachment of cilia and Golgi, affecting the positioning of primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>). Another study on sDAP protein CEP128 found that CEP128 is implicated in RAB11 vesicle trafficking at the primary cilia, in which CEP128 depletion results in aÂ defect in TGF-Î²/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and abnormal organ development in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MÃ¶nnich et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Studies of the DAPâsDAP relationship are also very limited. As mentioned above, our previous super-resolution imaging result showed dual localizations of CEP89, potentially one localizationÂ in the DAP region and the other close to the sDAP region, but no functional studies have been performed to check whether CEP89 is associated with sDAPs or not. In RPE-1 cells, a genetic knockout of the most upstream sDAP protein ODF2 was shown to abolish the recruitment of other sDAP components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>), but neither the DAP assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>) nor the ability of the mutant centrioles to grow cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>) was grossly impacted. Similarly, reduction of an upstream DAP protein, CEP83 in CEP83 mutated fibroblasts, did not affect the localization of ODF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Failler et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that DAPs and sDAPs are two independent elements. However, separate studies showed that a null ODF2 knockout in the mouse F9 cell line abolished both the distal and subdistal appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishikawa et al., 2005</xref>), and that partial truncation of ODF2 could abolish sDAPs without affecting DAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tateishi et al., 2013</xref>), revealing a more complicated relationship between the two structures. Together, despite their proximity to each other, whether distal and subdistal appendages are structurally or functionally related to each other remains elusive.</p><p>In this study, we systematically characterized the super-resolved molecular architecture of sDAPs using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). We mapped the spatial organization of multiple sDAP-related proteins and generated a three-dimensional model. Intriguingly, we found structural coupling between DAP and sDAP proteins. We have also directly observed the role of sDAPs on MT anchoring and further illustrated the selective involvement of Î³âtubulins on MT templating. Together, our studies systematically reveal the super-resolved architecture of sDAPs, suggest potential DAPâsDAP structural connections, and implicate a regulatory mechanism of MT anchoring around the centrosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title id="head_2">Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title id="head_3">Super-resolution microscopy reveals that theÂ completeness of ring occupancies by sDAP proteins depends on the cell cycle</title><p>To characterize sDAP architectureÂ systematically, we imaged multiple sDAP proteins reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tateishi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MÃ¶nnich et al., 2018</xref>) by dSTORM super-resolution microscopy. ODF2, CEP128, centriolin, CCDC68, ninein and CEP170 of sDAPs were imaged. A centriole proximal end protein CNAP1, known to be associated with some sDAP proteins (e.g. ninein, CEP170), was also imaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>). It is known that theÂ organization of centriole proteins may change with cell-cycle phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guarguaglini et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we only focus on theÂ geometric arrangement of proteins in the quiescent state, where primary cilia are grown or ready to grow. RPE-1 cells were serum starved for at least 24 hr to synchronize cells to the G<sub>0</sub> phase before proceeding to imaging.</p><p>We first examined whether sDAP proteins form rings with a nine-fold symmetry like those formedÂ by DAP proteins. We conducted two-color staining of the DAP protein SCLT1 and an sDAP protein of interest using dSTORM with Alexa Fluor 647 and Cy3B organic dyes. We used SCLT1 as a marker in widefield imaging to pick centrioles approximately viewed from the axial view by means of the well-defined ring structure of SCLT1 that is crudely observable in conventional widefield microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,d</xref>). We then imaged the channel for an sDAP protein of interest using super-resolution microscopy and examined theÂ radial distributions of the sDAP protein. Interestingly, we found different angular integrities of sDAP proteins among the images of the same protein as well as amongÂ those of different sDAP proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and d</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, the majority of CEP170 rings are not intact. Statistically, CEP170 exhibits a wider range of radial distributions under serum-fed (cell proliferating) conditions thanÂ under serum-starved (cell resting) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). InÂ contrast to CEP170, the relatively upstream sDAP protein CEP128 is better organized during the cell-resting phase andÂ during the proliferating phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Circular expansion of signals along the polar coordinate of the ring illustratesÂ thatÂ ~50% of ring occupancy is missing under serum-fed conditions, whereasÂ ~25% is missing under serum-starved conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>). It is interesting to note that 24-hr serum starvation, which promotes ciliogenesis in around 60% ofÂ RPE-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lo et al., 2019</xref>), does have an effect on the completeness of ring occupancy of ciliogenesis-independent sDAP proteins. In addition, sDAPs may not always possess a nine-punctum pattern like that of DAPs in RPE-1 cells. Our results not only show inconsistent occupancies of sDAPs, but also demonstrate a variation in sDAP ring completeness, probably in different cell phases, in the presence or absence of serum. Furthermore, our super-resolution fluorescence study enables us to discriminate occupancy variations of an upstream sDAP protein (CEP128) and ofÂ a peripheral sDAP protein (CEP170).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Super-resolved localizations of subdistal appendage (sDAP) proteins exhibit distinct radial distributions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Axial-view direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) images of CEP170 under serum-supplied (FBS+) and serum-starved (FBSâ) conditions.Â (<bold>b</bold>) Image analysis revealing that, under the proliferating condition (FBS+), CEP170 exhibits a relatively random radial distribution compared to that under the resting (FBSâ) G<sub>0</sub> phase.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g and h</xref>, the sDAP proteins are in ring shapes of different sizes, ranging approximately from 250 nmÂ to 600 nmÂ inÂ diameter. Among them, ODF2 forms the smallest ring with a diameter similar to that of the centriole MT wall (~200 nm), suggesting its close proximity to the centriole. By contrast, ninein and CEP170 occupy a much wider space, with a diameter of around 600 nm, larger than the diameter of outer DAP proteins such as FBF1 and SCLT1. Multiple studies have characterized the spatial organization of sDAP proteins via immuno-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guarguaglini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2017</xref>) or structured illumination (SIM) microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashihara et al., 2019</xref>). In line with previous SIM studies, our dSTORM images also show a range of 250â600 nm in diameter for various sDAP proteins. The difference is that SIM is limited by theÂ ~100 nm lateral imaging resolution, whereasÂ dSTORM can achieve a resolution of 20 nm. Taking advantage of the resolving power of dSTORM imaging, our work is able to map the molecular architecture in more detail.</p><p>When correlating the occupancies of sDAP proteins from ODF2 to CEP170 to the reported assembly hierarchy of sDAPs as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2017</xref>), we found that the smaller the size of the protein distribution, the more upstream it is in the hierarchy. Occasionally, an overhang-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, marked by arrowhead) was observed for ninein and CEP170. To better understand whether this overhang-like structure is a basal foot-like protrusion or a part of a neighboring daughter centriole, we performed 3D two-color super-resolution imaging of CEP170 and a DAP protein CEP164 using expansion microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). When looking at these images together with conventional epifluorescent microscopy imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), one can see that the extra signal most probably comes from the proximal end localization of CEP170 on the daughter centriole, andÂ not fromÂ an overhang structure of the sDAPs. To further investigate the arrangement of the sDAP stems, we performed TEM sectioning of RPE-1 centrioles in the axial view, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>. The TEM images reveal that sDAP stems can be mostly observed in the same section with a nine-fold arrangement. It is also interesting to note that the sDAP stems are mostly wider than those of DAPs, similar to the observations recorded in previous work by the Bornens group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paintrand et al., 1992</xref>). From the EM image, it seems that the stems of sDAPs are more flexible in shape and distribution than those of DAPs, potentially explaining the finding that nine-fold distribution is less obvious for the localization of sDAP proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title id="head_5">Lateral super-resolution images reveal sDAP as a triangular structure</title><p>We defined the longitudinal position of sDAP proteins by means of dual color dSTORM super-resolution imaging. Each sDAP protein was immuno-stained together with the DAP protein SCLT1, which served as a position reference. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>, CEP128 forms a compact layer at about 160 nm proximal to the SCLT1 layer of the DAPs. ODF2 covers a broader longitudinal region with two populations separating in two layers, which respectively localize atÂ ~100 nm andÂ ~200 nm proximal to the DAP protein SCLT1. Centriolin also covers a longitudinal range thatÂ seemingly possesses a single layer, although we cannot rule out the possibility of two very close layers. Ninein and CEP170 localize both to the sDAP region and toÂ the centriole proximal end marked by CNAP1. The two layers are separated byÂ ~350 nm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> shows the alignment of sDAP proteins according to their longitudinal positions. CEP128 is sandwiched between the two ODF2 layers, with centriolin localized above them. Ninein and CEP170 localize radially outward from centriolin.

Other sDAP proteins fill up the triangular structure. CEP128 is right at the border between the centriole MT and the sDAP stem. Centriolin is located at the middle portion of an sDAP stem, whereas ninein is close to the tips of sDAPs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Super-resolved lateral images reveal sDAP protein distribution from the centriole wall to the appendage tips.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative lateral-view two-color dSTORM images of sDAPâSCLT1 pairs revealing the longitudinal positions of various sDAP proteins relative to SCLT1.Â (<bold>b</bold>) A scatter plot describing the longitudinal positions of sDAP proteins relative to SCLT1.

ODF2, CEP128 and centriolin lie close to the centriole MT wall. CEP170 and ninein are mostly at the sDAP tips. To gain further structural insight, we also included the DAP structure from our previous work in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3bâe</xref>). Note that both the sDAP protein ODF2 and theÂ DAP protein CEP89 are two layered structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,e</xref>). The proximal layer of ODF2 is at the lowest position among the sDAPÂ proteins studied; while the distal layer of ODF2 lies in close proximity to the core DAP protein CEP83 (i.e.Â ~60 nm proximal to SCLT1 as we previously reported; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).

Successful knockout of CEP83 or CEP128 in RPE-1 cells were confirmed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Lateral super-resolution images of ODF2 reveal that ODF2 has two localizations distal and proximal to CEP128 in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4b</xref>). Surprisingly, in DAP or sDAP knockout cells, single-layered ODF2 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and e</xref>). In particular, the proximal layer of ODF2 was absent upon CEP128 depletion, where SCLT1 was used as a reference of the longitudinal position. To examine whether this change in ODF2 is caused by aÂ potential change in ODF2 configuration upon CEP128 depletion as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashihara et al., 2019</xref>), in addition to the original antibody targeting the N terminus of ODF2 (aa #39â200)Â (denoted as ODF2-N in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), we used another antibody targeting the C terminus of ODF2 (aa #800 to the C terminus, denoted as ODF2-C) for further study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). dSTORM imaging of ODF2-C revealed that in wild-type cells, ODF2-C distribution is wider than ODF2-N distribution in the radial direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b, c and d</xref>). In addition, the distal edge of ODF2-C is closer to SCLT1 than that of ODF2-N, reaching furtherÂ towardÂ the centriole distal end. Interestingly, when CEP128 is depleted, distributions of both ODF2-N and ODF2-C become thinner. The gap between ODF2-N/C and SCLT1 of CEP128<sup>â/â</sup> cells is larger than that of the wild-type cells, illustrating both narrowing and shifting of ODF2 occupancy upon sDAP CEP128 depletion. These observations imply that CEP128, as the binding partner of ODF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashihara et al., 2019</xref>), regulates the organization of ODF2. Whether this ODF2 thin layer in CEP128<sup>-/-Â </sup>cells is originated from the ODF2 layer at DAP region or the one at sDAP region remains to be examined. One speculation is that the sDAP depletion results in the removal of ODF2 in the sDAP layer. Similarly, in CEP83-depleted centrioles, one layer of ODF2 was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). This observation implies that ODF2 is associated with both DAPs and sDAPs as a downstream protein of CEP83 and CEP128, respectively.

Using CP110 as a reference toÂ indicate the distal boundary of the centriole, we find that the broadened longitudinal region of ninein spans from the sDAP region to the region originally occupied by DAPs. In addition, when CEP83 is stably expressed in <italic>CEP83<sup>â/</sup></italic><sup>â</sup>cells (<italic>CEP83<sup>â/</sup></italic><sup>â</sup> Rescue), the sDAP distribution of ninein is restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h and i</xref>). To examine the differences in sDAP structures between wild type and CEP83<sup>â/â</sup> RPE-1 cells, we performed TEM with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>. In wild-type cells, sDAPs mostly maintained their longitudinal position close to and proximal to the DAPs, but their shapes varied in different centrioles or even in the same centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>, left panel). Surprisingly, we found that the positions and shapes of the stems of sDAPs are largely varying in CEP83-depleted cells were highly variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>, right panel). That is, the sDAP structure is much less stable when DAPs are missing. Specifically, a few examples show that sDAP tips may point toward the distal end with a thicker stem, consistent with what we observed in ninein super-resolution images of CEP83<sup>â/â</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h and i</xref>). In other cases, sDAPs can localize at the middle region of the centriole, occupy the same side of the centriole, miss one side of occupancy, or localize at different longitudinal positions in the same centriole. These large variations imply that the loss of DAPs via CEP83 depletion affects the structural stability of sDAPs, providingÂ furtherÂ evidence that DAPs and sDAPs are structurally related to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>). Note that laterally oriented centrioles were preselected by the pattern of centrin and ninein under widefield imaging prior to dSTORM imaging; therefore, unlike the asymmetry of sDAP stems observed in the EM images of CEP83<sup>â/â</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>, right panel), asymmetry of ninein is less obvious in the ninein super-resolution images of CEP83<sup>â/â</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title id="head_9">sDAP depletion eliminates the anchoring of a subset of microtubules around the mother centriole</title><p>Previous studies have shown that the absence of ninein reduced microtubule (MT) regrowth after nocodazole-induced MT depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delgehyr et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is unclear whether this outcome results from the ninein population of the sDAP region orÂ that of the centriole proximal end. To validate whether sDAPs do play a MT-anchoring role, we examined Î±-tubulin localization in wild-type and <italic>CEP128<sup>â/â</sup></italic> RPE-1 cells during the serum-starved G<sub>0</sub> phase. In widefield images, no observable difference is found in terms of centrioles serving as the center of MT networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>). Many MT fibers still originate from the centrioles in the sDAP-depleted cells, andÂ it is not obvious that sDAPs serve as a MT-anchoring site. An axial view of MTs around the mother centriole obtainedÂ using super-resolution microscopy can sometimes show reduced MT numbers in <italic>CEP128<sup>â/</sup></italic><sup>â</sup>cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c and d</xref>), but it remains challenging to confirm whether the effect is due to sDAP depletion.

As expected, Î³-tubulins are highly enriched close to the centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Intriguingly, super-resolution imaging shows that most Î³-tubulins cover the longitudinal region of the mother centriole from the proximal end to the height of the sDAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), leaving the region between the DAPs and sDAPs less populated. The diameter of theÂ Î³-tubulin occupied region is about 400 nm, larger than the diameter of the centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). That is, Î³-tubulins in the G<sub>0</sub> phase are mostly confined to a well-defined cylindrical position outside the mother centriole. This confined cylindrical distribution of Î³-tubulins provides a better-defined localization of the previously known tightly packed PCM in the interphase, whichÂ isÂ very different from the broad distributionÂ of PCM-bound Î³-tubulins during mitosis. WhenÂ compared to the distribution of Î±-tubulin of wild-type centrioles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, the distal Î±-tubulin enrichment close to the sDAP region is different from the relatively uniform longitudinal distribution of Î³-tubulin. Therefore, it is likely that there are at least two populations of Î³-tubulins, a major population that does not anchor Î±- and Î²-tubulins and localizes along the mother centriole, and the other associated with MT anchoring at the sDAP region. To further examine the localization of Î³-tubulin at the sDAP tip, we compare the signals of Î³-tubulin in the region potentially close to the sDAP tip between wild-type and <italic>CEP128<sup>â/</sup></italic>â cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).

That is, sDAPs spatially regulate theÂ distal boundary of Î³-tubulins along the centriole. Furthermore, this population of Î³-tubulins may not anchor MTs, because we observed decreased Î±-tubulin population at the distal end of the mother centriole in the <italic>CEP128<sup>â/</sup></italic><sup>â</sup>cells. as summarized in a speculative model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>.

Unlike the more consistent nine-fold symmetric structures of DAP proteins, sDAP proteins are less organized, either with an incomplete occupancy of the ring or a spreading radial distribution. For those sDAPs possessing a more complete ring-shaped occupancy, ODF2, CEP128, and centriolin form better-defined nine puncta-like structures, whereas CCDC68, ninein, and CEP170 distribute more randomly around a ring. ODF2 localizes close to the upper and lower ends of the root of an sDAP attaching to the centriolar MTs. The distal layer of ODF2 is downstream of the DAP protein CEP83, whereas the proximal layer of ODF2 is downstream of the sDAP protein CEP128. CEP128 localizes slightly outside of ODF2 radially and inÂ between the two layers of ODF2 longitudinally. The genetic and localization relationships of ODF2 and CEP128 are consistent with the finding that these two proteins form a protein complex to work together as an sDAP componentÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashihara et al., 2019</xref>). Centriolin localizes slightly outside and distal to CEP128 in the central region of an sDAP. CEP89, in addition to its DAP layer, also has a longitudinal sDAP layer downstream of CEP128 localizing distal to centriolin, close to the distal border of an sDAP. Ninein and CEP170 both localize toward the tip of an sDAP andÂ have relatively broad radial and longitudinal distributions.Â They potentially serve as key components for functions of sDAP tips, such as anchoring a subset of MTs around the mother centriole. Note that the measurement may differ depending on the epitope regions of the protein of interest, as observed using ODF2 antibodies thatÂ recognize each terminus of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). This difference in structural arrangement may be related to the different functions of the N and C termini of ODF2 suggested in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishikawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashihara et al., 2019</xref>), with the N terminus of ODF2 found to be the interacting domain for CEP128.</p><p>In addition to the dual roles of ODF2 and CEP89 on DAPs and sDAPs, we found that the longitudinal distribution of sDAP ninein is regulated by DAPs. Depleting DAPs results in theÂ spreading of theÂ ninein covering the longitudinal region from the sDAPs all the way toward the distal end of the mother centriole. That is, DAPs serve as a distal border of sDAPs. The structural arrangement of sDAPs is dependent on the structural arrangement of DAPs. Previously, the DAPs and the sDAPs were considered toÂ be independent components serving distinct roles at the distal end of the mother centriole. Removal of sDAPs does not influence ciliogenesis, which requires proper functions of DAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>). sDAP protein localizations are still observed upon depletion of DAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joo et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, using super-resolution microscopy, we show hereÂ that DAPs and sDAPs are not entirely independent, with at least two proteins serving dual roles and withÂ ninein positioning affected by the DAP structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>).</p><p>We also provide direct evidence that sDAP-specific CEP128 knockout depletes MT population close to the sDAPs, further confirming that sDAPs anchor a subset of MTs around the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). This result clarifies the previous conclusion of nineinâs role in MT anchoring as an sDAP element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delgehyr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mogensen et al., 2000</xref>). The exact functions of this subset of sDAP-anchoring MTs remains unclear due to the challenge of tracing individual MT filaments, even with our 20-nm super-resolution capability. One speculation would be related to theÂ mechanosensation of cells through this subset of sDAP-anchoring MTs. It is known that for a motile cilium, the component proximal to DAPs is a cone-shaped basal foot, whose orientation is aligned to its beating direction, serving as a mechanical coupling element at the ciliary base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clare et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bornens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibbons, 1961</xref>). Because a primary cilium does not actively beat, it is speculated that mechanosensation is required in all orientations.Â Thus the ring-shaped sDAPs are formed at the centriolar distal end to anchor mechanosensing MTs in all circumferential directions. It would be interesting to examine mechanical coupling phenotypes in other types of polarized cells thatÂ have primary cilia, such as inner medulla collecting duct (IMCD) cells or Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Another possibility is that this subset of MTs partially bridges a centriole and Golgi apparatus, because we have previously shown that even though Golgi remains adjacent to a centriole in single knockout of <italic>CEP128<sup>â/â</sup>,</italic> double knockouts of <italic>CEP128<sup>â/</sup></italic><sup>â</sup> and <italic>CNAP1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> result in centriole-Golgi dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>). Because of the complex MT network surrounding the mother centriole, we were not able to determine whether the sDAP-linked MTs reach Golgi or not.</p><p>As Î³TuRC is the initiating template of a MT, we expected thatÂ the locations where Î³-tubulins are populated would be where more Î±-tubulin signals are found if an MT nucleation site remains as an anchoring site. Surprisingly, their distributions around the mother centriole are inconsistent when observing them using super-resolution microscopy. In wild type cells, Î±-tubulin signals are mostly associated with DAPs and sDAPs, whereas Î³-tubulins are mostly localized along the mother centriole below sDAPs. AlthoughÂ CEP128 depletion results in reduced Î±-tubulin close to the sDAP region, an unexpected increasing population of Î³-tubulin is observed around the region between sDAPs and DAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). From these results, weÂ can speculate that, in the G<sub>0</sub> quiescent phase, there is one population of Î³-tubulins involved in MT anchoring at sDAPs, and another population of Î³-tubulins localized along the centriole thatÂ isÂ not associated with the Î±-tubulin population. The latter population comprises the majority of centrosomal Î³-tubulins and wraps around the mother centriole at a well-defined cylindrical confinement with sDAPs as their distal constraint. It is possible that these Î³-tubulins are anchored at the compact PCM structure outside the mother centriole, with a diameter larger than the centriole wall, illustrating a clear shape of the confined PCM duringÂ interphase. It is also possible that this major Î³-tubulin population in G<sub>0</sub> phase serves as a reservoir of MT nucleating sites,Â which enables quick initiation of MT growth once the cells re-enter theÂ cell cycle. Besides, as suggested by a previous study showing that MT initiation and anchoring may be independent processesÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delgehyr et al., 2005</xref>), it is also likely that these Î³-tubulins can first initiate MT nucleation around the centriole and later be associated with some MT-anchoring proteins, suchÂ as ninein, to anchor MT to sDAPs. The function of this major Î³-tubulin population may be interesting to address in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title id="head_12">Materials and

The identity of the cell line has been authenticated using STR Profiling Analysis by ATCC with a 100% match. A mycoplasma contamination test was performed by collecting cell culture medium without antibiotics for 24 hr and processingÂ thisÂ medium by PCR using EZ-PCR mycoplasma detection kit (EZ-PCR Mycoplasma Detection Kit, 20-700-20, Biological Industries, CT, USA), according to theÂ manufacturer's protocol. This cell line is not in the list of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee. Prior to immunofluorescence staining, cells were cultured on poly-L-Lysine coated coverslips and then serum starved for 24 hr before fixing with methanol at â20Â°C. For staining of CCDC68, CEP170 and ninein, cells were first extracted with PTEM buffer for 2 min before proceeding to ice-cold methanol fixation. The PTEM buffer contained 20 mM PIPES, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mM EGTA and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and was prepared at pH 6.8. After fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% PBST (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min before blocking with 3% BSA for 30 min. Primary antibodies at optimized dilution prepared with 0.1% BSA in PBST were then added to cells for 1 hr. To remove unbound antibodies, cells were washed three times with 0.1% PBST, and then incubated with optimally diluted secondary antibodies for 1 hr.

Multiple gRNAs targeting different exons for CEP128 were used to achieve complete protein depletion. Briefly, the targeting sequences were cloned into the gRNA cloning vector (#41824, Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA) via the Gibson assembly method (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). gRNA was co-expressed with Cas9 protein in RPE-1 cells using reagents from the Church groupÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Esvelt et al., 2013</xref>) (Addgene: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.addgene.org/crispr/church/">http://www.addgene.org/crispr/church/</ext-link>).

Cells were then further postfixed in 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> in PBS buffer for 30 min on ice. After dehydrating in a graded series of ethanol, the cells were then infiltrated and embedded in EPON812 resin (Catalog #14120, Electron Microcopy Sciences) to generate a resin sample. A microtome (Ultracut UC6; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) was used to cut the sample into serial sections (~90 nm thickness), which were then stained with 1% uranyl acetate and 1% lead citrate. Samples were imaged using FEI Tecnai Spirit G2 and a JOEL JEM-1400plus transmission electron microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title id="head_19">dSTORM imaging and image analysis</title><p>For dSTORM imaging, Alexa Fluor 647 antibody (1:200) and Cy3B-conjugated antibody (1:100) were used as secondary antibodies. In general, the protein of interest was stained with Alexa Fluor 647 antibody whereas the reference protein, forÂ example SCLT1, was stained with Cy3B-conjugated antibody. The dSTORM imaging system included a modified inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti-E, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and a laser merge module (ILE, Spectral Applied Research, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada) with individual controllers for three light sources. To illuminate samples in the wide field, photon beams from a 637 nm laser (OBIS 637 LX 140 mW, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), a 561 nm laser (Jive 561 150 mW, Cobolt, Solna, Sweden) and a 405 nm laser (OBIS 405 LX 100 mW, Coherent) were homogenized (Borealis Conditioning Unit, Spectral Applied Research) and focused with a 100 Ã 1.49 NA oil immersion objective (CFI Apo TIRF, Nikon). To minimize z-axis drift, a perfect focusing system (PFS, Nikon) was used. During dSTORM imaging, the 647 nm and 561 nm laser lines were operated at a high intensity ofÂ ~1â5 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> to quench most of the fluorescence from Alexa 647 and Cy3B, respectively. A weak 405 nm beam was used to activate a portion of the dyes, converting them from a dark state to an excitable state. For single-color imaging of Alexa 647, signals were filtered with a bandpass filter (700/75, Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT, USA); for two-color imaging, the Alexa 647 channel was first recorded, and then the Cy3B channel was acquired with the corresponding filter (593/40, Chroma).</p><p>The collected fluorescent signal was filtered through a single-band emission filter and acquired on an EMCCD (Evolve 512 Delta, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA) with a pixel size of 93 nm. For each dSTORM image, 10,000â20,000 frames were acquired every 20 ms (exposure time). Individual single-molecule peaks were localized using MetaMorph Superresolution Module (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) based on a wavelet segmentation algorithm. Super-resolution images were cleaned with a Gaussian filter with a radius of 1 pixel. For imaging sample preparation, cells grown on coverslips were placed in an imaging chamber (Chamlide magnetic chamber, Live Cell Instrument, Seoul, Korea) and immersed in dSTORM imaging buffer. The buffer included TN buffer at pH 8.0, and an oxygen-scavenging system consisting of 60â100 mM mercaptoethylamine (MEA, 30070, Sigma-Aldrich) at pH 8.0, 0.5 mg/mL glucose oxidase (G2133, Sigma-Aldrich), 40 mg/mL catalase (C40, Sigma-Aldrich), and 10% (w/v) glucose (G8270, Sigma-Aldrich).</p><p>To correct lateral position drift, fiducial markers (Tetraspeck, T7279, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to the sample at a dilution of 1/200 before imaging. The drift was measured and corrected with ImageJ via frame-by-frame correlation of the fiducial markers. Chromatic aberration between the long and short wavelength channels was compensated with a customized algorithm relocating each pixel of a 561 nm image to its targeted position in the 647 nm channel with a predefined correction function obtained by a parabolic mapping of multiple calibration beads. For axial imaging of the DAPs, a ring pattern of SCLT1 was used to identify the top view orientation. For lateral imaging, the rod-like pattern of SCLT1 was used as an indicator of the lateral view of the centriole-cilium. To determine the diameter of the sDAP proteins, a radial position of an individual super-resolved punctum was measured and the distance between each punctum and the center was defined as the radius. To correlate dSTORM with EM images, signal of CEP170 was used to align with the tip of the sDAP contour on the electron micrograph.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title id="head_20">3D model illustration</title><p>The 3D mother centriole structure model was drawn with the 3D illustration software Blender (Blender Foundation, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

Stained cells were then incubated in 0.1 mg/ml acryloyl-X (A20770, Thermo Fisher Scientific) solution in DMSO overnight at 4Â°C, followed by washing twice for 15 min each with PBS. For in-situ polymer synthesis, monomer solution (1x PBS, 2M NaCl, 8.6% sodium acrylate [408220, Sigma-Aldrich], 2.5% acrylamide [01697, Sigma-Aldrich], 0.15% N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide [M7279, Sigma-Aldrich]) was prepared as described previouslyÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asano et al., 2018</xref>).

After digestion, coverslips were removed carefully. For sample expansion, gels were immersed in water for 20 min. This step was repeated 2â3 times in fresh water until gels were totally expanded. The expanded gels were imaged with 1.49NA 100x objective operated in a spinning disk confocal mode. 3D stack was acquired every 200 nm in z axis. 3D images were rendered with ImageJ.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan 107â2112 M-001-037, 107â2313-B-001â009, and the Academia Sinica Career Development Award 2317â1040300 to WMC, T-JC, T-YC, Y-PL, TTY, and J-CL; by a MOST (108â2313-B-010â001, 108â2628-B-010â007, and 108â2638-B-010â001-MY2) awardÂ to W-JW and C-H L; and byÂ anÂ NIH grant GM088253 to M-FBT.

microtubule-organizing center, the centrosome, and also serve as basal bodies of cilia and flagella. Centriole functions partly depend of protrusions emerging from centriole surface, which are termed distal and subdistal appendages. This paper nicely combines super-resolution microscopy and CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts in human cells to reveal the molecular organization of centriole appendages. These data confirm previous observations and provide novel insight into the architecture of centriole appendages and also contribute to the ongoing discussion about the functional role and interdependence of these structures.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Super-resolution microscopy reveals coupling between mammalian centriole subdistal appendages and distal appendages&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Laurence Pelletier (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Wong and colleagues present imaging of sub-distal appendage (SDAP) architecture using quantitative dSTORM. The authors show that different SDAP proteins display different radial distributions around the mother centrioles. The authors then use similar analyses to map the lateral position occupied by each of the SDAP analysed and generate an axial and lateral composite view of SDAP organization, which suggests that ODF2 and CEP89 distribution are localized to both DAPs and SDAP region consistent with a potential positional relationship between these structures. The authors then go on to show that ODF2, CEP89 and Ninein distribution is differentially regulated upon the perturbation of DAP and SDAP integrity using CRISPR KO cell lines. The authors then demonstrate a small but reproducible reduction in the number of microtubules anchored in the vicinity of SDAP in CEP128 KO cells. Finally, the authors present data suggesting that the majority of Î³-tubulin adjacent to the mother centriole does not appear to correlate with anchored microtubules at SDAPs in cells that are in G0 phase. Overall, this is a very nice paper, with high-quality quantitative sub-diffraction imaging of centriolar appendages. Although some of the data is somewhat preliminary, the results presented here expose both a positional and functional relationship between DAPs and SDAPs and begin to reveal a more direct role for SDAPs in microtubule anchoring at centrosomes, which will stimulate further work in these areas.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most important problem with this work is that conclusions derived from STORM-based analyses are not corroborated by ultrastructural analysis.</p><p>Specifically, Figure 3 shows a 3D model of SDAPs. The model shows nine subdistal appendages. Since SDAPs occupy more than one microtubule triplet, the model presented in Figure 3 might not reflect the actual organization of SDAPs in RPE-1 cells. In addition, it is not obvious how this model was deduced from presented STORM data, which itself did not reveal a nine-fold distribution of most SDAP proteins. The authors will either need prove their model by performing EM analysis, or clarify that this is a speculative model. As it is now, it may suggest the wrong concept of SDAP architecture in mammalian cells. Please see PMID: 30045886, a recent review on this subject.</p><p>Further, in Figure 4I, which summarizes the localization changes of SDAP proteins in Cep128-/- and Cep83-/- cells, some type of appendage is drawn at the distal centriole end. Do authors mean to say that in the absence of distal appendages, subdistal appendages form at the centriole's very distal ends? If so, it would be critical to perform an EM analysis of wild type and knockout centrioles and to show whether there are any structural changes associated with centriole distal ends. Otherwise, it needs to be clear that the model is speculative. The cartoon in Figure 6G is not corroborated by STORM or ultrastructural analysis either.</p><p>In summary, it should be possible to perform some classical EM to, at minimum, to investigate whether in knockout cells lacking DAPs sub distal-like structures form at the distal ends of centrioles. If the models and cartoons cannot be proven by EM, then it would be essential to state very clearly that these models and cartoons are speculative.</p><p>2) Figure 4A-C. The authors show that after Cep128 and Cep83 knockout ODF2 STORM signal changes, losing its proximal portion after Cep128 removal. The same seems to occur after Cep83 depletion but it is not clear from Figure 4D which portion of ODF2 is lost after Cep83 depletion. However, based on 4B and C, there is a ~50 nm gap between Sclt-1 and ODF2 protein signals in Cep128-/- cells. Also, the brightest portion of the ODF2 signal is shifted for additional ~50 nm toward centriole proximal end. This is not consistent with the authors' interpretation of the data. Since it has been previously shown that ODF2 interacts with Cep128 via its N terminus which extends further away from centrioles, one interpretation why ODF2 signal changes in Cep128-/- cells could be that without its natural binding partner, it changes its configuration from more to less extended, changing the shape of the STORM signal.</p><p>3) The quality of some STORM images raises concerns. For instance, even a well characterized distal appendage protein SCLT-1, which is known to reproducibly localizes to nine discrete foci here on longitudinally analyzed centrioles shows a highly variable and irreproducible pattern. This raises a question about the reproducibility and reliability of other STORM signals, specifically in Figure 4G-H and 6C where Ninein and Î-tubulin signals are very variable from one centriole to another. CP110 signal in Figure 4G is also of a poor quality, showing nonspecific signals. It is not clear how reliably it detects centriole distal ends. RPE-1 cells used in this study are supposed to be serum starved and, based on published data, majority of cells should have a cilium and should not have CP110 at centrioles.</p><p>Related to this: The authors use 24hours of FBS to synchronize cells in G0 and allow for, or not, cilia formation. Do the authors know how robust the G0 arrest and what % ciliation they achieve? It is unclear from looking at the data if they are imaging ciliated cells or not. More robust cell cycle arrest protocols could have been used or an additional cilia marker incorporated in their analysis to ensure differences observed in the +/- FBS conditions represents cell cycle modulation or the presence or not of a primary cilium.</p><p>4) Introduction: The authors claim that no clear EM image of SDAPs has been reported for human RPE-1 cells. This statement seems inaccurate, considering that there is a plethora of electron micrographs showing both sets of appendages in this cell line (for instance: PMID: 30988386, PMID: 23253480, PMID: 26675238, PMID: 25686250, PMID: 26880200... and more). It thus appears that SDAPs of RPE-1 cells are documented across literature appear to be present in variable number, that they can adopt various morphology (based on electron densities) and that they are associated with microtubules at their ends.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Super-resolution microscopy reveals coupling between mammalian centriole subdistal appendages and distal appendages&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

They concluded that the TEM analysis supports the nine-ness in the organization of sDAS. However, there are several issues with this interpretation and, consequently, with the model.</p><p>Subsection 'ODF2 is close to the centriole microtubule wall whereas ninein and CEP170 are close to the sDAP tips' states that &quot;The TEM images reveal that sDAP backbone can be mostly observed in the same section with a nine-fold arrangement&quot;. It appears that this conclusion was derived from only one cross-sectioned centriole (which is not adequate). The number of centrioles analyzed in cross section is not indicated But I saw only one analyzed centriole with eight instead of nine distinguishable sDA densities (marked by the asterix, one density which is detected in two adjacent sections is marked twice). So, in my view, presented electron micrograph clashes with author's interpretation. It demonstrates the lack of heterogeneity in the appearance of SDA in EM and questions the nine-fold arrangement of sDAs,</p><p>The authors explained (subsection 'Axial and lateral images compose a 3D molecular map of sDAPs' and rebuttal) that they used two studies to model SDAs. These are: Anderson et al., (PMID: 5064817), a study performed in cells from Rhesus monkey oviduct, and Paintrand et al., (PMID: 1486002), a study conducted on isolated centrioles from lymphoblastoid cell line.</p><p>Anderson study explores basal bodies which sport only one basal foot positioned in the middle of the basal body longitudinal axes. Moreover, the authors say that the &quot;structure at the longitudinal position proximal to the DAPs is the basal foot, a 'badminton-shaped' structure largely different from the sDAPs in the mother centriole&quot;. It is, therefore, confusing how can Anderson model was used to model SDAs in RPE-1.</p><p>Paintrand study, another work used to model SDAs, describes centrioles isolated from lymphoblastoid cells. Since during centriole isolation the heads of SDAs are frequently lost, their conical appearance may as well be perturbed So, again, it is not clear how SDAs from this study can be taken as a benchmark for modeling od sDAs in intact cells. It is not obvious whether authors realize that most centriole electrographs presented in Paintrand study were additionally digitally modified (rotationally averaged) with the purpose to highlight specific discussion points. Such averaging will inevitably result in the appearance of nine subdistal appendages. Centrioles from the same study that were not rotationally averaged clearly show a variable number of sDAs and their more conical shape of sDA's densities (for instance see Figure 10.)</p><p>Therefore, the following interpretation of sDA morphology in the introduction paragraph needs to be changed. After all, author's own EM data is not in agreement with their own description.</p><p>Introduction: &quot;When sDAPs do form a complete ring of a nine-fold symmetry, its symmetric pattern is different from that of DAPs (Uzbekov and Alieva, 2018), with one pairs of parallel electron-dense &quot;spokes&quot; in each arm, where one of the spokes is associated with the A-tubule of a MT triplet of the mother centriole and the other is associated with the C-tubule of an adjacent MT triplet...&quot;. It is also unclear why was Uzbekov and Alieva cited here, the centriole in question is taken over from Paintrand study.</p><p>EM analysis of SDAs of longitudinally positioned centrioles is now included in the manuscript (Figure 4J). It reveals variability in the shape of sDAs. All six appendages in wild type RPE cells are different in their morphology (not all have the same triangular shape) and they don't point in the same direction. It would be useful to accordingly adjust the interpretation in subsection 'Ninein covers a broadened longitudinal region toward the centriole distal end upon DAP removal'.</p><p>EM analysis of sDAs in Cep83-/- cells has revealed centrioles with somewhat uneven length and with sDAs positioned at various distances from both centriole's ends. Fewer sDA EM densities are also present in Cep83-\- cells. How this asymmetry is not reflected in the radial distribution of STORM Ninein signal, which remained more-less symmetrical organized around mother centriole? It is surprising that, given this revelation, the analysis of additional sDAPs has not been added to the analysis.</p><p>Introduction: &quot;Loncarek group further used correlative super-resolution microscopy and EM to show precise localization of DAP proteins relative to the electron dense blade structure (Bowler et al., 2019), improving the architectural mapping of the DAPs&quot;. Please note that Bowler at al. used tomography to elucidate the organization of DA's electron densities, which argued against the notion that DAs are organized as blades.</p><p>The text says: &quot;To understand the architecture of protein complexes at their mature stage in terms of structural occupancy, we further analyzed super-resolution images of those with nearly full ring occupancies for each sDAP protein.</p><p>What does it mean their mature stage? Were centrioles somehow pre-selected for imaging based on whether they saw a ring or not by wide field microscopy? Structural occupancy is unclear. I think that I understand the meaning, but the sentence could be re-phrased.</p><p>Arbitrary terminology seems to be used to describe the morphology of sDAs (&quot;SDAP backbone&quot;, &quot;sDAP arms&quot;, &quot;spokes&quot;, &quot;badminton-shaped, &quot;root&quot;...). It is confusing. sDA's parts are usually described as a head and a stem. At least these terms need to be defined.</p><p>Further proofreading is necessary. Some sentences are illogical; it is hard to understand what they meant. For instance: The title of the Figure 6 says: &quot;Î³ tubulins around mother centriole do not nucleate MT anchoring at the sDAPs in the G0 phase&quot;. What does it mean that anchoring is not nucleated? The abbreviation &quot;sDAP&quot; appears erroneously used on some places. &quot;sDAP protein&quot; and &quot;DAP protein&quot; is also used, although &quot;P&quot; already stands for &quot;protein&quot;...</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53580.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most important problem with this work is that conclusions derived from STORM-based analyses are not corroborated by ultrastructural analysis.</p><p>Specifically, Figure 3 shows a 3D model of SDAPs.

Here to confirm the organization of sDAP backbone in RPE-1 cells, we have followsfollows the reviewer's suggestion and performed serial TEM sectioning of RPE-1 centrioles in the axial view, shown in Figure 1I. The TEM data reveals that sDAP backbone can be mostly observed in the same section with a nine-fold arrangement. It is also interesting to note that the sDAP arms are mostly wider than those of DAPs, similar to the observation recorded in Bornens' paper. Therefore, in our model, we constructed a nine-fold distribution of sDAPs. We have added this figure to the main text to support our model (Figure 1I). From the EM image, it seems that the arms of sDAPs are more flexible in shape and distribution than those of DAPs, potentially reflecting why the nine-fold symmetry is less obvious for the localization of sDAP proteins. We have stated the structural characteristics of the sDAP EM image as discussed above in the main text.</p><p>Our 3D model was constructed by combining measurements from previous studies, our current TEM results, and our dSTORM data, aiming to provide a view of the potential sDAP structure. Nonetheless, we also cannot rule out that sDAPs in RPE-1 cells may also be a dynamic structure as reported in PMID: 30045886, and therefore this sDAP structure may possibly reflect the organization of sDAPs at a subset of centrioles. We have thus edited the manuscript from subsection 'Axial and lateral images compose a 3D molecular map of sDA' to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, in Figure 4I, which summarizes the localization changes of SDAP proteins in Cep128-/- and Cep83-/- cells, some type of appendage is drawn at the distal centriole end.

If so, it would be critical to perform an EM analysis of wild type and knockout centrioles and to show whether there are any structural changes associated with centriole distal ends. Otherwise, it needs to be clear that the model is speculative. The cartoon in Figure 6G is not corroborated by STORM or ultrastructural analysis either.</p><p>In summary, it should be possible to perform some classical EM to, at minimum, to investigate whether in knockout cells lacking DAPs sub distal-like structures form at the distal ends of centrioles. If the models and cartoons cannot be proven by EM, then it would be essential to state very clearly that these models and cartoons are speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer's comment. We have followsfollows the suggestion and performed TEM to examine the differences of sDAP structures between wild type and CEP83<sup>-/-</sup> RPE-1 cells, as shown in Figure 4J. In wild type cells, sDAPs (or sub distal-like structure as mentioned by the reviewer) mostly maintain their longitudinal position, with the triangular arms pointing toward the direction close to perpendicular to the centriole orientation (Figure 4J, left panel). Surprisingly, we found that the positions and shapes of the arms of sDAPs are largely varying in CEP83 depleted cells, showing with more examples to illustrate the variations (Figure 4J, right panel). That is, the sDAP structure is much less stable when DAPs are missing. Specifically, a few examples show that sDAP tips may point toward the distal end with a thicker arm, consistent with what we observed in ninein super-resolution images of CEP83<sup>-/-</sup> cells. This is in line with the previous TEM study of CEP164 knockdown RPE-1 centrioles (PMID: 23253480), where EM images show that sDAPs are titled toward the distal end. In other cases, sDAPs can localize at the middle region of the centriole, occupy the same side of the centriole, miss one side of occupancy, or localize at different longitudinal positions in the same centriole. These large variations imply that the loss of DAPs via CEP83 depletion affects the structural stability of sDAPs, reassuring that DAPs and sDAPs are structurally related to each other.</p><p>In accordance with these TEM results, we have revised our cartoon model for CEP83<sup>-/-</sup> centrioles to demonstrate possible structural variations (Figure 4K).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 4A-C. The authors show that after Cep128 and Cep83 knockout ODF2 STORM signal changes, losing its proximal portion after Cep128 removal. The same seems to occur after Cep83 depletion but it is not clear from Figure 4D which portion of ODF2 is lost after Cep83 depletion. However, based on 4B and C, there is a ~50 nm gap between Sclt-1 and ODF2 protein signals in Cep128-/- cells. Also, the brightest portion of the ODF2 signal is shifted for additional ~50 nm toward centriole proximal end. This is not consistent with the authors' interpretation of the data. Since it has been previously shown that ODF2 interacts with Cep128 via its N terminus which extends further away from centrioles, one interpretation why ODF2 signal changes in Cep128-/- cells could be that without its natural binding partner, it changes its configuration from more to less extended, changing the shape of the STORM signal.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for providing us insight into the potential change of ODF2 configuration upon CEP128 depletion. To further examine the idea, we used two different antibodies targeting both the N terminus and C terminus of ODF2 to examine their distribution differences in wild type and CEP128 depleted cells. The ODF2 antibody (HPA001874, Î£-Aldrich) we used in the manuscript targets the N terminus of ODF2, i.e. aa #39-200, out of its 829 amino acids, referred to as ODF2-N. We used another commercial antibody (ab43840, Abcam) that targets the C terminus of ODF2 (aa #800 to the C terminus), referred to as ODF2-C. dSTORM imaging of ODF2-C reveals that in wild type cells, ODF2-C distribution is wider than ODF2-N distribution in the radial direction (Figure 4B, 4C). In addition, ODF2-N extends more toward the proximal end than ODF2-C in the longitudinal direction, consistent with the CEP128 interaction result in PMID30623524. The distal edge of ODF2-C is closer to SCLT1 than that of ODF2-N, more reaching the centriole distal end. Interestingly, when CEP128 is depleted, distributions of both ODF2-N and ODF2-C become thinner. The gap between ODF2-N/C and SCLT1 of CEP128<sup>-/-</sup> cells is larger than that of the wild type cells, illustrating both narrowing and shifting of ODF2 occupancy upon sDAP CEP128 depletion. These observations imply that CEP128, as the binding partner of ODF2, regulates the organization of ODF2. We have added these results to Figure 4B-4D in the main text (subsection 'ODF2 and CEP89 localizations are differentially regulated by DAP and sDAP integrity'). It remains to be examined what exactly the thinner layer of ODF2 in CEP128<sup>-/-</sup> cells belongs to. One speculation is that the sDAP depletion results in the removal of ODF2 in the sDAP layer. We have stated clearly that this is only a speculation in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The quality of some STORM images raises concerns. For instance, even a well-characterized distal appendage protein SCLT-1, which is known to reproducibly localizes to nine discrete foci here on longitudinally analyzed centrioles shows a highly variable and irreproducible pattern. This raises a question about the reproducibility and reliability of other STORM signals, specifically in Figure 4G-H and 6C where Ninein and Î-tubulin signals are very variable from one centriole to another. CP110 signal in Figure 4G is also of a poor quality, showing nonspecific signals. It is not clear how reliably it detects centriole distal ends. RPE-1 cells used in this study are supposed to be serum starved and, based on published data, majority of cells should have a cilium and should not have CP110 at centrioles.</p></disp-quote><p>In dual color dSTORM imaging, we used Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647) and Cy3b dyes for immunostaining. Out of the two dyes, AF647 performs better than Cy3b in terms of its blinking property, which provides images with a more homogeneous intensity. Therefore, we always mark our protein of interest with AF647 and use Cy3b as the reference marker. The aim of Figure 6B was to measure the diameter of Î³-tubulin. Therefore, in Figure 6B, Î³-tubulin was marked by AF647 dye while SCLT1 was used as a reference for the axial orientation. To illustrate the difference, here we have also imaged the SCLT1/Î³-tubulin pair in a reverse manner, i.e. marking SCLT1 with AF647 and Î³-tubulin with Cy3b as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, Right panel).

It thus appears that SDAPs of RPE-1 cells are documented across literature appear to be present in variable number, that they can adopt various morphology (based on electron densities) and that they are associated with microtubules at their ends.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the advice. We have removed the sentence 'no clear EM image of SDAPs has been reported for human RPE-1 cells' in the Introduction to avoid confusion. The list of articles suggested by the reviewer includes TEM images of PRE-1 centriole in the lateral view upon CEP120 knockout (PMID: 30988386), CEP164 knockdown (PMID: 23253480), WDR8 knockdown (PMID: 26675238), EHD1 knockdown (PMID: 25686250) and NEDD1 overexpression (PMID: 26880200). CEP164 is a DAP protein among these proteins. Interestingly, from the siCEP164 EM images (PMID: 23253480), we also observed tilted sDAP structure similar to that of our CEP83 depleted RPE-1 centrioles (Figure 1G of PMID: 23253480). This data echoes with our observation that loss of DAP affects sDAP stability, suggesting a structural relationship between them.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the biggest issue remains the interpretation of the data and the model.</p><p>The authors have performed TEM analysis to understand the organization of subdistal appendages in starved RPE-1 cells (now shown in Figure 1I).

It appears that this conclusion was derived from only one cross-sectioned centriole (which is not adequate). The number of centrioles analyzed in cross section is not indicated but I saw only one analyzed centriole with eight instead of nine distinguishable sDA densities (marked by the asterix, one density which is detected in two adjacent sections is marked twice). So, in my view, presented electron micrograph clashes with author's interpretation. It demonstrates the lack of heterogeneity in the appearance of SDA in EM and questions the nine-fold arrangement of sDAs,</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. The serial cross-sectioned TEM images in Figure 1I are from one centriole (as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6A</xref>). To further elaborate our finding, we have reassured the alignment of images Z4 and Z5 using the original EM images as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6B</xref>. By further aligning the nine triplets of the centriole, we find that the missing sDAP in image Z4 between two adjacent triplets is indeed present in image Z5. We have stacked the serial TEM images and removed interference from the DAP signal to form a composite image and illustrate the nine sDAP EM signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6C, D</xref>). We have also performed an additional centriole TEM sectioning as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig7">Author response image 7</xref>. After stacking and removing signals from DAP, we also observed nine sDAPs in this centriole. We agree with the reviewer and a recent review about sDAPs (Uzbekov and Alieva, 2018) that sDAPs are dynamic and varying structures, especially in the number of appendages as we mentioned in the Introduction that the range of 2-12 sDAPs has been reported. We do not intend to use our TEM images to claim a consistent nine-fold organization of sDAPs as that of the DAPs, as we have shown that in the beginning of the Results section (Figure 1A-1F). Our 3D model represents one potential organization of sDAPs, assuming the condition when the sDAP region is fully occupied and each sDAP stem is found between two microtubule triplets. We have also emphasized as in subsection 'Axial and lateral images compose a 3D molecular map of sDAPs' that our model is an example for the potential organization of a subset of sDAPs with the sentence 'Note that because the structures of sDAPs are dynamic (Uzbekov and Alieva, 2018), this model only represents one possible organization of sDAPs in a subset of centrioles, such that other settings may also exist.'</p><fig id="sa2fig6"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Serial TEM imaging of a mother centriole in a wild type RPE-1 cell from Figure 1I.</title><p>(A) The serial TEM sections from Figure 1I.

Since during centriole isolation the heads of SDAs are frequently lost, their conical appearance may as well be perturbed So, again, it is not clear how SDAs from this study can be taken as a benchmark for modeling od sDAs in intact cells. It is not obvious whether authors realize that most centriole electrographs presented in Paintrand study were additionally digitally modified (rotationally averaged) with the purpose to highlight specific discussion points. Such averaging will inevitably result in the appearance of nine subdistal appendages. Centrioles from the same study that were not rotationally averaged clearly show a variable number of sDAs and their more conical shape of sDA's densities (for instance see Figure 10.)</p><p>Therefore, the following interpretation of sDA morphology in the introduction paragraph needs to be changed.

The two models from Anderson's TEM study and Paintrand's study, which we used as references for our 3D centriole model, were actually used to construct (1) the centriole wall with the distal appendages and (2) the subdistal appendages, respectively. The same as we mentioned above, we agree with the reviewer that the number of sDAP varies as shown in Figure 9 of Paintrand's paper Figure , in which a range of around 3-9 sDAPs can be observed. We also realize that some of the images in Paintrand's study were rotationally averaged. However, the presence of nine sDAP stems was also observed in a few of the non-averaged images as shown in Figure 3 Figure and Figure 9 from Paintrand's work. Again, we do not intend to emphasize a consistent nine-fold arrangement of sDAP. Our model represents one of the potential arrangements existing in a subset of sDAPs, as we clarified in subsection 'Axial and lateral images compose a 3D molecular map of sDAPs'. The main goal of constructing a 3D model is to provide a schematic view on the potential positioning of sDAP proteins on the mother centriole.</p><p>To avoid confusion, we have edited the sentences to further clarify the construction of our 3D model and emphasize the dynamic nature of sDAP structure starting from subsection 'Axial and lateral images compose a 3D molecular map of sDAPs' as follows: &quot;The model of the centriole and the DAPs are based on previous TEM serial sections of the monkey oviduct basal body (Anderson, 1972); the sDAP model is constructed based on the TEM study of centrioles from a human lymphoblastoma cell line (Paintrand et al., 1992) and our sDAP TEM results (Figure 1I).

That is, in contrast to the exact number of nine DAPs per centriole, the number of sDAPs may be different in different centrioles (Uzbekov and Alieva, 2018). Even when sDAPs do form a complete ring of a nine-fold symmetry, its morphology is different from that of DAPs (Paintrand et al., 1992, Uzbekov and Alieva, 2018). Each sDAP stem is composed of one pair of electron-dense signals on the sides, where one of them is associated with the A-tubule of a MT triplet of the mother centriole and the other is associated with the C-tubule of an adjacent MT triplet (Bystrevskaya et al., 1988, Paintrand et al., 1992).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>EM analysis of SDAs of longitudinally positioned centrioles is now included in the manuscript (Figure 4J).

How this asymmetry is not reflected in the radial distribution of STORM Ninein signal, which remained more-less symmetrical organized around mother centriole? It is surprising that, given this revelation, the analysis of additional sDAPs has not been added to the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Comparing our EM analysis of Cep83<sup>-/-</sup> cells with our dSTORM images for longitudinal distribution of ninein (Figure 4H, middle panel), we agree with the reviewer that the ninein dSTORM signal does not show a high level of asymmetry. This is related to our centriole pre-selection process prior to dSTORM imaging. Since the DAP proteins are absent in CEP83<sup>-/-</sup> cells, SCLT1 or any other large diameter DAP protein cannot be used as a marker for the centriole orientation. Therefore, when we imaged ninein in CEP83<sup>-/-</sup> cells, ninein itself was also used as an orientation marker. In our experiment, we co-stained CP110, ninein and centrin in CEP83<sup>-/-</sup> cells as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig8">Author response image 8</xref>. To identify a laterally oriented mother centriole, centrin is observed in widefield imaging as a rod-shaped structure (centriole) with ninein at the sDAP region perpendicular to the centriole; while CP110 on a mother centriole localizes at the edge of the centriole 'rod' close to ninein at sDAP region, serving as a reference for the distal end. With this pre-selection process, the ninein that lacks either left or right signal at the sDAP region (similar to those CEP83<sup>-/-</sup> cells that lack one of the electron density signals at sDAPs) would not be selected because it was challenging to assure that these centrioles were parallel to the imaging plane and thus to image them from a lateral view point. The ninein selected for dSTORM imaging would be the one with both left and right signals. Indeed, in the dSTORM imaging, the ninein signal is less asymmetric (Figure 4H, middle panel), but their distribution pattern is comparable to one of the EM images in CEP83<sup>-/-</sup> cells (Figure 4J, right panel) in which sDAPs are present on both sides and occupy a wider longitudinal space than those of the wild type cells. Thus, our ninein images reflect its distribution in a subset of centrioles, and this centriole pre-selection process should be the reason why the left-right asymmetry is less obvious in dSTORM images of ninein. To clarify this, we have added a sentence in subsection 'Ninein covers a broadened longitudinal region toward the centriole distal end upon DAP removal' as follows: &quot;Note that laterally oriented centrioles were preselected by the pattern of centrin and ninein under widefield imaging prior to dSTORM imaging; therefore, unlike the asymmetry of sDAP stems observed in the EM images of CEP83<sup>-/-</sup> cells (Figure 4J, right panel), asymmetry of ninein is less obvious in the ninein super-resolution images of CEP83<sup>-/-</sup> cells (Figure 4H).&quot;</p><fig id="sa2fig8"><label>Author response image 8.</label><caption><title>Widefield imaging of a centriole in the lateral view.</title><p>Bar = 2um.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53580-resp-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction: &quot;Loncarek group further used correlative super-resolution microscopy and EM to show precise localization of DAP proteins relative to the electron dense blade structure (Bowler et al., 2019), improving the architectural mapping of the DAPs&quot;.

To clarify, we have rephrased the sentences in subsection 'ODF2 is close to the centriole microtubule wall whereas ninein and CEP170 are close to the sDAP tips' as follows.</p><p>&quot;To understand the architecture of sDAP proteins with nearly full occupancies at the sDAPs, we pre-selected centrioles based on whether we saw a ring or not for an sDAP protein of interest by widefield microscopy and further analyzed them with super-resolution microscopy.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Arbitrary terminology seems to be used to describe the morphology of sDAs (&quot;SDAP backbone&quot;, &quot;sDAP arms&quot;, &quot;spokes&quot;, &quot;badminton-shaped, &quot;root&quot;...). It is confusing. sDA's parts are usually described as a head and a stem. At least these terms need to be defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We used 'DAP arm' as in the Boren's paper (Paintrand et al., 1992) to represent a single sDAP stem, 'DAP backbone' to describe the entire sDAP structure on the mother centriole and 'spokes' to refer to the electron dense signal on each side of a sDAP stem. To avoid confusion, we have adapted the term 'sDAP stem(s)' for sDAP arm or backbone and removed the term 'spokes'.</p><p>The term 'root' means the portion of a sDAP stem which connects the centriole wall. We have further clarified its definition when it first appeared in subsection 'Lateral super-resolution images reveal sDAP as a triangular structure'.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further proofreading is necessary. Some sentences are illogical; it is hard to understand what they meant. For instance: The title of the Figure 6 says: &quot;Î³ tubulins around mother centriole do not nucleate MT anchoring at the sDAPs in the G0 phase&quot;. What does it mean that anchoring is not nucleated?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the reminder. To avoid confusion, we have corrected the title of Figure 6 to &quot;A majority of Î³-tubulins around the mother centriole are not associated with MT anchoring at sDAPs in the G0 phase&quot;. We have also proofread the entire manuscript carefully and made several changes in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The abbreviation &quot;sDAP&quot; appears erroneously used on some places. &quot;sDAP protein&quot; and &quot;DAP protein&quot; is also used, although &quot;P&quot; already stands for &quot;protein&quot;...</p></disp-quote><p>We also noticed that various short forms exist in the literature for distal appendages (e.g. DA, DAP, DAPs) and subdistal appendages (e.g. sDA, SDA, sDAP, sDAPs). In our work, we used sDAP and DAP as the abbreviation for subdistal appendage and distal appendage, respectively, following papers such as PMID: 24882706, PMID: 24231678 and PMID: 29514088. These terms are defined when they first appear in the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
