How ubiquitous chaperone machineries direct their activities towards specific sets of substrates is unclear. Through the use of mouse genetics, imaging and quantitative proteomics we uncover that ZMYND10 is a novel co-chaperone that confers specificity for the FKBP8-HSP90 chaperone complex towards axonemal dynein clients required for cilia motility. Loss of ZMYND10 perturbs the chaperoning of axonemal dynein heavy chains, triggering broader degradation of dynein motor subunits. We show that pharmacological inhibition of FKBP8 phenocopies dynein motor instability associated with the loss of ZMYND10 in airway cells and that human disease-causing variants of ZMYND10 disrupt its ability to act as an FKBP8-HSP90 co-chaperone. Our study indicates that primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), caused by mutations in dynein assembly factors disrupting cytoplasmic pre-assembly of axonemal dynein motors, should be considered a cell-type specific protein-misfolding disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>macromolecular assembly</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>human disease</kwd><kwd>proteastasis</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC_UU_12018/26</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mali</surname><given-names>Girish R</given-names></name><name><surname>Yeyati</surname><given-names>Patricia L</given-names></name><name><surname>Dodd</surname><given-names>Daniel O</given-names></name><name><surname>Tennant</surname><given-names>Peter A</given-names></name><name><surname>Keighren</surname><given-names>Margaret A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mill</surname><given-names>Pleasantine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia-Munoz</surname><given-names>Amaya</given-names></name><name><surname>von Kreisheim</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000582</institution-id><institution>Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mali</surname><given-names>Girish R</given-names></name><name><surname>Jarman</surname><given-names>Andrew Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Mill</surname><given-names>Pleasantine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chaperoning defects in axonemal dynein subunits trigger proteostatic clearance of dynein motors opening up the possibility of trialling proteostasis modulators to treat the motile ciliopathy primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macromolecular motors of the dynein family power the essential beating of motile cilia/flagella. Motile cilia propel sperm cells, generate mucociliary clearance in airways, modulate nodal flow for embryonic left-right patterning and circulate cerebrospinal fluid inside the brain. Force-generating dynein motors are large molecular complexes visible by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as ‘outer’ and ‘inner dynein arms’ (ODA, IDA) spaced at regular intervals along the microtubule axoneme. Each ODA motor consists of catalytic heavy chains (HC), intermediate chains (IC) and light chains (LC); IDAs have a more heterogeneous composition. In mammals, at least 4 ODA and 7 IDA subtypes exist, each containing different HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kollmar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wickstead and Gull, 2007</xref>). Defective dyneins render cilia immotile, resulting in the severe congenital ciliopathy in humans termed Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD, OMIM: 242650). Understanding the molecular causes of PCD requires addressing how complex molecular machines like the dyneins get built during cilium biogenesis.</p><p>PCD-causing mutations are most frequently detected in genes encoding structural ODA subunits such as the intermediate chains (<italic>DNAI1</italic> and <italic>DNAI2</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pennarun et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guichard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loges et al., 2008</xref>]), or the catalytic heavy chain (<italic>DNAH5</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olbrich et al., 2002</xref>]), all of which disrupt motor assembly and/or function. Consequently, mutant multiciliated cells form cilia but these fail to move, lacking ODAs by TEM or immunofluorescence.</p><p>In addition to these structural subunits of dynein motors, several PCD-causing mutations are also found in a newly discovered set of genes, the ‘dynein axonemal assembly factors’ (DNAAFs) whose functions are poorly understood. DNAAFs are proposed to assist heat shock protein (HSP) chaperones to promote subunit folding and cytoplasmic pre-assembly of dynein motors. DNAAFs are presumed to act as cilial-specific co-chaperones based on proteomic identification of interactions with both ‘client’ dynein chains and canonical chaperones. Of the known assembly factors, KTU/DNAAF2 and DYX1C1/DNAAF4 have the most direct biochemical links to HSP90 and HSP70 chaperones, as well as ODA intermediate chain DNAI2 (IC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Omran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tarkar et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, KTU/DNAAF2, PIH1D3/DNAAF6 and SPAG1 share structural domains with key non-catalytic subunits of the R2TP-HSP90 chaperoning complex, PIH1 and TAH1, respectively. R2TP is a well established HSP90 co-chaperone which confers specificity during the assembly of multisubunit enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pal et al., 2014</xref>). DYX1C1/DNAAF4 and LRRC6 each have a CS or p23-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tarkar et al., 2013</xref>), p23 being a well characterised HSP90 co-chaperone acting during the last steps of the HSP90 chaperone cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Buchner, 2013</xref>). Interactions between LRRC6, DNAAF1/LRRC50 and C21ORF59/Kurly/CFAP298 were also recently reported which, coupled with the phenotypic analysis of <italic>Lrrc6</italic> mutant mice, suggests that these assembly factors may function together in a late-acting complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inaba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaffe et al., 2016</xref>). The functions of DNAAF3 and DNAAF5/HEATR2 which have no reported links to chaperones, remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diggle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitchison et al., 2012</xref>). Altogether, the current view is that many DNAAFs transiently participate as HSP90 co-chaperones during the macromolecular assembly of dynein motors before they are finally transported into the cilia.</p><p>Dynein pre-assembly has been well studied in unicellular eukaryotes such as <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Paramecium.</italic> For ODAs in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, affinity purification confirmed all three HCs (HCs; α, β, and γ, each of ∼500 kDa) and two ICs (IC1, 78 kDa; IC2, 69 kDa) are pre-assembled as a three headed complex and exist in a cytoplasmic pool prior to ciliary entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fok et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fowkes and Mitchell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qin et al., 2004</xref>). This cytoplasmic pre-assembly pathway is highly conserved and exists in all ciliated eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kobayashi and Takeda, 2012</xref>). While it is clear that the aforementioned assembly factors aid axonemal dynein pre-assembly, their precise molecular functions within the pre-assembly pathway still remain largely unknown.</p><p>Previous studies had established a strong genetic link between loss of ZMYND10, a putative DNAAF, and perturbations in dynein pre-assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurkowiak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zariwala et al., 2013</xref>), however the molecular role of ZMYND10 as a DNAAF in this process remained unclear. In order to probe the mammalian dynein pre-assembly pathway in greater molecular and cellular detail, we generated <italic>Zmynd10</italic> null mice by CRISPR genome editing. We used different motile ciliated lineages at distinct stages of differentiation from our mammalian mutant model to ascribe a molecular role to ZMYND10 within the dynein pre-assembly pathway.</p><p>Our studies implicate a novel chaperone complex comprising of ZMYND10, FKBP8 and HSP90 in the maturation of dynein HC clients and provide novel evidence of the temporally restricted nature of interactions within this chaperone-relay system, later involving LRRC6 likely to promote stable inter-subunit interactions. We postulate that a chaperone-relay system comprising of several discrete chaperone complexes handles the folding and stability of distinct dynein subunits all the while preventing spurious interactions during cytoplasmic pre-assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a mammalian PCD model to characterize dynein assembly</title><p>We targeted exon 6 of mouse <italic>Zmynd10</italic> to target all predicted protein isoforms, with three guide RNA (gRNA) sequences for CRISPR genome editing and generated several founders with insertion, deletion and inversion mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The process of mammalian cytoplasmic pre-assembly in terms of dynamics of localization and levels of dynein subunits has been previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diggle et al., 2014</xref>). ‘Immature’ cells stain strongly for dynein subunits within the cytoplasm, they appear rounder and their cilia are apparently shorter than those cells in which dynein subunits exclusively stain the ciliary compartment. Using Sentan as an independent marker for ‘mature’ motile cilia, we were able to detect a strong, focused signal at the tips of cilia with exclusively ciliary staining of axonemal dyneins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lower left inset). Sentan is a component of the apical ciliary crown structure of mature motile cilia, where peripheral singlet microtubules are capped by electron dense material abutting the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubo et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, in cells without clear apical Sentan signal, shorter cilia and cytoplasmic staining (DNAI2, DNALI1) were observed, consistent with these cells being ‘immature’ and in the process of assembling dynein motors and cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, upper right inset). We therefore postulate that these dynamic patterns of dynein subunits represent ‘mature’ and ‘immature’ cells during assembly of motile cilia, which we can see in cells isolated from nasal turbinates of control mice (3B middle and upper panels, respectively). In <italic>Zmynd10</italic> mutants, no apparent defects in ciliary length or number were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) however outer or inner arm dyneins fail to incorporate into mature ciliary axonemes. Importantly, no cytoplasmic accumulations were noted in ‘mature’ ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> panels with arrows). Surprisingly, cytoplasmic staining was observed in both ‘immature’ control and <italic>Zmynd10</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, arrowheads). A similar staining pattern was observed for DNALI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) indicating ODA and IDA dynein subunit precursors are initially synthesised normally, further supporting that ZMYND10 loss does not impact their transcription or translation. Instead, loss of ZMYND10 leads to dyneins being robustly cleared when their pre-assembly is perturbed.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34389.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Loss of ZMYND10 perturbs sub-cellular distribution and levels of dynein complexes during pre-assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Z-projection through healthy human donor nasal brush immunofluorescence shows a mix of ‘mature’ motile ciliated cells (lower inset, arrow) with exclusively axonemal staining of dynein subunits (DNAI2 green, DNALI1 magenta) and strong foci of SENTAN (red) at cilial tips, as well as ‘immature’ cells having cytoplasmic staining of dynein subunits and no SENTAN (right inset, arrowheads).

Immature cultures were very sensitive to FKBP8 inhibition, where cytoplasmic levels of DNAH5 were reduced to ~10% of control levels after DM-CHX (150 μM). In mature cells, fully assembled complexes within cilial axonemes were less sensitive to DM-CHX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). Surprisingly, a very striking destabilization of DNAI1 was also observed in immature cultures under these conditions.

Competitive binding of LRRC6 to ZMYND10 may advance the HSP90-FKBP8 chaperone cycle taking the client DNAHs to the next stage of assembly. We propose either R2TP or a specialized R2TP-like complex may function in parallel to assemble, scaffold or tether the DNAI1-DNAI2 heterodimeric complex via the PIH-domain proteins, such as DNAAF6, DNAAF2 and PIH1D2. The TPR-domain containing SPAG1 or DNAAF4 could recruit HSP90 via its MEEVD domain and together with RUVBL1/RUVBL2 these assembly factors could form a stable platform to promote HC-IC subunit interactions. This R2TP or R2TP-like complex likely operates distinctly to ZMYND10 as DNAI1/2 heterodimers are detected in <italic>Zmynd10</italic> mutants, however, these are likely degraded if fully functional mature complexes (with heavy chains) cannot be assembled. This chaperone-relay system comprises several discrete chaperone complexes overseeing the folding and stability of discrete dynein subunits. Folding intermediates are handed off to successive complexes to promote stable interactions between subunits all the while preventing spurious interactions.

Axonemal dynein motors represent the largest and most complex of such motile ciliary components. Their coordinated transcription, translation, assembly and transport is critically linked to ciliary function. The cell appears to have evolved a dedicated chaperone relay system involving multiple assembly and transport factors to execute distinct steps for their pre-assembly, sometimes in a tissue- or ciliary domain-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dougherty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fliegauf et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamaguchi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we reveal that the DNAAF ZMYND10 co-operates with the ubiquitous co-chaperone FKBP8 and chaperone HSP90 to mediate a key step in the pre-assembly pathway, specifically maturation of axonemal dynein heavy chains. Using multiple motile ciliated tissues, including trachea, oviduct and testes, from <italic>Zmynd10</italic> null mouse models, we observed reduced protein abundances for ODA HCs (DNAH5, DNAH9) and ICs (DNAI1 and DNAI2). Proximity ligation assays and immunopurification of endogenous components suggest that unstable intermediates of axonemal dynein ODA HCs are primarily affected and unable to fully associate with the IC heterodimers which are subsequently degraded in <italic>Zmynd10</italic> mutants. We provide evidence that the PPIase activity of FKBP8 is required to stabilize wild type axonemal dynein assemblies. Specific pharmacological inhibition of FKBP8 PPIase activity phenocopies the motility defects observed in <italic>Zmynd10</italic> mutants. We also confirm that LRRC6 may participate transiently at possibly later stages in the ZMYND10-dependent HSP90 chaperone cycle.

The first one involves the multi-functional R2TP complex (RUVBL1, RUVBL2, RPAP3, PIH1D1), which is a well-characterized co-chaperone of HSP90 in the assembly of several multimeric protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kakihara and Houry, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">von Morgen et al., 2015</xref>). Recent reports have highlighted the importance of PIH-domain containing DNAAFs (DNAAF2 and DNAAF6), RPAP-domain containing SPAG1 as well as Reptin (RUVBL2) and Pontin (RUVBL1) as regulators of cilia motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Desai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">zur Lage et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Olcese et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Omran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tarkar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamaguchi et al., 2018</xref>). All of these factors bear homology to components or form part of the multi-functional R2TP complex. Functional genetic analysis of the four PIH zebrafish paralogues revealed distinct and overlapping DNAAF functions in pre-assembly of specific subsets of axonemal dynein motors, in a tissue-specific as well as axonemal domain-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamaguchi et al., 2018</xref>). Biochemical evidence from endogenous affinity purification of an R2TP adaptor, WDR92 further revealed physical associations of heavy and intermediate chains of ODA and IDA subunits with R2TP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">zur Lage et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, these studies link dynein assembly factors to a cilial-specific configuration of the HSP90-R2TP complex. However, further biochemical studies are needed to define how these different cilial-configurations of R2TP-HSP90 and dynein clients interact during the chaperone cycles operative during axonemal dynein pre-assembly. Our study uncovers a second cilial-specific configuration of the HSP90 chaperone machinery involving FKBP8 via ZMYND10 in the processing of client axonemal dynein heavy chains in all motile ciliated tissues studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We show that the unchanged transcript levels do not correlate with the reduced protein levels of axonemal dynein HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and that unstable heavy chain folding intermediates in <italic>Zmynd10</italic> mutant extracts likely result from degradation of fully translated, improperly folded axonemal dynein HCs. Our results suggest that ZMYND10 directs and drives an FKBP8-HSP90 cycle, likely involving LRRC6, aiding the maturation of axonemal dynein HC clients required for their post-translational stability.</p><p>Our multipronged approach using immunofluorescence, proteomic and endogenous interaction studies all indicate that axonemal dynein HCs are the primary clients of ZMYND10. This is in contrast to recent studies suggesting that ZMYND10’s primary targets are the ODA ICs, DNAI1 and DNAI2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurkowiak et al., 2016</xref>). Initially, neither the levels of DNAI1 and DNAI2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), nor heterodimer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) are significantly affected during cytoplasmic pre-assembly in <italic>Zmynd10</italic> mutants. Moreover, our unbiased label-free quantitative proteomics shows that ZMYND10 loss also specifically impacts IDA HC stability whilst other subunits or structures remain mostly unaffected. This is distinct from the response seen in PCD models specifically affecting ODAs wherein complete lack of or misfolding of a single heavy chain in the case of DNAH5 results in a very specific and limited loss of outer dynein arms only: in <italic>DNAH5</italic> patients, DNALI1 is still found in the ciliary axonemes and IDAs visible by TEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loges et al., 2008</xref>). The primary defects we observe support the hypothesis that aberrant HC-IC subunit association and/or the misfolded HC polypeptides themselves trigger a robust proteostatic response leading to clearance of non-functional ODA and IDA complexes to mitigate cellular protein stress.</p><p>Our study goes towards addressing a long-standing question of where dynein pre-assembly occurs within the cytoplasm. Our interaction and mutational studies define a novel ZMYND10-FKBP8-HSP90 complex functioning in dynein pre-assembly, where FKBP8 could tether HC folding to endomembranes. The participation of FKBP8-HSP90 chaperone complex in protein folding, activation and clearance has been extensively documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banasavadi-Siddegowda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barth et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edlich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hutt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saita et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taipale et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Given the role of this complex in folding and maturation of CFTR on the cytosolic face of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hutt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2006</xref>), it raises the possibility that during early stages of pre-assembly, axonemal dynein heavy chains could also be localized to the cytosolic face of the ER through ZMYND10’s association with FKBP8. Future work should be directed to further pinpoint where different assembly steps occur within the cytoplasm. It would be tempting to speculate that properly folded dynein HCs are subsequently exchanged in the recently described dynamic cytoplasmic puncta containing rapidly fluxing DNAAFs and less mobile dynein subunits as shown for DNAI2 and DNALI1, structures termed dynein assembly particles or DynAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huizar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2017</xref>). This ‘phase-separated organelle’ model is attractive as increasing local concentration of specific DNAAF complexes could help overcome the apparently low binding affinities between different DNAAFs except in these molecular condensates. Indeed, we have been unable to capture endogenous interactions between LRRC6 and ZMYND10 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zariwala et al., 2013</xref>]), suggesting their physiological interactions may be highly transient or temporally restricted, as opposed to existing in stable complexes.</p><p>Taken together, we propose a revised model of the dynein preassembly pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), where multiple roles for HSP90 are emerging. Here, ZMYND10 acts as a novel co-chaperone of the ubiquitous FKBP8-HSP90 chaperone complex for axonemal dynein HC subunit maturation. Mature, assembly-competent HCs are then handed-off to a subsequent chaperone complex, likely the R2TP complex to allow for stable associations with other subunits such as the IC1/2 complex, in a ZMYND10-independent step. Working together, this chaperone relay ensures efficient assembly of functional dynein complexes for subsequent ciliary targeting. Given the critical role ZMYND10 plays in dynein assembly, we propose a novel alias, DNAAF7 for ZMYND10. Our work on ZMYND10 shows that the biosynthesis and quality control of dynein motors relies on an elaborate proteostasis network. Perturbations to this network by pharmacological means or due to genetic defects can disrupt motor assembly leading to PCD. This represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of PCD pathogenesis.

Mouse respiratory epithelial cells were obtained by exposing the nasal septum and scraping cells off the epithelium with an interdental brush (TePe, 0.8 mm ExtraSoft) followed by resuspension in DMEM (isolated from animals at P7-P29). Cells were spread on superfrost slides, air-dried and processed for immunofluorescence. This was modified for proximity ligation assay (PLA) where cells were resuspended in PBS, then fixed 4%PFA/3.7% sucrose/PBS for 30 min on ice and cytospun onto Superfrost slides. Human respiratory epithelial cells obtained by brush biopsying the nasal epithelium of healthy human donors or P7 neonatal mice were processed for proximity ligation assay using a Duolink PLA starter kit (DUO92101, Sigma-Aldrich), as per the manufacturer’s instructions following PFA fixation and 0.25%Triton-X100/TBS permeabilization 10 min. Alexa-488 phalloidin (Thermo Fischer) or rat anti-GRP94 (Thermo Fischer) counterstaining was done post-PLA protocol, prior to mounting in Duolink In Situ Mounting Medium with DAPI (Sigma Aldrich). Trachea (P7), testes (P150) and oviducts (P7) were dissected and immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (from 16% solution, Thermo Fischer) overnight and cryosectioned for immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to ZMYND10, acetylated α-tubulin or dynein components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diggle et al., 2014</xref>).

Isolation was carried out using RNeasy Mini Kit or RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s protocol. RNA samples were treated with Turbo DNAse to remove genomic DNA contamination using the Turbo DNA free kit (Ambion). Intron-spanning RT-qPCR assays were designed using the Universal Probe Library probe finder tool (Roche) to identify transcript specific primer-probe sets listed in supplementary table. Three separate experimental runs were carried out for each plate. All runs were done on three individual biological replicates. Data was analysed using Roche LC480 software. Subsequently, a paired two-tailed students t-test was used to compare differences in the mean expression values between wild type and mutant samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>DM-CHX FKBP8 inhibitor studies</title><p>Lyophilized FKBP8 inhibitor N-(N’N’-Dimethylcarboxamidomethyl)cycloheximide (DM-CHX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edlich et al., 2006</xref>) was dissolved in sterile PBS in a 1 mM stock and diluted further to working concentrations in MucilAir media (EPITHELIX Sàrl). MucilAir tracheal epithelial cultures (EPITHELIX Sàrl) inserts from healthy human donors (same for each stage, immature D17 after air-lift or mature D60 after air-lift) were incubated with DM-CHX for 24 hr at the indicated concentrations and harvested in mild lysis buffer, (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL, 0.15% Triton-X 100 and Halt Protease Inhibitor Single use cocktail EDTA free (Thermo Fischer). For FKBP8 inhibition studies of mTECs, DM-CHX was diluted to 100 μm in NuSerum media and added to wells every 2 days from 3 days ALI (immature treatment) or after 14 days (mature treatment).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: David Mitchell (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes generation of a <italic>Zmynd10</italic> null mouse and analysis of the effects of this mutation on axonemal dynein assembly. Both the macroscopic phenotype and the microscopy analysis show that this mutation disrupts ciliary motility through blocking assembly of axonemal dynein arms. Blots of heavy chains DNAH5 and DNAH9, as well as intermediate chains DNAI1 and DNAI2 supported IF studies of both trachea and oviduct. Maintained mRNA abundance and presence of degradation products on blots supported the conclusion that reduction of these proteins was due to proteolysis, not a block to transcription or translation.</p><p>Overall, this paper provides some solid advances in understanding mechanisms of axonemal dynein assembly and the role of ZMYND10. However, it requires more attention to detail in describing and presenting the data in order to be understood and accepted by the readership of this journal.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An attempt to show that proteins were first made and could be visualized in the cytoplasm, and were later either assembled (normal cells) or degraded (mutant cells) was of interest, but the data presentation made interpretation of these results problematic. The panels in Figure 3 are poorly labeled, and poorly described in the figure legend, making it difficult to follow the logic of the description of results (subsection “Mis-assembled dynein motors are blocked from entering cilia and cleared in <italic>Zmynd10</italic> mutants”, last paragraph). The authors suggest that they can differentiate between immature and mature cells, but use no markers. If the presence of DNAI2 in the cytoplasm is used to identify immature cells, then the reasoning is circular. Additionally, if the cells in panel B are all immature, as suggested by the arrowheads, then why is there no DNAI2 or DNALI1 signal in the cytoplasm? Second, panel B is described as showing IDA proteins, but includes one IDA protein (DNALI1) and one ODA protein (DNAI2). Further, it appears that DNAH5 is present in the cilia of an &quot;immature&quot; cell in the lower panel of Figure 3A. If DNAH5 at first assembles and then at a later time point is removed from the cilia, this is an important point and should be more completely documented. Lastly, if the cells indicated by arrows are mature, and the cilia are supposed to be longer, why do the cilia on the mature +/+ cells in panel A appear the shortest, and those on the immature +/+ cells in panel B appear the longest? Figure 4A suffers from the same difficulty in knowing which cells are mature and which are immature, without any independent markers. Thus, clarification of the maturity of these cells is critical for making claims about how dynein arm assembly changes over cell maturity.</p><p>2) Subsection “Mis-assembled dynein motors are blocked from entering cilia and cleared in <italic>Zmynd10</italic> mutants”, first paragraph and Figure 2F. In the mutant lysates, multiple (4 are indicated) fragments of DNAH5 (OAD HC) are seen. Although at lower levels, these also appear to be present in the control. Given that dynein HCs are very protease sensitive (what is likely a proteolytic fragment is clearly seen below the full-length DHC in the control lane), is it clear that this observation indicates &quot;post-translational destabilization&quot; rather than either enhanced proteolysis (even post-cell lysis) or premature translation termination? What was the antigen used to generate the DNAH5 antibody? Knowing this might allow the authors to conclude whether these represent N-terminal fragments that could have resulted from premature termination or C-terminal (motor domain) fragments that must have resulted from proteolysis.</p><p>3) Figure 4C and 4D are confusing. Why are different tissues compared at different time points and using different antibodies (DNAI2 and DNAI1 versus DNAI2 and DNAH5)? It is not possible to assess whether differences in assembly formation or stability are due to tissue-specific differences, maturation differences, the different proteins examined, or all of the above. Also, the diagram in Figure 4F is not consistent with the preceding data, which shows formation of complexes between the IC dimer and DNAH5, even if DNAH5 itself is unstable as indicated by the presence of degradation products.</p><p>4) Figure 6A and B: Positive controls are required to make sense of negative IP data. For example, if DNAAF2 is confirmed to pull down DNAAF4, but does not pull down ZMYND10, I would be reasonably confident that DNAAF2 does not strongly interact with ZMYND10. Zariwala et al. and Moore et al. identified a biochemical interaction between LRRC6 and ZMYND10. This work fails to recapitulate that interaction. The authors should use the same reagents as Zariwala to resolve this discrepancy. Do they interact or not (or do so extremely transiently)?</p><p>5) The authors provide very interesting data on the role of FKBP8's peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity in dynein assembly and see a decrease in both DHAH5 and DNAI1 stability when this is inhibited. Were these effects specific to these two particular outer arm subunits or is this manifest in others as well e.g. DNAI2 (which associates directly with DNAI1 and for which antibodies are available). In other words, is PPIase activity itself needed for stability of all these components individually, or is their loss the consequence of lack of PPIase activity on one key component of this massive complex?</p><p>6) Some points are overstated. The authors suggest that, &quot;the motile ciliopathy Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) should be considered a cell-type specific protein-misfolding disease.&quot; Surely, the authors mean that only some forms of PCD should be considered as being caused by protein misfolding.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34389.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An attempt to show that proteins were first made and could be visualized in the cytoplasm, and were later either assembled (normal cells) or degraded (mutant cells) was of interest, but the data presentation made interpretation of these results problematic.

Figures 3 and 4 are now better annotated and a more detailed description in the figure legends is provided. We have also used an independent marker for motile ciliary maturation, SENTAN (Kubo et al., 2008), which is enriched in the apical structure of mature motile ciliary tips. Using two commercial SENTAN antibodies on healthy human donor nasal brushings (here, new Figure 3A), we have demonstrated that the immunostaining pattern for two axonemal dynein subunits DNAI2 and DNALI1, transitions from a predominantly cytoplasmic (SENTAN negative, immature cell stage) to exclusively ciliary (SENTAN positive, mature cell stage) staining during motile ciliated cell differentiation for. We received a small aliquot of un-purified serum against mouse SENTAN (Kubo et al., 2008), which also showed enrichment in cilial tips but less precisely during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), as dyneins progressively translocate from the cytoplasm to cilia. We have not included the mouse data in the paper (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, right panel) as it requires much more optimization.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34389.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34389-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, if the cells in panel B are all immature, as suggested by the arrowheads, then why is there no DNAI2 or DNALI1 signal in the cytoplasm?

We have amended this panel to clarify the absence of DNAH5 signal in mutant cilia. We reiterate that we never observe DNAH5 staining in the ciliary compartment in <italic>Zmynd10</italic> mutant cells. The representative images acquired at comparable imaging conditions are provided to additionally emphasize this point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34389.029</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34389-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Mis-assembled dynein motors are blocked from entering cilia and cleared in Zmynd10 mutants”, first paragraph and Figure 2F.

From the position of the antigen used to raise this antibody (amino acids 846-1136; see Matsuo et al. 2013 AJP: LCMP), one can argue that the high molecular weight polypeptides detected in the immunoblots are unlikely to originate from premature translational termination. The antigen in the detected fragments maps to the stem region of the dynein heavy chain and does not include any region of the motor domain. The antigen does not lie to the extreme N-terminus of the protein and the high molecular weight fragments detected in the immunoblots appear consistent with a long (majority of) polypeptide being synthesised. To investigate this further, we analysed individual polypeptides detected for the relevant dynein proteins in the total testes proteomes and plotted their intensity along the length of the corresponding full-length proteins. Comparing the intensities of axonemal heavy chains in wild type and <italic>Zmynd10</italic> mutant samples indicates that identified peptides mapped all along the proteins but at lower intensity (see new Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>The presence of terminal peptides albeit with lower intensity (less abundant) in the mutants, argues against premature translational termination and suggests instead that proteins are fully synthesized and latter degraded or cleared. In agreement, the decreased DNAH5 levels in <italic>Zmynd10</italic> mutant fixed tissue sections indicate that its degradation is not post-cell lysis but may instead be part of a controlled mechanism that clears stalled dynein motor complexes in the absence of the assembly factor. As such, we interpret the high molecular weight laddering pattern of fragments, characteristic of proteolytic degradation, to be a consequence of loss of the ZMYND10-FKBP8-HSP90 mediated chaperoning of DHCs and therefore leading to enhanced protease sensitivity above the normal levels of sensitivity observed in control lysates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4C and 4D are confusing.

For instance, in mice, multiciliated cells start to appear in the trachea as early as embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) whereas in the brain and oviducts, they appear postnatally, from P5 and P8 onwards respectively. Despite the differences in timing, all multiciliated cells must undergo the same programme of differentiation, which includes the preassembly of dyneins in the cytoplasm. We believe that the strength of our study is the use of a mammalian model that allows us to interrogate basic principles of dynein assembly in different tissues, describing a universal function for ZMYND10 in all motile ciliated lineages examined. This is in contrast to the recent study using zebrafish mutants for all 4 PIH protein paralogues, which show distinct and sometimes redundant functions in dynein assembly in a tissue-specific manner (Yamaguchi et al., 2018). In our global view of axonemal dynein assembly, we have analysed seemingly different stages (i.e. days post-natal), which reflect these tissue-specific differences in timing of when the motile multi-ciliogenic programme gets switched on. To analyse formation of the dynein intermediate chain IC heterodimer (IC1/IC2), we used P26 testes samples (cytoplasmic pre-assembly just before flagellogenesis). Here, DNAI1 is precipitated by DNAI2 at similar levels in both control and mutants suggesting this complex is not initially affected (Figure 4C). Importantly, only slight differences in the levels of DNAI1 and DNAI2 are seen in the mutant inputs (and validated in our MS data Figures 5D, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). However, we observe that in both differentiating oviducts (Figure 4D) and trachea (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1B), the ability of DNAI2 to precipitate DNAH5 is weaker in the mutants compared to controls, even when normalizing for slight reductions in inputs in mutants. This indicates that the subsequent IC-HC interaction is somehow compromised in the absence of ZMYND10 (see new Figure 4E). For technical reasons, we were unable to assess the IC-HC interaction in P26 testes, to complement this series as we have been unable to source specific immunoreagents for DNAH17 (HC-β paralogue) and DNAH8 (HC-α paralogue). As suggested by the reviewers, we have now amended the model to indicate a weakening of ODA complex formation (dotted lines/arrows) instead of a complete abrogation as originally indicated (see Figure 4F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 6A and B: Positive controls are required to make sense of negative IP data. For example, if DNAAF2 is confirmed to pull down DNAAF4, but does not pull down ZMYND10, I would be reasonably confident that DNAAF2 does not strongly interact with ZMYND10. Zariwala et al. and Moore et al. identified a biochemical interaction between LRRC6 and ZMYND10. This work fails to recapitulate that interaction. The authors should use the same reagents as Zariwala to resolve this discrepancy. Do they interact or not (or do so extremely transiently)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have significantly overhauled Figures 6 and 7, as well as added Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and changed Figure 6—figure supplement 1 to remove ‘negative IP data’, as we concur with the reviewers that these types of studies have limited insight. We refer to the comprehensive DNAAF4 IP-MS dataset generated by Tarkar et al., 2013, which detects DNAAF2 but not ZMYND10 as an interaction partner. More recently, Paff et al., 2017, reported that PIH1D3 interacts with DNAAF2 and DNAAF4 <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggestive of a ternary complex between the three <italic>in vivo</italic>. Their interaction studies also failed to detect ZMYND10 as an interaction partner. Taken together, recent findings suggest that ZMYND10 functions separate to the other DNAAFs. This is why the main focus of this study was the discovery of a novel functional chaperone complex comprising of ZMYND10, FKBP8 and HSP90, the existence of which we have validated in multiple ways. The interaction with LRRC6 is interesting. As shown in our initial submission, we failed to detect ‘endogenous’ interaction between ZMYND10 and LRRC6 by reciprocal IPs during cytoplasmic dynein pre-assembly (now new Figure 6B). Both Zariwala et al., 2013 and Moore et al., 2013 had shown interaction only with overexpression systems. However, LRRC6 is the only ‘DNAAF’ to be significantly down-regulated in our P25 <italic>Zmynd10</italic> mutant testes MS dataset (see Figure 5D), suggesting some type of functional interaction exists. In response to the reviewers' comments, we have now tried a commercially available LRRC6 antibody from Novus (NBP1-82816, as used in the Zariwala paper) but in our hands this antibody fails to recognise endogenous mouse LRRC6 and no enrichment is seen in ZMYND10 pull downs, although a clear interaction with FKBP8 is detected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34389.030</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34389-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig><p>We also tested the custom mouse LRRC6 rabbit polyclonal that was a gift from Professor Hiroshi Hamada (used in this paper and panels shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). Although testes at different developmental stages were used (P24 with synchronised seminiferous tubules and P60 with asynchronised seminiferous tubules), we failed to observe a consistent interaction between ZMYND10 and LRRC6. Instead bands of different molecular weight were enriched in each of the two cases where a potential co-purification was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>, asterisks). All the while the interaction between FKBP8-HSP90-ZMYND10 is maintained. This suggests that any interaction between these two DNAAFs may be extremely transient in vivo.</p><fig id="respfig4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34389.031</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34389-resp-fig4-v2"/></fig><p>We also requested the human LRRC6-myc plasmid used by Zariwala et al. for our own over-expression studies (new Figure 8A), where we confirm that mouse ZMYND10 does pull-down LRRC6. We also confirm the same patient mutation in mouse ZMYND10 that abrogates interaction with FKBP8, fails to have an effect on the LRRC6 interaction. Furthermore, we show that when LRRC6 is co-expressed with wild type ZMYND10, the amount of FKBP8 precipitated by ZMYND10 is markedly reduced, indicating that ZMYND10 likely forms mutually exclusive complexes with FKBP8 and LRRC6. Again this is consistent with our model of a chaperone relay where several discrete, albeit transient, chaperone complexes oversee folding and stability of discrete dynein subunits, promoting stable interactions between subunits all the while preventing spurious interactions.</p><fig id="respfig5"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34389.032</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34389-resp-fig5-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors provide very interesting data on the role of FKBP8's peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity in dynein assembly and see a decrease in both DHAH5 and DNAI1 stability when this is inhibited.

Our model would have predicted the former, where only stability of HC subunits would be primarily affected. However, we also observed effects on DNAI1 and DNAI2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6</xref>). In our 24-hour treatment window, it is possible that DNAI1 and DNAI2 are destabilized secondarily, and as these proteins are much smaller compared to the ~500KDa HCs, we would expect to see faster turnover. Regardless, we show that inhibiting the PPIase activity of FKBP8 phenocopies ZMYND10 loss of function in terms of ODA subunit stability.</p><fig id="respfig6"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34389.033</object-id><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34389-resp-fig6-v2"/></fig><p>We have also extended this analysis to characterise the effect of DM-CHX on cilia motility as pointed by the reviewers. We used mouse tracheal epithelial cell cultures (mTECs) grown at air-liquid interface and treated at day 3 post-airlift (cytoplasmic pre-assembly starting) with either 100μm DM-CHX or vehicle in differentiation media. Cells were cultured for 14 days (changing every 2 days); whereupon control cultures treated with vehicle showed robust cilial beat. In contrast, no ciliary motility was detected in cultures treated with DM-CHX. We then switched the treatments, such that the control cultures were treated for 7 days with 100μm DM-CHX, which had no effect on motility. Drug treated immotile cultures, when switched to growth medium with vehicle started to display occasional patches of motile cilia. When these cultures were used for wholemount immunofluorescence with DNAH5 and DNAI2 (new Figure 7E), we confirmed FKBP8 inhibition had no effect on fully differentiated motile cilia whereas only newly differentiating cells had high cytoplasmic and some limited axonemal staining in newly elongating cilia, after 7 days release. Dramatically, the majority of cells in the early treatment cohort had no evidence of DNAH5 or DNAI2 in cilia, consistent to lack of ciliary motility. These results strongly support that the specific inhibition of FKBP8 destabilizes dynein subunits preventing their assembly in these cultures and that relieving this inhibition allows partial resumption of the stalled dynein assembly pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Some points are overstated.
