However, we know little about why animals adopt different interaction rules because of sparse sampling among species. Here, we identify an interaction rule that holds across single and mixed-species flocks of four migratory shorebird species spanning a seven-fold range of body masses. The rule, aligning with a one-wingspan lateral distance to nearest neighbors in the same horizontal plane, scales linearly with wingspan but is independent of nearest neighbor distance and neighbor species. This rule propagates outward to create a global flock structure that we term the compound-V formation. We propose that this formation represents an intermediary between the cluster flocks of starlings and the simple-V formations of geese and other large migratory birds. We explore multiple hypotheses regarding the benefit of this flock structure and how it differs from structures observed in other flocking species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45071.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Birds often fly in flocks ranging from very structured V-formations to unstructured clusters. Many studies have tried to prove what causes birds to flock and how it benefits them. Flocks, for example, may help birds to avoid predators and to navigate. Flying in a V-shaped formation likely also gives aerodynamic benefits that can make it easier to fly long distances.</p><p>Few studies, however, have measured how the positions of birds in a flock relate to things like flying speed or the frequency of wing flaps. This is because it was difficult to take such measurements in large flocks of moving birds. Advances in cameras and computers are now making it easier to track individual birds flying in large flocks. The technology allows scientists to measure how birds position themselves in relation to other birds, or how flock-positioning varies by bird size, species, ecology, and behaviors. Such measurements may help scientists better understand why and how birds flock.</p><p>Corcoran and Hedrick now show that four different types of shorebirds position themselves in the same way when flying in a flock. In the experiments, digital cameras recorded video of 18 cluster-like flocks of four different species of birds flying over a bird sanctuary or agricultural fields. The flocks ranged in size from a hundred to a thousand birds. Some flocks had two types of bird. The four types of birds – dunlin, short-billed dowitcher, American avocet, and marbled godwit – live in similar environments but greatly vary in size and fly at different speeds. Corcoran and Hedrick measured individual bird positions using three-dimensional computer reconstructions of the flocks.</p><p>Each bird – regardless of size or species – most commonly flew about one wingspan to the side and between a half to one-and-a-half wingspans back from the bird in front of it. Birds flying in simple V-shaped formations follow similar rules. This suggests that birds flying in clusters may also gain aerodynamic benefits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bird</kwd><kwd>flight</kwd><kwd>biomechanics</kwd><kwd>flocking</kwd><kwd>collective behavior</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1253276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hedrick</surname><given-names>Tyson L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Shorebird flocks fly in a formation that re-creates the neighbor positioning relationship of a V-formation in cluster flocks of more than 1000 birds.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The collective movements of animals—from schooling fish to swarming insects and flocking birds—have long excited intrigue among observers of nature. Collective motion arises as an emergent property of interactions between individuals (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herbert-Read, 2016</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vicsek and Zafeiris, 2012</xref>). Thus, much attention has been placed on identifying local interaction rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballerini et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herbert-Read et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lukeman et al., 2010</xref>) and how those rules affect group structure and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buhl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hemelrijk and Hildenbrandt, 2012</xref>). However, comparative data across species are still limited, preventing us from testing hypotheses regarding the evolution and diversity of collective movement patterns.</p><p>Hundreds of bird species fly in groups, but most quantitative research has focused on starlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attanasi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballerini et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavagna et al., 2010</xref>), homing pigeons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nagy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nagy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pettit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pettit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Usherwood et al., 2011</xref>) and birds that fly in V-formations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badgerow and Hainsworth, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cutts and Speakman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hummel, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lissaman and Shollenberger, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maeng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Portugal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weimerskirch et al., 2001</xref>). These data indicate that smaller birds fly in relatively dense cluster flocks that facilitate group cohesion and information transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attanasi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballerini et al., 2008a</xref>), whereas larger migratory birds fly in highly structured V formations (also known as line or echelon formations) that provide aerodynamic and energetic benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lissaman and Shollenberger, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Portugal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weimerskirch et al., 2001</xref>). However, descriptive accounts of flock structure over a greater range of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heppner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Piersma et al., 1990</xref>) cover a range of flock types, spanning the extremes of V-formation and large cluster flocks. The species whose flocking behavior have been studied quantitatively differ in many ways that could be important for flocking, including body size, ecology, the frequency of aggregation and its behavioral context. Therefore, on the basis of the available data, it is difficult to conclude what factors cause birds to adopt a specific group formation, or even what factors affect interaction rules, positioning and behavior within flocks.</p><p>We aimed to address these questions by collecting three-dimensional (3D) trajectories of the birds in flocks of four shorebird species that have similar ecologies (all forage in large groups in coastal habitats and migrate long distances) but that cover a seven-fold range of body mass and two-fold range of wingspan. Our study species include dunlin (<italic>Calidris alpina</italic> Linnaeus 1758; 56 g, 0.34 m wingspan), short-billed dowitcher (<italic>Limnodromus griseus</italic> Gmelin 1789; 110 g, 0.52 m wingspan), American avocet (<italic>Recurvirostra americana</italic> Gmelin 1789; 312 g, 0.72 m wingspan), and marbled godwit (<italic>Limosa fedoa</italic>, Linnaeus, 1758; 370 g, 0.78 m). Molecular dating indicates that these species diverged from their nearest common ancestor approximately 50 million years ago (Mya) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2007</xref>), providing time for evolutionary diversification of flocking behavior. By comparing the group structure of birds across a range of body sizes and by comparing our data with those in the literature, we aimed to determine the extent to which flock structure varies across species with different body sizes and ecologies. We employ three approaches: (1) identification of local interaction rules by quantifying the relative positions of birds and their nearest neighbors; (2) quantification of the degree of spatial structure within flocks; and (3) measurement of individual speeds and wingbeat frequencies to examine how local and global position within the flock affect flights behavior.</p><p>On the basis of existing flock data, we hypothesized that flocks of larger shorebird species would be more structured than those of smaller species (recapitulating the trend of larger birds flying in highly structured V formations) and that larger species would also exhibit aerodynamic formations more frequently. Because a previous study showed that flying in a cluster flock is energetically costly in pigeons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Usherwood et al., 2011</xref>), we hypothesized that birds flying in the middle and rear of flocks and birds flying closer to their nearest neighbor would have reduced flight performance (lower speed relative to their wingbeat frequency). Surprisingly, we found that all four species studied here flew in a flock structure that we term the compound-V formation. We propose that this structure might be an adaptation for aerodynamic flocking in migratory species, and that ecology is an underappreciated driver of the evolution of avian flocking behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We reconstructed the 3D trajectories from 18 bird flocks that ranged in size from 189 to 1039 individuals, which were recorded for 2.4–13.2 s at 29.97 frames per second (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This resulted in 1,598,169 3D position measurements that were used to examine flock structure. Sixteen of the 18 flocks were comprised entirely of a single species. The remaining two flocks were mixed-species flocks of marbled godwits and short-billed dowitchers. Computer vision techniques allowed the species of individuals in mixed-species flocks to be identified on the basis of differences in body size (see 'Materials and methods').</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45071.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Shorebird flock recording.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Multi-camera videography was used to reconstruct 3D trajectories of shorebirds flying near high-tide roosts in Humboldt Bay, California.

In all flocks, nearest neighbors flying within the same horizontal plane [an elevation slice of ±1 wingspan, a mean of 56% of nearest neighbors across all flocks (range 35–76%)] exhibited a distinctly peaked distribution, where modal neighbor position was offset both in front-back and lateral distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). By contrast, nearest neighbor birds flying outside the horizontal elevation slice of ±1 wingspan were distributed randomly with a peak directly above or below the focal bird (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). This indicates that shorebirds adopt alignment rules for neighbors flying within their same elevation slice.

After scaling alignment positions to wingspan (i.e., dividing neighbor distances by species wingspan), a distinctive pattern emerges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Specifically, the flocks adopted a modal lateral distance of approximately one wingspan (mean 1.04, range 0.88–1.24 wingspans). This non-dimensionalized lateral distance had a weak inverse relationship to species wingspan (linear regression, slope = −0.37, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.37, F = 9.38, p=0.007) and was not related to flock density (i.e. nearest neighbor distance, non-dimensionalized by wingspan; linear regression, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.07, F = 1.15; p=0.30). Non-dimensionalized trailing distance was inversely proportional to species wingspan (linear regression, slope = −0.40, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.33, F = 7.93, p=0.012) and increased with non-dimensional flock density (linear regression, slope = 0.13, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.58, F = 22.39; p=0.0002).

Adding the aerodynamic neighbor to the best model makes the term non-significant (LME, p=0.30) and increases the BIC of the model by 6.8.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45071.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Effect of positioning for aerodynamic interaction.</title><p>Here we show the effect of neighbor position on flight speed.

On the basis of previous studies, we predicted that larger species would adopt more structured flocks and would exhibit more frequent aerodynamic positioning. Neither of these hypotheses were supported by our data. Instead, we document a flock structure that we term the compound-V formation, in which birds in cluster flocks align to nearest neighbors within their same elevation slice (±1 wingspan) with a one-wingspan lateral offset while allowing front-back distance to fluctuate with flock density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). This flock type is similar to the shorebird ‘cluster’ and ‘bunch’ formations described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Piersma et al. (1990)</xref> and the ‘front cluster’ of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heppner (1974)</xref>. Here, this structure was observed in single- and mixed-species flocks of four shorebird species covering a seven-fold range in body mass. The simple alignment rule produces a flock structure that can be observed at all spatial scales within the flock, including overall flock shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is in contrast to flocks of other species, such as starlings, in which structure is only observed within each neighbor’s six nearest neighbors, equivalent to 1.2–2.7 wingspans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballerini et al., 2008a</xref>). Our data also show that shorebird global flock alignment is responsive to estimated local wind conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), and future work exploring this interaction may allow identification of the mechanism that governs the overall alignment. Wind conditions did not have discernible effects on local alignment, possibly because of the uncertainty in the measurement of the wind vector itself.</p><p>Mixed-species assemblages typically represent around 10% of migratory shorebird flocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Piersma et al., 1990</xref>), possibly because species that have different preferred flight speeds would have to compromise their flight speed in order to remain together as a group. Our data include ~10% mixed-species flocks (2 of 18) and support the hypothesis that differences in preferred flight speed influence whether different species flock together. We documented two mixed-species flocks of godwit and dowitcher; these flocks had an airspeed of 9.02 ± 0.34 m s<sup>−1</sup> (mean ± s.d., n = 2). The single-species godwit and dowitcher flocks had airspeeds of 9.64 ± 1.53 (n = 3) and 8.99 ± 1.92 m s<sup>−1</sup> (n = 3), respectively. Dunlin, which were present at the same time as godwits and dowitchers but did not fly in mixed flocks with these species, had an airspeed of 7.58 ± 0.11 m s<sup>−1</sup> (n = 7). Similarly, Avocets not observed to mix with other species at our field site, and they flew with airspeeds of 8.04 ± 0.13 m s<sup>−1</sup> (n = 3). Thus, the similarity in preferred flight speeds among godwits and dowitchers might be important for these species to form mixed-species flocks. Dunlin and avocets also flew at similar airspeeds, but were not observed in mixed-species flocks, perhaps because of their large difference in body size, wingbeat frequency, and/or maneuverability.</p><p>The flock data presented here also include other interesting results that lack clear explanations. Flight speed varied with position from front to rear and from center to margin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), implying that the flocks were not necessarily in equilibrium. This might cause larger flocks to separate into several smaller flocks over time, consistent with the observation that the arrival group size of migratory species is typically smaller than the departure group size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Piersma et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>Because birds in simple and compound-V formations adopt similar neighbor alignment rules, functional hypotheses for simple-V formations might also apply to compound-V formations. These include collision avoidance and information transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dill et al., 1997</xref>). Collision avoidance is a plausible hypothesis to explain the formation of simple-V formations because they theoretically permit birds to keep all neighbors out of their direct path of travel. This is not the case for compound-V formations, where many birds are flying in front of and behind one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). The problem of collision avoidance is exacerbated in compound-V formation because birds tend to fly in the same horizontal plane. A better strategy for collision avoidance is to fly in a three-dimensional shape, such as that adopted by flocks of chimney swifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evangelista et al., 2017</xref>). In these flocks, the most common neighbor position is further lateral than in the shorebird flocks and with a shorter trailing distance, more completely moving those individuals out of the path of other flock members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, even in the simple-V formation recorded here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), birds flew with approximately 20% of wingspan overlap and so did not have an entirely clear forward path. Thus, collision avoidance appears to be an unlikely explanation for the structuring of both the compound-V and simple-V formations recorded here.</p><p>Simple and compound-V formations might also be structured to maximize the observability of neighbors, facilitating information transfer by helping birds to detect and respond to changes in neighbor speed or direction, and improving flock cohesiveness by allowing information to propagate through the flock more quickly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dill et al. (1997)</xref> proposed that birds in V formation should maximize the measurement of neighbor movements by aligning at a 35.3 degree angle (relative to the direction of travel), or alternatively should maximize the measurement of neighbor speed by aligning at a 63.4 degree angle. The shorebird flocks examined here had modal neighbor-position alignment angles ranging from 33.7 to 51.8 with an average of 41.2 degrees. Neither this mean angle nor the nearly 20-degree range in alignment angle is consistent with Dill’s hypotheses or others calling for a single optimal alignment angle. Our finding that lateral spacing is uncorrelated with flock density, whereas trailing spacing increases with decreasing density, shows that the shorebird flocks are more organized in lateral distance than in trailing distance or alignment angle. Thus, hypotheses calling for organization based on alignment angle, whether to maximize information transfer or to keep lead birds in the visual fovea of trailing neighbors in a V formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badgerow and Hainsworth, 1981</xref>), are not well supported by our results.</p><p>Theoretical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badgerow and Hainsworth, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hummel, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lissaman and Shollenberger, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maeng et al., 2013</xref>) and empirical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Portugal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weimerskirch et al., 2001</xref>) has provided support for the hypothesis that birds flying in simple-V formations gain aerodynamic and energetic benefits, and we propose that such benefits might also explain why birds adopt the compound-V formation. In both cases, birds fly with a lateral offset of approximately one wingspan while allowing trailing distance to vary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), facilitating aerodynamic interaction. When compared to simple-V formations, compound-V formations allow greater flock densities, which should allow more rapid information transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attanasi et al., 2014</xref>), larger flock sizes, and improved predator defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Powell, 1974</xref>). Analyses of the airspeeds and wingbeat frequencies of flocking shorebirds provide some support for the aerodynamic alignment hypothesis. Birds flying in positions where beneficial aerodynamic interactions are predicted to occur flew faster than expected after controling for other factors (aerodynamic neighbor term in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, linear mixed effects model for airspeed, p&lt;0.0001). Over the entire dataset, 29.7% of nearest neighbor positions were in the ‘aerodynamic neighbor’ location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), compared with only 3.4% of nearest neighbor in flocking chimney swifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This faster flight should produce a reduced cost of transport, assuming there are no unmeasured compensating factors such as a simultaneous increase in stroke amplitude. Nevertheless, this speculative interpretation of the compound-V formation raises many new questions, such as how birds in the flock can maintain different speeds without separating and why an aerodynamic benefit would manifest as an increase in speed instead of, for example, a reduction in flapping frequency and airspeed as suggested by theoretical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hummel, 1983</xref>). Furthermore, despite the similarities in modal position among compound-V and simple-V flocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), it is not clear whether a single set of adjustment rules or responses to changes in neighbor position can produce both flock types. These questions, and a definitive explanation for why birds adopt a compound-V formation, cannot be answered with the current dataset. Progress in these areas will depend on new theoretical modeling and data collection from on-bird loggers measuring physiological, flock positioning and biomechanical data from a variety of species over a range of behavioral contexts. Further videographic flock surveys may also improve understanding of the variety of flock types, especially when collected with careful attention to behavioral context and with full measurement of local environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Field recording</title><p>We recorded multi-camera video of freely behaving, wild birds in Humboldt County, California between 17 April and 27 April 2017 and between 20 December 2017 and 1 January 2018. Recordings were made at the Arcata Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary (40°51'25.35&quot;N, 124° 5'39.37&quot;W) and above agricultural fields in the Arcata bottoms (40°53'51.98&quot;N, 124° 6'55.85&quot;W). No birds were captured or handled, and we made efforts to avoid influencing bird behavior. Video was captured at 29.97 frames per second and 1920 × 1080 pixel resolution using three Canon 6D cameras with 35 mm or 50 mm lenses. Cameras were set along a 10 m transect and staggered in elevation. We set cameras up to overlook locations where birds aggregated during high tide or when foraging in agricultural fields. Flocking events included birds moving with the tide, or flushing in response to predators (e.g., peregrine falcons) or for unknown reasons. Cameras recorded continuously for up to 3 hr per day. For analysis, we selected flocks that included at least 100 individuals and that had an orientation and size that allowed visual discrimination of individuals within the flock.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Bird detection</title><p>We used the MATLAB R2017a (Natick, MA, USA) computer vision toolbox to generate code for detecting birds in video recordings. A foreground detector first separated moving objects from the stationary background. A gaussian filter was then applied to the image with a diameter matched to bird size under the recording conditions. Two-dimensional peak detection found local peaks in the smoothed image that were taken as potential bird positions.</p><p>Under some conditions, overlapping wings of adjacent birds prevented accurate detection of many individuals. To overcome this problem, we developed a frame-averaging algorithm that helped to obscure the wings and to emphasize the bodies. Here, optic flow determines the overall movement of the flock for each frame. Using the optic flow measurements and two-dimensional interpolation, the algorithm subtracts movement between frames. A rolling 5-frame window is then applied to the entire video. This procedure highlights pixels that are moving in the same direction as the flock, such as the birds’ bodies, while filtering pixels that are moving in other directions, such as the wings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Three-dimensional calibration</title><p>Camera calibration followed established methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hedrick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Theriault et al., 2014</xref>), with the exception that the distance between cameras, instead of an object placed in view of the cameras, was used to scale the scene. This approach allowed us to record in locations where it was infeasible to place calibration objects in front of the cameras (e.g., over water). The in-camera horizontal alignment feature was used to align cameras to the horizon. The pitch of the camera was measured with a digital inclinometer with 0.1-degree precision. This allowed alignment of the scene to gravity in post processing, with the vertical (Z axis) origin placed at the level of the cameras. This permitted direct measurement of the elevation of the birds relative to one another.</p><p>Background objects that were visible in the scene were used as calibration points. We developed a preliminary calibration using stationary objects such as trees, poles, and sitting birds. We then added flying birds, ensuring that points covered a wide range of distances and elevations relative to the cameras. Calibrations had low direct linear transformation (DLT) residuals (&lt;0.5–1 pixel), indicating high-quality calibrations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Camera synchronization</title><p>Cameras were synchronized by broadcasting audio tones over Walkie Talkies (Motorola Talkabout MH230) to each camera. Audio tones were broadcast approximately once every five minutes during recording. A time offset was determined for each pair of cameras using cross-correlation of the audio tracks. This offset allowed camera synchronization within ±one half of a frame, or 16.6 ms.</p><p>In recordings where birds were relatively close to the camera (&lt;50 m) and moving at relatively high pixel speeds, we used sub-frame interpolation to achieve increased synchronization accuracy of one tenth of a frame, or ±1.7 ms. To determine the subframe offset, we interpolated tracks of moving birds used as background points in the calibration at 0.1 frame intervals from −1 to +1 frame (−1.0,–0.9, etc). We then calculated the DLT residual for a calibration with each combination of subframe-interpolated points for the three cameras. The set of offsets generating the lowest DLT residuals was used for the final calibration and applied to birds tracked in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Three-dimensional assignment</title><p>To reconstruct the three-dimensional positions of birds in a flock, 2D detections of individuals must be correctly assigned between cameras. We modified established software for this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evangelista et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, the software first finds all combinations of 2D points having DLT residuals of &lt;3 pixels. The software iteratively generates 3D points, starting with points that have the lowest DLT residuals and only allowing a 2D detection to be reused a single time. This helps with the problem of occlusion while limiting the number of ‘ghost’ birds (bird positions created from incorrectly matching detections among cameras). This process is repeated twice. The first iteration allows the user to determine a bounding region in the 3D space in which the flock is contained. In the second iteration, three-dimensional positions outside this bounding region are filtered before they can be considered as potential 3D points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Track generation</title><p>After 3D points have been generated, they are linked between frames to generate individual flight tracks. Here, a Kalman filter predicts the position of each bird in the subsequent frame for the 2D information from each camera and for the reconstructed 3D positions. In the first frame, the Kalman filter is seeded using optic flow measurements. For each frame step, a cost matrix is created from weighted sums of the 2D and 3D errors between predicted track positions and each reconstructed 3D point. The Hungarian algorithm is used to find a global optimum that minimizes the error in track assignment. A track that is not given an assignment is continued with a gap of up to four frames (0.13 s), after which it ends and any re-detection of the bird in question will start a new track.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Wingbeat frequency analysis</title><p>We measured wingbeat frequencies in a subset of recordings in which birds were both large enough and close enough to cameras to discern wingbeat oscillations. This excluded flocks of our smallest species, dunlin, and some flocks that were relatively distant from cameras. To measure wingbeat frequency, we used blob analysis to find a bounding box for each bird in each frame. We excluded blobs for which the bounding box included two or more birds as determined using the track-assignment algorithm described above. We averaged four components of the bounding box to measure wingbeat phase: height, inverse of the width, detrended X-coordinate of top-left corner, and inverse of detrended Y-coordinate of the top-left corner. This allowed quantification of wingbeat phase independent of bird orientation with respect to the cameras. Wingbeat phase was averaged across cameras and bandpass filtered before a 128-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to measure wingbeat frequency. The frame rate of the cameras (29.97 frames per second) and the FFT window determined a wingbeat frequency bin size of 0.12 wingbeats s<sup>−1</sup>. Our method is similar to that used in a recent study of two corvid species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ling et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Species identification in mixed-species flocks</title><p>We recorded two mixed-species flocks of godwits and dowitchers. The size difference between species allowed species identification using the detected pixel area and distance of each bird (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Here, blob analysis quantifies the pixel area for each bird in each tracked frame. Area data were excluded when two tracked birds were within a single blob bounding box. A low-pass filter was applied to the sequence of pixel area data across frames for each tracked bird to remove wingbeat effects. An object’s pixel area scales with the inverse of the square root of distance. Therefore, for each frame, the square root of the filtered pixel area was multiplied by bird’s distance to provide a distance-scaled area. This value was averaged across frames and across cameras for each bird track. In mixed-species flocks, a histogram of the scaled area had two distinct peaks with only a small amount of overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Fitting two normal distributions to these data revealed an expected error rate in species identification of 3.3%.

This was done separately for neighbors within ±1 wingspan in flight elevation—the potential positions at which aerodynamic interactions and collisions are plausible—and for neighbors beyond ±1 wingspan. For each flock, we calculated the modal lateral distance and modal front-back distance by taking the peak of a probability density function generated with a kernel density estimator and a smoothing bandwidth of 0.25 wingspans. We used modal values because distance calculations are truncated at zero, producing skewed distributions.</p><p>In a subsequent analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we quantified the angular distribution of neighbors at distances of two, four, six, and eight wingspans, and at a maximum radius depending on the size of the flock. Two-wingspan bins centered at the reference distance were used for selecting data points (e.g. birds within 1–3 wingspans were included in the two-wingspan bin). Our aim was to examine the extent of internal structure within the flock. Because edge effects could create the appearance of internal structure, we excluded birds whose edge distance was less than the wingspan of the bin being analyzed. For example, for the two-wingspan analysis, all birds within three wingspans of the horizontal edge of the flock were excluded. The maximum radius was taken as the median horizontal edge distance of all birds in the flock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

Ground speeds and flight directions were calculated for each bird at one-wingbeat time intervals. Median ground speed was calculated for each 10-degree bin having at least 500 data points. A circle was then fit to these median values, with the center of the circle representing a vector of wind direction and magnitude. Ground speeds and wind direction and magnitude were then used to calculate airspeeds. This approach is similar in principle to that used to estimate local wind speed from the drift in the ground reference frame position of circling vultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Weinzierl et al., 2016</xref>), and shares the important assumption that airspeed is independent of wind direction. However, birds are theoretically expected and empirically known to vary airspeed with wind speed when flying in order to reach a destination efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hedrick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shamoun-Baranes et al., 2007</xref>). Whether this is the case for shorebird flocks (making shorter flocks around the stopover point) is unknown, so we did not attempt to model this possible effect.</p><p>We compared our wind estimates to data from nearby weather stations. Our estimated wind direction and speed was typically within ±45 degrees and ±2 m s<sup>−1</sup> of weather station data (weather station KCAARCAT25). To avoid disturbing the birds, we did not attempt to release helium balloons to measure local wind conditions at altitude. Note that because our analysis here is based almost entirely on the positions and speeds of birds relative to their neighbors, our results are largely insensitive to the wind speed and direction. However, precise determination of bird airspeed and wind direction is required to model the expected position of the wake of the bird, and the absence of this information means that it is not possible to determine when or even if trailing birds interact with the wake of a leading neighbor, or to predict what flapping phase offset would be appropriate for aerodynamically beneficial interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analyses were conducted using the statistical toolbox in MATLAB r2017b (The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA).

eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Compound-V formations in shorebird flocks&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports on the dynamics and spatial distribution of individual birds in different flocks of shorebirds. The study covers 4 shorebird species that comprise a seven-fold range in body mass in flocks that ranged from hundreds to a thousand individuals. The flocks were filmed and analyzed using stereo-photogrammetry. The paper reports, for the first time, detailed kinematic and behavioral insight in the formation of shorebird flocks, reporting that on average the horizontal spacing between the birds is about 1 wingspan. Consequently, the spacing is larger between larger birds in absolute distance. Another key find is that the flight speed of individual shorebirds differs depending on the position within the flock. The logical consequence of this find is that these flocks undergo spatial turnover. This behavior may be representative for shorebirds maneuvering as a flock during foraging flights and evading predators, but it is unclear if such dynamics would prevail during long-distance migratory flights, since it may dissolve the flock structure over time. The study thus reports key insights in how shorebirds move as a collective and poses new questions about how this behavior may differ between flight objectives.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree with the authors that the basic findings are of interest to a general audience, however, they disagree with the interpretation of the findings and wording in the discussion. The reviewers believe the authors will agree with the reviewers that there may be confounding factors such as the effect of wind gusts and atmospheric turbulence on the displacement and dynamics of vortex wakes that are not fully addressed in the present manuscript. Further, based on state-of-the-art measurement technology it is currently not possible to measure the aerodynamic parameters that would substantiate some of the far-reaching claims made in the manuscript. In case the authors are willing to rewrite the manuscript to remove all un-substantiated discussion (see reviewer comments below) and refocus the manuscript on the valuable and interesting kinematic and behavioral measurements and outcomes, the manuscript could be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The revision would include removing most of the discussion and rewriting the key point the authors want to maintain in a condensed format in the very last paragraph: Summarizing it as a speculation on aerodynamic and energetic implications in which the authors propose a need for further study to substantiate these interpretations. All paragraphs before the very last should be speculation free and in accordance with the reviewer comments below. That way a general audience can benefit from the remarkable and interesting findings reported, and it is fine that the precise function cannot be pinned down as of yet, this study will encourage the field to pursue this in follow-up studies. In summary the main concerns are:</p><p>1) Crosswind was not established accurately, and this may confound interpretations. We note that it is possible to estimate crosswinds using balloons and tracking, as pioneered by Pennycuick.</p><p>2) The flow field generated by birds flying together is unknown and as such any interpretation of spacing in a flock requires speculation. Whereas other papers have speculated on this before, setting a president, we think everyone can agree on that this is a problem (and not a feature) in the literature that we would want to discourage in future papers to advance a more rigorous understanding of collective behavior.</p><p>Specific concerns:</p><p>1) It is unknown how gusts and atmospheric turbulence may affect the advection and dynamics of wake vortices in the flock, and also the vortex wakes themselves are likely to interact in complex manners that have yet to be quantified. We are concerned that factors are likely confounding the proposed optimal aerodynamic spacing of the birds in the flock. Although it is clear that birds don't need to be benefiting at every instant and that it is probably more reasonable to consider advantages as an ensemble average, care has to be taken to only claim what we can be certain off based on the current data, which do not include flow field measurements. Having shared this reasonable criticism, the reviewers also agree it is reasonable that this could not be quantified at this time or in the near future based on current technology, so we don't expect it to be addressed other than by a manuscript rewrite. This important limitation should be integrated in the discussion and has co-driven our request to move all speculative aspects of the manuscript to the last paragraph of the paper. In this we ask the authors to adhere to the principle &quot;less is more&quot; so they can feature and compel the reader by communicating their main interpretation of the observed kinematics and behavior in the last paragraph while engaging a broad audience with data we all agree on in the main body of the text.</p><p>2) The birds would have to fly relatively close to gain noticeable aerodynamic benefit from flying close to the bird in front, but that doesn't appear to always be the case either. This would be worthy of an extra figure so any speculative claims in the last paragraph can be supported, in case these distances are likely too large to give substantial (ensemble) benefits. This data would still be of interest to report, because we currently lack quantitative information on the matters in the literature.</p><p>3) The manuscript suggests that the aerodynamic benefit of being in a flock is that individuals fly faster when in the V-optima position. It is unclear to us if this is a benefit, how does that work exactly? How is this in agreement with the objective of individuals in a flock to stick together? Some of the questions that come up for birds flying in a cluster include, where do you speed up to? How does this work spatially and topologically? If birds are using an interaction rule, wouldn't one speeding up cause the others to speed up? Regardless of whether they are in the V-optima position (which is a topological argument)? Is it just a case of individuals of different sizes having to compromise their preferred optimal solo speed to be part of a group? Addressing these issues and questions requires restructuring the manuscript to focus on the data and holding off interpretation and discussion till a concise speculation at the very end of the manuscript. The reason being that the data cannot satisfactory answer these questions, but the data are indeed interesting and thought provoking, which can be highlighted satisfactory by restructuring the manuscript to first present undeniable observations before presenting interpretations that cannot be fully supported by this valuable dataset.</p><p>4) In the new speculative last paragraph, we like to see a deeper appreciation of the differences between the new compound-V versus previously reported 'conventional' V formation. Flying in a coherent compound V that remains stable over time requires the individual flight behavior to adhere to topological, spatial, and thus flight dynamic constraints. Questions come up about how flight speed and wingbeat are modulated to fly in a compound-CV? Do the classic adjustment rules for individuals in a flock need to be adjusted (e.g. alignment, speed adjustment, etc.). And how does flying within these constraints enable an individual vs ensemble to save energy? It seems particularly challenging to satisfactory address such questions, and this may also not be needed if the manuscript focusses on reporting the measured outcomes first and foremost, with a reasonable and balanced speculation in the final paragraph encouraging further study of parameters the authors feel will be particularly insightful to support their speculation.</p><p>5) The data is insufficient to fully support the putative 'ultimate' benefits of flocking in compound V formations. The proximate factors seem to be better supported and thus more appropriate to highlight.</p><p>6) It would be great to clarify the following in the manuscript regarding flight speed and compromise: If the groups don't split up, and they leave and arrive at the same time, what really is the benefit, and how are they gaining an advantage by speeding up exactly?</p><p>7) Please rigorously clarify how height was determined in the manuscript and Materials and methods. It takes quite a lot of effort to actually establish this. However, if you are suggesting that birds are in a position to take advantage of upwash to save energy etc., they need to be in the same horizontal plane, or if the wake is advected downward as one expects on basic theory and experiments, they should have some stagger. This needs to be described (albeit briefly) much earlier on and made clear with solid references to the peer reviewed literature. Presently, it's not spelled out and basically not possible to find this information and establish what was done.</p><p>8) Please report and clarify the wingbeat phasing in the compound flock. Are we correct to assume that with individual positioning and flaps identified, this can be analyzed? If not, please clarify in the Materials and methods and integrate these limitations in the Discussion.</p><p>9) Figure 1 D and G show some movement around the V-optima, what is the relationship between the distance (or delta) between V-optima versus flap frequency? And how does this relate to flight speed? Please report and discuss the relationship between flap frequency and positioning regardless of the effect size. (<italic>eLife</italic> encourages reporting both positive and negative findings).</p><p>10) An alternative and equally reasonable hypothesis to the energy hypothesis is that the birds are simply avoiding colliding and end up speeding up and spacing their positions in the flock near-equally accordingly to equally distribute the risk of collision. How does the data support one hypothesis more than the other? The collision avoidance seems more parsimonious at first glance. Please note that <italic>eLife</italic> is interested in the data regardless of which hypothesis it supports best, the dataset and behavioral patterns found are exciting regardless of the precise functional significance, because it is striking and thought provoking in its own right.</p><p>11) Please expand the rationale behind the functional tradeoffs/significance for (or against) mixed-species flocks based on the present literature in the Introduction.</p><p>12) Please integrate more of the statistics reported in the Materials and methods in the main text (currently the two key results described in the main text are a regression and a Mann-Whitney U test). If there are reasons to believe the current statistical details in the manuscript are sufficient, please explain why in the main text and refer to details in the main text. (Because the current form is somewhat unbalanced and confusing.)</p><p>13) The wind speed comparisons between the estimates presented and the weather station are significantly different: a +/- 45° difference in accuracy could have a substantial effect on your findings, please integrate this in your discussion as a limitation. This is one of the reasons we like to see the more speculative discussion/implications in the last paragraph to ensure the overall report is rigorous (except for the last more speculative paragraph).</p><p>14) The method of estimating airspeed based on measured ground speed of birds flying in different directions seems troublesome, since it has been established in earlier studies that birds change their airspeed depending on whether they fly in head-, tail- or side winds. Please integrate this literature in your experimental limitations in the Material and methods as well as in the (new) more speculative last paragraph. It is generally accepted that it is more accurate and appropriate to measure local wind directly using anemometer or tracking weather balloons (ascending balloons could easily have been filmed to get wind speed and direction).</p><p>15) Whereas we agree the statistics are impressive compared to previous studies, we like to see some caution since the study is based on 18 flocks, of which only two were of mixed species, which is a limited subset of a behavior that remains to be further studied. This further justifies our consensus that speculation needs to be limited to the last paragraph. It would be great if the outlook encourages more detailed study of other flocks across different habitats and periods during the year/migration.</p><p>16) Please note and integrate that the &quot;previously-undescribed&quot; flock structure termed &quot;compound V-formation&quot; is a well-known structure among shorebird watchers. Please refer to Piersma et al., 1990, as well as other ecological studies reporting/discussing these behaviors.</p><p>17) We do not understand why at one point the authors refer to body size variation among flock member as an explanation, and yet a fixed wing span is assumed for all members of a species in the same analyses. Please clarify the limitations and resolve the confusion for the reader.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45071.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Crosswind was not established accurately, and this may confound interpretations.

As suggested, we have created an additional figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) that shows the relative density of nearest neighbors and summarizes the percent of neighbors included in a set of plausible aerodynamic interaction zone. This was 29.74% for the shorebird flocks described here, in contrast to the 4.3% calculated for a chimney swift flock previously measured using a similar videographic approach (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The manuscript suggests that the aerodynamic benefit of being in a flock is that individuals fly faster when in the V-optima position.

These questions remain for future work, and we now point this out in our final paragraph of the Discussion.

It takes quite a lot of effort to actually establish this.

This needs to be described (albeit briefly) much earlier on and made clear with solid references to the peer reviewed literature. Presently, it's not spelled out and basically not possible to find this information and establish what was done.</p></disp-quote><p>We have emphasized in the Materials and methods, Results and figures (e.g. Figure 2) that birds were treated as being in the same horizontal plane if they were within +- one wingspan in elevation. It is noted in the first paragraph of the Discussion that on average, this includes 56% of neighbor positions. We have made sure to mention that neighbors are considered to be in the same horizontal plane when they are within +- one wingspan in elevation wherever these results are described. Elevation itself is a direct output from the 3D photogrammetry measurements, with uncertainty similar to the horizontal plane positions. We have elaborated slightly on the Methodological approach to gravity alignment and height determination in the “Three-dimensional calibration”. Finally, because of the complexity and uncertainty of the wake structure, we did not have an a priori prediction regarding the optimal trailing elevation (whether to be level, below or above the leading neighbor). Therefore, we did not include this originally in our results. However, in case this is of interest to some readers in the future, we have added this information to our results (see last sentence of first paragraph in the Results). Finally, a recent study simulating flapping formation flight indicates that the optimal position for trailing neighbors may be above, below, or at the same elevation as the leading bird depending on what is being optimized – see Tay, W. B., Murugaya, K. R., Chan, W. L., and Khoo, B. C. (2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please report and clarify the wingbeat phasing in the compound flock. Are we correct to assume that with individual positioning and flaps identified, this can be analyzed? If not, please clarify in the Materials and methods and integrate these limitations in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This information was included in our original submission (see third paragraph of the Biomechanicssection of the Results). We chose not to discuss this finding at length in the Discussion to avoid further speculation regarding potential aerodynamic interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 1 D and G show some movement around the V-optima, what is the relationship between the distance (or delta) between V-optima versus flap frequency? And how does this relate to flight speed? Please report and discuss the relationship between flap frequency and positioning regardless of the effect size. (eLife encourages reporting both positive and negative findings).</p></disp-quote><p>Position relative to the predicted V-optima had no effect on wingbeat frequency. If one adds the “aerodynamic neighbor” variable to our final model for wingbeat frequency, the Bayesian Information Criterion value increases by 6.7 and this variable is not statistically significant in the model (p = 0.30). We have added this information to the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) An alternative and equally reasonable hypothesis to the energy hypothesis is that the birds are simply avoiding colliding and end up speeding up and spacing their positions in the flock near-equally accordingly to equally distribute the risk of collision. How does the data support one hypothesis more than the other? The collision avoidance seems more parsimonious at first glance. Please note that eLife is interested in the data regardless of which hypothesis it supports best, the dataset and behavioral patterns found are exciting regardless of the precise functional significance, because it is striking and thought provoking in its own right.</p></disp-quote><p>The collision avoidance hypothesis was presented in the original discussion, where we noted that it does not appear to be a good fit to the compound-V formation. We have now expanded this paragraph (Discussion, paragraph four) to more fully explain our reasoning. The main difference between predictions of the collision avoidance hypothesis <italic>vs.</italic> aerodynamics hypothesis is that collision avoidance predicts where <italic>not</italic> to fly, whereas the aerodynamic hypothesis predicts a specific positional arrangement among neighbors. If collision avoidance were the primary factor dictating positioning, we would expect to see much more variation in flock density and modal flock positioning, as is present in other flocking species that have been studied, including starlings and swifts (see newly added Figure 3—figure supplement 1). However, we agree that in the absence of more direct evidence, the ultimate function of the flock arrangements observed cannot be determined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Please expand the rationale behind the functional tradeoffs/significance for (or against) mixed-species flocks based on the present literature in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>A review of the benefits and costs of mixed-species flocking is beyond the scope of this manuscript, as this was a relatively small part of what our study addresses. However, we did add a discussion paragraph on the mixed-species flocking result and how our results apply (Discussion paragraph two).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Please integrate more of the statistics reported in the Materials and methods in the main text (currently the two key results described in the main text are a regression and a Mann-Whitney U test). If there are reasons to believe the current statistical details in the manuscript are sufficient, please explain why in the main text and refer to details in the main text. (Because the current form is somewhat unbalanced and confusing.)</p></disp-quote><p>The statistical tests described in the Materials and methods are Rao’s test for circular distribution uniformity, and a linear mixed-effects model for assessing the relationship of many measurements and properties on flapping frequency and estimated airspeed. The Rao’s test results are in Table 2 and the linear mixed effects model results are presented in Table 3. Because the mixed effect models produce a large list of the individual coefficients and p values we believe they are better presented together in the Table. However, we have added additional references to the statistics tables, and we now provide the associated p-value when specific results are presented in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The wind speed comparisons between the estimates presented and the weather station are significantly different: a +/- 45° difference in accuracy could have a substantial effect on your findings, please integrate this in your discussion as a limitation. This is one of the reasons we like to see the more speculative discussion/implications in the last paragraph to ensure the overall report is rigorous (except for the last more speculative paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>We now call more attention to the discrepancy in text (see Estimating wind speed and directionsection in Materials and methods) and point out how uncertainty in the wind speed and direction limits interpretation of other results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The method of estimating airspeed based on measured ground speed of birds flying in different directions seems troublesome, since it has been established in earlier studies that birds change their airspeed depending on whether they fly in head-, tail- or side winds. Please integrate this literature in your experimental limitations in the Materials and methods as well as in the (new) more speculative last paragraph. It is generally accepted that it is more accurate and appropriate to measure local wind directly using anemometer or tracking weather balloons (ascending balloons could easily have been filmed to get wind speed and direction).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that an independent measure of wind speed and direction would be useful and more appropriate for minimizing error. Unfortunately, it was not possible to use balloons at our field site because it would have disturbed many migratory birds, including the birds we were studying, and because it was logistically infeasible to access areas of marsh and bay from where balloons would have needed to be released. We now indicate these limitations in the manuscript (see final Discussion paragraph). We have also expanded the Materials and methods description of our measurement to note the concern that birds may vary airspeed with wind direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Whereas we agree the statistics are impressive compared to previous studies, we like to see some caution since the study is based on 18 flocks, of which only two were of mixed species, which is a limited subset of a behavior that remains to be further studied. This further justifies our consensus that speculation needs to be limited to the last paragraph. It would be great if the outlook encourages more detailed study of other flocks across different habitats and periods during the year / migration.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s sentiment. We now conclude our discussion by suggesting further research that emphasizes comparative research on birds flocking in different habitats and conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Please note and integrate that the &quot;previously-undescribed&quot; flock structure termed &quot;compound V-formation&quot; is a well-known structure among shorebird watchers. Please refer to Piersma et al., 1990, as well as other ecological studies reporting/discussing these behaviors.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer providing this reference. We have incorporated the descriptions of flocking behavior by Piersma, as well as those of earlier work by Heppner, 1974. We now describe our findings in relation to this research and no longer claim that these are novel flock structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) We do not understand why at one point the authors refer to body size variation among flock member as an explanation, and yet a fixed wing span is assumed for all members of a species in the same analyses. Please clarify the limitations and resolve the confusion for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggestion that the flock segregates by size was put forth as a possible explanation for why birds at different front-to-back positions in the flock had different wingbeat frequencies. We were not able to resolve individual differences in body size (or wingspan), therefore we could not test this hypothesis directly. Because of this, we have removed the speculation of body size influencing flock position as part of the broader effort to include less speculation in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
