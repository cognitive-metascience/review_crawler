Skin vasculature undergoes dramatic remodeling during adult mouse hair cycle. Specifically, a horizontal plexus under the secondary hair germ (HPuHG) transiently neighbors the HFSC activation zone during the quiescence phase (telogen). Increased density of HPuHG can be induced by reciprocal mutations in the epithelium (<italic>Runx1</italic>) and endothelium (<italic>Alk1</italic>) in adult mice, and is accompanied by prolonged HFSC quiescence and by delayed entry and progression into the hair growth phase (anagen). Suggestively, skin vasculature produces BMP4, a well-established HFSC quiescence-inducing factor, thus contributing to a proliferation-inhibitory environment near the HFSC. Conversely, the HFSC activator Runx1 regulates secreted proteins with previously demonstrated roles in vasculature remodeling. We suggest a working model in which coordinated remodeling and molecular cross-talking of the adult epithelial and endothelial skin compartments modulate timing of HFSC activation from quiescence for proper tissue homeostasis of adult skin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hair follicle stem cells</kwd><kwd>vascular niche</kwd><kwd>Alk1</kwd><kwd>Runx1</kwd><kwd>skin vasculature</kwd><kwd>hair cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 AR070157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tumbar</surname><given-names>Tudorita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012636</institution-id><institution>New York State Stem Cell Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DOH01-C30293GG-3450000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>Prachi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 AR073806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tumbar</surname><given-names>Tudorita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hair follicle epithelium and skin vasculature remodeling are coordinated during quiescence, and their cross-talking is associated with the timing of stem cell activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cell (SC) maintenance and function depend on signals from their local microenvironment, the SC niche. Adult neural, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic SCs neighbor the vasculature, which not only supplies oxygen and nutrients but also provides molecular signals to the stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goldberg and Hirschi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gómez-Gaviro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oh and Nör, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Waldau, 2015</xref>), particularly through endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azevedo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perlin et al., 2017</xref>). An intimate molecular communication from the vascular niche to the SCs contributes to tissue homeostasis and repair. Reverse signaling, from SCs to the neighboring niche, was also shown in zebrafish where a hematopoietic SC can indeed remodel the perivascular niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>). Little is known about skin vasculature cross-talking with adult hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). Previously, we proposed a hypothetical model in which adult epithelial HFSCs cluster in their tissue residence (the bulge) to produce gradients of signaling molecules that might remodel the surrounding microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fuchs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tumbar et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>HFSCs reside in the upper segment of the hair follicle (HF) known as the bulge, and are embedded deep into the skin dermis. During hair cycle, bulge HFSCs periodically regenerate the temporary lower HF region (bulb), which grows downward into the hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cotsarelis, 2006</xref>). HFs undergo morphologically recognizable and synchronous phases of remodeling, known as catagen (bulb destruction), telogen (quiescence and rest) and anagen (bulb growth). At catagen a subset of quiescent HFSCs leave the bulge, and form the secondary hair germ, which replaces the apoptotic hair bulb. The skin loses most of its fat in the hypodermis, shrinks considerably in thickness, and the HFs enter the resting phase, or telogen. In anagen, signals from the environment, including the fat progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldstein and Horsley, 2012</xref>), activate the quiescent HFSCs in the hair germ to produce a new hair bulb with a newly growing hair shaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cotsarelis, 2006</xref>). The bulge HFSCs that go into the hair germ are subsequently replenished at anagen by self-renewing symmetric divisions of the bulge SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). The fat layer in the hypodermis and surrounding the growing hair bulb also regenerates in parallel with the hair follicle at anagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldstein and Horsley, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although poorly understood, the skin vasculature is remodeled along with the massive changes in the skin structure and thickness that result in destruction and reconstruction of the highly vascularized hypodermis. In human skin, vasculature associated cells known as pericytes may promote SC proliferation of the inter-follicular epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhuang et al., 2018</xref>), although any effects on hair follicle stem cell activation have not been addressed. Furthermore, a permanent vascular structure, known as the upper venule annulus, neighbors the upper hair bulge region at all hair cycle stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>), but the significance of this association is not understood. Importantly, angiogenesis and recruitment of blood vessels promote stronger hair shaft production, presumably by providing nutrients to rapidly dividing hair matrix progenitor cells in the bulb during full anagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mecklenburg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yano et al., 2001</xref>), but these studies have not examined the potential cross-talk of vasculature with quiescent HFSC at earlier stages of hair cycle (catagen/telogen).</p><p>Previously we showed that adult HFSC activation and telogen to anagen progression are promoted by runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Osorio et al., 2008</xref>), a transcription factor also important for hematopoietic SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yzaguirre et al., 2017</xref>). Runx1 is up-regulated at catagen in quiescent HFSCs migrated from the bulge, which form the hair germ, where Runx1 promotes the ‘primed’ stem cell state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scheitz et al., 2012</xref>). This cell state is more susceptible to activation from quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gonzales and Fuchs, 2017</xref>), because of changes in lipid metabolism and in susceptibility to specific signaling (e.g. Wnt) which we showed were driven by Runx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Osorio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scheitz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we characterized in detail the arrangements of vasculature near the HFSC activation zone, and found a transient dense horizontal plexus under the hair germ during late stages of quiescence (late catagen/telogen). We show that <italic>Cdh5-CreERT2</italic> induced endothelial-specific mutation in <italic>Activin A Receptor Like Type 1</italic> (<italic>Acvrl1</italic>, or <italic>Alk1</italic>), a gene known for controlling vasculature remodeling in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">González-Núñez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oh et al., 2000</xref>), affects the hair-cycle related remodeling of skin vasculature. This mutation results in increase of CD31+ vasculature density in the horizontal plexus near the hair germ and impaired HFSC activation with delayed progression into anagen. We provide evidence that skin endothelial cells produce BMP signals, previously proven essential for HFSC quiescence and hair cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Botchkarev and Sharov, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Tumbar, 2012</xref>). Conversely, we find that <italic>Runx1</italic> mutation in the epithelium not only delays stem cell activation and hair cycle progression as we showed before, but also increases the density of vasculature in the horizontal plexus under the hair germ. Our data are consistent with a model in which increased vasculature near the HFSC activation zone is inhibitory to stem cell activation and prolongs quiescence by delaying progression from telogen into anagen. We propose that reciprocal communication and coordination between HFSCs and vasculature are essential for proper skin homeostasis and for timely HFSC activation, and outline target genes for future mechanistic studies to dissect the molecular pathways involved in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Horizontal vascular plexus under hair germ transiently neighboring hair follicle stem cell activation zone during hair cycle</title><p>To understand in detail how the skin vasculature is remodeled near the HFSC activation zone in the hair germ during hair cycle, we sacrificed C57BL/6 wild type mice at late catagen (PD19), telogen (PD20), early anagen (PD21) and anagen (PD28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We will refer to the dense horizontal vasculature structure underneath the hair germ at telogen as the horizontal (H) plexus (P) under(u) the hair (H) germ (G) (HPuHG). The data suggest that the HPuHG forms at late catagen when skin vasculature changes the orientation from vertical to horizontal as shown by our angle measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>), and it is most prominent by telogen (PD20). The HPuHG disperses again at early anagen (PD21) and anagen (PD28) when the vasculature regains its vertical orientation relative to epidermis, as shown by data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B–C</xref>. Parallel with the morphological re-organization of skin vasculature around the hair germ described above, CD31+ endothelial cells undergo apoptosis at catagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) and proliferation at anagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), as shown by immunostaining for Caspase-3 and Ki67 and quantification. Importantly, the co-localization data were analyzed in single optical confocal images to rule out confounding interpretation from possible vasculature associated cells rather than CD31+ endothelial cells. The detection of proliferation and apoptosis in skin endothelial cells during hair cycle was in line with previously reported data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mecklenburg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yano et al., 2001</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45977.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>CD31+ vasculature undergoes proliferation at anagen and apoptosis at catagen.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Skin sections from mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> at late catagen (PD19), telogen (PD20), early anagen (PD21), and anagen (PD28) stained for CD31 and Ki67 or activated Caspase 3, imaged using confocal microscopy and Z-stacks (<bold>A,C,D,E</bold>) and shown as maximal projections. (<bold>B, F</bold>) Quantification was done by comparing Z-stack maximal projections with individual optical slices to verify co-localization. Caspase-3 quantification (<bold>B</bold>) was difficult to count as individual cells, and is shown as a semi-quantitative measure where ‘+++” means most frequent and “– “means absent. Strongly positive Ki67 cells are peripherally associated with vasculature, but are not actually CD31+ as shown by analysis of both individual confocal optical sections and projections through stack.

Specifically, from late catagen to telogen when HFSCs in hair germ prepare for subsequent activation, the skin vasculature becomes more horizontal and forms a characteristic plexus, with dense vessels bundling underneath the hair germ, a structure that we call the HPuHG. The HPuHG is transient, as it is strongly present in the vicinity of the hair germ at telogen. From telogen to early anagen, when HFSCs are activated and begin to proliferate, the HPuHG is dispersed and the vasculature largely regains its vertical orientation while the hypodermis expands pushing the remaining horizontal vasculature bundles away from the vicinity of the proliferating hair germ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> right panels for cartoon summary). Following this remarkable skin vasculature morphological remodeling through late catagen/telogen and early anagen, later on in full anagen the CD31+ cells also proliferate robustly undergoing angiogenesis followed by endothelial cell apoptosis at catagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Alk1</italic> endothelial-specific mutant via <italic>Cdh5-CreERT2</italic> increases density of HPuHG and delays HFSC activation and hair cycle progression</title><p>To understand if skin vasculature organization during telogen is relevant to subsequent HFSC activation and hair cycle progression, we aimed to perturb the characteristic remodeling from within the endothelium and examine possible effects on the hair epithelium and on hair cycle.

Our results instead suggest that prior to HFSCs activation and anagen onset, at late catagen/telogen, increased non-arterial vasculature near the hair germ has an inhibitory effect on stem cell activation and hair growth. Therefore, we considered the possibility that endothelial cells in the HPuHG may secrete HFSC quiescence-inducing factors, of which the most well-understood candidate is BMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Botchkarev and Sharov, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Tumbar, 2012</xref>).

BMP4 protein and mRNA levels oscillate through the hair cycle and are highly produced in skin during quiescence, whereas <italic>BMP Receptor Type-I</italic> (<italic>BMPRI)</italic> epithelial deletion is sufficient to activate the HFSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Botchkarev and Sharov, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Tumbar, 2012</xref>).</p><p>To examine if BMP4 protein is indeed expressed in skin vasculature we stained skin sections for BMP4 and CD31 from both WT and <italic>Alk1</italic> EndKO mice that were hair cycle stage matched, at Telogen/Anagen I, when rare Ki67+ cells are present in some HFs. Confocal imaging revealed pronounced BMP4 signal in vasculature-like structures, which expressed variable levels of CD31. These structures were distributed throughout the skin, but their density was increased in the HPuHG region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, left panels). The BMP4 expression was further accentuated in the HPuHG region in the <italic>Alk1</italic> EndKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right panels and quantified in 6B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Some BMP4+ vasculature-like structures of the HPuHG show lower or possibly absent levels of CD31, and these were more pronounced in the <italic>Alk1</italic> EndKO. The basis of this phenotype will be examined more in future, but we suspect it has to do with a reduction of CD31 expression in the <italic>Alk1</italic> EndKO vasculature. Quantification of BMP4 signal in the CD31+ regions in HPuHG area confirmed our visual assessment that CD31+ endothelial cells do not produce more BMP4 in the <italic>Alk1</italic> EndKO skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Taken these considerations together, the increase in BMP4 signal in the HPuHG area can be reasonably attributed to increased density of vasculature in this region. Further analysis showed that the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) expressed equal BMP4 levels in both control and <italic>Alk1</italic> EndKO skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>).

We conclude that skin vasculature produces BMP4, and thus its clustering in the HPuGH at late catagen/telogen generates high concentration of HFSC-quiescence inducing factors underneath the HFSC activation zone. These correlations provide a plausible, though likely partial, explanation of the delay in HFSC activation and hair cycle progression in the <italic>Alk1</italic> EndKO mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45977.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Increased BMP4 protein in the endothelial <italic>Alk1</italic> KO skin underneath the hair germ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of skin stained with BMP4 antibodies show prominent expression in the HPuHG region in vessel-like structure. Note increased BMP4 in the HPuHG region in the <italic>Alk1</italic> EndKO skin.

We conclude that during catagen VIII/telogen, Runx1 acts in the epithelial HFSCs destined to be activated (hair germ) to guide the remodeling of vasculature at this stage and promote a more dispersed vasculature plexus underneath the hair germ (HPuHG). Importantly, this paracrine function of epithelial Runx1 in vasculature organization is accompanied by a delay of HFSCs activation and progression of hair cycle into anagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Osorio et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Vasculature and hair follicle stem cell cross-communication during quiescence for proper subsequent skin homeostasis</title><p>Cross-talking between tissue stem cells and their environment is critical for tissue homeostasis. Hair follicle is an excellent system to study adult tissue regeneration, yet surprisingly little is known about the cross-communication between vasculature and HFSCs. Here we provide the first evidence for reciprocal communication that exists between vasculature and HFSCs in the hair germ during late quiescence stages of hair cycle, a stage, skin location, and specific question not examined by previous work of vasculature in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mecklenburg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhuang et al., 2018</xref>). We demonstrate that targeted mutations to either the epithelial (<italic>Runx1</italic>) or the endothelial (<italic>Alk1</italic>) compartments during the critical stage of late catagen/telogen has reciprocal effects on proper reorganization and functionality of the opposite compartment. In both cases, the mutations delayed the subsequent timing of HFSC activation and hair cycle progression and resulted in increased density of vasculature underneath the hair germ at telogen. We describe a precise choreography of vasculature remodeling around the HFSCs activation zone (hair germ) during late quiescence phases of late catagen/telogen, with transient dense vasculature under the hair germ, that has not been previously described.</p><p>Our data suggest a hypothetical model of how the HF epithelium and the skin endothelium communicate with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), for future experimental testing. Specifically, during late catagen the vasculature changes its vertical orientation and even distribution in the skin, and transiently forms a dense horizontal plexus underneath the hair germ (HPuHG), closely neighboring the HFSC activation zone during telogen. Suggestively, we find that CD31+ skin vasculature produces BMP4 which is highly present in the HPuHG, thus generating a high concentration of this well-known HFSC-quiescence inducing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Botchkarev and Sharov, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Tumbar, 2012</xref>) underneath the stem cell activation zone in the hair germ. BMP ligand expression levels are known to oscillate in skin through the hair cycle, inhibiting HFSC activation and hair cycle progression from telogen to anagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Botchkarev and Sharov, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Tumbar, 2012</xref>). BMP ligand expression has been documented in several different skin cell types such as fibroblast and adipocytes and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Botchkarev and Sharov (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Tumbar (2012)</xref>, although BMP4 expression in skin vasculature has not been previously reported to our knowledge. <italic>BMPRI</italic> deletion in the epithelium is known sufficient to induce HFSC proliferation and anagen onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Botchkarev and Sharov, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Tumbar, 2012</xref>). Thus, our data showing increased density of vasculature in the HFSCs activation zone, together with previous work on BMP signaling in skin, are compelling in suggesting that the HPuHG may inhibit HFSC activation through secretion of HFSC-quiescence inducing molecules, such as BMP. Additional quiescence-inducing mechanisms of the vasculature, such as hypoxia, are seen for instance in the hematopoietic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulais and Frenette, 2015</xref>) and should be analyzed here. Hypoxia is especially a possible candidate, given the high density of non-arterial (non O2 carrying) vasculature in the HPuHG (this work). Our data using <italic>Runx1</italic> epithelial and <italic>Alk1</italic> endothelial-specific mutations demonstrate reciprocal communication and perturbed remodeling in the opposite compartments at late catagen/telogen. These results provide a consistent and compelling correlation between increased density of the HPuHG with prolonged HFSC quiescence that corroborate with our working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We propose that the density of the HPuHG controls timing and robustness of subsequent HFSCs activation through BMP and other inhibitory signals, whereas the epithelium clearly modulates the density of the HPuHG forming at late stages of quiescence in hair cycle likely through specific Runx1 downstream targets relevant to vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45977.025</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model of HFSCs and vasculature cross-talking in hair cycle.</title><p>Left side: During late stages of HFSC quiescence (late catagen/telogen) remodeling of skin vasculature results in assembly of the horizontal plexus under hair germ HPuHG.

We find that endothelial knockout of <italic>Alk1</italic> induced at catagen (but importantly not when induced a few days later, at early anagen) had remarkable effects on skin vasculature organization. <italic>Alk1</italic> (<italic>Activin A Receptor Like Kinase 1</italic>) is a type I receptor for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family proteins, and is essential for proper blood vessel development and branching in the yolk sac and in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oh et al., 2000</xref>). Intriguingly, it has been proposed that <italic>Alk1</italic> loss prolongs the activation phase and delays the resolution phase of angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oh et al., 2000</xref>) suggesting a possible correlation with our hair cycle data (see more below in this section). Furthermore, endothelial cells isolated from <italic>Alk1</italic>-mutant skin were shown to form irregular, and disorganized vascular structures in vitro when compared with normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2013</xref>). In telogen/early anagen, we show that proliferation of normal skin vasculature is rare and occurs mostly in the zone underneath the hair germ (HPuHG), where vasculature appears increased in the <italic>Alk1</italic> EndKO (these data). Given our analysis of vascular remodeling during hair cycle, it is presumable that the HPuHG is in the activation phase of angiogenesis during telogen/early anagen, which is regulated by Alk1. This would be followed by the resolution phase at full anagen when angiogenesis occurs in skin. From the HPuHG structure, it is likely that new vasculature branches out and grows vertically to populate the skin around the growing hair follicles, accounting for the increased skin vessel density at anagen. </p><p>We show here that <italic>Alk1</italic> expression in vasculature is required for correct density of vasculature under the hair germ and for the effective branching and dispersal of the HPuHG during late telogen and very early anagen. When the HPuHG dispersal and branching is impaired in the <italic>Alk1</italic> endothelial KO, dense vasculature bundles create high BMP4 concentrations under the hair germ, which we propose may be responsible for delayed HFSC activation and delayed progression into anagen. Prolonged <italic>Alk1</italic> loss and skin injury can result in abnormal fusions between veins and arteries, known as arteriovenous malformation (AVM) that can lead to hemorrhages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2009</xref>). Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, a human disease in which <italic>Alk1</italic> is mutated, shows prominent vasculature defects and skin AVMs in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2009</xref>). Hair growth defects have not been reported for Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, though a simple delay in anagen onset would not be easily detectable in human, where hair follicles are mostly quiescent and anagen onset is non-synchronous in most body regions (except on the scalp where hair is mostly at anagen). Our data implicating Alk1 in skin vasculature remodeling during hair cycle may aid in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease and may provide a link with its prevalence in the skin. The function of Alk1 in controlling the remodeling of the HPuHG in hair cycle supports a role of vasculature under the HFSCs activation zone in maintaining quiescence and in halting hair cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, left).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title><italic>Runx1</italic> expression in the quiescent epithelial hair follicle stem cells is important for organization of neighboring vasculature in hair cycle</title><p>Our previous work has shown that Runx1 has pleiotropic cell-autonomous effects on quiescent HFSCs including control of cell cycle factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jain et al., 2018</xref>), and Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Osorio et al., 2011</xref>). These multiple Runx1 functions prime the hair germ cells for proper timing of activation in the subsequent stage of the hair cycle, but are not sufficient for HFSC activation, as we showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Here we show that <italic>Runx1</italic> expression in the hair epithelium at catagen VIII/telogen is essential for the proper reorganization of vasculature under the hair germ. In the absence of <italic>Runx1</italic>, in the hair follicle, the epithelium remodels properly in quiescence prior to anagen onset, but the HPuHG is denser, showing agglomerated vasculature cables underneath the HFSC activation zone. Based on this we propose a model for future investigation in which HFSCs utilize the transcription factor Runx1 to counteract the inhibitory effect of dense vasculature array organized as horizontal plexus under the hair germ (HPuHG). We show that in turn this ensures proper BMP concentration (and likely other inhibitory signals) from the vasculature for subsequent timely SC activation.</p><p>Although more experiments are needed to understand how exactly is <italic>Runx1</italic> expression in the epithelium guiding the vasculature remodeling in the endothelium during the late quiescence stages of hair cycle, our previous genome-wide gene expression profiling data suggest relevant pathways for future investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, a handful of Runx1 target genes are secreted molecules with known function in vasculature remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), an early observation which in fact prompted us to begin this entire study. Interfering with their function in the epithelium would help answer directly which of these molecules or combination of molecules are critical for cross-talking of epithelium with endothelium. The <italic>Runx1</italic>-induced changes in gene expression occur very rapidly, within 1 day of <italic>Runx1</italic> induction in the epithelium. In normal skin Runx1 is highly expressed in the shrinking hair bulb epithelium, as well as in the precursors of the hair germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). The Runx1-driven molecules secreted from the epithelium likely produce specific patterns of the extracellular environment around the shrinking hair follicle during late catagen. This would promote specific cues for migration and survival of the endothelial cells at this stage, thus resulting in the characteristic pattern of vasculature near the hair germ, with the correct density of the ‘HPuHG’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, right).</p><p>An interesting category of our newly uncovered Runx1-target genes are the <italic>semaphorins</italic>, which can signal to endothelial cells for proper cell migration and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gu and Giraudo, 2013</xref>). Other examples of Runx1-target genes that may be potentially vasculature-relevant are extracellular matrix molecules such as <italic>fibronectin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), a gene with known functions in vasculature development and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kostourou and Papalazarou, 2014</xref>), or <italic>Colagen 5a1</italic> implicated in familial Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with lethal arterial events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Monroe et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, several Cxcl chemokine molecules appeared upregulated in response to <italic>Runx1</italic> induction in the HFSCs, and chemokine signaling from neighboring cells have demonstrated effects on movement of endothelial cells and vasculature patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bosisio et al., 2014</xref>). It is likely that synergistic effects from many of these relevant Runx1 target genes, create the complex skin vasculature patterning around the hair germ that we describe here, thus we surmise that a simple knockout of any one of these molecules may be insufficient to recapitulate the Runx1 effect on vasculature. It is worth noting that Runx1 has been previously reported to work in eye and cancer angiogenesis, cell-autonomously in the endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iwatsuki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lam et al., 2017</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first example of a non-cell autonomous role of Runx1, from within the SCs, to promote patterns of remodeling in the neighboring vasculature. Our data on Runx1 taken together, support a model in which HFSCs control the organization of their microenvironment, in particular the density of neighboring vasculature near the HFSC activation zone, for proper subsequent SC activation and tissue homeostasis.</p><p>In conclusion, our work provides preliminary evidence and a working model for two-directional communication and reciprocal remodeling influence between vasculature and epithelial HFSCs during the late quiescence stages of adult hair cycle. This coordination can be perturbed from each compartment by specific targeted mutation and in both cases this appears to influence subsequent timing of HFSCs activation and proper skin homeostasis. Our work lacks direct functional evidence for the molecular mechanisms that mediate the cross-talking between HFSCs and skin vasculature, but provides a handful of compelling candidates and a detailed understanding of the system for direct future investigation. Elucidating the molecular pathways at play is pending genetic targeting of the BMP4 and other candidates in the endothelium and also targeting of the many Runx1 target genes with known vasculature remodeling function in the epithelium at the critical stage of hair cycle we reveal here. Our work opens a new road of investigation in skin stem cell biology and may aid to our understanding of skin vasculature disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

The muscle structure was identified in images prior to contrasting and channel splitting, as shown by characteristic background fluorescence pattern in this structure of the skin subcutis.</p><p>BMP4 intensity in HPuHG was measured by selecting the HPuHG region, and the average intensity per pixel was calculated. Three rectangular boxes were randomly drawn in the background, and the average intensity per pixel was measured to obtain background intensity. The final HPuHG intensity was calculated as HPuHG raw intensity minus background intensity. For BMP4 intensity in CD31+ area in HPuHG region, CD31+ area was outlined from the HPuHG region using free hand selection tool, and the average raw intensity of BMP4 in those selected areas was measured in ImageJ. Then three rectangular areas in the background were randomly selected and average intensity per pixel was measured as background intensity. The final BMP4 intensity in CD31+ area was determined as raw intensity minus average background intensity. For BMP4 intensity in IFE, IFE regions were outlined using the freehand selection tool, and the average raw intensity of BMP4 per pixel in those regions was measured. The final BMP4 intensity in IFE was obtained by raw IFE BMP4 intensity minus average background intensity.</p><p>Quantification of C57BL/6 wild type total skin CD31+ vasculature during hair cycle was done by selecting vessels in the entire skin area above the muscle layer. The HPuHG area was defined as described above for the <italic>Runx1</italic> mutant mice in a selected region underneath the hair germ. Angles of vasculatures were obtained by drawing a line along the vasculature branches in total skin and measuring its angle relative to a horizontal line parallel to the epidermis.</p><p>Representative images were enhanced for better quality using Brightness/Contrast tool in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Autofluorescence from paper towel was removed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using JMP Pro 14. For statistical analysis performed on vasculature data from <italic>Runx1</italic> and <italic>Alk1</italic> mutant mice, genetic background, total area, and individual variance were considered as random effects attributed to individual mouse. Area of vasculature in our selected region of interest was our variable and p-values were calculated by two-way ANOVA and Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) analysis with unbounded variance components. P-values of statistical analysis related to BMP4 and Pcad<sup>High</sup> cell counting were calculated by REML method mentioned above using each individual mouse as the random effect. For statistical analysis performed for vasculature changes during hair cycle analysis in wild type BL6 mice p-value was calculated from Student’s t-test. For differences between the distribution of vasculature angles in each hair cycle stage, p-values were calculated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test.</p><p>Analyses for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> used JMP analysis on the data of vasculature length of contact with hair follicles, which were stage matched at telogen. Data were log transformed and separated by mouse ID to account for individual mouse variation. REML analysis was run on JMP, with mouse ID set as a random effect, location (germ, lower bulge, upper bulge) and fixed conditions (mutant type and its control). The log transformed values for length of contact were measured on the Y-axis and then the analysis was run as least squares means plot, generated by the program and used for analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Anne Eichmann from Yale University for sharing the <italic>Nrp1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> x <italic>Cdh5-CreERT2</italic> and the <italic>Alk1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> x <italic>Cdh5-CreERT2</italic> mice and for useful discussion.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Xing Dai (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript addresses the role of crosstalk between blood vessels and hair follicles in the skin. The authors demonstrate that changes in vessel remodeling occur during the hair follicle cycle. The data also indicate that loss of the BMP receptor Alk1 in endothelial cells alters hair follicle cycling. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that Runx1 depletion in the epidermis results in defects in vascular remodeling. This work pioneers in describing the vasculature organization of the skin endothelium during different stages of the hair cycle, alluding to the importance of this organization. Moreover, the authors have identified the precise time-point at which vasculature remodeling around the hair germ is essential for proper hair cycle progression. Altogether, the work presented in this article will be of interest to the broad audience of <italic>eLife</italic> and will significantly advance fields of skin stem cell biology and stem cell-niche interactions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Expression of BMP4 by endothelial cells.</p><p>A) The upregulation of BMP4 in endothelial cells from Alk1 EndKO mice is a critical point. Since BMP4 is also expressed by other cell types (e.g., IFE cells in control skin), quantitative analysis of signal intensity in HPuHG/vasculature and IFE of control and KO skin would be important to clarify points such as whether Alk1 EndKO-induced BMP4 expression change is unique to the endothelial cells, and whether this is an increase in the number of expressing cells or increase in the expression level in individual cells. Additionally, sorting of CD31+ endothelial cells followed by expression analysis for Bmp4 would be informative although not essential.</p><p>B) Is there evidence that BMP signaling is elevated in hair follicles from Alk1 endoKO mice?</p><p>C) Does Runx1 deletion alter BMP expression in the vasculature?</p><p>2) Analysis of endothelial morphology in mutant mice.</p><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 2: First, the authors need to show the same immunofluorescence (IF) experiment (CD31, Ephrinb2, NF1 and/or Ki67) carried out in both CDH5-CreERT2 x Nrp1 fl/fl TM PD17 and CDH5-CreERT2 x Alk1 fl/fl TM PD17 at a time point where the phenotypic differences in Alk1EndKO are observed.</p><p>Also, the Nrp1f/f TM PD17 mice should also be sacrificed at PD31 to show Ki67 staining in this skin is comparable to CT.

This data should be included to address at what time point the hair cycle is delayed in the absence of Alk1.</p><p>B) Figure 4—figure supplement 3: The authors show that the Ki67 staining signature to be vastly different in PD28/31 skin of CT+TM when compared to Alk1 EndKO.

However, we quantified the BMP4 intensity in the HPuHG area, using immunostaining of CD31 and BMP4 on skin sections. We used 12μm skin sections from mice that were stage-matched at the Telogen to Anagen transition (when rare Ki67+ cells are present in the hair germ), using <italic>Alk1</italic> CT and KO (n=3 per group). 9-16 images per mouse were taken under the same exposure (250ms for BMP4). In ImageJ, the HPuHG region was selected, and the average intensity per pixel was calculated. Three rectangular boxes were randomly drawn in the background region, and the average intensity per pixel was measured to obtain background intensity. The final HPuHG intensity was calculated as HPuHG raw intensity/pixel minus background intensity/pixel. Statistics was performed using REML approach, which took into consideration mouse to mouse variation in comparing CT and KO groups. The calculated p-value is 0.0069, indicating the significant increase in BMP4 concentration in HPuHG area in <italic>Alk1</italic> KO compared to CT. The quantification is now shown in new Figure 6B.</p><p>BMP4 intensity in endothelial cells per se, was also measured using the same images that were used for above analysis. Specifically, all the CD31+ pixels that are in the HPuHG region or partly within the HPuHG region were selected in ImageJ. Then BMP4 intensity per pixel in those CD31+ region was measured. Again, background values that were calculated before were subtracted from the raw BMP4 intensity in CD31+ region to get the final BMP4 intensity per pixel in CD31+ region. Statistics was performed using REML approach, and the calculated p-value is 0.2103. These results indicated there is no change in BMP4 expression by endothelial cells between <italic>Alk1</italic> CT and KO. Since we showed that there is an increase in the CD31+ area in the HPuHG region, it is reasonable to infer that the BMP4 increase comes from the increased vasculature density in this area. The quantification is shown in new Figure 6C. With that said, some BMP+ cable vascular-like structures in the HPuHG region of the <italic>Alk1</italic> KO have no, or perhaps low, CD31 and their identity will remain to be investigated in more details later.</p><p>BMP4 intensity in IFE was also analyzed, as requested by reviewers. For this analysis, 8-10 images per mouse were used. IFE regions were hand-selected in each image in the ImageJ software, and the BMP4 intensity per pixel was measured. After subtracting background intensity as described above for measurement in HPuHG, we got the final IFE BMP4 intensity. Statistics was performed using REML approach, and the calculated p-value is 0.9321. These results indicated there is no change in BMP4 expression by IFE keratinocytes in <italic>Alk1</italic> EndoKO mice. The quantification is shown in new Figure 6D.</p><p>Overall, our quantitative analysis indicates there is an increase in BMP4 local concentration near the hair germ (in HPuHG). This increase is not caused by increased expression of BMP4 by endothelial cells or keratinocytes, and can be attributed to increased CD31+ vasculature density in the HPuHG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Is there evidence that BMP signaling is elevated in hair follicles from Alk1 endoKO mice?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, 12μm <italic>Alk1</italic> KO and CT skin sections were immunostained with phospho-SMAD 1/5/8 (pSMAD), as it is an indication of BMP signaling. Once BMP4 binds to its receptor, then SMAD 1/5/8 will be phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus. We observed nuclear pSMAD staining in a fraction of the hair follicles in PD31 (Telogen-Anagen II) and PD35 (Anagen I-II) <italic>Alk1</italic> EndoKO, indicating the persistence of BMP4 signaling (data not shown). Unfortunately, the intensity of the P-Smad staining was highly dependent on the age of the blocks, with the older blocks not giving any signal at all, and the newer blocks staining more strongly. Because of this technical problem and after a lot of staining troubleshooting, and given the difficulty of obtaining sufficient new knockout mice in a timely manner, we decided is best to hold back on these data and combine it with future experiments where we will explore in more depth the relevance of BMP signaling to the cross-talking between vasculature and hair follicle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Does Runx1 deletion alter BMP expression in the vasculature?</p></disp-quote><p>Immunostaining of CD31 and BMP4 was performed on 12μm staged-matched <italic>Runx1</italic> PD17-20 CT and KO (Catagen VIII) skin sections. 5-8 images per mouse (n=3 per group) were taken under the same exposure (250ms for BMP4). BMP4 expression in CD31+ vasculature was quantified using the same method as for <italic>Alk1</italic> KO skin. Statistics results showed a p-value of 0.5087. This result showed that <italic>Runx1</italic> deletion did not alter BMP4 expression in the vasculature itself, meaning endothelial cells express similar amounts of BMP.</p><p>Since we found <italic>Runx1</italic> mutant also has increased vasculature density in the HPuHG region, we also tested whether local BMP4 level in this region was increased (as it was in the <italic>Alk1</italic> EndKO). Thus, we quantified BMP4 intensity in HPuHG region using the same method as we did for <italic>Alk1</italic> mutant, and statistics showed a p-value of 0.0168. This result further supported our conclusion that increased HPuHG vasculature leads to increased BMP4 local concentration, and this true in the <italic>Runx1</italic> EpiKO mice as well. These data are shown in new Figure 8E and F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Analysis of endothelial morphology in mutant mice.</p><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 2: First, the authors need to show the same immunofluorescence (IF) experiment (CD31, Ephrinb2, NF1 and/or Ki67) carried out in both CDH5-CreERT2 x Nrp1 fl/fl TM PD17 and CDH5-CreERT2 x Alk1 fl/fl TM PD17 at a time point where the phenotypic differences in Alk1EndKO are observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide additional evidence for a vasculature phenotype in the <italic>Alk1</italic> Endo KO in 2 groups of mice that were stage matched at either telogen (group 1) or at telogen/anagen1 (group 2), when rare Ki67+ cells are present in the hair germ – now shown in new Figure 5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the Nrp1f/f TM PD17 mice should also be sacrificed at PD31 to show Ki67 staining in this skin is comparable to CT. Additionally, did the authors induce with TM at PD21 for CDH5-CreERT2 x Nrp1 fl/fl mice? The inclusion of this treatment will eliminate the contribution of Nrp1 during the hair cycle.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we are unable to perform any new <italic>Nrp1</italic> experiments because we no longer have the <italic>Nrp1</italic> mutant mice. We did the initial screen quite a few years ago when we began this project, and because we did not see any phenotype in <italic>Nrp1</italic> KO mice whereas the <italic>Alk1</italic> Endo KO mice showed a robust and consistent phenotype both in hair cycle and in vasculature remodeling, we did not maintain the <italic>Nrp1</italic> mouse line and focused on <italic>Alk1</italic> mice instead. In our previous submission, we reasoned it’d be valuable for the community to provide the <italic>Nrp1</italic> data, even though was negative. However, we agree that the lack of <italic>Nrp1</italic> involvement in vasculature remodeling during the hair cycle may not be convincing enough based on existing data, thus we decided to remove this part from our manuscript since it does not add to our story.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additional hair cycle analysis in mutant mice</p><p>A) The authors should include a panel of treated CDH5-CreERT2 x Alk1 fl/fl TM PD17 mice sacrificed at early/mid Telogen (PD 20/25). Does loss of Alk1 affect progression through telogen, or it merely delays entry into anagen? This data should be included to address at what time point the hair cycle is delayed in the absence of Alk1.</p></disp-quote><p>We produced as many additional animals as we could for this revision in the past 4 months, and added a number of earlier time points to the analysis. We now have analyzed a total of 24 CT and 15 KO mice, on which we did immunostaining of Ki67 on 12μm skin sections to precisely establish the hair cycle stages at different ages. These mice are now summarized in Table 1 and in Figure 4E. Based on these results, we firmly conclude that KO mice enter telogen, but do not progress to anagen in a timely manner, due to a delay in stem cell activation in the hair germ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Figure 4—figure supplement 3: The authors show that the Ki67 staining signature to be vastly different in PD28/31 skin of CT+TM when compared to Alk1 EndKO. The morphology of the hair follicle (HF) was also different as shown in the representative images of the two skins (Figure 3C). The authors need to provide data showing that at PD28 there are no significant differences in hair cycle between CT+TM and EndKO skins.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize about this confusion. The intention was to use mice at matched hair cycle stages, and at PD28/31 where we examined a total of 18 mice we found enough CT and KO mice where follicle were at the same stage (Tel/Ana I – with rare KI67+ in the germ) and these stage-matched mice were used for quantification of vasculature. This was confusing because the majority of CT mice were at Ana II+, as indicated by our KI67 staining and shown in Figure 4C and E, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1C. In addition to mice stage matched at telogen-anagen I transition, we have now also used younger mice, stage matched at telogen. The quantification of both stages is shown in new Figure 5B. As you can see, both at telogen and at Telogen/Anagen I End KO skin shows abnormal increase in density of the HPuHG, at a level never observed in any of the CT mice at any of the stages analyzed. In addition, the CT HPuHG density decreased at the transition from telogen to anagen I in (as also show in our analysis of vasculature in hair cycle in BL6 WT mice, Figure 1 and 2). However, in the <italic>Alk1</italic> EndKO the HPuHG remains strongly packed and does not disperse at the transition between the telogen and anagen I. With that said, skin from <italic>Alk1</italic> EndKO found at Anagen I/II shows that dispersal of the HPuHG eventually occurs, although the vast increase in CD31 signal throughout the skin persists into this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Greco et al., 2009, have previously shown that Pcad<sup>High</sup> cells are maintained during telogen in the hair germ (HG). Are the number of cells in the hair germ maintained during telogen in Alk1EndKO? Or is the delay a result of the loss of HG cells?

This result ascertains the conclusion that the delay in hair cycle is not caused by loss of Pcad<sup>High</sup> hair germ cells.

In addition, to show the organization of the skin vasculature is changing during hair cycle in terms of orientation relative to a horizontal line parallel to the epidermis we measured the angle of vasculature in total skin relative to a horizontal line parallel to the epidermis. Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test was performed to show the differences in distribution of angles.
