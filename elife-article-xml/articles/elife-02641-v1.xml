The first step in a variety of dynein transport events is the targeting of dynein to the dynamic microtubule plus end, but the molecular mechanism underlying this spatial regulation is not understood. Here, we reconstitute dynein plus-end transport using purified proteins from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and dissect the mechanism using single-molecule microscopy. We find that two proteins–homologs of Lis1 and Clip170–are sufficient to couple dynein to Kip2, a plus-end-directed kinesin. Dynein is transported to the plus end by Kip2, but is not a passive passenger, resisting its own plus-end-directed motion. Two microtubule-associated proteins, homologs of Clip170 and EB1, act as processivity factors for Kip2, helping it overcome dynein's intrinsic minus-end-directed motility. This reveals how a minimal system of proteins transports a molecular motor to the start of its track.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02641.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02641.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02641.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Eukaryotic cells use transport systems to efficiently move materials from one location to another.

One of their ends (the ‘plus’ end) explores the outskirts of the cell, growing and shrinking through the addition and loss of protein building blocks.

Kinesin motors move toward the plus end of the microtubule, and dynein motors move in the opposite direction, toward the minus end. But if dynein only moves to the minus end of the microtubule, a problem arises: how would dynein initially reach the plus end of the microtubule and the outskirts of the cell, where it collects cargoes?</p><p>Using purified yeast proteins, Roberts et al. reveal that a group of three proteins can solve this problem by transporting dynein to the plus end of the microtubule. The proteins comprise a kinesin motor, and two additional proteins that connect the dynein motor to the kinesin. Imaging the transport process shows that the dynein motor is not a passive passenger: it is able to resist against the kinesin. However, an additional microtubule-associated protein can help the kinesin motor to win this ‘tug of war’, and so the protein complex—including the dynein motor—moves toward the plus end of the microtubule.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02641.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02641.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>DNA origami</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001447</institution-id><institution>Rita Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>no reference number</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reck-Peterson</surname><given-names>Samara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM100947</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reck-Peterson</surname><given-names>Samara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>092436/Z/10/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Anthony J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vitro reconstitution reveals how a system of molecules works together to transport the motor protein dynein to the start of its track.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytoskeletal motor proteins transport and position a variety of macromolecules, organelles and mRNAs in the cell interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vale, 2003</xref>), but how these motors are themselves targeted to specific locations within the cell is an important unsolved question. Cytoplasmic dynein, a large and complex AAA+ motor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carter, 2013</xref>), uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to move cargoes toward the minus end of microtubules (typically toward the cell center). In addition, dyneins can act while anchored at the cell cortex, where they pull the microtubule network toward them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moore et al., 2009</xref>). Live-cell imaging in diverse organisms reveals that, surprisingly for a minus-end-directed motor, dynein accumulates at the plus ends of microtubules that grow and shrink near the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vaughan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma and Chisholm, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lenz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi and Murayama, 2009</xref>). By localizing to dynamic microtubule plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howard and Hyman, 2009</xref>), dynein is thought to ‘search-and-capture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirschner and Mitchison, 1986</xref>) cargo molecules, before transporting them toward the minus end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). The targeting of the dynein machinery to the microtubule plus end is crucial for proper dynein function in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moore et al., 2009</xref>), filamentous fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2006</xref>), and a subset of metazoan cells, including mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lomakin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31a">Lloyd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moughamian and Holzbaur, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moughamian et al., 2013</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms that target dynein to the microtubule plus end are poorly understood.</p><p>Microtubule plus ends are dynamic binding platforms for a variety of proteins, collectively referred to as +TIPs (plus-end tracking proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008</xref>). Previous studies have illuminated two general mechanisms by which proteins can be targeted to microtubule plus ends. First, a subset of +TIPs preferentially bind to unique structural features present at the plus end vs the body of the microtubule, and can recruit additional proteins to these sites. The prototypical example of this class of +TIP are EBs (end-binding proteins), which are involved in recruiting binding partners such as Clip170 and the dynein regulator dynactin to plus ends in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watson and Stephens, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bieling et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zanic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35a">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moughamian et al., 2013</xref>). Second, kinesin motor proteins can power the vectorial transport of proteins along the microtubule body to the plus end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bieling et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Subramanian et al., 2013</xref>). These two mechanisms (direct recruitment and vectorial transport) are not mutually exclusive, and evidence suggests that both may contribute to the plus-end targeting of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, genetic studies implicate at least three proteins in targeting dynein to the microtubule plus end: Lis1, a regulator of dynein motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>); Bik1, a homolog of Clip170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Markus et al., 2009</xref>); and Kip2, a plus-end-directed kinesin motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caudron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Markus et al., 2009</xref>). Deletion of the EB homolog (Bim1) in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> appears to have little effect on the plus-end targeting of dynein and its co-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caudron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Markus et al., 2011</xref>), despite (1) Bim1 binding directly to Bik1, an essential factor for dynein plus-end targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blake-Hodek et al., 2010</xref>); and (2) The homologs of Kip2, Bik1 and Bim1 functioning together as a plus-end tracking system in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bieling et al., 2007</xref>). While dynein plus-end targeting can persist in the absence of Bim1, it is unknown if Bim1 is involved in the dynein pathway in the native situation, because +TIPs often interact in an interconnected and, in some cases, redundant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caudron et al., 2008</xref>). More generally, how a system of molecules can function together to target dynein to the plus end is not clear in any system. This problem is particularly pressing for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> dynein: a forceful minus-end-directed motor with constitutive activity in motility assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gennerich et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In vitro reconstitution can provide powerful mechanistic insights into cellular processes, complementary to those derived from the complex in vivo environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu and Fletcher, 2009</xref>).

This dynein construct lacks the cargo-binding tail, which is dispensable for plus-end targeting in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Markus et al., 2009</xref>), and is dimerized by GST to yield a motor with highly-similar motile properties to full-length dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>).

To test this idea, we devised a microtubule recruitment assay. When wild-type dynein is mixed with microtubules in the absence of nucleotide, it binds strongly to the microtubule, as visualized by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (lane 1). In order to monitor dynein recruitment to the microtubule by other proteins, we introduced four mutations into its microtubule-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koonce and Tikhonenko, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Redwine et al., 2012</xref>), which severely weakened its association with microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 2; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the weak-binding dynein could be recruited efficiently to the microtubule by the combined presence of Lis1, Bik1, Kip2 and Bim1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 3). This dynein recruitment depended strictly on the presence of Lis1 and Bik1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 4 and 5), consistent with the idea that Lis1 and Bik1/Clip170 interact directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coquelle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lansbergen et al., 2004</xref>). To determine if the reported interaction between Lis1 and the C-terminal zinc-knuckle of Bik1/Clip170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coquelle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lansbergen et al., 2004</xref>) is involved in connecting the dynein-Lis1 and Bik1-Bim1-Kip2 complexes, we purified a Bik1ΔC construct lacking the C-terminal region. The Bik1ΔC construct retained the ability to bind Kip2 and Bim1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, its ability to recruit the weak-dynein to the microtubule in the presence of Lis1, Kip2 and Bim1 was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 6). Together, these results suggest that dynein-Lis1 and Bik1-Bim1-Kip2 each form sub-complexes, which in turn interact in a manner dependent on Lis1 and the C-terminal region of Bik1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reconstitution of dynein transport to the microtubule plus end with purified proteins</title><p>Having established a potential chain of connection between dynein and Kip2 with purified proteins, we next sought to visualize the emergent motile behavior of these opposite polarity motors on dynamic microtubules.

Strikingly, in the presence of Lis1, Bik1, Bim1 and Kip2, the large majority of dynein movements along the body of the microtubule were directed to the plus end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 1) (90 ± 3%; proportion ± SE, N = 122). Moreover, on 63 ± 7% of microtubules, dynein was present at the growing plus end itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), reminiscent of dynein localization in living yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Markus et al., 2009</xref>). Minus-end-directed dynein movements were now rare (10 ± 3% of events). We observed similar behavior for the full-length dynein complex purified from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, we conclude that a system of four proteins (Lis1, Bik1, Bim1, and Kip2) is sufficient to strongly bias dynein's movement toward the microtubule plus end.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Dynein can resist its transport to the plus end though its microtubule-binding domain</title><p>Dynein's plus-end-directed motion depended strictly on Kip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 5), but was slower than that of free Kip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), leading us to hypothesize that dynein might have the capacity to resist its own transport to the plus end. To test this model, we repeated the reconstitution using the dynein mutant engineered to have weak affinity for the microtubule. Strikingly, the plus-end velocity of the weak-binding dynein was increased relative to the wild-type protein, becoming close to that of Kip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, the weak-binding dynein also showed strong accumulation at the plus end of the microtubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 2). These results indicate that wild-type dynein is not a passive passenger during its plus-end-directed transport. Instead, the data support a model in which wild-type dynein and Kip2 have the potential to engage simultaneously with the microtubule in a ‘tug-of-war’-like mechanism.</p><p>If dynein's plus-end-directed movement is driven directly by Kip2, these two species should colocalize and move together on the microtubule. As expected from our biochemical data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), binding events between the dynein and Kip2 subcomplexes were extremely rare when both species were diluted to the sub-nanomolar concentrations required for single-molecule imaging. However, by exploiting the weak-binding dynein construct that does not bind appreciably to the microtubule at low nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 2), we were able to observe clear co-localized movements of dynein with Kip2 in the presence of Bik1 and Lis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, the dynein construct frequently localized with Kip2 midway through a run, and dissociated before its end, consistent with transient binding as indicated by our biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These observations suggest that the movement of dynein toward the plus end is driven directly by Kip2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Lis1 and Bik1 couple dynein to Kip2, and Bim1 regulates the efficiency of dynein plus-end transport</title><p>To probe the roles played by individual components in the plus-end-directed transport of dynein, we performed dropout experiments in which proteins were selectively omitted from the reconstitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Lis1 and Bik1 were critical for dynein's plus-end-directed movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). In their absence, dynein moved to the minus end of the microtubule, despite the continued movement of Kip2 to the plus end. These results indicate that Lis1 and Bik1 are required to connect dynein to Kip2. Omitting Kip2 abolished dynein's plus-end-directed movement, showing that the pathway we have reconstituted is kinesin dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 5). Interestingly, removal of Kip2 also increased the frequency of microtubule catastrophes (the conversion from growth to shrinkage; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, arrows), consistent with the short microtubule phenotype caused by Kip2 deletion in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cottingham and Hoyt, 1997</xref>). Finally, we observed an unexpected influence of Bim1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 6). In the absence of Bim1, dynein could still be transported to the plus end, but the fraction of plus- vs minus-end-directed dynein movements was roughly balanced (47 vs 53 ± 5%, respectively). Thus, Lis1, Bik1 and Kip2 constitute the minimal machinery for transporting dynein to the plus end, and Bim1 can regulate this machinery to increase the fraction of dynein movements that are directed to the plus end.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Bik1 and Bim1 enhance Kip2 processivity</title><p>Because Bim1 forms a ternary complex with Bik1 and Kip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we suspected that the influence of Bim1 on dynein's plus-end transport might be exerted through these proteins. Furthermore, analysis of the Kip2 amino acid sequence revealed that there is an SxIP motif within an extension N-terminal to the kinesin motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The SxIP motif is a signature sequence that interacts with EB-family proteins such as Bim1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that Bim1 may interact with Kip2 through this motif. Bim1 also binds to the Cap-Gly domain of Bik1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blake-Hodek et al., 2010</xref>) and the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zimniak et al., 2009</xref>), while Bik1's coiled coil is thought to interact with Kip2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Newman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho et al., 2004</xref>).

The essence of the mechanism involves coupling dynein's motor domain to a plus-end-directed kinesin, Kip2. By reconstituting the functional coupling between these opposite-polarity motors for the first time, we show that two proteins, Lis1 and Bik1, are sufficient to connect dynein and Kip2. This connection is capable of bearing load on the microtubule, but is not stable enough to be observed by size-exclusion chromatography. As is the case for interactions found in other self-organizing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirschner et al., 2000</xref>), a high off-rate between dynein and Kip2 might allow for dynamic regulation, for example enabling dynein to readily detach from Kip2 following targeting. Indeed, in vivo, the timescale of dynein ‘offloading’ from the microtubule plus end onto its receptor on the cell cortex is on the order of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markus and Lee, 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02641.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model of the minimal machinery for transporting dynein to the microtubule plus end.</title><p>Based on results from this study and earlier work.

Specifically, the addition and removal of phosphate groups on the N-terminal extension of Kip2's motor domain has the potential to influence its interaction with Bim1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>), as well as the negatively charged microtubule surface, both of which could impact Kip2 motility.</p><p>It remains to be seen if additional factors mitigate resistance from dynein during its plus-end transport in vivo, akin to the mutations in dynein's microtubule-binding domain that we found to enhance plus-end targeting in vitro. For example, dynein's tail domain is crucial for events downstream of plus-end targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Markus et al., 2009</xref>), but it is conceivable that the tail and its associated factors regulate the transport process as well. Once dynein reaches the plus end, the high local concentration of Lis1 at plus ends in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Markus et al., 2011</xref>) may help retain dynein by prolonging its microtubule attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53a">Yamada et al., 2008</xref>). Nudel, a Lis1 and dynein binding partner, may also promote dynein plus-end targeting by tethering Lis1 to dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McKenney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Zheng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zylkiewicz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, genetic studies indicate there is a second pathway for targeting dynein directly from the cytoplasm to the plus end that does not require Kip2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caudron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Markus et al., 2009</xref>). Overlap between these pathways in vivo may explain why Bim1's capacity to regulate dynein plus-end transport was previously hidden. In summary, these results provide a vivid example of how the interplay between dynein, kinesin and microtubule-associated proteins can give rise to a coherent behavior: the recycling of a molecular motor to the start of its track.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Dynein, Lis1 and Kip2</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used for the purification of dynein, Lis1 and Kip2 are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.

Kip2 was typically affinity purified via its ZZ-tag as described for dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>). For fluorescent labeling of the SNAP tag on Kip2, benzyl-guanine (BG) conjugated Atto647N dye (NEB; Ipswich, MA) was added to a final concentration of 10–30 μM while the Kip2 was bound to IgG-sepharose beads and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at ambient temperature.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We believe that with the appropriate changes your work will make an excellent contribution to the field of microtubule motors and one that <italic>eLife</italic> will be pleased to publish. Major points to consider in the revision:</p><p>1) “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Dynein-Lis1 and Bim1-Bik1-Kip2 form sub-complexes that interact on microtubules”. I did not find the evidence for this statement, which can also be found in modified forms in the text, sufficiently strong from the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>The authors do not rule out a mechanism in which Bim1-Bik1-Kip2 modulate binding of dynein to the microtubule indirectly, e.g., by modulating dynein's microtubule binding activity in solution or the structure of the MT lattice. The fluorescently labelled Kip2 could be used to assess colocalization of dynein and Kip2 in the same puncta in this assay in which higher resolution images are scrutinized. This should be attempted. Higher resolution images will also allow the authors to assess if increased binding of the weak MT-binding mutant of dynein in the presence of Lis1, Kip2, Bim1 and Bik1 is correlated with increased oligomerization or dynein (analogous to the experiments presented for Kip2 in Figure S3B). This would be a welcome addition to the paper.</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are consistent with a complex formed on microtubules that consists of dynein and Kip2 and is bridged by the other proteins. However, it is not possible to see traces of motile complexes that contain fluorescent dynein and Kip2 due to the excess of Kip2 in the assays. These experiments should be supplemented with at least one protein combination (plus any appropriate controls) in which Kip2 concentration is reduced. Plus end-directed movements of dynein may be rare, but they presumably would occur. If the authors' model is correct these puncta should contain Kip2.</p><p>2) I understand that the authors need to use the weak MT binding mutant in the absence of ATP to assess the influence of the other proteins on MT association of dynein. Showing stronger evidence that the same affect also occurs for the wild-type dynein in the presence of ATP would strengthen the manuscript significantly. The authors state in the Materials and methods section: “In particular, when Lis1 and Bik1 was omitted, an elevated dynein concentration (0.3 nM) was needed to observe runs, consistent with the finding that Lis1 and Bik1 can couple dynein to Kip2 and thus can help recruit dynein onto the microtubule”. It would appear that this observation forms a nice basis for a quantitative assay to assess the influence of these factors on the association of wild-type dynein with MTs. Such an assay should be attempted.</p><p>3) Presumably the polarity of the MT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is assigned by assuming that the plus end is growing more rapidly in all conditions. In the kymographs shown most dynein puncta on a single microtubule are moving in the same direction. An important control would be to show that the proteins added to dynein do not affect MT dynamics such that in some MTs the minus end grows more rapidly than the plus end, thus leading to erroneous conclusions about the directionality of dynein. Although I judge this an unlikely scenario it is presumably not too challenging to assess by placing the dynamic microtubules on a glass surface coupled to an immobilized motor of known directionality (such as kinesin-1). Such a control needs only to be done for one key condition.</p><p>4) The model that Kip2's MT affinity is increased by Bik1 and Bim1 is very interesting. It would seem straightforward to test this model by assessing the frequency of MT binding events or an assay similar to that used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The authors may have other ideas for how to assess the influence of Bik1 and Bim1 on Kip2's MT affinity.</p><p>5) It is unclear how the velocity of Kip2 can be accurately determined from the kymographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The traces are densely packed and discontinuous. A convincing account of how quantification was performed needs to be included in the methods. Perhaps adding a description of how the custom software deals with these traces would also help.</p><p>6) A major inference of the paper is that the plus end targeting of dynein has been reconstituted. However, it seems that one can be more confident that plus end-directed motility has been achieved. The authors state that dynein was present at ∼60% of microtubules of the growing plus end itself, reminiscent of dynein localization in living yeast cells.

I did not find the evidence for this statement, which can also be found in modified forms in the text, sufficiently strong from the data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref>.</p><p><italic>The authors do not rule out a mechanism in which Bim1-Bik1-Kip2 modulate binding of dynein to the microtubule indirectly, e.g., by modulating dynein's microtubule binding activity in solution or the structure of the MT lattice. […] Plus end-directed movements of dynein may be rare, but they presumably would occur. If the authors' model is correct these puncta should contain Kip2</italic>.</p><p>We have performed the dynein-Kip2 co-localization experiment (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>) and obtained positive results. Our rationale for the design of this experiment is as follows. Our biochemical experiments suggest that dynein-Lis1 and Bik1-Bim1-Kip2 interact, but do not form a stable complex even at micromolar concentrations. Thus, when performing single-molecule co-localization experiments, we have to consider the “concentration problem” (van Oijen A.M., 2011, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 22: 75-80): when both species are diluted to the picomolar concentrations required for single-molecule imaging on the microtubule, the chance of observing a binding event between them is extremely small.</p><p>In reconstitution experiments with all proteins present, we used nanomolar Kip2 concentrations and picomolar dynein concentrations: conditions under which individual dynein movements can be observed, but Kip2 runs are too dense to decipher if colocalization is occurring. Conversely, if dynein is used at nanomolar concentration and Kip2 is at picomolar concentrations, dynein runs are too dense to resolve colocalization. To overcome this, we exploited the weak binding dynein mutant that does not bind appreciably to the microtubule even at nanomolar concentrations. This allowed us to use an elevated dynein concentration and a Kip2 concentration suitable for single-molecule imaging. We observed clear co-localized runs on the microtubule, suggesting that Kip2 directly drives dynein’s plus-end-directed movement.</p><p>The reviewers point out that “Bim1-Bik1-Kip2 could modulate binding of dynein to the microtubule indirectly (e.g., by modulating dynein's microtubule binding activity in solution or the structure of the MT lattice).” We have adjusted our language in the paper to acknowledge this. However, three lines of evidence argue against this possibility: 1) The weak binding dynein mutant, in which four charged amino acids have been mutated to alanine, does not bind microtubules appreciably (even in the absence of nucleotide, which corresponds to the highest affinity state in dynein’s mechanochemical cycle). It seems very unlikely that the binding of Bim1-Bik1-Kip2 to weak dynein could modulate its ability to bind microtubules, because its microtubule-binding domain is intrinsically impaired. 2) In these experiments microtubules are preformed and taxol stabilized, making lattice changes unlikely. 3) We present new data showing that removal of the C-terminal 40 amino acids of Bik1 previously reported to interact with Lis1 abolishes recruitment of weak dynein to the microtubule (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) but has no effect on its ability to bind Kip2 and Bim1. Together with the new co-localization data, these points all indicate that Lis1 and Bik1 couple dynein to Kip2, and Kip2 drives dynein’s movement toward the plus end directly.</p><p><italic>2) I understand that the authors need to use the weak MT binding mutant in the absence of ATP to assess the influence of the other proteins on MT association of dynein. Showing stronger evidence that the same affect also occurs for the wild-type dynein in the presence of ATP would strengthen the manuscript significantly. The authors state in the Materials and methods section: “In particular, when Lis1 and Bik1 was omitted, an elevated dynein concentration (0.3 nM) was needed to observe runs, consistent with the finding that Lis1 and Bik1 can couple dynein to Kip2 and thus can help recruit dynein onto the microtubule”. It would appear that this observation forms a nice basis for a quantitative assay to assess the influence of these factors on the association of wild-type dynein with MTs. Such an assay should be attempted</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for this comment, which has driven home our need to state our conclusions more clearly. We use the recruitment of the weak -binding dynein construct to the microtubule as a diagnostic for interactions between dynein and its plus-end-transport machinery (we did not mean to imply that dynein is recruited to the microtubule in the same way in the in vivo situation). We believe the observation that more dynein is required to observe a similar density of runs in the absence of Bik1 and Lis1 reflects the fact that, in the presence of Kip2, there are fewer microtubule binding sites available to dynein since Kip2 and dynein compete for the same site on the microtubule. In the presence of Bik1 and Lis1, which couple dynein to Kip2, the need for dynein to bind the microtubule directly is bypassed, and lower dynein concentrations are required to observe binding events.</p><p>Based on this logic, we think the outcome of the suggested assay would depend critically on the Kip2 concentration used and its interpretation with respect to the situation in vivo would not be straightforward, so we would be unable to make any firm additional conclusions based on it. We have emphasized that we used microtubule recruitment for diagnostic purposes, and modified the highlighted passage.</p><p><italic>3) Presumably the polarity of the MT in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>is assigned by assuming that the plus end is growing more rapidly in all conditions. In the kymographs shown most dynein puncta on a single microtubule are moving in the same direction. An important control would be to show that the proteins added to dynein do not affect MT dynamics such that in some MTs the minus end grows more rapidly than the plus end, thus leading to erroneous conclusions about the directionality of dynein. Although I judge this an unlikely scenario it is presumably not too challenging to assess by placing the dynamic microtubules on a glass surface coupled to an immobilized motor of known directionality (such as kinesin-1). Such a control needs only to be done for one key condition</italic>.</p><p>We assigned plus ends of microtubules based on two criteria: 1) the direction of Kip2 movement and 2) the microtubule end with faster growth rates. In all cases the direction of Kip2 movement correlated with moving towards the faster growing microtubule end. We have clarified this in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>4) The model that Kip2's MT affinity is increased by Bik1 and Bim1 is very interesting. It would seem straightforward to test this model by assessing the frequency of MT binding events or an assay similar to that used in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>. The authors may have other ideas for how to assess the influence of Bik1 and Bim1 on Kip2's MT affinity</italic>.</p><p>We have provided further analysis of Bik1 and Bim1’s effect on Kip2’s microtubule encounters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>. These factors both increase Kip2’s landing rate and reduce its off-rate, consistent with the model that they augment Kip2’s microtubule affinity. Thank you for this suggestion.</p><p><italic>5) It is unclear how the velocity of Kip2 can be accurately determined from the kymographs in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>. The traces are densely packed and discontinuous. A convincing account of how quantification was performed needs to be included in the methods. Perhaps adding a description of how the custom software deals with these traces would also help</italic>.</p><p>We have clarified how Kip2 velocity was measured in the materials and methods. As indicated, the density of Kip2 runs in the main reconstitution precludes measuring the velocity of every molecule in the population. Therefore, we determined the velocity of a subset of discrete runs, and used the average of these values as an estimate of the population velocity. These velocities closely resemble those derived from Kip2 at single-molecule concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>), and showed exactly the same trends (e.g., in both cases omitting Bim1 or Bik1 resulted in a small increase in velocity), suggesting they are a good estimate of the population velocities. We also note than none of our conclusions rest on a quantitative comparison between Kip2 velocities in the main reconstitution. The crucial comparison is between the plus-end-directed velocity of dynein with a wild-type or weak microtubule-binding domain, for which distinct runs are obtained.</p><p><italic>6) A major inference of the paper is that the plus end targeting of dynein has been reconstituted. However, it seems that one can be more confident that plus end-directed motility has been achieved. The authors state that dynein was present at ∼ 60% of microtubules of the growing plus end itself, reminiscent of dynein localization in living yeast cells. No images of wild-type dynein enrichment at the plus ends are shown so it is not clear if there is more dynein at the plus end than on the rest of the lattice. Representative Kymographs can also be shown to bolster this point</italic>.</p><p><italic>Depending on the situation observed, the authors may wish to modify their language to talk about reconstitution of “plus end-directed movement” rather than “targeting to the plus end”</italic>.</p><p>We have added extra kymographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>) showing dynein at growing microtubule plus ends. While we do observe dynein at ∼60% plus ends under these conditions, we agree with the reviewers that “plus-end-directed movement” is a good phrase to describe our results, and have modified our language accordingly.</p><p><italic>7) There is a potential caveat that the dynein here is truncated and is a GST fusion, with the GST driving dimerisation to at least some extent. Some discussion on how potentially significant this caveat is will be useful</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have clarified that we used GST to dimerize dynein’s motor domain, and the resulting motor has motile properties highly similar to full-length dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>). We aimed to stress in our original text that additional factors, such as dynein’s tail domain, have the potential to regulate the system we have reconstituted. We now state: “It remains to be seen if additional factors mitigate resistance from dynein during its plus-end transport in vivo, akin to the mutations in dynein’s microtubule-binding domain that we found to enhance plus-end targeting in vitro. For example, dynein’s tail domain is crucial for events downstream of plus-end-targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Markus et al., 2009</xref>), but it is conceivable that the tail and its associated factors regulate the transport process as well.”</p><p>In addition, we have added new data showing the full reconstitution performed with the full-length dynein complex purified from S. cerevisiae. We observed similar behavior for the full-length dynein as the GST-dimerized dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, new panel B).</p></body></sub-article></article>
