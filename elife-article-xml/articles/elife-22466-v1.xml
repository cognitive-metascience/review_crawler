that control social behavior of mammals, and perturbed oxytocin signaling has been linked to the pathogenesis of several psychiatric disorders. However, it is still largely unknown how oxytocin exactly regulates neuronal function. We show that early, transient oxytocin exposure <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibits the development of hippocampal glutamatergic neurons, leading to reduced dendrite complexity, synapse density, and excitatory transmission, while sparing GABAergic neurons. Conversely, genetic elimination of oxytocin receptors increases the expression of protein components of excitatory synapses and excitatory synaptic transmission <italic>in vitro</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, oxytocin-receptor-deficient hippocampal pyramidal neurons develop more complex dendrites, which leads to increased spine number and reduced γ-oscillations. These results indicate that oxytocin controls the development of hippocampal excitatory neurons and contributes to the maintenance of a physiological excitation/inhibition balance, whose disruption can cause neurobehavioral disturbances.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22466.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22466.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>peptide hormones</kwd><kwd>synapses</kwd><kwd>autism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002803</institution-id><institution>Fondazione Cariplo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant 2008.2314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parenti</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rhee</surname><given-names>JeongSeop</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EU-AIMS FP7-115300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brose</surname><given-names>Nils</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003390</institution-id><institution>Fritz Thyssen Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawabe</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CNMPB</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brose</surname><given-names>Nils</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP1365/KA3423/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brose</surname><given-names>Nils</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KA3423/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawabe</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimori</surname><given-names>Katsuhiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Perturbation of oxytocin signaling causes alterations that may be causally involved in the etiology of oxytocin-related neurobehavioral disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oxytocin (Oxt) is produced by magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) of the hypothalamus and released into the bloodstream from posterior pituitary nerve terminals. By activating G protein-coupled Oxt receptors (Oxtr) in peripheral target tissues, Oxt exerts multiple effects, most prominently uterine contraction during parturition and milk ejection after delivery. In addition, Oxt is released in the brain by synaptic release from projections of parvocellular PVN neurons and by hormone-like release from the somata and dendrites of magnocellular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ludwig and Leng, 2006</xref>). Based on these processes and its long half-life, Oxt can act in diverse Oxtr-expressing brain areas even when direct innervation by Oxt-containing fibers is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stoop, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Key regulatory effects of Oxt on animal and human behavior include promotion of facial recognition and maternal nurturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferguson et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2000</xref>), control of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bale et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>), and regulation of spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tomizawa et al., 2003</xref>). These functions are corroborated by studies on mice lacking Oxt or Oxtrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishimori et al., 1996</xref>). Notably, the behavioral phenotype of <italic>Oxtr</italic> knock-out (<italic>Oxtr<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) mice recapitulates several symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sala et al., 2011</xref>). Conversely, behavioral changes in mouse ASD models that are not based on direct perturbations of Oxt signaling, such as μ opiod receptor (<italic>Opmr1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gigliucci et al., 2014</xref>) or contactin associated protein-like 2 (<italic>Cntnap2</italic>) knock-outs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peñagarikano et al., 2015</xref>), are rescued upon Oxt administration, and even human ASD patients improve with Oxt treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hollander et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Striepens et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Oxtr</italic> polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LoParo and Waldman, 2015</xref>) and abnormal methylation of the <italic>Oxtr</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elagoz Yuksel et al., 2016</xref>) have been linked with ASDs, supporting the notion that altered Oxt signaling can contribute to ASDs.</p><p>At delivery, an Oxt surge in the maternal bloodstream promotes labor and subsequent lactation. The circulating Oxt reaches the fetal brain, where it regulates the developmental switch of GABAergic signaling from excitation to inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tyzio et al., 2006</xref>). This switch appears to be impaired in the valproate-intoxication and fragile-X-syndrome mouse models of ASDs, and to be restored by Oxt treatment. Moreover, administration of an Oxtr antagonist to naïve pregnant mice one day before delivery leads to ASD-like features in the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tyzio et al., 2014</xref>). These findings indicate that an early blockade of Oxt signaling affects the development of synaptic wiring in the brain and leads to lifelong consequences, including neuropsychiatric diseases. This notion is supported by the observations that <italic>Oxtr<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice show an increased seizure propensity and that the relative contribution of GABAergic synapses is reduced in cultured hippocampal <italic>Oxtr<sup>−/−</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sala et al., 2011</xref>). However, the hypothesis that early, transient Oxt signaling shapes or 'primes' neuronal morphology and function in the brain remains to be tested.</p><p>We attempted in our study to mimic the maternal Oxt surge prior to and around parturition and its effect on brain development in the offspring by studying early effects of transient Oxt signaling on developing neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>, and by analyzing related consequences of Oxtr loss <italic>in vivo</italic>. We demonstrate that Oxt exerts an early and cell-type specific 'priming' effect on developing excitatory neurons to regulate dendrite branching and synapse development, synaptic transmission, and the synchronicity of neuronal networks. These findings are likely of key relevance for the molecular pathology of brain diseases that involve altered Oxt signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Oxt reduces dendrite branching and function of glutamatergic neurons via G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled Oxtrs</title><p>In mice, a surge of Oxt appears during the last days of gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pfaff et al., 2002</xref>) and peaks just before delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2001</xref>). To assess the effects of transient exposure of hippocampal neurons to Oxt, we reenacted <italic>in vitro</italic> the <italic>in vivo</italic> Oxt maternal surge by treating autaptic cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekkers and Stevens, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgalossi et al., 2012</xref>) with 100 nM Oxt for 1–3 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV), starting on the first day after seeding. Oxt exposure did not affect neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>) but reduced the dendritic arborization of neurons at 14 DIV, as assessed by Sholl analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sholl, 1953</xref>) of cells stained with an antibody to the dendrite marker Map2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>).

To test if Oxtrs mediate the Oxt effects seen in our system, we exposed autaptic cultures to Oxt for 1 or 3 DIV in the presence of the Oxtr antagonist Atosiban (ATO). Morphological analyses at 14 DIV showed that ATO treatment abolished the Oxt-induced effects on dendrite arborization, whereas ATO alone was ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h–j</xref>), indicating that the Oxt effects on dendrites and synapses of hippocampal neurons are mediated by Oxtrs.</p><p>To test whether the morphological changes caused by Oxt contribute to alterations in synaptic transmission, we performed patch-clamp recordings at 9–14 DIV in Oxt-treated hippocampal autaptic neurons. The amplitudes of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were decreased in Oxt-treated glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c</xref>). The same was true for the size of the apparent readily releasable pool (RRP) of glutamatergic synaptic vesicles (SVs), as assessed by the EPSC induced by the application of a hypertonic sucrose solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nair et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>) (Figure a,d). In contrast, neither evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) amplitudes nor the RRP of GABAergic neurons, which represent a minor cell fraction in hippocampal autaptic cultures, were affected by Oxt, indicating that Oxt exclusively acts on excitatory hippocampal neurons in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>). The vesicular release probability (P<sub>vr</sub>) of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, calculated by dividing the postsynaptic charge transfer elicited by an action potential (AP) by the postsynaptic charge transfer in response to RRP release, was not changed by Oxt exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), indicating that the fusion-probability of primed SVs is not altered by Oxt. We next studied synaptic short-term plasticity (STP) by measuring synaptic responses during 10 Hz stimulus trains, and found that EPSC and IPSC amplitudes depressed similarly and irrespective of Oxt-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l,m</xref>). These findings indicate that Oxt specifically causes strong reductions of EPSCs but does not affect the fundamental characteristics of the presynaptic transmitter release machinery.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22466.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Oxt-treatment reduces evoked and spontaneous glutamatergic synaptic transmission in autaptic hippocampal neurons.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative traces of evoked EPSCs (left) and postsynaptic currents evoked by 0.5 M sucrose (right) from control glutamatergic autaptic neurons (Ctrl, black) and from glutamatergic autaptic neurons treated with Oxt for 1 day (Oxt 1d, light grey) or 3 days (Oxt 3d, dark grey).

In contrast, we detected a significant reduction of mEPSC frequency, indicating that Oxt reduces the number of functional glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>). Again, reflecting the morphological and IPSC data, mIPSC events in GABAergic neurons were not altered by Oxt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i–k</xref>).</p><p>To further assess the selectivity of Oxt effects on excitatory neurons, we quantified ionic currents upon exogenous application of glutamate or GABA. Corroborating our PSC data, GABA-induced currents were not changed in Oxt-treated GABAergic neurons, whereas Oxt-exposed glutamatergic neurons showed a reduction of their responses to glutamate as compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f–h</xref>). This indicates that the number of surface glutamate receptors in glutamatergic neurons, but not of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in GABAergic cells, is decreased by early Oxt exposure, supporting the notion that Oxt specifically affects excitatory neurons. To exert these actions, Oxt requires the Oxtr, since the addition of ATO suppressed the reduction of EPSCs induced by Oxt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–k</xref>) and Oxtr-deficient neurons did not show any changes in their electrophysiological characteristics upon Oxt treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3d–j</xref>). Surprisingly, Oxt effects were restricted to the early phase of synaptic development, as Oxt-application to neurons from DIV 7 onwards, that is, at a time when synaptogenesis is ongoing, did not cause any changes in the morphology and function of glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–k</xref>).</p><p>In a subset of experiments, we complemented our analyses of cultured neurons from P0 pups, in which Oxt levels reach peak values, with analyses of neurons from E18 mouse embryos.

Hence, subsequent experiments were carried out with P0 cultures.</p><p>Depending on the context, activated Oxtrs can activate phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) via G<sub>q/11</sub>, or inhibit or stimulate adenylyl cyclase via G<sub>i/o</sub> or G<sub>s</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2001</xref>). To test which intracellular pathway mediates the Oxt-induced effects on glutamatergic neurons, we exposed hippocampal neurons to Oxt for 1 DIV in the presence of the PLCβ inhibitor U73122. U73122 blocked all morphological and electrophysiological effects induced by Oxt, whereas U73122 exposure alone was ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a–n</xref>). Moreover, Oxt still partially exerted effects on glutamatergic neurons after cultures had been exposed from 1 DIV to 3 DIV to 100 ng/μl pertussis toxin (PTX), which blocks G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>o</sub>-signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5a–b</xref>). These results indicate that Oxtrs coupled to G<sub>q/11</sub> modulate hippocampal glutamatergic neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Inhibitory hippocampal neurons are less affected by Oxt because of low Oxtr expression levels</title><p>In contrast to previous reports on acute Oxt effects on GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mühlethaler et al., 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zaninetti and Raggenbass, 2000</xref>), our data indicate that Oxt exposure for 1–3 days only affects the morphology of excitatory hippocampal neurons. To further assess this selectivity, we studied autaptic striatal neurons, which are primarily GABAergic.

Further, quantitative analyses of GABAergic pre- and postsynapses, as identified by immunolabeling of VGAT and Gephyrin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nair et al., 2013</xref>), showed that Oxt did not alter the number of GABAergic synapses of striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22466.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Ectopic Oxtr expression confers Oxt sensitivity in striatal inhibitory autaptic neurons.</title><p>(<bold>a–c</bold>) Sample traces of evoked IPSCs (<bold>a</bold>), IPSCs triggered by application of 0.5 M sucrose (<bold>b</bold>), and IPSCs triggered by 3 μM GABA (<bold>c</bold>) in an untransfected Ctrl (black), an untransfected cell treated with Oxt for 1 day (Oxt 1d, light grey), an EGFP transfected cell treated with Oxt for 1 day (blue, EGFP+Oxt 1d), and an Oxtr-transfected cell treated with Oxt for 1 day (Oxtr+Oxt 1d, light blue).

Electrophysiological analyses of Oxtr-overexpressing cells, as identified via EGFP fluorescence, indicated that Oxt treatment for 1 or 3 DIV caused reductions of evoked IPSC amplitudes, of the RRP, and of the response to exogenous application of GABA, which was not seen in control cells expressing EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–g</xref>). The P<sub>vr</sub> was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Following early Oxt exposure, Oxtr-overexpressing GABAergic neurons developed less dendritic arborizations than cells expressing only EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i–k</xref>). These data indicate that striatal GABAergic neurons are insensitive to Oxt because they lack Oxtrs, but can be rendered Oxt-sensitive upon ectopic expression of Oxtrs.</p><p>To further assess Oxtr expression in hippocampal and striatal GABAergic neurons, we studied Oxtr-Venus knock-in mice (<italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>), which express Venus instead of the functional Oxtr from the endogenous <italic>Oxtr</italic> locus.

As compared to <italic>Oxtr<sup>+/+</sup></italic> neurons, <italic>Oxtr<sup>−/−</sup></italic> neurons at 14 DIV exhibited an increase of the density of NL1-positive clusters, a decrease of the density of NL2-positive clusters, an increase in the number of excitatory synaptic structures with partially colocalized Synaptophysin and PSD95, and a decrease in the number of inhibitory synaptic structures with partially colocalized Synaptophysin and Gephyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–g</xref>). Further, the number of GluA1-positive clusters was increased in <italic>Oxtr<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cultures, whereas no differences were detected for GABA<sub>A</sub>γ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–g</xref>). These data again indicate that the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory synapses is shifted towards increased excitation in mass cultures of hippocampal neurons lacking Oxtrs.</p><p>To test whether the altered expression of synaptic proteins in <italic>Oxtr<sup>−/−</sup></italic> neurons has any functional impact on synaptic transmission, we analyzed spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) and IPSCs (sIPSCs) in mass cultures of hippocampal <italic>Oxtr<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Oxtr<sup>−/−</sup></italic> neurons.

Further, changes in synchronous network activity, e.g. in γ-oscillations, have been described in ASD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rojas and Wilson, 2014</xref>), and in mouse models carrying mutations that cause heritable ASD in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammer et al., 2015</xref>).

These findings are compatible with the altered balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition in <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></italic> mice and show that a perturbation of Oxt signaling in the hippocampus leads to an aberrant development of pyramidal neurons that, in turn, causes altered γ- oscillations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Oxytocin regulates brain circuits that control complex mammalian behaviors, including social interactions, and aberrant Oxt signaling has been linked to the pathogenesis of various neurobehavioral disorders, including ASDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feldman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guastella and Hickie, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neumann and Slattery, 2016</xref>). In parturient rodents, the increased Oxt in the bloodstream does not only promote parturition, but also induces changes in the fetal brain, including a switch of GABAergic signaling from excitatory to inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tyzio et al., 2006</xref>). If the Oxt-based communication from the mother to the fetus is perturbed, the offspring develop ASD-like symptoms, indicating that Oxt exerts an early priming influence on brain development that can last far beyond the initial Oxt exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tyzio et al., 2014</xref>). However, the mechanisms of this Oxt-dependent priming effect that arises prior to and during parturition are unknown. The present study was designed to address this issue by determining whether and how early, transient exposure to Oxt, mimicking the Oxt increase prior to and during parturition, influences neuronal development and function.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Oxt signaling and dendrite morphogenesis</title><p>Our study shows that transient Oxt exposure of cultured mouse hippocampal glutamatergic neurons causes altered neuronal dendrite complexity and altered numbers of excitatory synapses. These Oxtr- and G<sub>q/11</sub>-PLCβ-mediated effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>) were only observed upon Oxt treatment immediately after seeding, that is, at an early stage of neuronal development, whereas later Oxt addition was ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–k</xref>). This indicates that Oxt exerts a 'priming' effect on dendritogenesis and synaptogenesis and is not required continuously or for the consolidation of preexisting dendrites or synapses. Accordingly, Oxtr loss in hippocampal pyramidal neurons leads to an increase in dendrite complexity in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–e</xref>).</p><p>Our data provide the first evidence for a role of Oxt in the control of dendrite growth and synaptogenesis in glutamatergic pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, a brain structure that receives Oxt signaling via direct Oxt neuron projections and by Oxt diffusion after somato-dendritic release. In contrast, previously reported effects of Oxt on neuronal morphology mostly concerned autocrine Oxt signaling, which can have different effects depending on the context. For instance, Oxt released from the somato-dendritic compartments of magnocellular neurons in the SON is thought to stimulate dendrite development in an autocrine fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chevaleyre et al., 2001</xref>) likely in synergy with afferent glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chevaleyre et al., 2002</xref>), whereas during lactation, when Oxt levels are high, dendrite branching decreases in magnocellular SON neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stern and Armstrong, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Downstream effectors involved in the Oxt-dependent regulation of hippocampal neuron morphology remain unknown, but transient Oxt signaling likely exerts its morphoregulatory effects by controlling gene transcription programs that regulate various components of growth-promoting pathways or the cytoskeleton. In neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cells, for instance, Oxtr agonists differentially regulate the genes encoding Nestin and Map2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakos et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, activation of the PLCβ pathway, which mediates the effects of Otx on dendrite development in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), affects dendrite morphology. For example, tonic activation of α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors activates the PLCβ pathway to cause dendrite retraction and reduced spine density in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cook and Wellman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Radley et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wellman, 2001</xref>), and sustained PKC activation downstream of PLCβ signalling modulates spine density in hippocampal neurons by perturbing actin cytoskeleton cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calabrese and Halpain, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hains et al., 2009</xref>). Further, PKC activity is known to affect dendrite development in several other neuronal cell types. For instance, PKC activators cause a strong reduction of the dendrite complexity in Purkinje cells, while PKC inhibition leads to increased dendrite size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Metzger and Kapfhammer, 2000</xref>). Hence, it is likely that the concerted action of such pathways downstream of Oxtr activation ultimately converge to control neuron growth and synaptogenesis as described here.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cell type specificity of morphoregulatory Oxt effects</title><p>A striking and unexpected finding of our study is that the morphoregulatory effects of Oxt appear to specifically target glutamatergic but not GABAergic neurons. Our analysis shows that this specificity is caused by the fact that GABAergic neurons express very low Oxtr levels or none at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Immunohistochemical mapping of Oxtr-expressing neurons in brain sections of <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/+</sup></italic> mice showed that Oxtrs are widely expressed throughout the entire hippocampus and that all hippocampal subregions contain Oxtr expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is in contrast to a previous report indicating that the Oxtr is mainly expressed in the CA3 subregion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hammock and Levitt, 2013</xref>) but nicely matches recent observations obtained using a novel specific antibody to the mouse Oxtr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mitre et al., 2016</xref>), showing Oxtr expression in the pyramidal cell layer in all hippocampal subfields. More importantly, the majority of Oxtr-expressing neurons are GAD-67-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further, Oxtr expression is undetectable in the striatum, which is mostly composed of GABAergic neurons, and Oxtr expression in cultured striatal neurons rendered these cells sensitive to the morphoregulatory effects of Oxt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In essence, these findings show that GABAergic neurons contain the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the Oxt effects on neuronal morphology but are intrinsically insensitive to Oxt due to the lack of Oxtrs.</p><p>Our finding that Oxt exerts its morphoregulatory effects selectively on excitatory neurons is unexpected in the light of several publications reporting that, in rat, Oxt acutely activates interneurons located in the stratum pyramidale and modulates fast-spiking interneurons, thus enhancing inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mühlethaler et al., 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zaninetti and Raggenbass, 2000</xref>). One explanation for these discrepancies could be a species difference between mouse and rat as regards Oxt sensitivity of inhibitory neurons. Indeed, species-specific effects of Oxt in rat and guinea pig hippocampal neurons were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raggenbass et al., 1989</xref>). A second explanation concerns the respective experimental design. We aimed at analyzing the effects of an extended but transient Oxt exposure of isolated neurons to mimic the diffusive action of Oxt in the fetal brain prior to and during parturition, while previous studies mainly addressed acute effects of Oxt in hippocampal slices. Such acute effects may even include alterations of inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gravati et al., 2010</xref>). In an acute Oxt treatment scenario in slices, indirect circuit effects of Oxt signaling cannot be excluded, and priming effects of Oxt signaling and their long-term consequences for neuronal morphology and function cannot be detected. A third explanation relates to Oxtr and Avpr pharmacology. Most previous studies employed concentrations of Oxtr ligands that are likely to also activate Avprs, so that Oxtr independent effects cannot be excluded. In contrast, the Oxt, Oxtr agonist, and Oxtr antagonist concentrations used in the present study were chosen based on the relative Oxt affinities of mouse Oxtrs and Avprs in order to ensure selective targeting of Oxtrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busnelli et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Oxt treatment vs. <italic>Oxtr</italic> KO</title><p>Our data on the morphology and function of Oxt-treated glutamatergic autaptic neurons from WT hippocampus and on the morphology of pyramidal hippocampal neurons in brains of Oxtr-deficient <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></italic> mice are reverse complements.

Because the neurons were cultured from embryos after hysterectomy at gestation day 18 and because the culture medium used in our experiments most likely does not contain Oxt, phenotypic changes seen in cultured <italic>Oxtr<sup>−/−</sup></italic> neurons likely arise from a lack of Oxtr signaling late in gestation, when Oxt levels are already increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pfaff et al., 2002</xref>).

This parallels the changes in hippocampi of <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></italic> mice, in which glutamatergic neurons showed more complex dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and the increased excitatory neurotransmission and spine number in acute hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Moreover these observations reversely complement the data on Oxt treated autaptic glutamatergic neurons from WT mice, which showed reductions in dendrite complexity, synapse number, and synapse function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).</p><p>In addition, however, the mass culture experiments revealed a negative effect of Oxtr deletion on the number of protein clusters containing the inhibitory synapse components NL2 and Gephyrin (but not GABA<sub>A</sub>γ2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–g</xref>). No corresponding opposite effect was seen upon Oxt treatment of autaptic GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is possible that this discrepancy is due to homeostatic mechanisms that control the interplay between excitation and inhibition in mass cultures but are irrelevant in single-neuron autaptic cultures. Apart from this, it is possible that the absolute number of inhibitory synapses in mass culture is not changed but that synapses are simply 'diluted' over the larger dendrites of glutamatergic <italic>Oxtr<sup>−/−</sup></italic> neurons, which represent about 80% of the cells in the culture. This could be the cause of the small reduction in the density of inhibitory synapses as detected by NL2 and Gephyrin labeling, which might escape detection by GABA<sub>A</sub>γ2 labeling. This notion is supported by the fact that sIPSC frequency is unchanged in mass-cultured <italic>Oxtr<sup>−/−</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5l</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Oxt signaling and neurodevelopmental disorders</title><p>Many studies have linked dysfunctions of Oxt signaling to ASDs and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Such a disturbance in the excitation/inhibition balance has repeatedly been invoked as a causal contributor to ASD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gillberg and Billstedt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>). Indeed, most genes known to be involved in the genetic etiology of ASDs encode proteins that directly or indirectly determine synapse density or function and hence excitation/inhibition balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kleijer et al., 2014</xref>), and, correspondingly, excitation/inhibition imbalances are a key feature of numerous genetic mouse models of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gogolla et al., 2009</xref>). The present study shows that <italic>Oxtr</italic>-deficient mice belong into this category of ASD models, stressing the notion that an altered excitation/inhibition balance is a key feature of ASDs.</p><p>The aberrant morphology of pyramidal cells in the hippocampus of <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></italic> mice is paralleled by a strong reduction in the power of γ-oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g–j</xref>). These oscillations are thought to play a key role in cognitive functions mediated by the hippocampus, such as memory coding, memory retrieval, and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colgin and Moser, 2010</xref>), and their perturbation has been linked to multiple brain disease states. Similar alterations in CA3 γ-oscillations, although likely caused by a different cellular mechanism, were observed in other genetic mouse models of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammer et al., 2015</xref>), and perturbed γ-oscillatory activity can be detected in ASD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rojas and Wilson, 2014</xref>) and other neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maxwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Woo et al., 2010</xref>). These findings led to the idea that perturbations of γ-oscillations might serve as a 'biomarker' for the corresponding disorders, which is supported by the present data on <italic>Oxtr</italic>-deficient mice. Interestingly, the specific activation of GABAergic cells during acute application of the Oxtr agonist TGOT in rat hippocampal slices increases the population spike during kainate-induced γ-oscillations, without inducing any changes in oscillation power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owen et al., 2013</xref>). While it is not clear whether these effects are due to a specific role of Oxt-signaling in the rat, which is not relevant in the mouse, the corresponding data show that short-term action of Oxt is not sufficient to induce changes in neuronal network function although excitation/inhibition balance is changed transiently. In general terms, the perturbation of γ-oscillations in <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></italic> mice may be a consequence of the altered excitation/inhibition balance during the early stages of neuronal network formation. In all current models of γ-oscillatory activity, inhibitory interneurons, such as basket cells targeting the somata of principal cells, play a key role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>). It is possible that more complex dendrites of CA3 principal cells in <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></italic> mice receive more excitatory inputs as shown by the increased number of spines observed in CA3 pyramidal neurons, causing an increased excitatory drive onto these cells that partly overrides the inhibitory inputs. An alternative scenario would be that the increase in dendrite complexity of CA3 neurons leads to a reduced input resistance of these cells, a consequent reduction in their activity, and a reduction in γ-oscillations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results indicate that Oxt signaling exerts an early priming effect on developing glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus. This process throttles dendrite development and thus guarantees a proper excitation/inhibition balance. Aberrations in this process, caused for instance by genetic perturbation of Oxt signaling, as shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), or by deficient Oxt signaling during pregnancy, parturition, or early postnatal brain development, cause dendrite hypertrophy, an increased excitation/inhibition balance, and consequent defects in network synchrony in the hippocampus, and likely also in other brain regions. These findings provide important insights into the role of Oxt signaling in fetal and early postnatal brain development, and represent an explanatory basis for the etiological role that dysfunctions in Oxt signaling appear to play in ASDs and other neuropsychiatric disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Oxtr<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takayanagi et al., 2005</xref>) and <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>) were provided by K.

Briefly, astrocytes for autaptic cultures were obtained from mouse cortices dissected from P0 WT animals and enzymatically digested for 15 min at 37°C with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin-EDTA (Gibco). Astrocytes were plated in T75 culture flasks in DMEM (Gibco) containing 10% FBS and penicillin (100 U/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and grown for 7–10 days in vitro (DIV). After this, astrocytes were trypsinized and plated at a density of ~30,000 cells/well onto 32 mm-diameter glass coverslips that were previously coated with agarose (Sigma-Aldrich), and stamped using a custom-made stamp to generate 200 μm × 200 μm substrate islands with a coating solution containing poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich), acetic acid, and collagen (BD Biosciences). Hippocampi and striata from P0 WT or <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></italic> mice and from E18 mouse embryos were isolated and digested for 60 min at 37°C in DMEM containing 2.5 U/ml papain (Worthington Biomedical Corporation), 0.2 mg/ml cysteine (Sigma), 1 mM CaCl2, and 0.5 mM EDTA. After washing, the dissociated neurons were seeded onto the microisland plates in pre-warmed Neurobasal medium (Gibco) supplemented with B27 (Gibco), Glutamax (Gibco) and penicillin (100 U/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at a density of ~4000 cell/well. Autaptic cultures were exposed to Oxt (100 nM; Bachem), atosiban (100 nM; Sigma-Aldrich), or both during the first 3 DIV by adding fresh drug solution every 24 hr. Oxt concentration was chosen based on the pharmacological features of the relevant receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busnelli et al., 2013</xref>), that is, the murine Oxtr (K<sub>d</sub> ~1 nM for Oxt) and vasopressin V1a receptor (K<sub>d</sub> ~20–30 nM for Oxt). The other compound used in the present study, 1-[6- ((17β−3-methoxyestra-1,3,5 (10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl]−1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U-73122, 3 μM; Calbiochem), was applied to cells alone or in combination with Oxt (100 nM) only at DIV one due to the excessive neuronal death observed after three-day exposure. Striatal autaptic cultures were infected 6 hr after plating and treated with Oxt starting from 1 to 3 DIV. Electrophysiological recordings were performed between 9 and 14 DIV, whereas immunofluorescence analyses were carried out at 14 DIV. In order to contain the intrinsic variability of the autaptic cultures preparation, we employed no less than four different neuronal preparations for every condition analyzed, typically studied numbers high of cells and focused all analyses on DIV10–14. Further, all experiments were conducted by measuring on every day during the experiments approximately the same number of cells per condition. Finally, within-experiment controls were included in all the experiments.

The brains were then isolated and post-fixed for 16 hr at 4°C with 4% paraformaldehyde. After extensive washes with PBS, the brains were passed through a sucrose gradient. The brains were then snap frozen in a −45°C isopentane bath, and coronal cryosections of 50 μm thickness were collected on Superfrost Plus slides, and air dried for 1 hr. After washing with PBS, brain sections were incubated with gentle agitation using blocking solution (10% goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) and subsequently incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibodies and DAPI diluted in blocking buffer, followed by incubation with the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with appropriate fluorophores for 4 hr at RT. Subsequently, the sections were washed three times with PBS and mounted on slides using Immu-Mount (Thermo Scientific) mounting medium.

CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, whose polarized structure was maintained in coronal sections, were analyzed by discriminating between the basal neurites (this terminology includes both dendrites and the axonal projection) and the apical dendrites of electroporated cells.

Briefly, the fluorescent signals of pre- and post-synaptic markers were first thresholded, and then the number of puncta in each cell was measured after the application of a separation filter capable of distinguishing larger puncta. In colocalization experiments assessing immunostained pre- and post-synaptic proteins, the background signal was substracted using the Subtract Background Plugin, and the Intensity Correlation Analysis plugin was used to calculate the Manders' overlap coefficient. Single cell dendrite complexity was evaluated using the advanced Sholl analysis plugin of ImageJ, in which concentric circles are drawn at 5 μm intervals around a common center in the cell body, and the numbers of crossing dendrites are counted at each circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sholl, 1953</xref>). From the Sholl analysis data, we then calculated the number of intersecting dendrites in the interval, expressed as distance from the cell body, showing the largest number of intersections (≤25% below the maximum number of intersections). This interval was 25–80 μm in hippocampal neurons and 15–60 μm in striatal cultures. The images used for the Sholl analysis were acquired using an upright epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axio Imager Z1) with a 25x objective lens. For the analysis of pre- and post-synaptic proteins in hippocampal mass cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), stained neurons were subjected to imaging analysis using a Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 63x objective. For each coverslip (two for each experimental condition) from 3–4 independent cell preparations, eight random fields were captured and analyzed. For VGAT and VGLUT1 experiments, z-stack serial scans at 1 μm steps were taken and the puncta juxtaposed to Map2-positive processes with different lengths were counted and normalized to 10 μm dendrite length. The quantitative analysis of post-synaptic markers (NL1, NL2, PSD95, Gephyrin, GluA1, GluN1, and GABAγ2) was performed by calculating three distinct parameters, i.e. the total number of merged fluorescent clusters, and the intensities and areas of fluorescence in dendrites with different lengths. Only the fluorescent cluster density is shown here for reasons of brevity because the other two parameters gave identical results. The data were then normalized to 10 μm dendritic length. In each field, 7–8 dendritic tracts with different lengths were analyzed up to a total of 105/120 dendrites for each of the three preparations using the NIH ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Antibodies</title><p>For autaptic culture staining, the following primary antibodies were used: Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against VGAT (1:1000, Synaptic Systems, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_887871">AB_887871</ext-link>), VGLUT1 (1:1000, Synaptic Systems, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_887875">AB_887875</ext-link>), and Map2 (1:500, Chemicon, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_91939">AB_91939</ext-link>); chicken polyclonal antibody against Map2 (1:500, Novus, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2138178">AB_2138178</ext-link>); mouse monoclonal antibodies against Gephyrin (3B11, 1:500, Synaptic Systems, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_887719">AB_887719</ext-link>), and PSD95 (6G6-1C9, 1:200, Abcam, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_303248">AB_303248</ext-link>).

Pregnant females were deeply anesthetized and kept on a warming pad (31–32°C) during the entire surgical procedure. The anesthesia was maintained by a steady supply of isoflurane (DeltaSelect) and oxygen (1 L/min). The uterus with the embryos was exposed through a ~2 cm midline incision in the ventral abdomen peritoneum and moistened with warmed PBS containing antibiotics (1000 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin; Invitrogen). The plasmid [at a concentration of 1.25 μg/μl, prepared using an EndoFree plasmid purification kit (Quiagen) and dissolved in TE (TrisHCl pH 8.0) buffer with 0.05% Fast Green dye (Sigma)] was injected using a glass capillary into the lateral ventricles of embryos. Electric square pulses (38 V, 50 mA, 50 ms duration, 950 ms intervals, six pulses per embryo) were applied to each embryo with an ECM830 electroporator (BTX Harvard Apparatus). Subsequently, the uterus was placed back into the abdominal cavity, and the body wall was sutured. P7 animals were used for neuronal morphology reconstruction. After intracardiac perfusion with saline followed by 4% PFA, brains were isolated from skulls and post-fixed for 16 hr in 4% PFA in phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4), followed by extensive washing with PBS. After passing through a 10–30% sucrose gradient, 100 μm-thick coronal cryosections were collected on Superfrost Pluss glass slides (Thermo Scientific), mounted, and signals of tdTomato fluorescence were acquired with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using a 40x objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>For electrophysiology, autaptic cultured neurons (9–14 DIV) were whole-cell voltage-clamped at −70 mV with an EPSC10 amplifier (HEKA) under the control of the Patchmaster two program (HEKA). All traces were analyzed using AxoGraph X (AxoGraph Scientific). The experiments were performed using a patch-pipette solution containing (in mM) 136 KCl, 17.8 Hepes, 1 EGTA, 0.6 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 NaATP, 0.3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 15 creatine phosphate, and 5 U/mL phosphocreatine kinase (315–320 mOsmol/L, pH 7.4). The extracellular solution used for all recordings contained (in mM) 140 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 10 Hepes, 10 glucose, 4 CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub> (320 mOsml/liter), pH, 7.3. Evoked EPSCs and IPSCs were induced by depolarizing the cell from −70 to 0 mV at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. The size of the ready releasable pool (RRP) was measured upon 6 s application of 0.5 M hypertonic sucrose solution. The vesicular release probability (P<sub>vr</sub>) was calculated by dividing the charge transfer during an action potential induced PSC by the charge transfer during the sucrose response. Short-term plasticity was evaluated by recording PSCs during 10 Hz stimulation trains. Miniature EPS (mEPSC) and IPS (mIPSC) currents were recorded in the presence of 300 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX, Tocris Bioscience). The cell surface expression of GABA and glutamate receptor was assessed by focal application of 100 μM glutamic acid (Sigma) or 3 μM GABA (Sigma), respectively. Spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) were recorded in a whole-cell configuration using an internal solution containing (in mM) 135 CsCl, 3 NaCl, 10 EGTA, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 ATP, 0.3 GTP, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4, with CsOH, and a bath solution containing (in mM) 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 glucose, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Hepes, pH 7.4, with NaOH. During sPSC recordings, the internal solution was supplemented with 5 mM N-ethyllidocaine (QX-314) in order to block action potentials in the patch-clamped neuron. Moreover, during the recording of glutamatergic PSCs (sEPSC) 10 μM bicuculline was added to block GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, whereas during GABAergic PSC (sIPSC) recording 10 μM 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) and 30 μM 4- (3phosphonopropyl)piperazine-2-carboxylic acid (CPP) were added to block AMPA and NMDA receptors, respectively. Spontaneous synaptic events were detected using NeuroMatic, a collection of Igor Pro (WaveMetrics Inc.) functions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com/">http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com/</ext-link>) upon setting at 10 pA as detection threshold. The amplitude averages and standard deviations were calculated using the lognormal function of the Origin 7.5 software (OriginLab Corp), due to lognormal distribution of the amplitudes of spontaneous synaptic events. Inter-event intervals for spontaneous synaptic events were distributed exponentially and mean intervals were obtained from the best mono-exponential fit of the inter-event interval distributions. Gamma oscillations were recorded in juvenile <italic>Oxtr<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></italic> mice (P15–26). Transverse hippocampal slices (300 µm thickness) were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bischofberger et al., 2006</xref>) using a vibratome (Leica VT1200S) from age-matched littermates anesthetized with isoflurane (DeltaSelect). Brain isolation and slice preparation were performed on ice in a sucrose-based slicing solution (230 mM sucrose, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM D-glucose, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) under oxygenation with carbogen gas (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). After sectioning, slices were placed in a holding chamber containing ACSF (120 mM NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM D-glucose, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) and allowed to recover for 10–15 min before recording. Hippocampal γ-oscillations were recorded in the CA3 region, where the peak power of kainate-induced γ-oscillations is reported to be the highest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Craig and McBain, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammer et al., 2015</xref>). All recordings were performed using an interface recording chamber (BSCBU Base Unit with the BSC-HT Haas Top, Harvard Apparatus). Slices were constantly perfused with ACSF and the temperature was maintained at 33°C. Extracellular recording electrodes filled with ACSF were placed in the pyramidal cell layer of CA3 and extracellular field potentials were recorded for ≥20 min before the addition of 100 nM kainate. Baseline (≥20 min) and oscillatory (30 min) activities were acquired using a 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Molecular Devices), low pass Bessel filtered at 3 KHz, and digitized by the Digidata 1440A data acquisition system (Axon Instruments, Molecular Devices). All electrophysiological traces were analyzed using Axograph X software (AxoGraph Scientific). Power spectra were calculated upon Fourier transforms of 10 min epochs (last 10 min of each recording) of recorded field activity. The baseline power spectrum was subtracted from the power spectrum obtained during kainate application. The dominant frequency within 25–45 Hz was used to quantify the peak frequency. The power was calculated as the area under the respective peak in the power spectrum. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in <italic>Oxtr<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></italic> hippocampal slices at room temperature (22°C). Slices were prepared and maintained in ACSF under oxygenation with carbogen gas (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), as described in the previous paragraph. The holding potential was set at −70 mV using an EPSC10 amplifier (HEKA) under the control of the Patchmaster software (HEKA). Miniature post-synaptic currents (mPSCs) were recorded in the presence of 1 µM TTX from CA1 and CA3 neurons showing the typical morphological properties of pyramidal cells. In addition to TTX, miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) were recorded in the presence of 10 µM 6-cyano-7- nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), and 20 µM D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5) to block excitatory postsynaptic currents. Miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were recorded in the presence of 10 µM bicuculline methiodide to block inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Two different intracellular solutions were used during mIPSCs and mEPSCs acquisitions. The pipette solution for recording mIPSCs contained 0.4% biocytine, 120 mM potassium gluconate, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, and 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.28 with KOH, osmolarity adjusted to 315 mOsm/L with sucrose. The pipette solution for recording mEPSCs contained contained 0.4% biocytine, 140 mM KCl, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, and 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH, osmolarity adjusted to 315 mOsm/L with sucrose.

In support of this conclusion, the authors demonstrate that oxytocin treatment of hippocampal autaptic culture during DIV1-3 induces at a later stage (DIV14) decreases in the dendritic complexity and excitatory synaptic transmission in glutamatergic neurons but no changes in inhibitory synaptic transmission in GABAergic neurons. This difference appears to be attributable to low levels of oxytocin receptors in GABAergic neurons as supported by the result that exogenous expression of oxytocin receptors in striatal GABAergic neurons renders oxytocin sensitivity and related changes in synapses/transmission in these neurons. Conversely, in oxytocin receptor-lacking neurons from two different mouse lines, there are increases in dendritic complexity, E-I synapse ratio, and excitatory synaptic transmission.</p><p>The suggested roles of oxytocin in the regulation of excitatory neuronal morphology and excitatory synapse development and function are different from the focus of previous works on the role of oxytocin in the regulation of GABAergic neuronal functions. The experimental data are solid and seem to support the main conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors indicated that the oxytocin surge occurs during the last days of gestation and peaks just before the delivery (subsection “Oxt reduces dendrite branching and function of glutamatergic neurons via G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled Oxtrs”, first paragraph). If this is true, why did the authors prepare hippocampal cultures using P0 pups, which may already be exposed to oxytocin surge?</p><p>2) Is 100nM Oxt physiologically relevant?

If this is true, why did the authors prepare hippocampal cultures using P0 pups, which may already be exposed to oxytocin surge?</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge the validity of this comment, which is mainly relevant in the context of explaining the phenotype of Oxtr-deficient neurons that were cultured at E18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> we demonstrate that the phenomena seen in autaptic cultures prepared from P0 pups and treated with Oxt are corroborated by data on neurons in mass cultures prepared from E18 embryos and exposed to 10 nM TGOT, a selective Oxtr agonist.</p><p>Despite these arguments, we acted upon this comment and studied autaptic hippocampal cultures from E18 mouse embryos to complement the data obtained with P0 autaptic cultures. The results obtained on E18 cultures are very similar to those obtained on P0 autaptic cultures: Oxt exposure reduced the dendrite complexity of hippocampal neurons and impaired glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Our new data indicate that neurons cultured at P0 remain sensitive to Oxt after culturing, even though they must have been exposed to Oxt shortly before and during parturition, indicating that Oxt signalling towards these neurons has not reached saturation – or that the culturing process causes some type of 'reset' in the neurons. The new data on the effects of Oxt on neuronal morphology and synaptic transmission in E18 cultures are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, and described/discussed in the main text (subsection “Oxt reduces dendrite branching and function of glutamatergic neurons via G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled Oxtrs”, sixth paragraph). Given that the reviewers requested us to shorten the manuscript somewhat, we abstained from a detailed further discussion of this issue.</p><p><italic>2) Is 100nM Oxt physiologically relevant? Also, is Oxtr expressed at 1-3DIV neurons? How about astrocytes? Do they express Oxtr as well?</italic> </p><p>In essence, there is currently no way to tell the exact Oxt concentration during physiologically relevant Oxt signalling in the hippocampus, which receives Oxt via direct projections and diffusion from other more distant release sites. Reported concentrations of Oxt in extracellular compartments in the brain, CSF, or plasma vary substantially depending on the study at hand. However, it is likely that resting physiological concentrations of Oxt are below 100 nM. In normal, non-pregnant mice and rats, Oxt levels in microdialysates (30 min dialysis at 0.33 microliter/min) from amygdala and hippocampus are in the range of 50-100 pM. However, these values are likely substantially lower than the actual extracellular Oxt concentration. During pregnancy, corresponding Oxt levels in plasma (and hence in the embryos) can increase manifold. As explained in our paper, we chose an Oxt concentration that is actually substantially lower than the concentrations used in other very prominently published papers on Oxt effect on neurons – 100 nM. This concentration was chosen based on the criteria of (i) maximal effect on Oxt receptors (Kd of about 1 nM for Oxt) and (ii) minimal cross-reactivity with V1a receptors (Kd about 20-30 nM for Oxt) (Busnelli et al., 2013, J Pharmacol Exp Ther 346, 318-327). Experts in the specificity titration of Oxt concentrations use the same concentrations for the treatment of hippocampal neurons as we do (Leonzino et al., 2016, Cell Rep 15, 96-103). This issue is now discussed in the revised version of the paper (subsection “Mass culture of hippocampal neurons and autaptic neuronal culture”).</p><p>Hippocampal neurons in culture express Oxt receptors already at DIV1, and expression increases over time in culture (Leonzino et al., 2016, Cell Rep 15, 96-103). Hence, at the time of our treatment, Oxt receptors are already expressed in hippocampal neurons. This information is now provided in the revised manuscript (subsection “Oxt reduces dendrite branching and function of glutamatergic neurons via <sub>Gq/11</sub>-coupled Oxtrs”, second paragraph).</p><p>Another important new issue in this context is that Oxt receptor knock out neurons do not response to our Oxt treatment – see also our comment to point 3 below – indicating that the effects we describe are specifically caused by Oxt receptor activation. These new data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, and described/discussed in the main text (subsection “Oxt reduces dendrite branching and function of glutamatergic neurons via G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled Oxtrs”, first and fifth paragraphs).</p><p>As regards the involvement of astrocytes in the Oxt effects we see, we do not think that they play a significant role because we show that selective expression of Oxt receptors in inhibitory neurons (under a synapsin promoter) makes these cells sensitive to Oxt. Further, our labelling of cells expressing Oxt receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) does not detect cells with astrocyte-like appearance and localization but a nice colocalization with NeuN, indicating that it is mainly neurons that express Oxt receptors.</p><p>Despite these arguments, we acted upon the corresponding comment of the reviewers. We directly assessed Oxt receptor expression in astrocytes in <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/+</sup></italic>hippocampus and cortex. No colocalization was observed between Venus, which reports Oxtr expression and the astrocyte marker S100. These were complemented by Western blotting experiments with astrocyte and whole brain extracts using antibodies to Venus and the astrocyte marker GFAP. Here, brain samples were shown to contain both GFAP and Venus, while no Oxtr expression was detected in primary cultured <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></italic> or <italic>Oxtr<sup>Vn/+</sup></italic>astrocytes. These new data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, and described/discussed in the main text (subsection “Inhibitory hippocampal neurons are less affected by Oxt because of low Oxtr expression levels”, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) The neuronal cultures from Oxtr<sup>-/-</sup> mice were prepared from E18, while other cultures were prepared using P0 pups. Why is there discrepancy? Also, it will be nice to perform oxytocin treatment on DIV1-3 Oxyt<sup>-/-</sup> neurons as a control.</italic> </p><p>Taking embryos at P0 is technically easier and saves the mothers for further breeding. Hence, experiments on WT cells were done using tissue from P0 pups. On the other hand, offspring from Oxt receptor KO dams, which were used in the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, die usually quickly after birth due to aberrant maternal care (Takayanagi et al., 2005, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102, 16096-16101). To prevent deteriorating effects on the pups in these experiments, we decided to routinely take the embryos at E18. This information is now provided in the main text (subsection “Mass culture of hippocampal neurons and autaptic neuronal culture”).Please see also our response to point 1 above.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we performed new control experiments by treating Oxt receptor knock out neurons with Oxt for 1 or 3 days. No differences were found between control and Oxt treated groups indicating that the Oxt effects we observed in hippocampal neurons are selectively mediated by Oxt receptor. These new data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, and described/discussed in the main text (subsection “Oxt reduces dendrite branching and function of glutamatergic neurons via G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled Oxtrs”, first and fifth paragraphs).</p><p><italic>4) Exogenous oxytocin treatment resulted in severe dendritic atrophy in pyramidal neurons. The authors may want to test neuronal viability or apoptosis upon oxytocin treatment.</italic> </p><p>We concur with the notion that it would be interesting to test neuronal viability or apoptosis upon Oxt treatment. Hence, we analysed neuronal survival in hippocampal mass cultures upon Oxt treatment by firstly analysing nuclear pyknosis (nuclear condensation) and, additionally, by determining the percentage of cells that are propidium iodide positive (DNA fragmentation) in control and Oxt-exposed cultures (Tuffy et al., 2010, Mol Cell Biol 30, 5484-5501). No significant differences were found between control and treated groups in the percentage of pyknotic nuclei, indicating that our Oxt treatment does not affect cell viability. These new data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and described/discussed in the main text (subsection “Oxt reduces dendrite branching and function of glutamatergic neurons via G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled Oxtrs”, first paragraph).</p><p>In the first set of experiments we also attempted a co-staining with propidium iodide and DAPI. Hippocampal neurons were first incubated with propidium iodide (PI, 5 μM) in culture medium for 30 min, and upon fixation, nuclei were stained with DAPI. However, due to the fact that PI stained not only the nuclei but also the cell bodies, we determined that the PI had leaked outside the nucleus, most likely due to the fixation method employed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1A and 1B</xref>). Therefore, we performed a new set of experiments where neurons were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (5 μM) in culture medium for 30 min, directly mounted on glass slides, and imaged for image analysis. Even though in E18 Oxt treated cultures the percentage of PI-positive cells appeared to be slightly reduced as compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1C</xref>), we abstained from following this up further due to the time limitation for resubmission (currently, the data represent two independent cultures prepared from E18 embryos and only one P0 neuronal preparation). In any case, even the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1C</xref> indicate that Oxt treatment does not cause cell death.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22466.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Assessment of apoptosis using propidium iodide.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of propidium iodide (PI)-positive nuclei and Hoechst-labeled nuclei captured immediately after mounting after fixation under different conditions.
