We investigated the sources of this output variability across a motor system, from the central pattern generator (CPG) to the motor plant. In the bilaterally symmetric leech heartbeat system, the CPG orchestrates two coordinations in the bilateral hearts with different intersegmental phase relations (Δ<italic>ϕ</italic>) and periodic side-to-side switches. Population variability is large. We show that the system is precise within a coordination, that differences in repetitions of a coordination contribute little to population output variability, but that differences between bilaterally homologous cells may contribute to some of this variability. Nevertheless, much output variability is likely associated with genetic and life history differences among individuals. Variability of Δ<italic>ϕ</italic> were coordination-specific: similar at all levels in one, but significantly lower for the motor pattern than the CPG pattern in the other. Mechanisms that transform CPG output to motor neurons may limit output variability in the motor pattern.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31123.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many of our everyday behaviors are rhythmic actions, such as walking, breathing and chewing.

Wenning et al. set out to discover where this variability in rhythmic behaviors comes from, using the leech heartbeat system as a model. Leeches have two hearts, or more precisely two heart tubes that run along the entire length of the body, one on either side. The two heart tubes beat with different patterns, but under the direction of the CPGs and motor neurons, they swap patterns with each other every few minutes.

Even when the activity of one of these levels varies less than another, for example between CPG and motor neurons, it is not necessarily reflected in the next level of the system. In some cases, however, variability is seen between opposite sides. Moreover, the rhythmic activity of CPG neurons, motor neurons, and muscle cells in one leech differs greatly from that of another. This likely reflects differences in the genes and life history of the animals.</p><p>Wenning et al. provide a roadmap for others to use in identifying sources of variability in rhythmic movements.

Indeed, the hunt is on to find the mechanisms and rules that permit constant network output through coordinated regulation, both developmentally and homeostatically, of highly variable membrane and synaptic conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O'Leary et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ransdell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schulz et al., 2006</xref>). But how constant is network output across individuals? Not very seems to be the answer when looking at the literature more closely (e.g., locomotion in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellardita and Kiehn, 2015</xref>] and zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Masino and Fetcho, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wiggin et al., 2014</xref>]; food processing in crabs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamood et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamood and Marder, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yarger and Stein, 2015</xref>], crawling in fly larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>]).</p><p>The central pattern generating networks of invertebrates have provided some of the best evidence supporting the notion of constant output with underlying variability of conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goaillard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prinz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ransdell et al., 2013</xref>). Here phase of firing of component neurons is considered a critical aspect of a functional motor pattern, and phase is by no means constant. Even though it is not correlated with period, phase varies considerably across animals as shown in the stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) and in our work on the leech heartbeat system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bucher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Norris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Norris et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wenning et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2004b</xref>). Indeed, we were forced to the conclusion that each animal arrives at a unique solution to producing a functional heartbeat motor pattern; based on phase differences in the premotor pattern and synaptic strength patterns from the central pattern generator (CPG) to motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Norris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wright and Calabrese, 2011b</xref>). Thus, not only are underlying conductances variable but activity itself is variable and any attempt to elucidate mechanisms of regulation must consider what the target limits for regulation are (‘What is good enough?’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marder et al., 2006</xref>), what are the sources of variability in network output, and how variability at one level in a network influences the variability on another. Here we focus mainly on the latter two questions, having previously established the range of functional output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Norris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Norris et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Norris et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wenning et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wenning et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Leech heartbeat presents an amenable system for answering these questions because all relevant neurons of the CPG and motor neurons are identified and easily recorded, and the motor plant (here the hearts) also can be directly monitored (recent review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calabrese et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the system is strictly feedforward – CPG to motor neurons, to heart muscle –, its elements are bilaterally symmetrical, it operates without phasic sensory feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calabrese, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calabrese, 1979</xref>), and it has already been demonstrated to be highly variable in output across individuals at each level. A unique aspect to this system is that the coordination of the CPG, motor neurons, and hearts differs at any given time on the two sides – rear-to-front peristaltic versus synchronous – with periodic switches in coordination between sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Norris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Norris et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wenning et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wenning et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Thus, while rhythmic circuit output is continuous, it presents episodic coordination states on each body side.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31123.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Leech Heartbeat System switches between two coordination states.</title><p>Circuit diagram including the bilateral homologous pairs of the relevant heart (HN) interneurons of the core CPG, the heart (HE) motor neurons and the heart tube segments of midbody ganglia 8 to 14. Large colored circles are cell bodies and associated input processes. Cells with similar input and output connections and function share a circle. Lines indicate cell processes, small circles indicate inhibitory chemical synapses, diodes electrical connections. The HN interneurons of ganglia 3 and 4 (HN(R/L,3) and HN(R/L,4) are part of the beat timing network and make mutual inhibitory connections. The HN(R/L,1,2) coordinating interneurons of the timing network are not illustrated for simplicity. Four pairs of premotor HN interneuron (front premotor interneurons: HN(3) and HN(4); middle premotor interneurons HN(6) and HN(7)) make inhibitory connections to all ipsilateral HE motor neurons shown here (HE(8) to HE(14)). The two bilateral heart tubes, which run the length of the animal, form the motor plant. Each individual heart segment is entrained by phasic excitatory input from its ipsilateral segmental HE motor neuron. The entire heartbeat system switches between two coordination states, left rear-to-front peristaltic/right synchronous and vice versa (peristaltic magenta, synchronous blue) about every 70 to 350 s (15 to 60 beat cycles). The two intersegmental coordination states of interneurons, motor neurons and hearts are set up by interactions between the timing network’s front premotor interneurons and the middle premotor interneurons linked by the switch HN interneurons of segment 5 (HN(R/L,5)) and by direct electrical connections. On the synchronous side the switch interneuron HN(5) (ochre) bursts with the beat timing but the HN(5) on the peristaltic side is silent (greyed out). Note that the switch interneurons make bilateral connections to the middle premotor interneurons and that phasing in these CPG premotor interneurons is dominated by the single active switch interneuron. Switches (double-headed vertical arrow) in coordination state occur when the silent switch interneuron starts to burst and the bursting switch interneuron simultaneously becomes silent. The CPG switches between left synchronous/right peristaltic (top) and left peristaltic/right synchronous (bottom) states of coordination.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-31123-fig1-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31123.004</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Imaging the hearts and analyzing the bilateral beat pattern of adult leeches in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ventral view of a flattened, intact leech illuminated from below.

We then compare these sources across levels and coordination states.</p><p>We show that cycle-to-cycle variabilities in phase were low at all levels, in both coordination states, and on both sides. Thus, activity within an individual is precise. We confirm and quantify the large variability in phase across individuals at each level and show that high variability at one level is not necessarily fed forward to the next. In seeking to elucidate the sources of this population variability, we show that repetitions of a coordination state have low variability and thus contribute little. On the other hand, we show that when the same motor act is performed by bilaterally homologous neurons and muscles, variability can be as large as in the population itself depending on the level and coordination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Background</title><p>Medicinal leeches have two bilateral heart tubes which run the entire length of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maranto and Calabrese, 1984a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">1984b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thompson and Stent, 1976a</xref>). Segmental heart (HE) motor neurons innervate the hearts along their length, timing and coordinating their constrictions. The HE motor neurons are controlled by a heartbeat CPG that produces a bilaterally asymmetric activity pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calabrese, 1977</xref>). On one side, CPG premotor interneurons fire bursts in a peristaltic rear-to-front progression and in near synchrony on the other. Motor neurons fire correspondingly leading to peristaltic and synchronous motor patterns, in turn leading to an asymmetric beat pattern of the hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wenning et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2004b</xref>). The beat period in leeches is about 4.5 to 11 s, which translates into several thousand heartbeats per day. Embedded in this ongoing activity is the periodic alternation between the two coordinations about every 70–350 s creating episodes of coordination that span 15 to 60 beat cycles. We define a switch cycle of a given side when it has completed both coordinations, one after the other.</p><p>The core heartbeat CPG consists of 7 bilaterally paired segmental heart interneurons (HN) linked by inhibitory synapses and electrical coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calabrese, 2010</xref>). Beat timing is determined by the mutually inhibitory bilateral pairs (Right/Left) of interneurons in ganglion 3 (HN(R/L,3)) and ganglion 4 (HN(R/L,4)) linked by coordinating interneurons HN(R/L,1) and HN(R/L,2), which form a beat timing network and ensure bilaterally symmetrical timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calabrese, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calabrese, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Masino and Calabrese, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2002c</xref>). Output to the segmental heart motor neurons, which occur in segments 3 to 18, is provided by inhibitory input from premotor interneurons. Each HE motor neuron makes an excitatory connection to the ipsilateral heart section in its home segment. The HN(R/L,5) interneurons switch the network. The switch interneuron on the synchronous side bursts with beat timing while the one on the peristaltic side is silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calabrese, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gramoll et al., 1994</xref>). Switches in coordination occur when the silent switch interneuron starts to burst and the bursting switch interneuron simultaneously becomes silent. Because the switch interneurons make bilateral connections to the middle premotor interneurons HN(6) and HN(7), phasing in these CPG premotor interneurons is dominated by the single active switch interneuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In summary, a single CPG consisting of bilateral homologous pairs of HN interneurons produces an asymmetric premotor pattern, motor pattern, and beat pattern that episodically and periodically switches between left synchronous/right peristaltic and left peristaltic/right synchronous states of coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 A2, B2, C2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31123.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Recordings of the CPG pattern, the motor pattern, and the beat pattern.</title><p>(<bold>A1, B1, C1</bold>) Recording sites and methods for all levels of the heartbeat control system.

While the phase difference of the premotor HN interneurons is the same in all the segments considered here, the synaptic strength of their connections to motor neurons progressively changes across segments although there is considerable individual variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Norris et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Norris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wright and Calabrese, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">2011b</xref>).

Therefore, because the Δ<italic>ϕ</italic> of the motor pattern (HE(8) to HE(12)) is significantly smaller than that of the CPG pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), it expresses less of the CPG’s variability. Under this hypothesis, as more or less of the CPG’s Δ<italic>ϕ</italic> is expressed then more or less of its variability is expressed. We found that this was the case. In some of our bilateral HE recordings we recorded the HE(14) (N = 15) or the HE(10) (N = 9) along with the HE(8).

Similarly, in the pyloric pattern of the isolated STNS, variances were much lower within than across animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamood et al., 2015</xref>). In the episodic gastric pattern, however, variances within animals, but again convolved across episodes across many days, were comparable to those across animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamood et al., 2015</xref>). Variability increases when modulatory input is compromised (decentralization), in both the pyloric and the gastric pattern in the crab STNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamood and Marder, 2015</xref>). In contrast, variability in interlimb phase decreases sharply in galloping mice after ablating all V0 commissural interneurons resulting in a bounding gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellardita and Kiehn, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Two potential sources for the large variability in phase across animals at each level of the leech heartbeat system are variability in the episodic repeats of the same motor program within an individual, and variability between bilaterally homologous elements, also within an individual. Episodic variability is seen as the two alternating patterns are repeated periodically by the same neurons and muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Repetition variances were significantly lower than expected from the population variance across both coordinations and levels, and therefore seem not to contribute to the population variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Because in much of the literature episodes within an animal and across animals are convolved it is not easy to determine whether repetition variability (i.e., inter-episode variability) contributes to population variability. We suspect it does. For example, interlimb phase variance in galloping mice was assessed convolving 51 episodes across three animals so the large variance shown probably reflects large repetition variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellardita and Kiehn, 2015</xref>). Similarly, in an elegant study on the motor and constriction patterns in fly larvae, covering forward and backward crawling, episodes and animals are convolved in the analysis presented, and the considerable inter-episode variability was not quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>) though it certainly exists (personal communication, Stefan Pulver). In zebrafish literature again episodes and animals are convolved making it difficult to parse repetition variance and population variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Masino and Fetcho, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wiggin et al., 2014</xref>). The heroic enterprise to record from several motor neurons in the STNS in vivo over several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yarger and Stein, 2015</xref>) does not tease apart the phase variability across episodes and across animals for the episodic gastric motor pattern.</p><p>Variability between homologous cells within an individual can also contribute to variability seen in a population. For example, in the crab heartbeat system, the five (presumably) homologous motor neurons – which are part of the CPG in this system – can express different levels of a common set of membrane conductances to achieve synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ransdell et al., 2013</xref>). This system seems more tightly regulated in phase than the leech heartbeat neuronal network, reflecting the synchronized rather than segment-specific nature of its motor output.</p><p>We took advantage of the bilateral layout in the leech heartbeat system to test whether variability in homologous elements can contribute to population variability. In the leech, neurons arise from bilaterally paired columns of blast cells derived from bilateral pairs of stem cells (teloblasts) each of which arises from a symmetric division. Such symmetry in the origin of bilateral blast cells gives rises to the concept of bilaterally homologous structures and cells. Blast cells differentiate into neurons, epithelia and muscles in each segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stent and Weisblat, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weisblat and Shankland, 1985</xref>). Yet, there is evidence for stochastic events during leech development, for example the bilateral OP neuroblasts undergo symmetric divisions but for each the fate of the daughter cells is determined by position, and also in the formation of unpaired neurons, where either the left or the right neuron dies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stent and Weisblat, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weisblat and Shankland, 1985</xref>).</p><p>At all levels, bilaterally homologous elements (neurons and muscles) participate in heartbeat with a single CPG orchestrating two different coordinations of motor neurons and heart muscles. Bilateral variances differed depending on level (CPG, motor neurons, motor plant) and coordination (peristaltic, synchronous). In synchronous coordination, on all levels, the variance of differences in intersegmental Δ<italic>ϕ </italic>between sides (ΔΔ<italic>ϕ</italic>) was significantly less than expected from the population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>), and therefore unlikely to contribute to the population variability. In peristaltic coordination, however, the variance between sides (ΔΔ<italic>ϕ</italic>) in the CPG pattern and in the beat pattern did not differ from the population but differed significantly from the population in the motor pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Therefore, such variability between homologous elements may contribute to the population variability at least for the CPG and the beat patterns when peristaltic. This bilateral variability might arise from stochastic processes during development as envisioned e.g., in the models of O’Leary and Marder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O'Leary et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O'Leary et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, an important source of population variability is likely genetic and life history differences inherent in our population.</p><p>The sources of this high bilateral variability in the CPG and the hearts are likely to be different. For example, the bilateral homologs of the premotor interneurons of the CPG vary in the synaptic strengths of their connectivity pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roffman et al., 2012</xref>) and likely in their intrinsic conductances. Each heart segment receives excitatory input from its ipsilateral motor neuron, these synapses may also vary in strength, and heart muscles may vary in their intrinsic conductances. Moreover, the exact timing of that heart segment’s constriction appears to depend on load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wenning et al., 2014</xref>), which is unlikely to be identical on both sides in a soft-bodied animal like the leech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wenning and Meyer, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Phase variability across levels of a motor system</title><p>Despite the feedforward nature of the leech heartbeat system – CPG, motor neurons, heart muscle – we found that the high phase variance in the CPG in peristaltic coordination did not translate into an equally high variance in the motor pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This puzzling result begs the question how the variance of the motor pattern is reduced. The peristaltic phase difference that the HE(8) to HE(12) motor neurons achieve is significantly smaller than that of the premotor interneurons of the CPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The phase progression of the premotor bursting pattern determines the maximal phase range, but the segment-specific synaptic strength pattern, intrinsic properties, and coupling determines the phase realized between two motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wright and Calabrese, 2011b</xref>). The premotor phase differences and the synaptic strength patterns interact so that the phase difference of the motor neurons progresses smoothly across the segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wright and Calabrese, 2011b</xref>), and this smoothing and segment-to-segment attenuation of the CPG phase difference may limit the variance of intersegmental Δ<italic>ϕs</italic>, especially for nearby segments. In support of this conclusion, we observed that when a larger or smaller number of segments intervene between motor neurons are assessed, then the variance in the motor pattern reflects more or less the corresponding variance of the CPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, in segmentally distributed motor patterns (such as the swim networks of lampreys, fish, leeches, crayfish swimmerets and locomotor patterns in insects) it is important to define or, better even, to compare different sets of segments over which variability is assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Büschges, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grillner and El Manira, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ingebretson and Masino, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smarandache-Wellmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wiggin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We interrogated a feed-forward motor control system to determine the output variability of phase among individuals at each level - CPG, motor neurons, muscles - and found that it varied at each level, which nevertheless did not obscure recognition of distinct coordinations. We attempted to identify some of the sources of this variability in output activity. It is unlikely due to variability in performing the same function multiple times since the repetition variances are low everywhere in the system. Some of this population variability may be due to differences between homologous cells in an individual. We observed that when the same motor act is performed by bilaterally homologous CPG neurons and heart muscles, variability in peristaltic phase on the two sides is as large as in the population itself. In other cases (peristaltic motor pattern and synchronous patterns at all levels), it appears likely that output variability is mainly associated with genetic and life history difference among individuals in the population. Across levels, phase variability was coordination-specific: similar at all levels in the synchronous but significantly lower for the motor pattern than for the CPG pattern in peristaltic coordination. Mechanisms involved in the transform from CPG to the motor neurons may limit the range of output variability in the motor pattern. We provide a roadmap for others that may wish to analyze variability in motor system and argue that existing data sets on the locomotor and other motor patterns of invertebrates and vertebrates can be teased apart to determine the sources of output variability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and solutions</title><p>Adult leeches (<italic>Hirudo sp</italic>.) were obtained from commercial suppliers (Leeches USA, Westbury, NY, or Niagara Medical Leeches (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leeches.biz">www.leeches.biz/contact</ext-link>) and kept in artificial pond water at 16°C.

For example, for the CPG we calculated<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>7</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>7</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>We plotted the individual ΔΔ<italic>ϕ</italic> in a circular phase plot and calculated their variance.

This analysis yielded two data sets (one for each coordination) per level, 6 sets total. We repeated this procedure 10,000 times after scrambling the data from the right and left body sides from different animals, and calculated the p values from the z score of the normal distribution of the scrambled populations. The motor pattern and the beat pattern were treated the same way.</p><p>We assessed the variability of the synaptic input from premotor heart interneurons HN(R,4) and HN(R,7) to heart motor neurons HE(R,8), HE(R,10) and HE(R,12), and from heart interneurons HN(L,4) and HN(L,7) to heart motor neurons HE(L,8), HE(L,10) and HE(L,12). This analysis yielded two data sets per motor neuron pair, 6 sets total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). To evaluate the synaptic input further and to eliminate any differences due to the quality of the voltage-clamp recordings, we calculated the proportion of the synaptic strength due to the HN(4) premotor interneuron on each side using its ratio to the sum of the synaptic inputs of both premotor interneurons HN(4)/[HN(4) + HN(7)], separately for each side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We used a paired t-test to assess whether the two sides were different. Next, we scrambled the data from the right and left body sides from different animals (10,000 times), and calculated their p values using a paired t-test.</p><p>We used means ±SD for descriptive statistics.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu significantly improved the code to analyze spike-triggered averages and Florencia Zamora helped with the analysis.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Sources of variability in a motor system&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Nonetheless, if you feel that a significant rewrite could address the bulk of the reasonable issues raised by the reviewers (including some of the parts of the consultation session included here), we would be willing to consider a new version along those lines.</p><p>This manuscript and its reviews engendered a long and spirited discussion among the reviewers, the Reviewing Editor and the Senior Editor.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor's initial summary was: &quot;While all reviewers saw the value of this meta-analysis, they also missed the experimental approach that brings this beyond the descriptive level. The reviewers also didn't see a quick fix to add critical experiments to link the data in a meaningful manner. They also felt that the authors did not attempt to appeal to a general readership which would make this study more attractive for <italic>eLife</italic>.&quot;</p><p>In looking back at the extended discussions among the reviewers, it is clear that:</p><p>a) It was difficult to figure out which data came from the same animals, and therefore really supported the up and down level of organization point you were trying to make.</p><p>b) The manuscript itself is very invertebrate-centric and there may be useful and informative vertebrate work that should be cited.</p><p>c) The manuscript has to proactively argue, at least in a good paragraph in the Discussion section, why you believe that the variability is not due to experimentor-error.</p><p>d) It is not clear that the stats are properly done or presented (SEs versus SDs, etc.).</p><p>e) The argument about developmental stochasticity being responsible for left/right differences is very speculative and should be relegated to a Discussion point but not elevated to the extent it is in the present version.</p><p>f) The Abstract was hard to parse.</p><p>g) Is it really the case that the variability increases and decreases across the levels of organization? If so, is that an interesting result that needs a possible explanation? This finding is probably part of what motivated a reviewer to worry/wonder about experimental error.</p><p>We understand that it may not be possible to do a manipulation that would address the Reviewing Editor’s initial evaluation, but points a-g are clearly fixable.</p><p>Some of the comments made during discussion were:</p><p>&quot;But there <bold>could</bold> be controlled measurements in their data set. I don't think they need measurements of all levels in the same animals – even if they led us on a transitive journey of dual measurements where A+B and B+C told us something about variability in A relative to C. Without these (which are definitely not in this version of the manuscript), every bias against the variability story will come into play and every can of worms will be opened as people read this study. &quot;</p><p>&quot;First, the premise about developmental stochasticity is nothing more than a speculation and should be introduced as that in a much more restricted fashion.</p><p>Second, many, if not all of the standard errors should be standard deviations. More critically, I am not sure exactly what was used as N's to calculate p values. there appear to be some very very small p's that may have resulted from using number of cycles not animals. So, I am not sure that all of the stats are correctly done.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I agree that the paper is highly invertebrate-centric, but I am not sure whether a similar data exists in a vertebrate? If so, they should certainly consider it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Data such as these that clearly pose the issue of whether variability at one level is transmitted to another are rare anywhere, and if properly presented, I think this would be a valuable contribution…What I find intriguing is that at face value the variability does not change monotonically across levels, and they don't really address that adequately.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I guess I just think that this paper is a very brave attempt to do something that needs to be done, and with all of the issues of the present version, there is nothing quite like it in the literature and it is addressing a very interesting problem.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am not as convinced that it is possible to parse what is experimentally induced variation versus biological variation in the various comparisons in the paper. I wish it had actually been addressed head on in the paper.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I guess my problem was/is that I have/had a preconceived idea what to expect from a paper dealing with variability, and I didn't see this in the manuscript -hence my negative reaction.</p><p>In mammalian rhythm generating networks (e.g. neocortex and of course the respiratory network) you find a huge amount of cycle-to-cycle variability which is the reflection of the stochastic activation/synchronization of weakly coupled neurons. And also, we find of course a huge variability in the types of inward/outward currents in rhythm generating neurons. Thus, variability is a big deal in how these networks operate and studying this variability using computational approaches, gives you interesting insights into the network architecture. Variability is also reflected into how the network oscillation is transmitted to the motor output.</p><p>Anyhow, we and other used experimental and computational approaches to dissect the mechanisms for this variability and how it assembles these rhythm generating networks. All this is built on the wonderful work that has been done in invertebrates. I didn't see anything of this in this paper. This paper appeared to me like a big collection of variability data that are found at different levels of integration – but I didn't see the big picture question.&quot;</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This study addresses an important issue in neurobiology: i.e. the nature of cycle-by-cycle variability in rhythm generating neuronal networks. The authors are surprisingly agnostic to the literature in mammalian rhythm generating networks, and focus primarily on the leech heart beat system with some reference to other invertebrate rhythm generating systems. This omission unnecessarily limits the scope of this fundamentally, important issue.</p><p>The authors base their study on a larger data set, which allows them to compare sources of variability at various levels of integration from the cellular level to the behavioral level. However, one major weakness of this meta-analysis is the absence of experimental attempts to explore the actual mechanisms that underlie this stochastic variability, and the question how variability at one level influences another level.</p><p>The dataset presented in this manuscript seems ideal for a subsequent computational approach, which could model the detailed data to explore how variability at one level influences variability at another level of integration. This would be one kind of &quot;experimental approach&quot; that could be very informative and would likely provide interesting mechanistic insights and testable hypotheses. But, without a computational approach or actual experiments in this ideal model system, the study remains very descriptive.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have compiled an extensive and impressive resource of data for motor pattern output across three levels of organization for a CPG network responsible for heart contraction in the leech. In a thorough and insightful analysis, they reveal that output variability across individuals, as measured by phase relationships, is different at different levels of the feedforward circuit, with the least variability seen at the level of the motor network, as opposed to the CPG or musculature. This is a compelling insight.</p><p>I do have serious concerns that I feel need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The nature and scope of the data themselves, and the nature and scope of the interpretation and discussion, are not in balance. Even from the title, &quot;Sources of variability[…]&quot; this imbalance is established, as I do not feel the authors are in any way assessing the mechanistic underpinnings or sources of variability. In particular, the use of bilateral measurements – and the demonstration therein of differences – is held up as evidence of &quot;stochasticity in developmental pathways&quot; among genetically identical cells and networks. One cannot argue with the genetics in question, but there is no evidence whatsoever to support this hypothesis. Indeed, inherent in this perspective is a bias that these are truly bilaterally symmetrical. Is there any data to support this assertion, or is this just an assumption? One could make the case that at a superficial level the mammalian heart is bilaterally symmetrical as well, but physiologically the pulmonary and systemic circuits are clearly differentiated in their function and underlying physiology. If this is the focus the authors wish to take, there needs to be a substantial redirection of the introduction and discussion of this work to try to make this case. Else the authors may have stumbled on to compelling physiological evidence to call into question the idea that the annelid heart is indeed a bilaterally symmetrical structure (at this point, an equally parsimonious – if not more so – interpretation of the data). In short, I do not feel that anywhere in the manuscript the authors make a compelling enough case to draw any conclusions about sources of variability. Phenomenologically, the variability is clear – but the etiology is completely unexplored in this study.</p><p>2) Variability is perhaps one of the more difficult phenomena to quantify, due to its – well, variability. Because the data in this study are substantially meta-analytical, there is substantive lack of experimental control over potential sources of variability that preclude combining these data into one analysis. For example, comparing the amount of variability in measurements of muscle output for data collected multiple years ago with a cohort of animals entirely distinct of that from which the motor neuron output was collected is potentially confounding. The authors utilize animals supplied from multiple vendors outside of their own control (are they wild caught or reared?). How can one ensure rearing conditions, environmental variables, etc. are consistent between vendors – or across time – to appropriately cross-compare these different data sets into one analysis? Is there any potential species confusion across the time span of these studies? Indeed, the species used is listed only as &quot;Hirudo sp.&quot; and recently Hirudo has undergone a species reclassification. if the authors may be inadvertently, and more importantly asymmetrically, combining data from multiple species this is highly problematic. The most compelling data are those in which multiple levels of analysis are achieved from the same individuals – statistics for these are reported as a sub-population in the text, but to me the most informative analysis would be a correlation of variability in, for example, motor neuron variability and muscle output variability across individuals in which data were obtained for both. The authors do apparently have 9 instances of paired CPG and motor neuron recordings, as well as simultaneous motor and beat pattern from an earlier study (Wenning et al., 2014). By lumping these data together as populations, and not controlling the abovementioned sources of variability among individuals, the authors lose power for their interpretation.</p><p>3) There is an unexplored aspect to these data that I would have appreciated hearing the authors' perspective on. That is, what are the functional implications – costs, tradeoffs, etc. – for differing variability across these levels? In other words, why should the system require highest constancy of phase at the level of motor neurons? And just as interesting, how is this achieved – how does a system take feedforward input from a CPG and decrease the variability in that input signal? I am keenly interested to hear the authors' insight on this mechanistic question, and its functional consequences – and I feel this is the more compelling aspect of the data presented.</p><p>In sum, I really enjoyed the thorough analysis of these data and the collection and curation therein that allows for interesting comparisons across levels of organization in a feedforward system. I am less convinced that pitching this work in the context of &quot;sources of variability&quot; is congruent with the data at hand. The challenges associated with a meta-analysis in this context are significant.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This paper explores an important question concerning how variable a motor output is within and across animals at the level of the CPG, the motor output, and the behavior. There is a widespread notion that there are many solutions to producing essentially the same motor output. One might be led to think that there is not great variability of output across animals or within animals, but a critical analysis of this question depends on strong data sets that compare patterns across levels from cells to behavior and across individuals in the same motor behavior. This paper does that for the heart beat rhythm in leeches. The major take home message is that, while there is relatively low variation in phase relationships on a cycle-to-cycle basis in a pattern produced by the heart circuit on one side of an individual animal, there is substantial variation at levels from CPG to behavior across animals. So, the output can be variable, though presumably still in an appropriately functional range. Importantly, even on opposite sides in an individual animal, the separate rhythm generators for heartbeat on the two sides can show as much difference as that seen between animals. This suggests that the assembly of the networks leads to differences in the motor patterns that may underlie observed variations. In short, rhythms across animals (and even within animals on the two sides) are not as consistent as we might think from cellular to behavioral levels, but one presumes that they are in a range that is good enough. This is important data for coming to grips with what variability at cellular and `molecular levels means for variability in motor behavior. Except for a few places the paper offers a clear verbal account and an especially clear graphical presentation of the data.</p><p>Some concerns:</p><p>1) The Abstract is poor. I read it initially and could not really figure out what it was talking about. The paper itself is way better and the figures are excellent, but the abstract needs to be done in a way that makes the conclusions easily accessible to a person reading it. To be more concrete, in the parts starting on line 16, it is not obvious what repetition variability means, and the sentence after that one is also hard to parse without having read the paper.</p><p>2) I thought that the last two sentences of the subsection “Conclusions” seemed to be a side issue not appropriate for the big conclusions.</p><p>3) My biggest issue with the work however is the potential for variability that is the result of experimental manipulation necessary to collect the data. The preparations at some levels involve dissections and even some compression of the animal for imaging the beats. There is no account of how that might affect variation across preparations. Could the cross individual variation have to do with varying levels of damage to the preparations rather than a difference in the animals themselves. Even within an animal, the two sides might different because of some differences in the level of experimental damage within the two different networks that can still produce a stable output, but with a shifted phase. I am not sure exactly how to rule this out, but it seems to be something that deserves consideration in the paper. Is there is good reason to think it is not the source of the variation?

The authors are surprisingly agnostic to the literature in mammalian rhythm generating networks, and focus primarily on the leech heart beat system with some reference to other invertebrate rhythm generating systems. This omission unnecessarily limits the scope of this fundamentally, important issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We were not interested per se in cycle-to-cycle variability; we explore it here mainly to underpin our observations about differences among preparations, across levels, between episodic repetitions, and among bilaterally homologous neurons. We have not found corresponding studies in vertebrate rhythmic motor systems, except perhaps birdsong, which we made every effort to incorporate into Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors base their study on a larger data set, which allows them to compare sources of variability at various levels of integration from the cellular level to the behavioral level. However, one major weakness of this meta-analysis is the absence of experimental attempts to explore the actual mechanisms that underlie this stochastic variability, and the question how variability at one level influences another level.</p></disp-quote><p>We rely on extensive experimental analyses we have made over the years on the mechanisms of patterning within the heartbeat system and use this knowledge to inform our analyses.

But, without a computational approach or actual experiments in this ideal model system, the study remains very descriptive.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see:</p><p>Weaver et al., 2010, Wright and Calabrese, 2011 and Wright and Calabrese, 2011.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have compiled an extensive and impressive resource of data for motor pattern output across three levels of organization for a CPG network responsible for heart contraction in the leech. In a thorough and insightful analysis, they reveal that output variability across individuals, as measured by phase relationships, is different at different levels of the feedforward circuit, with the least variability seen at the level of the motor network, as opposed to the CPG or musculature. This is a compelling insight.</p><p>I do have serious concerns that I feel need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The nature and scope of the data themselves, and the nature and scope of the interpretation and discussion, are not in balance. Even from the title, &quot;Sources of variability[…]&quot; this imbalance is established, as I do not feel the authors are in any way assessing the mechanistic underpinnings or sources of variability. In particular, the use of bilateral measurements – and the demonstration therein of differences – is held up as evidence of &quot;stochasticity in developmental pathways&quot; among genetically identical cells and networks. One cannot argue with the genetics in question, but there is no evidence whatsoever to support this hypothesis. Indeed, inherent in this perspective is a bias that these are truly bilaterally symmetrical. Is there any data to support this assertion, or is this just an assumption? One could make the case that at a superficial level the mammalian heart is bilaterally symmetrical as well, but physiologically the pulmonary and systemic circuits are clearly differentiated in their function and underlying physiology. If this is the focus the authors wish to take, there needs to be a substantial redirection of the introduction and discussion of this work to try to make this case. Else the authors may have stumbled on to compelling physiological evidence to call into question the idea that the annelid heart is indeed a bilaterally symmetrical structure (at this point, an equally parsimonious – if not more so – interpretation of the data). In short, I do not feel that anywhere in the manuscript the authors make a compelling enough case to draw any conclusions about sources of variability. Phenomenologically, the variability is clear – but the etiology is completely unexplored in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have scaled back our claims about pinpointing the sources of variability in the population (note change in Title and Abstract), and we speculate about the origin of bilateral variability in the Discussion section “This bilateral variability might arise from stochastic processes during development as envisioned e.g., in the models of O’Leary and Marder, (2013, 2014).” We think that the reviewer has been confused by our complicated ‘simple’ system. There are bilaterally paired hearts that are identical to the eye. They both perform peristalsis alternating with synchrony in a reciprocal manner; left heart peristaltic/right heart synchronous and vice versa. They do vary in the corresponding (peristaltic/synchronous) patterns they produce across sides (as they do among individuals) but there is no handedness that we can see. The nervous elements that control the hearts consist of bilaterally paired motor neurons and interneurons. These produce reciprocally switching peristaltic and synchronous patterns corresponding to the heartbeat. There is variability in the corresponding (peristaltic/synchronous) patterns they produce across sides (as they do among individuals) but again there is no handedness that we can see. The development of the leech nervous system has been studied in great detail and these studies suggest that bilateral homologous neurons arise from bilateral homologous neuroblasts. Symmetry is rampant in the leech nervous system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Variability is perhaps one of the more difficult phenomena to quantify, due to its – well, variability. Because the data in this study are substantially meta-analytical, there is substantive lack of experimental control over potential sources of variability that preclude combining these data into one analysis. For example, comparing the amount of variability in measurements of muscle output for data collected multiple years ago with a cohort of animals entirely distinct of that from which the motor neuron output was collected is potentially confounding. The authors utilize animals supplied from multiple vendors outside of their own control (are they wild caught or reared?). How can one ensure rearing conditions, environmental variables, etc. are consistent between vendors – or across time – to appropriately cross-compare these different data sets into one analysis? Is there any potential species confusion across the time span of these studies? Indeed, the species used is listed only as &quot;Hirudo sp.&quot; and recently Hirudo has undergone a species reclassification. if the authors may be inadvertently, and more importantly asymmetrically, combining data from multiple species this is highly problematic. The most compelling data are those in which multiple levels of analysis are achieved from the same individuals – statistics for these are reported as a sub-population in the text, but to me the most informative analysis would be a correlation of variability in, for example, motor neuron variability and muscle output variability across individuals in which data were obtained for both. The authors do apparently have 9 instances of paired CPG and motor neuron recordings, as well as simultaneous motor and beat pattern from an earlier study (Wenning et al., 2014). By lumping these data together as populations, and not controlling the abovementioned sources of variability among individuals, the authors lose power for their interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have thoroughly addressed this issue and have added a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that fully explains all the groups of animals that we use and we constantly refer to this figure in the text to make sure that the reader know which animals we are referring to. All Ns in the manuscript refer to the number of animals (preparations).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is an unexplored aspect to these data that I would have appreciated hearing the authors' perspective on. That is, what are the functional implications – costs, tradeoffs, etc. – for differing variability across these levels? In other words, why should the system require highest constancy of phase at the level of motor neurons? And just as interesting, how is this achieved – how does a system take feedforward input from a CPG and decrease the variability in that input signal? I am keenly interested to hear the authors' insight on this mechanistic question, and its functional consequences – and I feel this is the more compelling aspect of the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We now attempt to explain how variability translates from level to level and make new analyses to elucidate how known mechanisms of circuit operation may explain this translation of variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, Figure 5—figure supplement 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This paper explores an important question concerning how variable a motor output is within and across animals at the level of the CPG, the motor output, and the behavior. There is a widespread notion that there are many solutions to producing essentially the same motor output. One might be led to think that there is not great variability of output across animals or within animals, but a critical analysis of this question depends on strong data sets that compare patterns across levels from cells to behavior and across individuals in the same motor behavior. This paper does that for the heart beat rhythm in leeches. The major take home message is that, while there is relatively low variation in phase relationships on a cycle-to-cycle basis in a pattern produced by the heart circuit on one side of an individual animal, there is substantial variation at levels from CPG to behavior across animals. So, the output can be variable, though presumably still in an appropriately functional range. Importantly, even on opposite sides in an individual animal, the separate rhythm generators for heartbeat on the two sides can show as much difference as that seen between animals. This suggests that the assembly of the networks leads to differences in the motor patterns that may underlie observed variations. In short, rhythms across animals (and even within animals on the two sides) are not as consistent as we might think from cellular to behavioral levels, but one presumes that they are in a range that is good enough. This is important data for coming to grips with what variability at cellular and `molecular levels means for variability in motor behavior. Except for a few places the paper offers a clear verbal account and an especially clear graphical presentation of the data.</p><p>Some concerns:</p><p>1) The Abstract is poor. I read it initially and could not really figure out what it was talking about. The paper itself is way better and the figures are excellent, but the abstract needs to be done in a way that makes the conclusions easily accessible to a person reading it. To be more concrete, in the parts starting on line 16, it is not obvious what repetition variability means, and the sentence after that one is also hard to parse without having read the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have completely rewritten the Abstract and hope it is clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I thought that the last two sentences of the subsection “Conclusions” seemed to be a side issue not appropriate for the big conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) My biggest issue with the work however is the potential for variability that is the result of experimental manipulation necessary to collect the data. The preparations at some levels involve dissections and even some compression of the animal for imaging the beats. There is no account of how that might affect variation across preparations. Could the cross individual variation have to do with varying levels of damage to the preparations rather than a difference in the animals themselves. Even within an animal, the two sides might different because of some differences in the level of experimental damage within the two different networks that can still produce a stable output, but with a shifted phase. I am not sure exactly how to rule this out, but it seems to be something that deserves consideration in the paper. Is there is good reason to think it is not the source of the variation? And if it is, the paper may speak less to the construction of networks and perhaps more to their destruction.</p></disp-quote><p>We forthrightly address this issue in our letter of appeal.

In the leech, neurons arise from bilaterally paired columns of blast cells derived from bilateral pairs of stem cells (teloblasts) each of which arises from a symmetric division. Such symmetry in the origin of bilateral blast cells gives rises to the concept of bilaterally homologous structures and cells. Blast cells differentiate into neurons, epithelia and muscles in each segment (Stent and Weisblat, 1985; Weisblat and Shankland, 1985). Yet, there is evidence for stochastic events during leech development, for example the bilateral OP neuroblasts undergo symmetric divisions but for each the fate of the daughter cells is determined by position, and also in the formation of unpaired neurons, where either the left or the right neuron dies (Blair et al., 1990; Stent and Weisblat, 1985; Weisblat and Shankland, 1985).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The very last sentence of the paper could more overtly place the charge on those model systems that are able to keenly control genetics and life history to take up the mantle of this idea next (I'm looking at you, Drosophila larval circuit people).

The peristaltic phase difference that the HE(8) to HE(12) motor neurons achieve is significantly smaller than that of the premotor interneurons of the CPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The phase progression of the premotor bursting pattern determines the maximal phase range, but the segment-specific synaptic strength pattern, intrinsic properties, and coupling determines the phase realized between two motor neurons (Wright and Calabrese, 2011). The premotor phase differences and the synaptic strength patterns interact so that the phase difference of the motor neurons progresses smoothly across the segments, and this smoothing and segment-to-segment attenuation of the CPG phase difference may limit the variance of intersegmental Dfs, especially for nearby segments. In support of this conclusion, we observed that when a larger or smaller number of segments intervene between motor neurons are assessed, then the variance in the motor pattern reflects more or less the corresponding variance of the CPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, in segmentally distributed motor patterns (such as the swim networks of lampreys, fish, leeches, crayfish swimmerets and locomotor patterns in insects) it is important to define or, better even, to compare different sets of segments over which variability is assessed (Buschges, 2005; Grillner and El Manira, 2015; Ingebretson and Masino, 2013; Kristan et al., 2005; Mullins et al., 2011; Pulver et al., 2015; Smarandache-Wellmann et al., 2014; Wiggin et al., 2012).</p><p>Discussion section very last sentence:</p><p>We provide a roadmap for others that may wish to analyze variability in motor system and argue that existing data sets on the locomotor and other motor patterns of invertebrates and vertebrates can be teased apart to determine the sources of output variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While we would like to ask you for a bigger picture discussion, the paper would benefit from reducing the Discussion section, by trying to make it more concise.</p></disp-quote><p>We shortened the original discussion considerably but added back considerations about other systems.
