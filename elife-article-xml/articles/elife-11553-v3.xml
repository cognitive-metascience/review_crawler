unclear. A current assumption is that cytosolic Drp1 is recruited directly to fission sites immediately prior to fission. Using live-cell microscopy, we find evidence for a different model, progressive maturation of Drp1 oligomers on mitochondria through incorporation of smaller mitochondrially-bound Drp1 units. Maturation of a stable Drp1 oligomer does not forcibly lead to fission. Drp1 oligomers also translocate directionally along mitochondria. Ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, causes rapid mitochondrial accumulation of actin filaments followed by Drp1 accumulation at the fission site, and increases fission rate. Inhibiting actin polymerization, myosin IIA, or the formin INF2 reduces both un-stimulated and ionomycin-induced Drp1 accumulation and mitochondrial fission. Actin filaments bind purified Drp1 and increase GTPase activity in a manner that is synergistic with the mitochondrial protein Mff, suggesting a role for direct Drp1/actin interaction. We propose that Drp1 is in dynamic equilibrium on mitochondria in a fission-independent manner, and that fission factors such as actin filaments target productive oligomerization to fission sites.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11553.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11553.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11553.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside cells, structures called mitochondria supply the energy needed to carry out the processes that sustain life. Mitochondria constantly divide (a process known as fission) or fuse together, which helps to keep them in good working condition and well distributed around the cell. Several neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s, are associated with problems that affect mitochondrial fission.</p> <p>Many different molecules work together to help mitochondria divide, including a protein called Drp1. A number of Drp1 molecules can associate with each other to form an “oligomer” in the shape of a ring around a mitochondrion. The ring then constricts to split the mitochondrion in two.</p> <p>It is often assumed that Drp1 molecules are recruited to the mitochondria immediately before fission and then form the oligomer ring. However, by using microscopy to track the movement of fluorescently labeled Drp1 molecules in human cells, Ji, Hatch et al. now suggest that Drp1 is continuously binding to and releasing from mitochondria, regardless of the need for fission. The experiments showed that when bound to surface of the mitochondrion, Drp1 switches between assembling and disassembling the oligomer ring. This process of Drp1 assembly and oligomerization on mitochondria is called maturation.</p> <p>Specific signals for fission can push Drp1 toward maturation, which then leads to fission. Ji, Hatch et al. found that one such signal is the assembly of filaments of a protein called actin. Preventing actin filaments from forming reduced the amount of Drp1 that accumulated at mitochondria, and resulted in the mitochondria dividing less frequently. Further biochemical experiments also revealed that actin interacts directly with Drp1 and stimulates Drp1 activity, helping the ring to organize and assist mitochondrial fission.</p> <p>The formation of actin filaments is not the only mechanism that can recruit Drp1 to mitochondria. Future work should investigate whether other mechanisms work with actin to recruit Drp1. As with actin filaments, other signals might be predicted to influence the balance of maturation and disassembly of Drp1 oligomers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11553.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11553.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>formin</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>INF2</kwd><kwd>ionomycin</kwd><kwd>Mff</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM069818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Higgs</surname><given-names>Henry N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM106000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Higgs</surname><given-names>Henry N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK088826</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Higgs</surname><given-names>Henry N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS056244</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strack</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS087908</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strack</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatch</surname><given-names>Anna L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A key cellular process is controlled by altering a balance, rather than through an off/on mechanism.</meta-value> </custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondrial fission and fusion create a dynamic network that is necessary for mitochondrial distribution and homeostasis. During mitosis, fission is necessary to distribute mitochondria between daughter cells. In neurons, fission and transport maintains mitochondrial distribution throughout the length of these highly polarized cells. Mitochondrial fission is also a fundamental step during mitophagy, a quality control mechanism that removes damaged mitochondrial segments. Dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics are linked to multiple neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, hereditary ataxia, and Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen and Chan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Girard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Niemann et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The dynamin-like GTPase Drp1 is a central component of the fission machinery, with Drp1 oligomerization and constriction providing a driving force for the process. Drp1 is a cytosolic protein that translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smirnova et al., 2001</xref>). In solution, Drp1 exists in a number of oligomeric states, including dimers, tetramers, and higher-order oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fröhlich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Macdonald et al., 2014</xref>). Membrane-bound oligomeric Drp1 induces tubulation of associated membrane, and constricts the membrane in the presence of GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Francy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mears et al., 2011</xref>). Drp1 can bind to the OMM through several factors, including the mitochondrial-specific lipid cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Macdonald et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stepanyants et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bustillo-Zabalbeitia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ugarte-Uribe et al., 2014</xref>); and several ‘receptors’ on the OMM, such as Mff, MiD49, and MiD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richter et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>What mechanisms target specific sites on mitochondria for fission? Recent findings have shed light on this question. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms close contacts with mitochondria at the eventual fission site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>). Actin polymerization at the ER-mitochondrial interface may be a key component, controlled by the ER-bound formin INF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>) and the mitochondrially-bound Spire1C protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manor et al., 2015</xref>). Myosin II activity also plays a role in this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DuBoff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korobova et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibition of actin polymerization, myosin II activity, or INF2 causes decreased levels of mitochondrially-bound Drp1 oligomers, suggesting that actin and myosin are acting at the level of Drp1 recruitment. Two additional actin binding proteins, cortactin and cofilin, have also been linked to mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Given the number of factors that can mediate Drp1 recruitment to the OMM, as well as the necessity for Drp1 oligomerization at the fission site, a fundamental question concerns the relationship between Drp1 recruitment, oligomerization, and fission. We envision two possible models for the process, termed de novo assembly and targeted equilibrium. In de novo assembly, cytosolic Drp1 is recruited specifically to fission sites, where it oligomerizes and mediates fission in a concerted series of steps in response to fission signals (which include OMM receptors, cardiolipin and actin). In targeted equilibrium, Drp1 maintains a constant equilibrium between cytosolic and mitochondrial pools, as well as between dimer and oligomer. These equilibria are independent of fission. Fission signals shift these equilibria toward stable oligomerization at targeted fission sites on the OMM.</p><p>While few studies address the order of events during Drp1 recruitment, de novo assembly is often tacitly assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Otera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elgass et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Labbé et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show evidence supporting targeted equilibrium. We observe that mitochondrially-bound Drp1 oligomers mature into stable oligomers through a series of merging events. Some of these Drp1 oligomers are motile—capable of translocating on the mitochondrial surface before engaging in fission. Notably, not all mitochondrially-bound Drp1 oligomers engage in fission. Using ionomycin treatment to induce mitochondrial fission, we show that actin polymerization precedes Drp1 oligomerization, and that actin enriches with Drp1 at fission sites. Inhibition of actin polymerization, INF2 or myosin II decreases ionomycin-induced Drp1 accumulation and mitochondrial fission. Biochemically, actin filaments bind Drp1 directly and enhance its GTPase activity, suggesting that actin filaments can organize Drp1 into a productive oligomer. These results suggest that actin promotes fission by facilitating productive oligomerization of Drp1 on the OMM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To monitor Drp1 dynamics in live cells, we developed a U2OS cell line stably expressing GFP-Drp1 with partial shRNA suppression of endogenous Drp1 (gDrp-U2OS). By quantitative western blotting, gDrp-U2OS cells maintain 1.64-fold total Drp1 levels compared to control U2OS cells, with 56% endogenous Drp1 and 44% GFP-Drp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Mitochondrial morphology appears similar between control U2OS and gDrp-U2OS cells (not shown). We also developed a live-cell assay to measure mitochondrial fission rate, in which peripheral cellular regions are imaged over 10 min for dynamics of a fluorescent mitochondrial marker. Fission events are scored based on stable separation of the marker, and similar fission rates are obtained with either a matrix marker or an OMM marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Using this assay, the fission rates of control U2OS and gDrp1-U2OS cells are statistically similar (1.26 ± 1.01 versus 1.51 ± 0.69 fission events per mm mitochondrion per min, p = 0.49) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Additionally, a second clone displaying undetectable endogenous Drp1 levels and GFP-Drp1 levels ~3.5-fold higher than control Drp1 levels displays similar mitochondrial fission frequency to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>), suggesting that GFP-Drp1 functionally compensates for endogenous Drp1 in these cells. We used the gDrp1-U2OS line for subsequent studies, due to its overall Drp1 levels being closer to those of control cells.</p><p>By live-cell confocal microscopy, much of the GFP-Drp1 in gDrp-U2OS cells appears diffuse in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, adjusting the fluorescence threshold to eliminate this diffuse signal reveals abundant Drp1 ‘puncta’ of varying intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), likely representing Drp1 oligomers. We arbitrarily defined two categories of puncta: ‘total’ puncta, including all Drp1 signal over the diffuse background; and ‘high-threshold’ puncta, representing the brightest 30% of Drp1 puncta. These designations do not represent two distinct pools of intensity, as the distribution of punctum intensity is continuous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Here, we use these categories to distinguish between smaller puncta and those approaching maximal size.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11553.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mitochondrial association of Drp1 puncta.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Time-lapse image of region of gDrp1-U2OS cell transiently expressing mito-BFP and processed to remove background GFP (described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

We observed three distinct dynamic behaviors associated with mitochondrially-bound Drp1 puncta: punctum merging, punctum motility, and mitochondrial fission. Mitochondrially-bound puncta frequently merge together, with successive merging events resulting in punctum growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>). Merging is a reversible process, and can be followed by splitting of the merged punctum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). The combination of these results suggests that a population of Drp1 is in rapid equilibrium between the cytosol and the OMM, and that one mechanism for assembly of larger Drp1 oligomers is through merging of mitochondrially-bound oligomers. We refer to this process as ‘maturation’. Imaging at higher resolution by Airyscan microscopy suggests that maturing puncta are loosely associated with the mitochondrion, and progressively encircle the mitochondrion as they mature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11553.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Maturation of mitochondrially-bound Drp1 puncta.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Example of Drp1 maturation events (arrowheads), followed by mitochondrial fission (63 s).

However, only a low percentage of Drp1 puncta (2.5% of total puncta and 6.3% of high threshold puncta) engages in observable fission events during the 10 min imaging period. Even for productive puncta, the lag between punctum establishment and mitochondrial fission varies significantly, with a mean of 76.0 ± 40.3 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) that appears to be independent of mitochondrial length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results suggest that establishment of an apparently stable mitochondrially-bound Drp1 oligomer is not sufficient, and that additional steps are required to drive fission.</p><p>We made two additional observations concerning mitochondrial fission. First, mitochondria undergoing fission tend to be longer than the mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Second, Drp1 remains at newly created mitochondrial ends for a significant time after fission. This residual Drp1 can be asymmetrically distributed, with one end inheriting most or all residual Drp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).</p><p>We examined Drp1 puncta at higher spatial resolution by live-cell 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM), using Tom20-mCherry as the mitochondrial marker in order to label the OMM. We analyzed diameters of both mitochondria and associated Drp1 puncta for ‘productive’ events (leading to fission) and non-productive events (sites of stable Drp1 puncta that did not undergo fission during observation). The mean mitochondrial diameter in the absence of Drp1 is 322 ± 64 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Non-productive high-threshold Drp1 puncta still cause significant constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), with mean mitochondrial diameter of 215 ± 50 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and Drp1 diameter of 270 ± 38 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) at these sites. This constriction is maintained over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We previously showed that mitochondrial length increased upon three cellular treatments: inhibition of actin polymerization by Latrunculin A (LatA), siRNA suppression of the formin protein INF2, or inhibition of myosin II by chemical inhibitors or siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korobova et al., 2014</xref>). The increase in mitochondrial length suggests a fission defect, but could also reflect changes in mitochondrial fusion. Here, we establish that the effect is on mitochondrial fission, using our live-cell fission assay. Suppression of either INF2 or myosin IIA causes an ~50% decrease in fission rate, whereas Drp1 suppression or expression of the dominant-negative Drp1 K38A mutant cause near-complete inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In addition, suppression of either INF2 or myosin IIA reduces mitochondrially-associated Drp1 puncta, with a moderate reduction of total Drp1 puncta (2.7-fold for both INF2 and myosin IIA) and a larger reduction in high threshold puncta (6.7-fold and 8.3-fold, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). LatA treatment also causes a reduction in mitochondrially-associated Drp1 puncta, although the degree of high threshold reduction is not as great as for INF2 or myosin IIA suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results support the previous results suggesting a role for actin polymerization in mitochondrial Drp1 assembly.</p><p>We next examined the relationship between actin filaments and Drp1 during mitochondrial fission by live-cell microscopy in gDrp-U2OS cells. One challenge is the abundance of actin-based structures in U2OS cells. To mitigate this issue, we imaged cells at a focal plane significantly above the ventral surface, where there are fewer actin-based structures such as stress fibers. In this region, we observed frequent examples of actin filaments accumulating prior to fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref>), but the overall actin filament abundance in the region remained a challenge for determining whether its presence might contribute to fission. To assess the significance of the actin accumulation, we calculated the mean percentage of mitochondrial area covered by actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and compared this number to the percentage of fission events at which actin was present immediately prior to fission. We found that a significantly higher percentage of fission events (56%) were associated with actin filaments than would be expected by random correlation (28%, n = 59 fission events, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6— figure supplement 2C</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media11" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-11553-media11.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11553.024</object-id><label>Video 11.</label><caption><title>Confocal live cell image of mitochondrial fission in an un-stimulated U2OS cell transiently expressing mApple-F-tractin and mito-BFP.</title><p>Time lapse was taken in single z-plane in dorsal region of cells to avoid massive actin based structures every 3 s.

To examine this relationship in more detail, we used ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, to increase mitochondrial fission rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanmartin et al., 2014</xref>). A recent publication showed that 3T3 cells respond to increased cytosolic calcium with an acute burst of actin polymerization throughout the cytosol, mediated by INF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shao et al., 2015</xref>). We find a similar ionomycin-induced actin burst in gDrp-U2OS cells (16.9 ± 8.7% signal increase, t<sub>1/2</sub> 28.1 ± 19.8 s) followed by a rapid decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Pre-treatment for 15 min with LatA abolishes both Drp1 accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) and the increase in mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Suppression of INF2 by siRNA treatment potently inhibits the actin increase, but causes a smaller decrease in whole-cell Drp1 oligomer accumulation than that achieved by LatA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, the effect of INF2 suppression on mitochondrially-associated high threshold Drp1 puncta is dramatic, with almost complete elimination of the ionomycin-induced increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> Right). INF2 suppression also causes a decrease in ionomycin-induced mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

These experiments suggest that both INF2-induced actin polymerization and myosin II activity are important pre-requisites for productive Drp1 oligomer assembly.</p><p>The mechanism by which actin might stimulate Drp1 accumulation is unclear. One possibility is that Drp1 binds directly to actin filaments at the fission site, similar to the direct binding between dynamin and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palmer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mooren et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, a previous study demonstrates that actin accumulates at clathrin-mediated endocytosis sites prior to dynamin 2 arrival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grassart et al., 2014</xref>). We tested the possibility of a direct interaction using purified proteins. Through co-sedimentation assay, Drp1 binds actin with an apparent K<sub>d</sub> of 0.8 ± 0.4 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8— figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, less than 50% of the Drp1 binds actin filaments even at saturating actin concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This situation is not caused by a significant pool of ‘inactive’ Drp1 in our purified preparation, since &gt;90% of the Drp1 pellets when incubated with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We postulate that partial binding is due to differential affinities of Drp1 oligomeric states for actin filaments.

Rather than being an ‘all or none’ process in which Drp1 oligomerization at the fission site is induced de novo by fission signals, we postulate that both Drp1 oligomerization and mitochondrial association are in constant equilibrium even in the absence of fission signals. Fission signals serve to ‘target’ this equilibrium to fission sites. Actin filaments are one such fission signal.</p><p>We illustrate these features as a three-stage model for fission-productive Drp1: recruitment, maturation, and conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In recruitment, ‘units’ of Drp1 are in rapid equilibrium between cytosolic and mitochondrially-bound pools. These Drp1 units diffuse on the OMM, and merge to form larger units. Maturation is the progressive association of mitochondrially-bound Drp1 units, leading to assembly of an oligomer that fully encircles the mitochondrion. The size of the mature oligomer is unclear, but might be similar to the 26-40 subunits found for dynamin2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grassart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cocucci et al., 2014</xref>). Mature oligomers are capable of movement along the OMM. Conversion represents a distinct process in which a site containing a stable Drp1 oligomer is rendered fission-competent.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11553.038</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model for assembly of fission-productive Drp1 on mitochondria.</title><p><bold>Step 1: recruitment</bold>.

First, what is the complete list of “fission signals”? There is evidence that OMM proteins such as Mff, MiD49/51, and Fis1, as well as cardiolipin exposure on the OMM, can serve as fission signals. We postulate that actin filaments in proximity to the mitochondrion are another such signal. Other potential factors that might influence fission could include mitochondrial length and mitochondrial branches. We find that fission events occur disproportionately on longer mitochondria, but we do not find an increase in Drp1 puncta density on longer mitochondria, suggesting that maturation is not favored on long mitochondria. It should be realized, however, that most mitochondria exist in a branched network in these cells. The relationship between mitochondrial branching and mitochondrial fission is a fascinating question still to be addressed.</p><p>Second, do the various fission signals act in series or in parallel? In other words, do the signals work together within the same fission pathway, or act in alternate pathways? Both options could be true, depending on the fission signal. For example, we postulate that actin filaments and cardiolipin might represent alternate maturation factors, since both are polyvalent anions. In contrast, actin filaments could work in concert with Mff, either in “coincidence detection” by Drp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hatch et al., 2014</xref>) or by actin filaments serving as a reservoir for delivery of Drp1 oligomers to Mff. Recent work has shown that Mff binds preferentially to oligomerized Drp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu and Chan, 2015</xref>), which is consistent with this possibility. We show here that actin filaments and Mff synergize in stimulating Drp1’s GTPase activity. A final possibility is that specific fission factors mediate distinct steps in the process. For example, a recent study on the membrane-altering ability of the Drp1-cardiolipin interaction might suggest that cardiolipin triggers a conversion step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stepanyants et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Third, what is the size of the Drp1 ‘unit’ that is recruited to mitochondria? We cannot detect the smallest oligomers (dimers, tetramers) in this study for several reasons, including: our threshold procedure forcibly removes these from analysis, and only ~ half of the Drp1 in these cells is GFP-labeled. The available data suggest that the recruited unit may be mixed oligomers of GFP-labeled and endogenous Drp1. Recent biochemical studies have shown that Drp1 exists in equilibrium between oligomeric states in solution, with some evidence that dimers are the relevant membrane-recruited unit in the case of cardiolipin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fröhlich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Macdonald et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, in the present study we observe clear instances of Drp1 puncta apparently translocating from cytosol to mitochondrion. We state ‘apparently’ because it is possible that these oligomers transfer from another membrane or a cytoskeletal structure. Based on these findings, we postulate that a range of oligomeric species can be recruited to mitochondria, but that their on- and off-rates might vary considerably.</p><p>Fourth, what steps are stimulated by actin? Our data show that inhibiting actin polymerization inhibits the accumulation of Drp1 oligomers, suggestive of roles in either recruitment or maturation. Direct Drp1 binding to actin filaments near mitochondria might enhance initial mitochondrial binding, or might accelerate oligomerization steps of cytosolic Drp1 prior to mitochondrial interaction, both of which would aid recruitment. Alternately, actin binding to mitochondrially-bound Drp1 might enhance oligomerization on the mitochondrial surface, which would represent maturation. The two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. A related question is: what is myosin II’s role in the process? One possibility is that myosin II activity might lead to Drp1-independent ‘pre-constriction’ of the OMM, as we have proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korobova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hatch et al., 2014</xref>). It is also possible that myosin II organizes the INF2-assembled actin filaments in a manner optimal for Drp1 recruitment and/or maturation.</p><p>Fifth, what are the roles of other actin binding proteins that have been identified as contributing to mitochondrial fission, such as cortactin, cofilin, and Spire 1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015</xref>)? There is evidence that mitochondrially-bound Spire 1C and ER-bound INF2 work through the same pathway, suggesting that Spire 1C might serve as a nucleation factor and INF2 as an elongation factor and/or a severing protein. Spire proteins cooperate with other formin proteins in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vizcarra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Quinlan, 2013</xref>). Roles for cortactin and cofilin in the same pathway as Spire 1C/INF2 are possible, but an alternative is that they contribute to a distinct actin-dependent pathway. The fact that steady-state fission rate is only partially reduced by INF2 or myosin IIA suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggests some degree of functional redundancy.</p><p>Sixth, does the conversion step represent a change in Drp1 structure/activity, or changes in other fission components? One possibility is recruitment of additional necessary molecules. For example, recent publications show that endophilin co-operates with actin and dynamin in clathrin-independent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boucrot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renard et al., 2015</xref>). Alternately, exposure of cardiolipin on the OMM could trigger a conversion step, as mentioned above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Macdonald et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Seventh, how does ionomycin stimulate mitochondrial fission? We postulate that, in addition to the known effect of calcium on Drp1 phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cribbs and Strack, 2007</xref>), increased cytosolic calcium activates INF2, as demonstrated in recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shao et al., 2015</xref>) (R. Wedlich-Söldner, personal communication). These effects are likely to be similar to those induced by the Listeria protein LLO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stavru et al., 2013</xref>), which is also a calcium ionophore.</p><p>Eighth, what is the role of the ER in mitochondrial fission? The tight association of ER with mitochondria at fission sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>) could contribute in two ways. First, ER supplies the INF2 isoform responsible for actin dynamics at the fission site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manor et al., 2015</xref>). Second, ER might contribute to the calcium dynamics necessary for ionomycin-mediated fission, considering the complex relationship between extracellular calcium entry, calcium release from ER, and ER-mitochondrial calcium communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horne and Meyer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Csordás et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Finally, what is the mechanism of Drp1 motility on mitochondria? Our 3D-SIM time-lapse movies suggest that motile Drp1 oligomers are rings that encircle the mitochondrion, and that these rings change significantly during the motility process, in a manner similar to ‘walking’ along the mitochondrial surface. Another possible mechanism could be ‘treadmilling’ of Drp1 units, adding to one side of the Drp1 oligomer while dissociating from the other side, akin to cytoskeletal polymers. Furthermore, what is the purpose of this motility? One possibility is something we call the ‘night watchman’ hypothesis, in which motility allows mature Drp1 oligomers to ‘patrol’ the mitochondrion in search of fission signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and siRNA oligonucleotides</title><p>Mito-DsRed and mito-BFP constructs were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korobova et al., 2014</xref>), and consist of amino acids 1–22 of S. cerevisiae COX4 N-terminal to the respective fusion protein. mCherry-mito-7 was purchased from Addgene (#55102), and consists of the mitochondrial targeting sequence was from subunit VIII of human cytochrome C oxidase N-terminal to mCherry.

Files of these ROIs were assembled, then coded and scrambled by one investigator, and analyzed for fission by a second investigator in a blinded manner as to the treatment condition. The second investigator scanned the ROIs frame-by-frame manually for fission events, and determined mitochondrial length within the ROI using the ImageJ macro, Mitochondrial Morphology (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dagda et al. (2009)</xref>). The results were then given back to the first investigator for de-coding. For measuring lengths of individual mitochondria, ROIs were selected that enabled imaging of the entire mitochondrial length where possible. Due to the fact that the majority of mitochondrial mass is in the form of a branched mitochondrial ‘network’ in these cells, and that one end of the network is often in the peri-nuclear region which is difficult to resolve, it was frequently difficult to find both ends of the network, in which case the resolvable length was reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Polyclonal antibodies against human INF2 N-terminus (amino acids 1-424) or FH1-FH2- C (amino acids 469-1249, CAAX) were raised in rabbits by Covance (Denver, PA), and affinity purified using DID construct (amino acids 1-269) or FH1-FH2 (amino acids 469-940) coupled to Sulfolink (Thermo/Pierce).

Your article has been favorably assessed by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom, Pekka Lappalainen, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The other two reviewers were Liza Pon and Aurelien Roux.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Drp1 is a dynamin-like GTPase, which promotes mitochondrial fission. However, the mechanisms underlying Drp1 association, oligomerization and dynamics on mitochondrial membrane are incompletely understood. Here, Ji et al., demonstrate that mitochondrially-bound Drp1 oligomers are motile and undergo merging events in order to mature into stable oligomers that are associated with mitochondrial fission. They also show that only a fraction of mitochondrially-associated Drp1 oligomers catalyze fission and that there is typically a long lag-period between the assembly/maturation of Drp1 puncta and the actual fission event. Finally, they provide evidence that actin filaments increase Drp1 accumulation and mitochondrial fission, and that Drp1 directly interacts with actin.</p> <p>The majority of experiments presented are convincing and of very good technical quality, and this interesting study extends our understanding of the mechanism underlying mitochondrial fission and provide evidence for a novel role of the actin cytoskeleton in recruiting Drp1 to the organelle. However, certain aspects of the study are slightly premature and at a somewhat descriptive level. Thus, few additional experiments geared towards understanding the mechanism and function of the peculiar behavior of Drp1 would significantly strengthen the manuscript.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>1) Actin-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) of Drp1 is an interesting observation, but whether the direct association between Drp1 and F-actin has any relevance in cells remains unclear. At minimum, the authors should examine whether Drp1 that is bound to a cardiolipin-rich membrane is capable of interacting with F-actin. This could be tested e.g. by examining (by fluorescence microscopy or by co-flotation assays) whether cardiolipin-rich vesicle/liposome -associated Drp1 (see e.g. Macdonald et al., MBoC, 2014) is capable of recruiting F-actin on the membrane in vitro. Alternatively, the authors could apply mutagenesis to reveal whether the binding sites for F-actin and membrane overlap on the surface of Drp1.</p> <p>2) Previous studies from this group revealed that silencing of INF2 or Myosin II results in decrease in localization of Drp1 puncta to mitochondria. At the time, they had not resolved high and low threshold puncta. Nonetheless, this suggests that the actin-dependent recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria is a general phenomena and not a consequence of ionomycin treatment. However, all studies on INF2, Myosin II and actin were performed in the presence of ionomycin. The manuscript would benefit from analysis of the effect of LatA treatment and of silencing INF2 or myosin II on recruitment of high and low threshold Drp1 puncta to mitochondria in cells that are not treated with ionomycin.</p> <p>3) The process where short oligomers are assembled into a productive, complete ring of Drp1 at the mitochondria may actually have a function. Is it possible this function could be to estimate the total length of the mitochondria, in order to fission the longest mitochondria in priority? Have the authors measured the probability of fission as a function of mitochondrial length? Such analysis may be very informative. Also, it would be better to present the fission data as a percentage of rings undergoing fission during the 10 min observation period, as this is more intuitive to understand than the fission efficiency presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> (and to eventually see that perturbing the actin cytoskeleton changes this correlation). Thus, few additional assays, data analysis and/or discussion concerning the possible cellular function of the peculiar assembly mechanism of Drp1 would significantly strengthen the manuscript (please see also 'minor points by reviewer #2' for further suggestions concerning possible additional experiments to test this hypothesis).</p> <p>4) The authors used mitochondria-targeted BFP and time-lapse imaging to visualize mitochondria association of Drp1 with the organelle and mitochondrial fission. Extensive UV illumination required to excite BFP can be damaging and induce mitochondrial fission. The manuscript would benefit from studies to determine whether the BFP-imaging conditions used affect mitochondria and cells.</p> <p>Minor points:</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p> <p>1) In the Results, K<sub>d</sub> value for Drp1 – actin interaction should be 0.8 μM (not 0.8 mM as stated in the text).</p> <p>2) Why are the average mitochondrial diameters different for 'non-productive Drp1 bound mitochondria' between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>? This should be explained.</p> <p>3) In the co-sedimentation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) the binding of 1,3 μM Drp1 reaches a plateau at 0,5 μM (i.e. more than 50% of the Drp1 is unable to co-sediment with F-actin). Does this mean that majority of Drp1 used in the assay was inactive?</p> <p>4) Does Drp1 bundle F-actin? Can the authors exclude the possibility that the thick actin filaments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> do not result from filament bundling (instead of Drp1-decoration)?</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p> <p>1) It seems intuitive that fission rate should be proportional to the length of the mitochondria, the longest ones being chopped into smaller ones. Have the authors measure the probability of fission as a function of mitochondrial length?</p> <p>2) I further wonder if longer mitochondria will then be covered by more punctae of DRP1, even though their density (number of punctae divided by length) could be constant. Have the authors measured the density of punctae as a function of mitochondria length?</p> <p>3) If point 2 is correct, longer mitochondria may thus have more punctae, which then will create more rings to fission more longer mitochondria. Have the authors measured the number of productive rings (undergoing fission) as a function of the length of mitochondria?</p> <p>4) If the proposed points above are correct, than one can understand the function of the actin-dependent mechanism of assembly shown by the authors. The role of the actin will then be to gather together oligomer evenly distributed at the surface of the mitochondria into productive rings at a fairly constant distance between productive rings: it means that the distribution of distances between productive (leading to fission) rings could be fairly broad, but with a peak. Have the authors measured the distribution of distances between fission points or productive rings?</p> <p>5) In this case, one expects the distance between the rings to be strongly affected by actin polymerization dynamics. A simple expectation could be that fast turn over could make closer rings and lower dynamics rings more spread apart, or even absent, which is what the authors have observed. Have the authors tried to overexpress cortactin (promotes actin polymerization) and/or cofilin (enhance turnover of actin) to see the effects of these molecules on the distance between productive rings?</p> <p>6) How did the authors choose the 30% high threshold? It sounds fairly arbitrary, is there any logic behind it?</p> <p>7) I found a striking difference between several fission events reported in this manuscript: some of them are left with DRP1 on one of the 2 tips of the mitochondria (tips generated by the fission), and others seem to have DRP1 at both tips. In this last case, they usually are of very different intensity. I was thus wondering if the authors had noticed this, and if most of the case were only one tip decorated with Drp1 or the 2 tips were always decorated.</p> <p>8) As said above, the fission efficiency parameter is fairly non-intuitive, a percentage of dots reaching fission within the 10min of observation would be better, I think.</p> <p>9) A small fraction of the low threshold dots still reach fission, so I was wondering if in doing so, their intensity was growing to the high threshold category or would stay constant.</p> <p>10) The authors have made a stable cell line expressing DRP1-GFP representing 44% of the total amount of DRP found in those cells. I was wondering if the authors could check further the functionality of the GFP construct by doing a siRNA against the endogenous form of DRP1 (which could be feasible if the authors have used a cDNA construct for doing the stable cell line), and show that the fission of mitochondria is still close to normality?</p> <p>11) 10 min of observation looks short in comparison to the duration of assembly and fission of mitochondria. I understand that the imaging of these events is difficult, but could it be possible to image them for much longer, in order to have a proper statistics (many rings may end up in being productive, but just not in the time window selected by the authors).</p> <p>12) Kymographs of single dots forming and fissioning could help in visualizing better the kinetics of assembly and fission. Not absolutely required.</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p> <p>1) The scale on the Y-axis needs to extend from 0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and many of the supplemental figures. If the authors want to emphasize the differences observed under different experimental conditions, they can show a full scale and an insert showing a zoom in on areas of interest.</p> <p>2) The figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> does not provide sufficient information for the reader to understand what was done. The graphs show fluorescence intensity of Drp1 and actin under conditions of ionomycin treatment. Is this the fluorescence intensity of Drp1 or actin that is associated with mitochondria? The figure legend and Y-axis labels should be revised to clarify this issue.</p> <p>3) The figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> does not provide sufficient information for the reader to understand what was done. Is actin maintained as filaments (e.g. by phalloidin) in the experiments for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and its associated supplemental figures? If not, is the concentration of F- and F-actin known under their experimental conditions? The figure legend should be revised for clarity.</p> <p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the K<sub>d</sub> of Drp1 binding to F-actin is 0.8 µM and in the text, the K<sub>d</sub> is 0.8 mM. Based on the data shown, the reference to mM is a typo, which should be corrected.</p> <p>5) Based on the negative staining results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, purified Drp1 does not change the width of F-actin. Instead, it results in bundling of actin filaments. The text should be modified accordingly.</p> <p>6) The figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref> does not provide sufficient information for the reader to understand what was done and what is shown. Do the lanes labeled &quot;standards&quot; show the total amount of Drp1 and actin in the binding mixture without centrifugation? Are the lanes in the labeled Drp1, µM and actin µM the pellets from the ultracentrifugation? The legend needs to be revised for clarity.</p></body> </sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11553.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p><italic>[…] The majority of experiments presented are convincing and of very good technical quality, and this interesting study extends our understanding of the mechanism underlying mitochondrial fission and provide evidence for a novel role of the actin cytoskeleton in recruiting Drp1 to the organelle.

However, we feel that our findings make an important mechanistic advance, in showing that the assembly of productive Drp1 oligomers on mitochondria is through alteration of an equilibrium process that is continuously occurring on mitochondria. Drp1 is constantly binding to and releasing from mitochondria, as well as in equilibrium between oligomeric states both on and off mitochondria, even in the absence of signals for fission. Fission signals (in this case, actin filaments near the fission site) serve to shift this equilibrium toward productive Drp1 oligomerization at fission sites. Our model contrasts with previous models depicting that Drp1 is recruited directly from the cytosol to fission sites in response to fission signals.</p> <p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p> <p><italic>1) Actin-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) of Drp1 is an interesting observation, but whether the direct association between Drp1 and F-actin has any relevance in cells remains unclear.

Alternatively, the authors could apply mutagenesis to reveal whether the binding sites for F-actin and membrane overlap on the surface of Drp1.</italic> </p> <p>This is, indeed, an important question that we have pursued in a somewhat different manner than that suggested. We chose to examine the combined effects of actin filaments and Mff, a Drp1 receptor on the OMM. We chose Mff for the following reason: this protein has been shown to be important for mitochondrial fission by multiple groups (Gandre-Babbe.et al., 2008; Otera et al., 2010; Loson et al., 2013; Liu et al. 2015). We now show evidence that actin filaments and Mff (the cytoplasmic portion) synergize to increase Drp1’s GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> and Results). These are very exciting results that lead to many new mechanistic hypotheses for us (included in Discussion). Although cardiolipin is an intriguing fission factor, we feel that it could be an “alternate” co-activator to actin filaments (both being anionic multivalent surfaces). Our future experiments will focus on mechanistically dissecting the combined effects of actin filaments, cardiolipin and Mff (as well as other OMM receptors) on Drp1 activity. Resolution of this question will require extensive experimentation that we feel is beyond the scope of this manuscript, so we hope that the new data we present are sufficient to provide evidence for the potential physiological significance of the actin/Drp1 interaction.</p> <p><italic>2) Previous studies from this group revealed that silencing of INF2 or Myosin II results in decrease in localization of Drp1 puncta to mitochondria. At the time, they had not resolved high and low threshold puncta. Nonetheless, this suggests that the actin-dependent recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria is a general phenomena and not a consequence of ionomycin treatment. However, all studies on INF2, Myosin II and actin were performed in the presence of ionomycin. The manuscript would benefit from analysis of the effect of LatA treatment and of silencing INF2 or myosin II on recruitment of high and low threshold Drp1 puncta to mitochondria in cells that are not treated with ionomycin.</italic> </p> <p>We have now quantified the effects of INF2 and myosin IIA suppression, as well as LatA treatment, on mitochondrially-bound Drp1 puncta (both total puncta and high threshold puncta), and find significant reductions for all these treatments. These results are now depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1C and 1D</xref>, and described in the Results section.</p> <p><italic>3) The process where short oligomers are assembled into a productive, complete ring of Drp1 at the mitochondria may actually have a function. Is it possible this function could be to estimate the total length of the mitochondria, in order to fission the longest mitochondria in priority? Have the authors measured the probability of fission as a function of mitochondrial length? Such analysis may be very informative.</italic> </p> <p>We now supply data showing that the mitochondria undergoing fission tend to be the longer ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref> and paragraph seven, Results). There are several issues that complicate this analysis. First, most mitochondria are in a network in U2OS cells, which is branched. This network often extends from the periphery to the peri-nuclear region, and it is often difficult to find both ends. Second, the frequency of mitochondrial fission is relatively low and our viewing time is limited (see reviewer 2 comments), making it difficult to conduct this analysis on a large number of events at present. Given these difficulties, we analyze fission events on mitochondria for which we can measure lengths, and find the mitochondria undergoing fission to be generally longer than those not undergoing fission. We also analyze in more detail the number of Drp1 puncta as a function of mitochondrial length, in response to reviewer 2 comment 2, and find that Drp1 punctum number increases linearly with mitochondrial length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1H</xref>). Thus, Drp1 punctum density does not vary with mitochondrial length. Finally, we examine the relationship between mitochondrial length and the “lag time” (between stable Drp1 oligomer assembly and fission) and find no apparent correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, paragraph six, Results). We think that the aggregate of the information suggests that the reason that fission occurs more readily on longer mitochondria is that there are more Drp1 puncta overall (but not higher density), providing a higher probability that one will become fission-competent. In the Discussion, we add a statement that the issue of mitochondrial branching, and its influence on mitochondrial fission, is a fascinating question still to be addressed (paragraph three, Discussion).</p> <p><italic>Also, it would be better to present the fission data as a percentage of rings undergoing fission during the 10 min observation period, as this is more intuitive to understand than the fission efficiency presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> (and to eventually see that perturbing the actin cytoskeleton changes this correlation).</italic> </p> <p>We have altered <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and modified the Results to reflect the reviewers’ comment.</p> <p><italic>Thus, few additional assays, data analysis and/or discussion concerning the possible cellular function of the peculiar assembly mechanism of Drp1 would significantly strengthen the manuscript (please see also 'minor points by reviewer #2' for further suggestions concerning possible additional experiments to test this hypothesis).</italic> </p> <p>We have altered our Discussion to reflect these comments (paragraph three), but we feel that the assembly mechanism is not necessarily peculiar. Our hypothesis is that fission signals such as actin filaments push the equilibrium of Drp1 oligomerization on mitochondria, driving maturation. Our evidence throughout the paper is consistent with this possibility. This mechanism of driving a reaction through changing an equilibrium process is used to regulate a large number of biological processes (metabolism, actin polymerization, many others) so we do not regard it as particularly bizarre.</p> <p><italic>4) The authors used mitochondria-targeted BFP and time-lapse imaging to visualize mitochondria association of Drp1 with the organelle and mitochondrial fission. Extensive UV illumination required to excite BFP can be damaging and induce mitochondrial fission. The manuscript would benefit from studies to determine whether the BFP-imaging conditions used affect mitochondria and cells.</italic> </p> <p>We agree that this is a concern, and have measured fission rates in the absence and presence of ionomycin using either our mitoRed or mitoBFP markers. In this experiment, we imaged for 25 min, which is longer than we have for the other experiments in this manuscript (see response to a reviewer 2 comment). We found similar fission rates for either mitochondrial matrix probe.</p> <p>These results are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3</xref> and discussed in the Results.</p> <p><italic>Minor points:</italic> Reviewer #1:</p> <p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments, which enabled us to bring up two important points about Drp1 biochemical properties.</p> <p><italic>1) In the Results, K<sub>d</sub> value for Drp1 – actin interaction should be 0.8 μM (not 0.8 mM as stated in the text).</italic></p> <p>Thank you for catching this. We have now corrected it.</p> <p><italic>2) Why are the average mitochondrial diameters different for 'non-productive Drp1 bound mitochondria' between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>? This should be explained.</italic> </p> <p>We are sorry for the confusion on this issue, which was due to poor explanation in the text and figures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> examines mitochondrial diameter (through Tom20) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> examines Drp1 punctum diameter. We have improved the figure labeling to clarify this issue.</p> <p><italic>3) In the co-sedimentation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) the binding of 1,3 μM Drp1 reaches a plateau at 0,5 μM (i.e. more than 50% of the Drp1 is unable to co-sediment with F-actin). Does this mean that majority of Drp1 used in the assay was inactive?</italic> </p> <p>The reviewer was very astute in noticing this. We know that the vast majority of our Drp1 is active, since we get close to 100% pelleting in the presence of non- hydrolyzable GTP analogue. We now include these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1B</xref> and discuss this phenomenon in the Results. We have been fascinated by this issue, and are investigating it in depth. It is due to a combination of varying Drp1 oligomeric state (each state with varying affinity for actin filaments) and a more complicated relationship between Drp1- Drp1 interactions and off-rate of Drp1 from actin filaments. We would ask to be allowed to address this mechanism in more depth in a subsequent publication, because it merits a more detailed analysis than we can do in this manuscript.</p> <p><italic>4) Does Drp1 bundle F-actin? Can the authors exclude the possibility that the thick actin filaments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> do not result from filament bundling (instead of Drp1-decoration)?</italic></p> <p>This is a great observation. Indeed, in our EMs we cannot distinguish between Drp1 bound to single filaments versus Drp1-bundled filaments. Drp1 can induce filament bundling, and we now supply evidence for this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>; Results). As with many facets of Drp1 biochemistry, this bundling is not straightforward (depicted in 8F), and we would prefer to show initial evidence for bundling here, followed by more detailed examination in a future publication.</p> <p>Reviewer #2:</p> <p>We appreciate the thoughtful comments by this reviewer, which challenged us and made us think about the process in a different way. Ultimately, our responses to his/her specific comments are somewhat ‘negative’ in that we were not able to obtain clear evidence in support of their idea.</p> <p>However, the reviewer’s comments bring up issues of the relationship between mitochondrial fission and the mitochondrial network, including many fascinating issues with mitochondrial branches: how are branches made, and how do they affect fission? We hope to address these in the future, but feel it appropriate to mention these only in passing in the Discussion.</p> <p><italic>1) It seems intuitive that fission rate should be proportional to the length of the mitochondria, the longest ones being chopped into smaller ones. Have the authors measure the probability of fission as a function of mitochondrial length?</italic> </p> <p>We have analyzed the lengths of filaments undergoing fission, as well as those not experiencing fission during the viewing period, and find that longer filaments tend to be the ones undergoing fission. This is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref>. These analyses are complicated by the fact that it is difficult to define length, given the mitochondrial network that exists.</p> <p><italic>2) I further wonder if longer mitochondria will then be covered by more punctae of DRP1, even though their density (number of punctae divided by length) could be constant. Have the authors measured the density of punctae as a function of mitochondria length?</italic> </p> <p>We have now measured Drp1 puncta number as a function of mitochondrial length, and find that, as suspected by the reviewer, the relationship is roughly linear for both total puncta and for high threshold puncta. These data are now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1H</xref>, and are described in paragraph three of the Results.</p> <p><italic>3) If point 2 is correct, longer mitochondria may thus have more punctae, which then will create more rings to fission more longer mitochondria. Have the authors measured the number of productive rings (undergoing fission) as a function of the length of mitochondria?</italic> </p> <p>We have found that longer mitochondria are more likely to undergo fission in our viewing period (response to major comment 3 and to reviewer 2 comment 1). This essentially corresponds to productive rings (since all fission events correspond to high-threshold Drp1 rings). However, the fact that the density of high-threshold puncta does not increase with mitochondrial length (response to reviewer 2 comment 2) suggests that maturation is not favored on longer mitochondria. The conversion phase does not seem to be affected by mitochondrial length, if one can use lag time as a measure of conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p> <p><italic>4) If the proposed points above are correct, than one can understand the function of the actin-dependent mechanism of assembly shown by the authors. The role of the actin will then be to gather together oligomer evenly distributed at the surface of the mitochondria into productive rings at a fairly constant distance between productive rings: it means that the distribution of distances between productive (leading to fission) rings could be fairly broad, but with a peak. Have the authors measured the distribution of distances between fission points or productive rings?</italic> </p> <p>It is difficult to measure the distance between productive rings on mitochondria, because the majority of fission events occur in isolation. Further response to this comment is given in comment 5.</p> <p><italic>5) In this case, one expects the distance between the rings to be strongly affected by actin polymerization dynamics. A simple expectation could be that fast turn over could make closer rings and lower dynamics rings more spread apart, or even absent, which is what the authors have observed. Have the authors tried to overexpress cortactin (promotes actin polymerization) and/or cofilin (enhance turnover of actin) to see the effects of these molecules on the distance between productive rings?</italic> </p> <p>Our hypothesis is that actin filaments do not represent a “steady-state” signal to stimulate Drp1 maturation, but are activated to assemble at specific sites (in other words, a “fission signal”).</p> <p>These site-specific signals serve to shift Drp1’s equilibrium towards assembly of productive oligomers. We have re-written the first paragraph of the Discussion to state this more clearly.</p> <p>In this context, shifting global actin polymerization could have effects on mitochondrial fission, by changing the availability of polymerizable actin monomers for example. The fact that INF2 is ER-bound (and that ER interacts with mitochondria at fission sites), and our previous localization studies of activated myosin II suggest that these influence mitochondrial fission specifically. We are interested in the potential roles of cortactin and cofilin in this process, especially due to their published links to fission (referenced in the manuscript), but feel that significant experimentation is required to deconvolve their global roles from mitochondria-specific roles.</p> <p><italic>6) How did the authors choose the 30% high threshold? It sounds fairly arbitrary, is there any logic behind it?</italic> </p> <p>We did not have a specific logic in choosing the 30% cut-off point, since the distribution in punctum intensity is fairly continuous. The high-threshold designation allows us to distinguish the more mature puncta from total puncta, which allows us a means of assessing maturation. We now include the word “arbitrarily” in paragraph two of the Results section.</p> <p><italic>7) I found a striking difference between several fission events reported in this manuscript: some of them are left with DRP1 on one of the 2 tips of the mitochondria (tips generated by the fission), and others seem to have DRP1 at both tips. In this last case, they usually are of very different intensity. I was thus wondering if the authors had noticed this, and if most of the case were only one tip decorated with Drp1 or the 2 tips were always decorated.</italic> </p> <p>We thank the reviewer for this observation, and now show examples of Drp1 remaining at newly created mitochondrial ends. From our analysis, 30% of the time the Drp1 remains only at one of the two new ends. We now show this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B-D</xref>, and describe it in the Results.</p> <p><italic>8) As said above, the fission efficiency parameter is fairly non-intuitive, a percentage of dots reaching fission within the 10min of observation would be better, I think.</italic> </p> <p>We have altered <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> to reflect the reviewer’s comment.</p> <p><italic>9) A small fraction of the low threshold dots still reach fission, so I was wondering if in doing so, their intensity was growing to the high threshold category or would stay constant.</italic> </p> <p>We now realize that our “low threshold” classification is a very poor use of words, since it refers to all Drp1 puncta with intensities over that of the diffuse background. We have changed “low threshold puncta” to “total puncta” throughout the manuscript.</p> <p><italic>10) The authors have made a stable cell line expressing DRP1-GFP representing 44% of the total amount of DRP found in those cells. I was wondering if the authors could check further the functionality of the GFP construct by doing a siRNA against the endogenous form of DRP1 (which could be feasible if the authors have used a cDNA construct for doing the stable cell line), and show that the fission of mitochondria is still close to normality?</italic> </p> <p>We were also concerned about the ability of GFP-Drp1 to replace endogenous Drp1. Our original intent was to develop a stable cell line that both suppressed endogenous Drp1 and expressed GFP-Drp1 at near endogenous levels (hence use of the combined shRNA/re- expression construct). The clone that best suited our purposes was one that still had appreciable endogenous Drp1 expression, but whose GFP-Drp1 expression was relatively low (resulting in a &lt;twofold increase in overall Drp1).</p> <p>As partial response to this comment, we have analyzed a different clone isolated during production of our stable cell line. This clone effectively suppresses endogenous Drp1 to undetectable levels, while expressing GFP-Drp1 to levels ~threefold higher than Drp1 levels in control cells. This clone displays similar mitochondrial fission rates to those of control cells (both unstimulated and ionomycin-stimulated). We now show these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1E-G</xref>, and describe them in paragraph one, Results.</p> <p><italic>11) 10 minutes of observation looks short in comparison to the duration of assembly and fission of mitochondria. I understand that the imaging of these events is difficult, but could it be possible to image them for much longer, in order to have a proper statistics (many rings may end up in being productive, but just not in the time window selected by the authors).</italic> </p> <p>We agree with the reviewer that, ideally, imaging would be conducted over a longer time period to capture more fission events and get a better gauge of Drp1 ring productivity. We used 10 minutes, though, because we found it necessary to acquire images as rapidly as possible, since fission events can happen quickly, followed by rapid mitochondrial translocation (causing an under- estimation of fission). Given the frequency of image acquisition, we limited total exposure time to reduce the potential for imaging-induced artifacts and photo-bleaching. In our revised manuscript, however, we have conducted the analysis of two experiments for &gt; 20 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1G</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3</xref>) and have found no significant difference in fission rate from our 10 minute observation, which suggests that we are not experiencing imaging artifacts to a large degree.</p> <p><italic>12) Kymographs of single dots forming and fissioning could help in visualizing better the kinetics of assembly and fission. Not absolutely required.</italic> </p> <p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion, and have attempted kymograph analysis of Drp1 puncta before and during fission. Unfortunately, we found this analysis was complicated by the dynamics of the mitochondria themselves, which in our hands made the analysis too difficult to provide clear kinetic patterns for Drp1.</p> <p>Reviewer #3:</p> <p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments, which led us to clarify a number of places that were confusing in the manuscript, and to address the actin bundling issue.</p> <p><italic>1) The scale on the Y-axis needs to extend from 0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and many of the supplemental figures. If the authors want to emphasize the differences observed under different experimental conditions, they can show a full scale and an insert showing a zoom in on areas of interest.</italic> </p> <p>We have changed the Y axis to extend from 0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we feel that extending the Y axis to 0 in the main figure (and supplying a zoomed inset) is confusing and detracts from interpretation of the data. By limiting the Y axis, we are not trying to make the results appear more significant than they are, we are simply trying to display the data in the clearest manner possible. These are not large% changes in the Drp1 punctum or actin filament signals, but they are robust (as denoted by the error bars for each time point).</p> <p><italic>2) The figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> does not provide sufficient information for the reader to understand what was done. The graphs show fluorescence intensity of Drp1 and actin under conditions of ionomycin treatment. Is this the fluorescence intensity of Drp1 or actin that is associated with mitochondria? The figure legend and Y-axis labels should be revised to clarify this issue.</italic> </p> <p>We have described the experiments better in the new figure legend. Briefly, both the Drp1 and actin signals represent fluorescence intensities above the diffuse cytosolic background, which represents Drp1 puncta and actin filaments, respectively. In both cases, these are not mitochondrially-localized Drp1 or actin (Drp1 is a whole cell evaluation, actin is evaluation of specific regions of interest).</p> <p><italic>3) The figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> does not provide sufficient information for the reader to understand what was done. Is actin maintained as filaments (e.g. by phalloidin) in the experiments for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and its associated supplemental figures? If not, is the concentration of F- and F-actin known under their experimental conditions? The figure legend should be revised for clarity.</italic> </p> <p>We have revised the legend to clarify this issue. No phalloidin is used in these assays, so that the concentration of actin filaments is the total actin concentration minus the barbed end critical concentration (0.1 μM). We know that Drp1 does not significantly change the kinetics of actin polymerization or the barbed end critical concentration, as determined by pyrene-actin polymerization assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p> <p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the K<sub>d</sub> of Drp1 binding to F-actin is 0.8 µM and in the text, the K<sub>d</sub> is 0.8 mM. Based on the data shown, the reference to mM is a typo, which should be corrected.</italic> </p> <p>We regret this mistake and have corrected it.</p> <p><italic>5) Based on the negative staining results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, purified Drp1 does not change the width of F-actin. Instead, it results in bundling of actin filaments. The text should be modified accordingly.</italic> </p> <p>We have modified this section of the manuscript, in response to comments from both reviewer 1 and reviewer 3. In fact, we cannot distinguish if the negative staining represents an actin bundle or a single actin filament decorated by Drp1. We now supply evidence that Drp1 can cause actin filament bundling.</p> <p>These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>, and described in the Results.</p> <p><italic>6) The figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref> does not provide sufficient information for the reader to understand what was done and what is shown. Do the lanes labeled &quot;standards&quot; show the total amount of Drp1 and actin in the binding mixture without centrifugation? Are the lanes in the labeled Drp1, µM and actin µM the pellets from the ultracentrifugation? The legend needs to be revised for clarity.</italic> </p> <p>We have now clarified that the “Standards” do indeed show the total amount of Drp1 and actin present in the assay prior to centrifugation. The other lanes are the pellet fractions and are now labeled as such.</p></body> </sub-article></article>
