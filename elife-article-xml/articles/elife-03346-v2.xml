Unraveling the regulatory mechanisms underlying adipogenesis is therefore highly relevant from a biomedical perspective. Our current understanding of fat cell differentiation is centered on the transcriptional cascades driven by the C/EBP protein family and the master regulator PPARγ. To elucidate further components of the adipogenic gene regulatory network, we performed a large-scale transcription factor (TF) screen overexpressing 734 TFs in mouse pre-adipocytes and probed their effect on differentiation. We identified 22 novel pro-adipogenic TFs and characterized the top ranking TF, ZEB1, as being essential for adipogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, its expression levels correlate with fat cell differentiation potential in humans. Genomic profiling further revealed that this TF directly targets and controls the expression of most early and late adipogenic regulators, identifying ZEB1 as a central transcriptional component of fat cell differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03346.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03346.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03346.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The growing rates of obesity and related metabolic diseases are a major public health concern worldwide. People who are overweight or obese are at increased risk for a range of diseases including diabetes and heart disease, which may reduce their quality of life and shorten their lifespans. Obese people have more, larger fat cells than individuals of healthy weight, and so understanding how the body creates fat cells may provide new insights into ways to prevent or treat obesity.</p><p>Fat cells arise from a population of stem cells that can also give rise to bone cells and cartilage. Some of the proteins—called transcription factors—that work together to turn on the expression of genes needed for a stem cell to become a fat cell have been identified. However, the exact regulatory processes that cause an unspecialized cell to develop into a fat cell remain unclear.</p><p>Gubelmann et al. set out to identify more of the transcription factors that cause stem cells to become fat cells. A high-throughput, automated process was used to test the effect of over-expressing each of 734 transcription factors in mouse cells that are primed to become fat cells. Twenty-six transcription factors were found to increase the number of these primed cells that became mature fat cells—most of which had not previously been shown to affect how fat cells develop. The most powerful driver of fat cell development was ZEB1: a transcription factor that has previously been implicated in many other biological processes. Most notably, ZEB1 was linked to a transition during development that allows cells to migrate to the correct location in the embryo, but also to a mechanism that allows cancerous cells to spread to new tissues.</p><p>Using studies of mouse cells and live mice, computational analyses, and biopsies from obese patients, Gubelmann et al. show that ZEB1 regulates numerous other transcription factors that promote the development of fat cells. These include factors that initially set an unspecialized cell on the path to becoming a fat cell and those that guide the changes that occur as the fat cell matures. Further studies will be required to show whether the ZEB1 protein itself is needed to prime stem cells to start becoming fat cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03346.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03346.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>adipogenesis</kwd><kwd>zeb1</kwd><kwd>transcription factor screen</kwd><kwd>gene regulatory network</kwd><kwd>mesenchymal stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_122552, 31003A_138323</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gubelmann</surname><given-names>Carine</given-names></name><name><surname>Waszak</surname><given-names>Sebastian M</given-names></name><name><surname>Deplancke</surname><given-names>Bart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Federation of European Biochemical Societies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwalie</surname><given-names>Petra C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 600-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwalie</surname><given-names>Petra C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT001032/2013-L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwalie</surname><given-names>Petra C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001703</institution-id><institution>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deplancke</surname><given-names>Bart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>205641 AdipoDif</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wolfrum</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_140926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wolfrum</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A large-scale transcription factor screen reveals over twenty novel adipogenic regulators: most notably ZEB1, which exerts essential transcriptional control of fat cell differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity and its associated diseases such as diabetes and hypertension affect a high percentage of the world population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">von Ruesten et al., 2011</xref>). Excess fat mass in obese individuals is driven by an increase in adipocyte cell size (hypertrophy) or number (hyperplasia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stephens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</xref>). A comprehensive knowledge of adipocyte differentiation is therefore relevant and timely both from a basic and medical research perspective. Adipocytes arise from multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through an initial lineage commitment phase, followed by terminal differentiation with accumulation of lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cawthorn et al., 2012</xref>). Although many of the key transcription factors (TFs) controlling this adipogenic program are known, a cohesive model of the underlying molecular events has yet to be revealed.</p><p>Most of our current understanding of adipogenesis has been derived using the in vitro murine committed pre-adipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Green and Kehinde, 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">1976</xref>), which to a certain extent recapitulates key features of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green and Kehinde, 1979</xref>). The adipocyte differentiation program is accomplished by the expression and activity of a cascade of TFs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rosen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farmer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siersbæk and Mandrup, 2011</xref>]), most notably the early-expressed CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins beta (C/EBPβ) and delta (C/EBPδ), which induce C/EBPα and the adipogenic master regulator nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). C/EBPα and PPARγ cooperate to activate adipogenic genes and cross-regulate each other in a positive feedback loop to maintain the terminally differentiated state of mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have revealed the importance of other TFs in regulating adipogenesis both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Soukas et al., 2001</xref>).

Efforts are therefore underway to integrate this information into comprehensive adipogenic regulatory networks (aGRNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siersbæk et al., 2012</xref>), to which new nodes such as the early regulators ZFP432 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>), TCF7L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cristancho et al., 2011</xref>), or EVI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishibashi et al., 2012</xref>) keep being added. This suggests that many important components of this aGRN remain to be discovered.</p><p>To systematically identify novel aGRN members, we performed a large-scale overexpression screen with 734 full-length mouse TFs in 3T3-L1 cells, which led to the identification of 26 pro-adipogenic TFs.

We found 26 TFs that significantly enhance adipogenesis (≥ 1.5-fold relative to control (FC), Bonferroni &lt; 0.05) of which 22 have to our knowledge never been implicated in this process, with the TF ZEB1 showing the strongest effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gubelmann et al., 2014</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, the master regulator PPARγ was among these 26 stringently selected top ranking candidates, serving as a positive control.</p><p>Because our screen was blind to the expression and functional characteristics of the overexpressed TFs, we investigated which of our top enhancing TFs are also endogenously expressed in 3T3-L1 cells or other pre-adipocyte cell lines. For this purpose, we analyzed publicly available microarray expression data from mouse 3T3-L1 and primary human adipose stromal cells, as well as RNA polymerase II (POLII) binding data for expressed TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nielsen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mikkelsen et al., 2010</xref>). We found that 18 of the top 26 candidates (69%) show high microarray signal or POLII gene body occupancy, suggesting that they are actively transcribed during 3T3-L1 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gubelmann et al., 2014</xref>] and ‘Materials and methods’). Additionally, we found using Expression Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kapushesky et al., 2012</xref>) that nine of the positive candidates (including PPARγ and the top candidate ZEB1) are expressed significantly higher in adipose tissue compared to their mean expression across tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The high abundance of these TFs may point to a regulatory function in adipocyte-specific processes. Moreover, 15 (83%) of the candidates' human orthologs are also highly expressed in human adipose stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that their regulation is conserved.</p><p>To validate the adipogenic activity of our newly identified pro-adipogenic TFs, we generated 10 stably transduced 3T3-L1 cell lines, including for eight of the top candidates that were not previously implicated in adipogenesis (referred to as ‘follow-up TFs’), as well as for PPARγ and the negative control vector, using puromycin selection. TFs were overexpressed for 2 days before inducing differentiation, and lipids were stained with Oil Red O 5 days after differentiation. Overexpression of the TFs was confirmed by Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Compared with cells transduced with the control vector, overexpression of 6 out of these 8 TFs led to increased lipid content within the respective cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and a strong induction of adipogenic gene expression as measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (<italic>Pparg2</italic>, <italic>Cebpa</italic>, and <italic>Adipoq</italic>) after differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).

This suggests that these TFs may be important in defining the pre-adipocyte state and may act as early regulators of fat cell differentiation.</p><p>To confirm the involvement of the top differentiation-enhancing TF ZEB1 in 3T3-L1 adipogenesis, we reduced its expression levels with three distinct shRNAs.

Oil Red O staining revealed a dramatic reduction in differentiation for individual shRNAs and an almost completely abolished differentiation when the shRNA pool was used, an effect that mimicked that of PPARγ KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we identified several TFs that increase adipogenesis when transiently or stably overexpressed in 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). In addition, we revealed that KD of the top adipogenic candidate ZEB1 inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that this TF is a so far unrecognized, important mediator of 3T3-L1 fat cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Alteration of nuclear ZEB1 levels perturbs the expression of adipogenic regulators and pathways</title><p>To explore the mechanism underlying ZEB1-induced stimulation of adipogenesis, we used 3T3-L1 cells. First, we quantified its expression level by qPCR at six adipogenic differentiation time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Unlike <italic>Pparγ</italic>, whose expression is highly induced upon adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tontonoz et al., 1994</xref>), <italic>Zeb1</italic> mRNA levels were already high in pre-adipocytes and moderately but significantly decreased during terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>, p = 0.009, Wilcoxon rank-sum test days −2 to 2 vs. day 4). This result is consistent with data from previously published microarray-based gene expression during adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mikkelsen et al., 2010</xref>) as well as with data comparing pre-adipocyte to adipocyte gene expression (Expression Atlas: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kapushesky et al., 2012</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). ZEB1 may thus already be active at early stages of adipogenesis, in line with the observation that it is among several genes that were highly upregulated immediately after adipogenic induction of mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billon et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We next examined ZEB1 protein levels during differentiation using our recently developed quantitative proteomics assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simicevic et al., 2013</xref>). We found that ZEB1 is expressed at comparable levels to the nuclear receptor RXRα at day 0 (about 0.25 fmol/μg nuclear extract) ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simicevic et al., 2013</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

These results indicate that, even though ZEB1 is already highly expressed in pre-adipocytes, its nuclear protein level tends to further increase over the course of differentiation, which appears consistent with the enhancing effect of ZEB1 upon overexpression.

Pathway enrichment analysis of genes whose expression changed already in pre-adipocytes revealed a clear distinction between up- and down-regulated genes. While the former enriched for cell cycle and cytoskeleton remodeling-related processes, the latter singled out various developmental pathways previously implicated in adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">James, 2013</xref>), including ‘TGF-beta-dependent induction of EMT via SMADs’, ‘Ligand-dependent activation of the ESR1/AP1 pathway’, ‘WNT signaling pathway Part 2’, and ‘Notch Signaling Pathway’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gubelmann et al., 2014</xref>]). Specifically, reducing ZEB1 expression in 3T3-L1 cells had a strong impact on the expression of the adipogenic master regulators <italic>Cebpa</italic>, <italic>Cebpd</italic> as well as the known adipogenic TFs <italic>Nr3c1</italic> and <italic>Krox20</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gubelmann et al., 2014</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Moreover, we found that the expression of four novel adipogenic candidates identified in the TF screen (<italic>Zfp30</italic>, <italic>Ebf3</italic>, <italic>Msx1</italic>, and <italic>Atoh8</italic>) is equally perturbed (at day 0) by reduced ZEB1 levels, suggesting that they may belong to the same regulatory module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gubelmann et al., 2014</xref>]).</p><p>To better understand the gene regulatory function of ZEB1, we analyzed the proportion of up- and down-regulated genes in each of nine distinct gene clusters that were previously derived from genome-wide microarray-based expression data generated during 3T3-L1 terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mikkelsen et al., 2010</xref>). Strikingly, genes showing decreased expression upon confluence under normal conditions (i.e., expression at day −2 is higher than at day 0) were significantly up-regulated at day 0 in ZEB1 KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). The enrichment was strongest for genes in cluster 2, which were previously associated with mitosis and cell cycle functions. This is consistent with the pathway analysis results reported above and suggests that ZEB1 may control the expression of genes involved in coordinated cell cycle arrest, an essential step in 3T3-L1 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tang et al., 2003</xref>). Conversely, we found that a striking majority of genes whose expression increases upon confluence (day −2 expression lower than day 0 expression) were downregulated at day 0 upon ZEB1 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The strongest signal was observed for cluster 3 genes, which were previously associated with cell adhesion and extracellular matrix functionality. We note that several other EMT factors such as <italic>Snai2</italic> (previously shown to be a promoter of adipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pérez-Mancera et al., 2007</xref>]), <italic>Twist1, Id2</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic> fall in this cluster and were significantly down-regulated upon ZEB1 KD.</p><p>To test how ZEB1 KD specifically impacts the expression of known adipogenic TFs in a statistical threshold-independent manner, we directly compared expression fold-changes of positive and negative regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gubelmann et al., 2014</xref>]) of fat cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In pre-adipocytes, positive regulators tended to be down-regulated upon ZEB1 KD while negative regulators were up-regulated (p = 0.007, Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing fold-changes), suggesting that ZEB1 acts primarily as a positive regulator in the context of the aGRN, consistent with observations from our phenotype-profiling experiments. We recently dissected the role of SMRT (NCOR2), a transcriptional co-repressor, in fat cell differentiation and showed how it maintains genes in a poised state until adipogenesis is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raghav et al., 2012</xref>). If ZEB1 is, as hypothesized, an activator of early adipogenic genes, which are partially repressed by SMRT, we expect (1) a high overlap between genes regulated by SMRT and ZEB1; and (2) SMRT and ZEB1 KD to have inverse effects on the expression of the genes that they control. Indeed, we found that the fold-changes induced in POLII binding upon SMRT KD and in gene expression upon ZEB1 KD were significantly negatively correlated (Spearman's ρ = −0.36, p &lt; 10<sup>−16</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). For example, while SMRT KD significantly increased POLII levels at the positive adipogenic regulators <italic>Cebpa</italic> and <italic>Id4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murad et al., 2010</xref>), ZEB1 KD highly reduced their mRNA levels in pre-adipocytes.

Together, these results suggest that, while there is sequence specificity to ZEB1 binding, the protein is most likely recruited to a broad number of regulatory regions, either by or in cooperation with other DNA binding proteins.</p><p>To verify whether ZEB1 targets previously identified (pre)adipogenic regulatory regions, we used publicly available C/EBPβ and AP1 binding data in 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Siersbæk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Siersbæk et al., 2014</xref>). We found that almost one third of ZEB1-bound regions were co-bound by C/EBPβ, which represents a significant enrichment over random expectation (Fisher's exact test, p ≤ 10<sup>−12</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Both ZEB1 and C/EBPβ ChIP-seq signal intensities were high at these 5,032 genomic locations, which were also enriched for AP1 factor binding (in particular ATF7 and ATF2), high DNase I signal, and to a lesser extent POLII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Strikingly, 27% of regions bound by ZEB1 at day 0 were also bound by at least one of the five AP1 complex proteins JUNB, FOSL2, CJUN, ATF7, and ATF2 4 hr after induction of differentiation, again a highly significant co-localization (Fisher's exact test, p ≤ 10–12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Globally, regions showing higher ZEB1 enrichment co-localized more with TF binding and with genomic marks of transcriptional activity such as POLII and H3K9AC as well as open chromatic regions as indicated by high DNase I signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Indeed, genome-wide correlations between ZEB1 and POLII ChIP-seq read counts were high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, we also analyzed the overlap between ZEB1, AP1, and C/EBPβ in the human HepG2 as well as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) (data from ENCODE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>]). We observed consistent enrichment of C/EBPβ, JUN, and FOSL (AP1 complex members) around ZEB1 peak summits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>), providing support for a conserved molecular relationship between these TFs in mediating DNA binding.</p><p>To test whether the observed genomic co-localization of ZEB1, C/EBPβ, and AP1 factors relies on physical interactions, we assayed ZEB1 interaction partners in 3T3-L1 cells by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gubelmann et al., 2014</xref>]). We first verified that we could recover the ZEB1 protein as well as its known interaction partners such as CtBP1/2 and HDAC1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gheldof et al., 2012</xref>). The presence of these four known partners among the 89 stringently selected (‘Materials and methods’) and reproducibly pulled down proteins confirmed the validity of our approach. Importantly, we also detected C/EBPβ at similar stringency and additionally, RUNX2, NFIX, and AP1-family members ATF2 and ATF7-specific peptides in one of the replicate experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These data suggest that, in 3T3-L1 cells, ZEB1 is located within the same protein complex as at least one of the major regulators of adipogenic gene expression (C/EBPβ) and potentially also cooperates with other adipogenic TFs such as ATF2 or ATF7 to mediate transcription.</p><p>To further assess the functional relationship between ZEB1 and C/EBPβ binding, we performed ZEB1 ChIP experiments after stable C/EBPβ knockdown in 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), testing 10 ZEB1-C/EBPβ co-bound regions, six ZEB1-only regions, and six negative control regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1I</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gubelmann et al., 2014</xref>]) based on our ZEB1 and publicly available C/EBPβ ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Siersbæk et al., 2011</xref>). We first validated these C/EBPβ-bound regions by performing C/EBPβ ChIP-qPCR in our (control) 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We found that C/EBPβ was almost invariably enriched at ZEB1-bound regions, even at regions (five out of six) that did not show C/EBPβ enrichment in the publicly available ChIP-seq data and that were thus presumed to be bound by ZEB1 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, the genomic co-localization of the two proteins may be even more widespread than originally appreciated, strengthening their functional relationship. In stable C/EBPβ knockdown cells, we observed a decrease of both C/EBPβ and ZEB1 DNA binding at the majority of the tested regions with the exception of the single ZEB1-only bound region, suggesting that ZEB1 DNA-binding is dependent on C/EBPβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, when we measured <italic>Zeb1</italic> mRNA levels in the C/EBPβ KD cells, we observed a two-fold decrease compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This result implies that C/EBPβ mediates <italic>Zeb1</italic> expression, which is substantiated by the fact that C/EBPβ directly targets the <italic>Zeb1</italic> gene in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Thus, at this point, we cannot exclude that the observed decrease in ZEB1 DNA binding in C/EBPβ KD cells may in part be a consequence of decreased cellular ZEB1 levels. Further experiments will be required to examine putative DNA binding cooperativity effects between these two TFs.</p><p>Collectively, these observations demonstrate that in committed pre-adipocytes, ZEB1 is bound to open/active regulatory regions already before the onset of adipogenesis. Many of these regions are targeted by first-wave adipogenic TFs such as C/EBPβ and AP1-family members, implying a functional relationship between these TFs and, given the provided evidence, especially between ZEB1 and C/EBPβ in early adipogenic regulatory events.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ZEB1 DNA binding is dynamic at adipogenic genes</title><p>To better understand the dynamic regulatory properties of ZEB1, we profiled its DNA binding during 3T3-L1 fat cell differentiation by including days −2, 2, and 4 in addition to day 0.

To further assess the functional impact of ZEB1 depletion on these late- vs. early-only bound genes, we integrated the expression data into our analyses (‘Materials and methods’). The most notable observation was that a large fraction of late-only genes (here defined as genes that contain at least one late-only bound region but no early-only one) are down-regulated upon ZEB1 KD, with almost a quarter of them being significantly lower expressed at differentiation day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>), corresponding to an almost three-fold enrichment compared to statically bound genes (p ≤ 10<sup>–12</sup>, Fisher's exact test). Collectively, these results are consistent with the observation that an important fraction of genes that are induced during adipogenesis show increased proximal ZEB1 binding after addition of the differentiation cocktail.</p><p>We conclude that ZEB1 DNA binding is largely static during adipogenesis and given the strong overlap with DNase I hypersensitive sites may therefore contribute to establishing the regulatory landscape in pre- and mature adipocytes. Nevertheless, a subset of ZEB1 target sites is clearly dynamically bound. Genes that acquire ZEB1 binding after day 0 tend to be also bound by C/EBPβ, up-regulated after differentiation induction, particularly sensitive to alternation of nuclear ZEB1 levels and overall enriched for adipogenic functions. This suggests that ZEB1 may be involved in mediating the regulatory switch in primed pre-adipocytes toward the terminal differentiation program.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ZEB1: a core component of the adipogenic GRN</title><p>To gain a complete overview of all levels at which ZEB1 regulates adipogenesis, we specifically focused on the aGRN that we manually assembled and curated based on recent reviews as well as Wikipathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siersbæk et al., 2012</xref>).

We thus performed a more systematic survey of the extent of ZEB1 binding to genes previously involved in adipogenic commitment, as defined by (1) a specific 3T3 pre-adipocyte expression signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>) and (2) pre-adipocyte factors found to be regulated at the expression level (recently compiled in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cawthorn et al., 2012</xref>). We found that the expression of about half (48%) of these genes significantly changes after ZEB1 KD in 3T3-L1 cells, with a striking majority (87%) of them being down-regulated. We note that this includes both transcriptional regulators such as the above-mentioned ZFP423, ligands such as WNT6 and membrane receptors such as PDGFRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and that the majority of their encoding loci are directly targeted by ZEB1 in un-induced pre-adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Given ZEB1's involvement in mediating the expression of early adipogenic commitment factors, we next tested whether ZEB1 also regulates adipogenesis in uncommitted precursors such as the C3H10T1/2 MSCs.

Conversely, ZEB1 KD almost halved the formation of mature fat cells in the transplanted pad compared to the negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, ZEB1 is also highly important for adipogenesis in vivo. To assess whether the observed ZEB1 overexpression or KD effects could be linked to proliferation changes of adipocyte precursor cells, we quantified the nuclei from the implant sections (‘Materials and methods’). We did not observe any change in proliferation in the ZEB1 KD and overexpression samples compared to the respective controls, although ZEB1 KD tended to yield more variable data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results suggest that the observed effect of ZEB1 on adipogenesis does not involve major changes in the extent of cell proliferation capacity, although more in-depth molecular studies will be required to substantiate these findings.</p><p>Having demonstrated ZEB1's importance in mouse adipose biology, we asked whether its highly conserved ortholog would exert a similar function in humans.

To investigate this, we used subcutaneous fat biopsies from a previously sampled cohort of 62 obese patients (41 females and 21 males) with body mass indices (BMI) of 31–64 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meissburger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Winkler et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, we determined <italic>Zeb1</italic> mRNA expression in the SVF from each patient's fat sample.

Interestingly, we found strong positive correlations (Spearman's ρ ≥ 0.40, p ≤ 0.03) with adipocyte differentiation, total fat mass, as well as adiponectin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1H</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gubelmann et al., 2014</xref>]).

These range from classical phenotype- and ‘guilt by association’-driven studies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tang and Lane, 2012</xref>), over enrichment analyses in adipogenic compared to non-adipogenic clonal lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), to chromatin state-based inference of key regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mikkelsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Waki et al., 2011</xref>). Of late, more large-scale studies have started to emerge in both mouse and human systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Villanueva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Söhle et al., 2012</xref>). Our study differs from these high-throughput screening approaches in that we set out to systematically identify novel transcriptional regulators of adipogenesis through an overexpression screen of TFs in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. This was made possible due to the recent generation of a comprehensive library of mouse TF ORF clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gubelmann et al., 2013</xref>), which allowed us to explore the completeness of the so-far assembled aGRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tang and Lane, 2012</xref>]).</p><p>We were able to identify several TFs having strong reproducible effects on fat cell differentiation. The majority of these have so far either never or only indirectly been linked to adipogenesis. For example, the only available information for the second ranking regulator ZFP30 is that it belongs to the family of KRAB zinc finger proteins, typically repressors with important roles in vertebrate development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Urrutia, 2003</xref>). Other examples include MSX1 and ATOH8, which have been associated with differentiation processes in mesenchymal lineages but to our knowledge never with adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jimenez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rawnsley et al., 2013</xref>). More generally, the identification of several novel adipogenic TFs suggests that, besides the well-characterized TF cascade including the C/EBP family of TFs and the canonical master regulator PPARγ, a substantial number of yet unconnected TFs also contribute to the adipogenic phenotype. This underscores the value of our screen, which provides a comprehensive resource that will accelerate the complete characterization of the core GRN underlying fat cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>ZEB1 emerges as a central component of the aGRN</title><p>The TF with the strongest effect on fat cell differentiation in our screen was ZEB1. This protein (also known as δEF1, TCF8, NIL2-a, BZP, AREB6, MEB1, ZFHX1a, and ZFHEP) is a highly conserved and versatile TF that was originally identified as a repressor of the lens-specific δ1-crystalline enhancer in chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Funahashi et al., 1991</xref>). It has subsequently been shown to be involved in a broad range of regulatory processes, including EMT, tumor metastasis, development, and differentiation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gheldof et al., 2012</xref>), providing a rationale as to why homozygous <italic>Zeb1</italic> null mice are not viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Higashi et al., 1997</xref>). Similar to the majority of the other TFs identified in our screen, little is known about the involvement of ZEB1 in fat cell differentiation. One report linked a ZEB1 gain-of-function mutation to increased adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kurima et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with our findings; another found that female mice that are heterozygous for a targeted deletion of exon 1 of <italic>Zeb1</italic> show increased adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saykally et al., 2009</xref>), thus identifying ZEB1 as a repressor of adipogenesis. However, the latter study also reported that ZEB1 expression in parametrial fat increases as fat accumulates, in line with the results presented here. We therefore suspect that the phenotype observed in the studied ZEB1 haploinsufficient mice may not be related to adipocyte hyperplasia, but rather to hypertrophy, another well-established means of adipose tissue expansion. Thus, our findings consolidate and explain ZEB1's involvement in adipogenesis.</p><p>Indeed, (1) the large effects that reduction of ZEB1 levels has on the adipogenic phenotype and on the expression of both early (e.g. including ZFP423, TCF7L1 and EVI1) and late (e.g. PPARγ, C/EBPα, KLF15) members of the aGRN, (2) the fact that many of these TFs are also directly targeted by ZEB1, and (3) the fact that ZEB1 operates at the crossroads of several pathways underlying adipogenesis collectively indicate that this TF is an integral part of the molecular identity of pre-adipocytes. This is further supported by earlier observations revealing that <italic>Zeb1</italic> is expressed at high levels in adipose stem cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kupershmidt et al., 2010</xref>), that it is significantly expressed higher in pre-adipocytes compared to adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kapushesky et al., 2012</xref>), and that it is one of relatively few genes that is highly up-regulated during transition of mouse embryonic stem cells to adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billon et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we found that many of the newly identified TFs such as ZFP30, MSX1, and ATOH8 are also highly expressed in pre-adipocytes. In addition, they are all direct targets of ZEB1 and their expression is affected by ZEB1 KD, suggesting that they may also have a role in early adipogenesis. The identification of several, putatively novel early adipogenic regulators likely reflects the nature of our experimental set-up, which employs early induction of TF overexpression before the cells undergo terminal differentiation. The ability to detect such early regulators is valuable, because the uncharted gene regulatory territory is especially confined to early processes rather than late ones for adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To provide a mechanistic understanding of how ZEB1 mediates adipogenesis and to further characterize its regulatory mode of action, we assessed genome-wide gene expression differences after ZEB1 KD at days 0 and 2 of fat cell differentiation. In addition, we performed ZEB1 ChIP-seq at distinct time points during adipogenesis, providing a first glance into the dynamic DNA binding properties of ZEB1 in any biological system. We found that ZEB1 DNA binding is widespread, to an extent similar to that of other essential regulators such as C/EBPβ, PU.1, or MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Siersbæk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nie et al., 2012</xref>), preferentially promoter-proximal and largely static, consistent with its relatively stable expression profile during terminal fat cell differentiation. In terms of sequence specificity, we found that ZEB1-bound regions were not only enriched for E-boxes (in particular ‘CACCTG’) as previously described, but also for a large number of DNA binding motifs of established adipogenic regulators, including C/EBPβ, AP1, and NFI factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Waki et al., 2011</xref>). Together with its strong overlap with DNase hypersensitive sites, these results suggest that ZEB1 contributes to establishing the regulatory landscape in pre- adipocytes as well as mature adipocytes.</p><p>Nevertheless, we found that a subset of ZEB1 target regions is dynamically bound. Genes that acquire ZEB1 binding upon differentiation induction tend to be co-bound by C/EBPβ, transcriptionally up-regulated, and enriched for adipogenic functions. These data suggest that ZEB1 may be involved in mediating the regulatory switch in primed pre-adipocytes toward the terminal differentiation program. Interestingly, a comparable mechanism has been uncovered in vascular smooth muscle cells, where ZEB1 has been shown to interact with SMAD3 and to synergistically activate the transcription of key differentiation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nishimura et al., 2006</xref>). In the context of adipocytes, we propose that ZEB1 forms a complex with C/EBPβ, as supported by our mass spectrometry data, and that these two TFs cooperate to control adipogenic gene expression. In contrast, we found that early-only bound regions were enriched for motifs of the osteogenic master regulator RUNX2, raising the possibility that ZEB1 may bind to osteogenic regulatory regions (likely in a repressive context), and may thus be involved in the bone-fat switch. This is consistent with ZEB1's previous implication in differentiation of various mesenchymal lineages, including osteogenesis, myogenesis, and chondrogenesis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gheldof et al., 2012</xref>]).</p><p>Importantly, murine ZEB1 shows strong conservation to its human ortholog and its gene was located within one of the top 16 regions of association in a recently performed meta-analysis of 32 body fat distribution genome-wide association studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heid et al., 2010</xref>), consistent with an earlier report indicating a putative link between genomic variation in the <italic>ZEB1</italic> locus and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hager et al., 1998</xref>). Our data from obese patients underscore this importance. Specifically, we found that <italic>ZEB1</italic> levels in the SVF correlate with differentiation potential, total fat mass, and circulating adiponectin levels. It is well accepted that adipocyte hyperplasia in obesity can lead to an increased fat cell number with smaller more insulin sensitive adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tilg and Moschen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roberts et al., 2009</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were in agreement that the work was exciting and potentially of interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, several major issues were identified that need to be addressed in order to strengthen the conclusions drawn. These issues are summarized below:</p><p>1) Clarification regarding the screening system. Under standard conditions, close to all 3T3-L1 cells typically differentiate. That suggests that the setup used for the transcription factor screen somehow affects the differentiation capacity of the control cells, which allows one to identify factors that result in an increase in the differentiation capacity. This is supported by the relatively low degree of differentiation of the control cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> compared to control cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. This should be clarified in the manuscript. Microscopic pictures of the differentiation capacity of control cells would be valuable for evaluation of the degree of differentiation. Also, based on the Western blotting in S1c, it isn't clear what is being overexpressed. Why are there so many HA-tagged products of such varying sizes?</p><p>2) Effect of ZEB1 knockdown on ZEB1 promoter occupancy. The ChIP-seq for Zeb1 should have a knockdown control. There are a large number of weak peaks, most of which seem not to have the ZEB1 motif. How many of these peaks are still present in the absence of ZEB1?</p><p>3) Relationship of ZEB1 and C/EBPb. The authors convincingly show that ZEB1 binds to many chromatin regions together with C/EBPβ and this factor also associates with ZEB1 in a co-IP experiment indicating that these factors cooperate on chromatin. This conclusion would be strengthened if it could be demonstrated that C/EBPβ binding to chromatin is affected by ZEB1 knockdown and vice versa.</p><p>4) Better correlation between gene expression and promoter occupancy. The correlation between ChIP-seq data and gene expression profiles is well documented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and supplemental information). However, it would be informative if the RNA-seq data upon ZEB1 knock down were included here to make it clear whether genes associated with early, late, or static ZEB1 binding are in fact affected by ZEB1 knock down. The data is already used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, so it should be straightforward to analyze the effect of knock down on the expression of putative direct ZEB1 target genes identified by ChIP-seq.</p><p>5) Additional data for the in vivo studies. For the in vivo differentiation of implanted precursor cells, it would be relevant to know whether ZEB1 knockdown affects proliferation of precursor cells, their commitment or just their maturation to adipocytes. Also, data on gene expression would be informative.</p><p>6) Clarification of the human data. The human data in Figure 7 is somewhat at odds with prior results. Is adiponectin positively correlated with body weight in these samples? It looks like it might be, which is not generally how those two variables interact.</p><p>7) Claims regarding commitment are premature. A weak point in the manuscript is the data on the importance of ZEB1 for commitment of MSCs to the adipocyte lineage. Although the authors provide evidence that ZEB1 is required for terminal differentiation of MSCs (i.e. C3H10T1/2 cells), it is not clear if this is because ZEB1 is required for the commitment step. The analysis of expression of Zfp423 and Zfp521 upon ZEB1 knock down is not convincing in itself. If the authors want to claim that ZEB1 also regulates commitment, this should be more thoroughly evaluated experimentally. Note, the editor believes that this question is better suited for a future manuscript and strongly suggests that the authors simply soften their conclusions regarding a role in commitment in the present paper. Alternatively, if the authors wish to make this claim, additional studies would be required. Some of the questions that could be addressed include: (1) can over expression of ZEB1 substitute for BMP-2/4 signaling to commit C3H10T1/2 cells to the adipocyte lineage?; (2) does overexpression of ZEB1 decrease the potential of C3H10T1/2 cells to develop into other cell lineages?; (3) is transient overexpression or knock down during commitment enough to enhance or decrease, respectively, differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells?; or (4) is overexpression or knock down only during terminal differentiation of C3H10T1/2 enough to enhance or inhibit differentiation, respectively?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03346.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Clarification regarding the screening system.

We implemented this protocol because we were specifically interested in identifying transcription factors that enhance adipogenesis. If rosiglitazone had been used, then the margin to see this effect would have been very low since PPAR activators such as rosiglitazone yield close to complete differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (e.g. Chawla and Lazar, PNAS, 1994). With our protocol, the average differentiation of cells was close to 50%, leaving ample room for observing enhancing effects. To be completely clear, but considering the fact that the method has already been described several times in the literature (e.g. Meissburger et al. EMBO Mol Med, 2011; Trajovski &amp; Stoffel, Nat Cell Biol, 2012), we included microscopic images of our differentiation screen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1A</xref>. If it is deemed necessary, these images can also be included in the supplementary material of the manuscript<italic>.</italic><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Microscopic images of BODIPY (lipids, in green) and Hoechst (nuclei, in red)-stained 3T3-L1 cells transduced with control, ZEB1 and PPARG overexpression constructs.

Here, the differentiation difference results from the fact that panel 1C involves stable cell lines whereas panel 1D involves non-selected cells. We have consistently observed a lower differentiation capacity of stable cell lines compared to cells that are only transiently transduced. The differentiation enhancement (or lack thereof) needs therefore to be evaluated as compared to the stably or transiently transduced controls respectively. As suggested by the reviewers, we have added microscopic images of the cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref> in two new figures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2 fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 2 and 3</xref> of the revised manuscript and have indicated this in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend.</p><p>Regarding the Western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref>, several overexpressed TFs yielded indeed multiple HA-tagged products. This is especially the case for ZEB1. However, similar ZEB1 band profiles were also observed in other studies using different endogenous antibodies (Chang et al., Nat Cell Biol, 2001; Gregory et al., Nature Cell Biology, 2008; Wellner et al., Nat Cell Biology, 2009; Masin et al., <italic>Cancer</italic> and Metabolism, 2014). We therefore suspect that these bands reflect cryptic translation or specific protein degradation products given that they stem from the same open-reading frame construct and that they are all tagged by HA. To clarify this, we have added a statement to the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref> legend.</p><p><italic>2) Effect of ZEB1 knockdown on ZEB1 promoter occupancy. The ChIP-seq for Zeb1 should have a knockdown control. There are a large number of weak peaks, most of which seem not to have the ZEB1 motif. How many of these peaks are still present in the absence of ZEB1?</italic></p><p>We already indicated in the original manuscript (Material and methods, Lentiviral production and stable cell lines) that despite extensive efforts, we were unable to derive a stable ZEB1 knockdown 3T3-L1 cell line. This issue renders the negative control experiment suggested by the reviewers rather difficult because of the intrinsic cellular heterogeneity that arises upon transient knockdown. We thus decided to validate our ZEB1 ChIP-seq data by performing a ChIP on HA-tagged ZEB1 in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells using a HA-specific antibody to provide the requested assessment of the specificity of the ZEB1 antibody. While overexpression may increase the number of binding events, we would expect the majority of endogenous ZEB1 binding sites to overlap with those detected using ZEB1-HA ChIP. Indeed, we found that ZEB1 replicate experiments versus ZEB1-HA before differentiation showed high correlation of read counts with Spearman’s rho = 0.83 and 0.86, in the range of what is typically observed for replicate ChIP-seq experiments (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). A clarifying statement was added in the Results section of the revised manuscript).</p><p>In addition, we included in the revised manuscript the ChIP-qPCR results of 12 positive and three negative regions that we had previously used to validate the ZEB1 ChIP-seq libraries. Ten of these 12 positive regions were enriched compared to the negative regions further validating the robustness of the ZEB1 ChIP-seq data (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref> and the respective qPCR primers were added to the revised Supplementary file 9).</p><p><italic>3) Relationship of ZEB1 and C/EBPb. The authors convincingly show that ZEB1 binds to many chromatin regions together with C/EBPβ and this factor also associates with ZEB1 in a co-IP experiment indicating that these factors cooperate on chromatin. This conclusion would be strengthened if it could be demonstrated that C/EBPβ binding to chromatin is affected by ZEB1 knockdown and vice versa</italic>.</p><p>As indicated above, we were unable to derive stable ZEB1 knockdown cells, which makes performing ChIP experiments difficult. We therefore set out to analyze the binding behavior of ZEB1 in stable C/EBPβ knockdown 3T3-L1 cells (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2A</xref>). We selected 10 genomic regions bound by both C/EBPβ and ZEB1 as well as six regions bound by ZEB1 only, using publicly available C/EBPβ ChIP-seq data (Siersbaeck et al., EMBO J, 2011). First, we validated these regions by performing C/EBPβ ChIP-qPCR in control 3T3-L1 cells (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2B</xref>), allowing us to uncover that C/EBPβ binding is more prevalent than so far appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Siersbaeck et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Steger et al., 2010</xref>) given that we found that most tested “ZEB1-only” regions (five out of six) are nevertheless bound by C/EBPβ. These results already strengthen the regulatory relationship between ZEB1 and C/EBPβ. We then targeted nine regions that we experimentally determined were bound by both C/EBPβ and ZEB1 as well as the sole ZEB1-only bound region to determine the ZEB1 DNA binding enrichment at these regions in stable C/EBPβ knockdown versus control cells using ZEB1 ChIP-qPCR. We found that ZEB1 DNA binding is decreased to various degrees at all tested regions compared to control knockdown cells, whereas this was not observed at the control site bound by ZEB1 only (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2C</xref>). These results suggest that the binding behavior of ZEB1 is influenced by C/EBPβ, although we cannot exclude at this point that the observed decrease in ZEB1 DNA binding in C/EBPβ knockdown cells may stem from a decrease in overall ZEB1 protein levels. Indeed, further analyses revealed that the knockdown of C/EBPβ in 3T3-L1 cells decreases ZEB1 gene expression, as assessed by qPCR (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2D</xref>). This result implies that C/EBPβ mediates <italic>Zeb1</italic> expression, which is substantiated by the fact that C/EBPβ appears to target the <italic>Zeb1</italic> gene in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2E</xref>). Thus, the decreased DNA binding of ZEB1 in C/EBPβ-knockdown cells may also be a consequence of overall decreased ZEB1 levels (even though this was not reflected at the negative control site 10).</p><p>Taken together, although further experiments will be required to examine putative DNA binding cooperativity effects between ZEB1 and C/EBPβ, our data clearly demonstrate that ZEB1-C/EBPβ site co-occupancy is even more abundant than previously anticipated and that C/EBPβ may regulate ZEB1 expression, providing further support of the important regulatory relationship between ZEB1 and C/EBPβ. We have added these results to the revised manuscript as a new paragraph in the section “ZEB1 co-binds adipogenic regulatory regions with established early regulators such as C/EBPβ”<bold>,</bold> as well as in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Better correlation between gene expression and promoter occupancy. The correlation between ChIP-seq data and gene expression profiles is well documented (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>and supplemental information). However, it would be informative if the RNA-seq data upon ZEB1 knock down were included here to make it clear whether genes associated with early, late, or static ZEB1 binding are in fact affected by ZEB1 knock down. The data is already used in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, so it should be straightforward to analyze the effect of knock down on the expression of putative direct ZEB1 target genes identified by ChIP-seq</italic>.</p><p>As per the reviewers’ suggestion, we have now integrated the RNA-seq data upon ZEB1 knockdown with the dynamic ZEB1 binding data, specifically adding the text below to the section “ZEB1 DNA-binding is dynamic at adipogenic genes” of the revised manuscript as well as revised panels <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1G</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) Additional data for the in vivo studies. For the in vivo differentiation of implanted precursor cells, it would be relevant to know whether ZEB1 knockdown affects proliferation of precursor cells, their commitment or just their maturation to adipocytes. Also, data on gene expression would be informative</italic>.</p><p>For the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, we were unfortunately unable to recover data on gene expression as the adipose tissues were fixed in paraformaldehyde and embedded with paraffin for H&amp;E staining. However, as this specific method has been validated extensively (see e.g. Meissburger et al. EMBO Mol Med, 2011), we are confident that, consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data, the effect observed here clearly demonstrates that ZEB1 is an important regulator of adipogenesis.</p><p>However, based on our image analyses, we were able to address the question whether ZEB1 modulation affects cell proliferation, which is a major determinant for adipogenesis. Specifically, we quantified the nuclei from the implant sections and did not observe any change in proliferation in the ZEB1 knockdown or overexpression samples compared to the respective controls, although ZEB1 knockdown tended to yield more variable results (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results suggest that the observed effect of ZEB1 on adipogenesis does not involve major changes in the degree of cell proliferation capacity. We have added this result to the “ZEB1 is an important regulator of in vivo adipogenesis” Results section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Finally, we think that addressing the question whether commitment or maturation is affected is still beyond the current state of the art. This is mainly due to the fact that so far no bona fide marker exists to differentiate between cells that can commit to the adipocyte lineage versus committed adipoblasts capable of maturating into an adipocyte.</p><p><italic>6) Clarification of the human data. The human data in Figure 7 is somewhat at odds with prior results. Is adiponectin positively correlated with body weight in these samples? It looks like it might be, which is not generally how those two variables interact</italic>.</p><p>While we acknowledge that the correlations presented here might suggest a positive correlation between adiponectin and body weight, this is in fact not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1B</xref>). It has to be mentioned that the correlation of adiponectin with body weight is seen when comparing lean versus obese individuals. The cohort that we employed in this study consists entirely of obese individuals with a BMI of &gt;35. Thus, no correlation between adiponectin and body weight was necessarily expected and none was indeed observed.</p><p><italic>7) Claims regarding commitment are premature. A weak point in the manuscript is the data on the importance of ZEB1 for commitment of MSCs to the adipocyte lineage. Although the authors provide evidence that ZEB1 is required for terminal differentiation of MSCs (i.e. C3H10T1/2 cells), it is not clear if this is because ZEB1 is required for the commitment step. The analysis of expression of Zfp423 and Zfp521 upon ZEB1 knock down is not convincing in itself. If the authors want to claim that ZEB1 also regulates commitment, this should be more thoroughly evaluated experimentally. Note, the editor believes that this question is better suited for a future manuscript and strongly suggests that the authors simply soften their conclusions regarding a role in commitment in the present paper. Alternatively, if the authors wish to make this claim, additional studies would be required. Some of the questions that could be addressed include: (1) can over expression of ZEB1 substitute for BMP-2/4 signaling to commit C3H10T1/2 cells to the adipocyte lineage?; (2) does overexpression of ZEB1 decrease the potential of C3H10T1/2 cells to develop into other cell lineages?; (3) is transient overexpression or knock down during commitment enough to enhance or decrease, respectively, differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells?; or (4) is overexpression or knock down only during terminal differentiation of C3H10T1/2 enough to enhance or inhibit differentiation, respectively?</italic></p><p>We acknowledge that our current C3H10T1/2 experiments, while highly suggestive, may not be sufficient to conclusively demonstrate ZEB1’s involvement in adipogenic commitment. We therefore have decided to take the editor’s advice and to pursue this question in a follow-up study. In the current manuscript, we now present ZEB1’s intriguing, positive regulatory effect on adipogenic commitment factors and on C3H10T1/2 adipogenesis in the context of the adipogenic regulatory network. To this end, we have restructured the last two figures, in what we think is a concise and conceptually cohesive way of presenting the mesenchymal stem cell results. Additionally, we have removed “determination” from the Abstract and it now reads “identifying ZEB1 as a central transcriptional component of fat cell differentiation”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
