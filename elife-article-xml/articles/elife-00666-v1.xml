formin-family protein Diaphanous (Dia). Apical localization and activity of Dia are at the core of restricting F-actin formation to the correct membrane domain. Here we identify the mechanisms that target Dia to the apical surface. PI(4,5)P2 levels at the apical membrane regulate Dia localization in both the MDCK cyst model and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tubular epithelia. An N-terminal basic domain of Dia is crucial for apical localization, implying direct binding to PI(4,5)P2. Dia apical targeting also depends on binding to Rho1, which is critical for activation-induced conformational change, as well as physically anchoring Dia to the apical membrane. We demonstrate that binding to Rho1 facilitates interaction with PI(4,5)P2 at the plane of the membrane. Together these cues ensure efficient and distinct restriction of Dia to the apical membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00666.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00666.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00666.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many physiological processes are directional, which means that tissues and organs often need a sense of spatial orientation in order to function properly. In most tissues, this sense of direction relies on certain proteins and infrastructure components of the cell being located in specific subcellular regions, rather than being distributed in a more symmetrical fashion throughout the cell: the latter phenomenon is known as cell polarity.</p><p>Exocrine tissues (that is, glands) are composed of tubular epithelial cells organized around a central lumen: the cells in the gland secrete various products (such as enzymes) into the lumen, so that they can be carried to the target organ elsewhere in the body. Epithelial cells in these tissues are therefore polarized to enable directional transport to the lumen. An example of cell polarity is a network of actin filaments that lines the apical surface of these cells (the surface nearest the common lumen). This actin network helps to shuttle cargo to the lumen by assisting with directional, coordinated secretion, among other processes.</p><p>In fruitflies, the construction of the apical actin network depends on the presence of a protein called Diaphanous. However, the signals that lead to the localization of this protein near the apical membrane of the cells are not well understood. Now Rousso et al. report that a modified lipid, called PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, is involved in this localization. However, they also show that this lipid does not govern the apical localization of Diaphanous on its own: rather, an enzyme called Rho1 must also be present to assist with the localization of Diaphanous and to ensure that actin is deposited in the correct place. Rousso et al. also demonstrate that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-mediated localization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Diaphanous occurs in mammalian cells. Lipid-protein collaboration also targets other proteins to the apical membrane. A common mechanism may therefore underlie cell polarity in tubular organ tissues in flies and mammals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00666.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00666.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Diaphanous</kwd><kwd>formin</kwd><kwd>tubular epithelia</kwd><kwd>apical localization</kwd><kwd>PI(4,5)P2</kwd><kwd>Rho1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>US-Israel Binational Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2009186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mostov</surname><given-names>Keith E</given-names></name><name><surname>Schejter</surname><given-names>Eyal D</given-names></name><name><surname>Shilo</surname><given-names>Ben-Zion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK074398, DK091530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mostov</surname><given-names>Keith E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CJ Martin Fellowship, National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shewan</surname><given-names>Annette M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schoenheimer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shilo</surname><given-names>Ben-Zion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Synergistic interactions with PI(4,5)P2 and activated Rho1, which are enriched at the apical membrane of tubular organs, facilitate tight apical targeting of the formin Diaphanous.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelial cells that comprise tubular organs are highly polarized, a feature that enables them to execute functions such as vectorial secretion and absorption of nutrients. Polarization is apparent in the distinct composition of membrane domains: the apical membrane—the surface facing the lumen, the basal membrane, which contacts the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM), and the lateral surfaces, which contain specialized cellular junctions that adhere adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bryant and Mostov, 2008</xref>). The generation and maintenance of cell polarity is achieved by domain-specific proteins and lipids, which support the unique organization and function of each region. Among these, asymmetric distribution of phosphoinositides has been shown to be crucial for membrane identity and lumen formation in tubular systems. PI(4,5)P2 in the apical surface and PI(3,4,5)P3 in the basal membrane have been shown to tether specific polarity and cytoskeleton related proteins, which define their respective domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin-Belmonte and Mostov, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Cytoskeletal structures play key guidance roles underlying maintenance of epithelial cell polarity. They perform these functions by serving as membrane scaffolds, supporting adhesion, and enabling vesicle transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nance and Zallen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tepass, 2012</xref>). One such structure, which is a common feature of tubular tissues, is a network of actin microfilaments lining the apical surface of the tube cells. In a previous study we found that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tubular organs, this network mediates myosinV based transport of vesicles, promoting their secretion from the apical surface into the tube lumen. The actin-nucleator responsible for generating these structures was shown to be the formin-family protein Diaphanous (Dia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massarwa et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Apical restriction of Dia activity in this context is the consequence of tight apical localization of the Dia protein, which was shown to be a common feature of all epithelial cells generating the different <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic tubular organs. Thus, apical targeting of Dia is at the core of a cellular mechanism generating actin cables that emanate from the apical membrane, and enable apical secretion. While the delivery of apical and baso-lateral transmembrane proteins through specialized routes of the secretory pathway has been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weisz and Rodriguez-Boulan, 2009</xref>), much less is known about the targeting of cytoplasmic proteins such as Dia to distinct membrane domains.</p><p>Dia belongs to the formin family of actin nucleators, which regulate the formation of linear actin cables. The Dia-related formins (DRFs) can be functionally divided into two major domains, each encompassing roughly one half of the protein sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goode and Eck, 2007</xref>). The C-terminal portion of DRFs regulates actin polymer assembly by mediating microfilament nucleation, elongation and processive capping. Key functional sub-domains include the FH2 domain, which acts as a dimer, and moves processively with the growing barbed end, and the FH1 domain, which together with profilin acts to accelerate filament elongation by recruiting monomeric actin. The N-terminal portion of DRF nucleators is regulatory, governing the activation state of the molecule through interactions with various effectors. Importantly, this region has been shown to play significant roles in directing DRF localization in vivo (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Higgs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chesarone et al., 2010</xref>). DRFs are autoinhibited due to an intra-molecular interaction between the C-terminal DAD domain and the N-terminal DID domain, which maintains the molecule in a closed conformation. Upon binding of GTP-bound Rho1 to the N-terminal GTPase-binding domain, autoinhibition is relieved, allowing Dia to assume an open, active conformation and promote actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lammers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Otomo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rose et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>DRFs have been shown to play critical roles in the formation of diverse actin-based structures in many cellular contexts, including cytokinesis, cell adhesion, polarized cell growth and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Faix and Grosse, 2006</xref>). Accordingly, Dia-like proteins assume distinct subcellular localizations in a cell type specific manner. To prevent spatially unrestricted actin assembly in cells, localization of DRFs is highly regulated, and involves different factors and mechanisms. For example, the yeast formin Bni1p localizes during budding to the mother cell bud neck, by binding to the polarity factor Spa2, via a mechanism that involves four different localizing domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Targeting of mDia2, a mammalian homologue of Dia, to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis, is achieved by binding to the scaffold protein anillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Watanabe et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Dia is recruited to lamellipodia by the actin regulator Ena/Vasp in a small subset of epidermal cells, during the process of embryonic dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Homem and Peifer, 2009</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> tubular structures, <italic>dia</italic> mRNA is tightly concentrated at the apical side of the cells, by a mechanism that was shown to be distinct from the Dia protein apical targeting mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massarwa et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, targeting of Dia-like proteins is regulated at multiple levels, to assure restriction of activity to the correct cellular domain.</p><p>Here we examine the mechanisms that mediate apical targeting of the Dia protein in tubular organs of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We find that efficient apical targeting of Dia requires the detection of both PI(4,5)P2 and Rho1 on the apical surface. We show, both in a mammalian cell culture model and by genetic manipulations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tubular organs, that PI(4,5)P2 levels regulate Dia localization. An N-terminal basic domain of Dia is critical for this regulation, indicative of an electrostatic-based direct interaction between Dia and PI(4,5)P2. We demonstrate that apical enrichment of PI(4,5)P2 is a common feature of tubular organs in the fly, which can be attributed in part to the apical restriction of the PIP5 kinase (PIP5K) Skittles. We further show that Rho1 facilitates Dia apical targeting, both by inducing the Dia open conformation, thereby exposing N-terminal domains that are critical for localization, as well as by physically anchoring Dia to the apical surface. This anchoring appears to promote the Dia–PI(4,5)P2 interaction, leading to synergistic effects of these two apical cues. We therefore propose that a multi-tiered targeting mechanism, utilizing both global and specific features of tubular organs, achieves a distinct localization pattern of Dia, thereby enabling execution of the cardinal process of apical secretion in these organs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The open conformation of Dia facilitates apical targeting through N-terminal domains</title><p>Endogenous Dia exhibits a highly polarized distribution, accumulating at the apical surface of epithelial cells in diverse tubular tissues of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massarwa et al., 2009</xref>). To dissect and quantitatively assess the structural basis for this polarized distribution, we monitored the localization patterns of different GFP-tagged Dia constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), following tissue-specific expression in several tubular organs. These constructs do not contain the 3′UTR sequences mediating RNA localization, and thus reflect targeting at the protein level.

While expression of this construct in tubular epithelia results in protein levels similar to the full-length form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), GFP-Dia-ΔDAD displays a much tighter apical localization pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>), suggesting that the molecule is now more accessible to apical-targeting signals. Quantification demonstrates that apical enrichment of GFP-Dia-ΔDAD is enhanced up to fourfold relative to GFP-Dia-FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref>). Further measurements in GFP-Dia-ΔDAD expressing cells reveal that ∼45% of the total GFP intensity in the cell is concentrated at the apical surface, which encompasses only ∼5% of the total cell area. When compared with the GFP-Dia-FL expressing cells, a clear shift in the GFP distribution is observed from the cytoplasm to the apical domain. In contrast, a similar degree of localization to the lateral membrane SJ domain is exhibited by both constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, enhanced apical localization of GFP-Dia-ΔDAD appears to result primarily from efficient apical recruitment of its cytoplasmic pool. The intensity differences between the apical and cytoplasmic domains were therefore used in this study as the primary measure for apical enrichment of Dia constructs.</p><p>To identify the domains within Dia that mediate apical localization of the open form, we examined the localization patterns of different reporter constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While these assays focused on the embryonic salivary gland, qualitatively similar observations were made in other tubular organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We initially examined separately the localizing activity of the two halves of the Dia-ΔDAD protein, each of which harbors distinct functional domains. A construct containing only the C-terminal half (GFP-Dia-C′) was distributed within the cytoplasm upon expression in tubular epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, the reciprocal N-terminal construct (GFP-Dia-N′) displayed striking apical enrichment, reminiscent of the localization pattern of the intact GFP-Dia-ΔDAD open molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, quantification of relative fluorescence levels demonstrated strong apical enrichment of GFP-Dia-N′, while no apical bias whatsoever was observed for GFP-Dia-C′ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These observations suggest that the N-terminal half of Dia is both necessary and sufficient for apical targeting.</p><p>Since the Dia protein functions as a dimer, one concern is that the localization of the tested constructs will be influenced by dimerization to the endogenous, full-length protein. However, when the dimerization domain (DD) was added to the Dia-C′ construct (GFP-Dia-DD-C′), no apical localization was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), demonstrating that apical localization of Dia constructs is not biased by dimerization to endogenous Dia.</p><p>Taken together, this structure–function analysis supports a model whereby the open conformation of Dia facilitates efficient apical localization by exposing critical domains to targeting cues.

The rapid shift in GFP-Dia-ΔDAD localization preceded the general shift in polarity induced by exogenous PI(4,5)P2 treatment in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007</xref>). This can be readily appreciated by the partial basolateral localization of the apical membrane marker gp-135, which no longer co-localized with GFP-Dia-ΔDAD following treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). The rapid nature of Dia re-localization suggests that recruitment to the baso-lateral membranes is a direct result of exogenous PI(4,5)P2 treatment.

Supporting this notion is the observation that a mutated form of PIP5-kinase, containing an inactive kinase domain, fails to localize to the same membrane domain as the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fairn et al., 2009</xref>), demonstrating that continuous PI(4,5)P2 generation is required to enhance the localization bias of PIP5-kinases.

We assume that the excess of Sktl-KID molecules may sequester endogenous levels of PI(4,5)P2 at the apical membrane, compromising localization of Sktl and other PI(4,5)P2-binding proteins, and leading to a disrupted morphology of tubular epithelia (not shown).</p><p>Taken together, these observations are consistent with a scenario where apically-biased Sktl generates PI(4,5)P2 at the apical membrane of tubular organs.

Dia binding to Rho1-GTP generates an initial apical bias, and promotes PI(4,5)P2 binding via exposure of the N-terminal region and enrichment near the apical membrane. The Dia- PI(4,5)P2 interaction further stabilizes apical membrane association. Dia can shift dynamically between three states, being bound to each of the apical cues alone, or to both simultaneously, increasing the probability for re-binding and therefore the efficiency of apical targeting.

Thus, despite being critical for Dia localization, the basic domain is not sufficient on its own to drive apical targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Direct binding to Rho1 anchors Dia to the apical surface</title><p>The inability of the BD to drive apical targeting on its own, suggested that PI(4,5)P2 may function in combination with additional factors to target Dia apically. The N-terminus of Dia is composed of several distinct domains that can serve as targets for apical recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Prominent among these is the GTPase-binding domain, through which Rho1 binds and activates the actin nucleation and elongation capacities of Dia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Otomo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rose et al., 2005</xref>). An initial indication that Rho1 can serve as an apical recruitment factor for Dia came from examination of Rho1 protein localization. A GFP-Rho1 construct specifically expressed in third instar larval salivary gland cells showed clear enrichment at the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), as did a GFP fusion protein expressed from the endogenous Rho1 promoter (not shown). Apical enrichment of GFP-Rho1 was not altered upon co-expression with a <italic>dia</italic>-RNAi construct, indicating that it is not mediated by Dia protein or by actin structures generated by Dia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the localization pattern of GFP-Dia-N′ following depletion of Rho1. The ability to follow the inherently open Dia-N′ construct, allowed to critically examine the role of Rho1 as a physical anchor for Dia, independent of its role as an activator. GFP-Dia-N′ localization was dramatically altered upon co-expression with a <italic>Rho1</italic>–RNAi construct, and displayed a uniform distribution in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). Furthermore, a similar outcome was obtained following expression of GFP-Dia-N′-mut<sup>G</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), a GFP-Dia-N′ variant, which is mutated at residues that confer Rho1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Otomo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rose et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lammers et al., 2008</xref>). The distribution of GFP-Dia-N′-mut<sup>G</sup> was essentially cytoplasmic upon expression in larval salivary glands, as well as in various embryonic tubular tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that direct interaction with Rho1 mediates Dia targeting. Thus, apically-localized Rho1 functions to physically anchor Dia to the apical surface, in addition to opening the protein. We assume that Rho1 exerts both activities only in the active, GTP-bound form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rose et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that binding to both Rho1 and PI(4,5)P2 contribute to apical targeting of Dia. We next wanted to explore the possible relationship between these two cues. First, Rho1 localization was not altered following different manipulations designed to modify PI(4,5)P2 levels and affect Dia localization, including Sktl over-expression and PTEN depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similarly, when we monitored the PI(4,5)P2 reporter PH-PLCδ-GFP, it remained apically enriched following co-expression with a <italic>Rho1</italic>–RNAi construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that Rho1 does not directly regulate PI(4,5)P2 distribution.</p><p>Second, we analyzed the inter-relationship between the two cues with respect to Dia apical localization. Previous studies of the mDia1–Rho1 interaction showed that the BD is dispensable for the formation of an mDia1–Rho1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Otomo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rose et al., 2005</xref>). Co-expression of GFP-Dia-N′ΔBD with <italic>Rho1</italic>-RNAi or expression of a GFP-Dia-N′ΔBD mut<sup>G</sup> construct resulted in complete loss of apical localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–G</xref>). This indicates that the residual apical localization observed for the GFP-Dia-N′ΔBD construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) can be attributed to Rho1 binding, consistent with the notion of two distinct functional modules for Dia binding. However, the inability of the BD to direct even a mild bias of apical localization on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggests that the Dia–PI(4,5)P2 interaction requires simultaneous binding of an apical cue through an additional domain.</p><p>Finally, quantification of Dia apical enrichment in larval salivary gland cells revealed that the ultimate apical distribution of Dia is strongly affected by the combined influence of both cues. While the capacity to bind PI(4,5)P2 does not promote apical localization in the absence of Rho1, it strongly enhances apical targeting of Dia when Rho1 is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, compare Dia-N′ΔBD with Dia-N′). Similar results were obtained in embryonic salivary glands, where a construct defective in PI(4,5)P2 binding (Dia-N′ΔBD) showed weak apical enrichment (≈2), while a construct defective in Rho1 binding (Dia-N′ΔBD-mut<sup>G</sup>) showed no apical bias whatsoever (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). However, the Dia-N′ construct, in which the binding domains for both cues are intact, displayed apical enrichment values of ≈7, clearly indicative of synergy between Rho1 and PI(4,5)P2 in promoting Dia apical localization. Taken together, we show that a partial apical localization bias of Dia by Rho1 binding is significantly enhanced by binding to PI(4,5)P2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ability to recruit Dia, one of the central nucleators of actin microfilaments, to the cell membrane, is important for its capacity to trigger processes of membrane extension and intracellular trafficking. We focused our study of Dia recruitment on tubular epithelial tissues, where Dia was shown to be specifically localized to the apical membrane. This tight apical localization is critical for the formation of polarized actin tracks, guiding apical movement of secretory vesicles that are associated with MyosinV motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massarwa et al., 2009</xref>). Mechanisms that regulate the apical localization of Dia were examined in distinct tubular organs such as the trachea, salivary glands and hindgut, and at different stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. This experimental flexibility allowed us to utilize the specific advantages of different tissues, and identify features which are universal to all tubular organs. We found that apical recruitment of Dia is mediated by binding to two distinct elements, PI(4,5)P2 and Rho1. Further analysis suggests that synergism between these two partial signals ensures highly efficient apical localization of active Dia.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>PI(4,5)P2-Dia interaction serves as a cue for apical targeting</title><p>The enrichment of PI(4,5)P2 in apical membranes of tubular organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007</xref>) suggested that PI(4,5)P2-binding could serve as a common localization cue for Dia, shared by different tubular organs. Indeed, a reporter for the endogenous levels of PI(4,5)P2 displayed a highly significant apical enrichment in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tubular organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The causal role of PI(4,5)P2 in recruiting Dia was demonstrated in several ways. First, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dia was apically localized in the heterologous MDCK cell culture system, and its localization was shifted basally within minutes of adding PI(4,5)P2 to the basal membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We wish to point out that while in this system Dia localization is regulated by PI(4,5)P2 under both excess and normal conditions, it is currently unknown whether an interaction between Dia and mammalian Rho GTPases also contributes to the apical localization. Second, elevation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tubular organs in the levels of Sktl, a PIP5-kinase that generates PI(4,5)P2, gave rise to a corresponding enhancement in the level of apical Dia. Conversely, knockdown of the <italic>Pten</italic> gene encoding the PI(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase in these tissues resulted in redistribution of PI(4,5)P2, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007</xref>). A corresponding alteration in Dia localization further supports the causal role of PI(4,5)P2 in its localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that generation of PI(4,5)P2 at the apical membrane by Sktl exhibits self-amplifying properties. Over-expression of tagged Sktl resulted in both a massive increase in the levels of apical PI(4,5)P2 (not shown), and accumulation of Sktl at the same domain. In contrast, a Sktl protein that is catalytically inactive was distributed uniformly, when expressed in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We assume that the signal targeting Sktl apically may be limited, and capable of providing only an initial bias. The resulting enrichment of PI(4,5)P2 following the activity of Sktl can lead to the recruitment of additional Sktl molecules and amplify this apical bias.</p><p>The link between phospholipids and localization of formins extends to the plant kingdom. In the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens,</italic> class-II formins bind PI(3,5)P2, leading to their cortical localization, and allowing them to mediate polarized growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van Gisbergen et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, phospholipids are emerging as important regulators of formin localization and activity at the tissue and organismal level.</p><p>The mammalian formins mDia1 and mDia2 bind phospholipids through a basic domain (BD), located at the extreme N-terminus. This BD was shown to regulate both activity and recruitment to membranes in cell culture models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramalingam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gorelik et al., 2011</xref>). Similar to the mammalian homologues, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dia also contains an N-terminal basic domain which is critical for apical localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and is likely to mediate the association with PI(4,5)P2 through electrostatic interactions with the acidic phospholipid. These interactions are known to be weak, and are usually insufficient to stably associate proteins with the membrane under physiological conditions, requiring coupling to additional membrane-targeting motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulgrew-Nesbitt et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, the Dia BD proved insufficient to direct apical targeting on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this respect, Dia differs from plant formins, which commonly contain a structured PTEN domain for phospholipid binding. This domain confers strong and more specific association, and is consequently sufficient for cortical localization, without requirement for additional targeting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van Gisbergen et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Binding to Rho1 activates and anchors Dia to the apical membrane</title><p>Insufficiency of the BD in mediating Dia apical targeting led us to search for additional targeting signals. The constitutively activated, open conformation of Dia was significantly more accessible to apical targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), probably as a result of exposing the N-terminus more readily to apical-targeting factors. Interestingly, even high levels of the open conformation of Dia were efficiently targeted, indicating that the targeting machinery is in relative excess. Normally, the generation of the open Dia conformation is facilitated by binding to Rho1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Otomo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rose et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, for some formin-family proteins, phosphorylation of residues adjacent to the DAD domain by a Rho1 effector, ROCK-1, is an essential element in the activation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takeya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Staus et al., 2011</xref>). It remains to be determined whether ROCK-1 also plays a role in activation of Dia in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tubular organs.</p><p>Rho1 also contributes directly to apical-membrane anchoring of Dia. We were able to deplete Rho1 in larval salivary glands, and observed a complete loss of apical targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The ability to follow localization of an open form of Dia allowed us to separate the roles of Rho1 in Dia activation and localization. The open form of Dia still requires binding to Rho1 for its apical localization, as was shown by elimination of Rho1 and by mutating the Rho1-binding domain of Dia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>There are indications for apical enrichment of Rho1 protein in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tubular organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massarwa et al., 2009</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The distribution of the activated form of Rho1 may be even more apically biased. It appears, however, that Rho1 requires different signals than Dia for its apical localization. Alterations in the PI(4,5)P2 distribution, which resulted in dramatic effects on the localization of Dia, had only a marginal effect on the localization of Rho1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). While Dia localization depends on Rho1, the localization of Rho1 is independent of Dia and the apical actin cables it forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting a hierarchy rather than a reinforcing feedback loop between the two proteins. One possibility is that apical Rho1 localization involves anchoring to Rho-GEFs, the specific guanine-exchange factors that activate Rho1, and were also shown to be enriched in apical membranes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> tubular organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massarwa et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cooperating interactions target Dia apically</title><p>Our results demonstrate that the tight apical localization of Dia is achieved by combining functionally distinct apical-biasing cues. Neither Rho1 nor PI(4,5)P2 is sufficient to efficiently recruit Dia apically on their own. Nevertheless, combining these two relatively weak interactions gives rise to dramatic apical localization of Dia, demonstrating a synergistic contribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The cooperative contribution of multiple domains within the same protein to drive membrane targeting is termed ‘Coincidence detection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lemmon, 2008</xref>). This mechanism for localization of a multidomain protein can be used to generate enhanced targeting specificity. While both Rho1 and PI(4,5)P2 may separately reside in other subcellular domains, Dia will bind with high avidity exclusively to the apical membrane that encompasses both cues.</p><p>The modular nature of these targeting mechanisms allows to examine the contribution of each cue, and the significance of their cooperation in Dia apical restriction. Binding to Rho1 alone was weak but nevertheless detectable. Conversely, binding to PI(4,5)P2 alone was not capable of generating any apical localization bias, despite its marked contribution to apical recruitment in the presence of Rho1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This asymmetry between the two cues suggests a model for the dynamics of Dia-apical targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Binding to activated Rho1 may represent the more prevalent scenario for the initial interaction of Dia with the apical membrane. This interaction will also give rise to an open conformation of Dia, which is more amenable to targeting, and will provide physical proximity to the membrane. Membrane proximity can now allow the interaction of Dia with PI(4,5)P2, which was not favored when the Dia protein was cytoplasmic, due to low affinity restrictions. The Dia-PI(4,5)P2 interaction stabilizes association with the apical membrane, resulting in synergy in the combined action of Rho1 and PI(4,5)P2 in Dia apical localization. Once in the vicinity of the apical membrane, Dia can shift dynamically among three states, being bound to each of the cues alone, or to both simultaneously. This feature can increase the effective levels of apical-targeting cues, since they do not necessarily have to be used simultaneously at all times.</p><p>Mechanisms that similarly utilize the synergistic activity of two proteins may be used in the regulation of other actin regulators, which integrate between multiple signals. The activity of N-WASP, the activator of the ARP2/3 actin nucleation complex, was shown to be dependent on the synergistic binding of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 and of PI(4,5)P2 to distinct domains in the protein. However, this binding is not reported to lead to targeting of the protein to distinct subcellular domains, but rather to localized activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prehoda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</xref>).</p><p>While the apical targeting of Dia protein is very prominent, additional regulation operating on other tiers of the pathway may ensure enhanced fidelity of the localization. Although these mechanisms seem redundant, they may provide higher accuracy to the system. As previously noted, <italic>dia</italic> mRNA is also apically localized by a mechanism that is distinct from the protein localization machinery, leading to localized translation of Dia protein at the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massarwa et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, we observed a more restricted apical distribution of endogenous Dia compared with the over-expressed protein, which is not localized at the RNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, a bias in the apical localization of Dia activators (Rho-GEFs and Rho1) may provide another level of refinement. Finally, the bias in Rho-GEFs may be influenced by apical PI(4,5)P2 levels, providing an additional layer of convergence between distinct signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Viaud et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It is likely that this general mechanism in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tubular organs extends to tubular tissues in the mammalian system. A collaboration between PI(4,5)P2 and a Rho-family GTPase in membrane recruitment of mammalian mDia2 was observed in a cell culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gorelik et al., 2011</xref>), and here we have demonstrated the capacity of PI(4,5)P2 to influence Dia targeting in mammalian MDCK cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, the link between activation and localization, as well as the identity of the critical domain for localization of formin family proteins, appear to be conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Carramusa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Watanabe et al., 2010</xref>). In this context, we have recently examined the tubular epithelium of secretory acinar cells in the mouse pancreas, and shown that activated mDia1 is targeted to the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geron et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the Dia apical-targeting machinery appears to be common to a variety of tubular tissues, regardless of their origin or physiological function.</p><p>In conclusion, this work uncovers a mechanism by which Dia is targeted to the apical membrane of tubular epithelia, thereby restricting actin cable formation, and consequently secretion, to a distinct membrane domain of these cells. This localization mechanism is likely to be universal to tubular epithelia in a broad range of organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs</title><p>For the generation of GFP-Dia-N′, GFP-Dia-N′ΔBD and GFP-Dia-BD, eGFP was cloned into pUAST–attB at the BglII–EcoRI sites.

GFP-Dia-N′-mut<sup>G</sup> and GFP-Dia-N′ΔBD-mut<sup>G</sup> were created by site directed mutagenesis (Phusion, NEB), replacing nucleotides TG (440–441) with AC and AGC (451–453) with GAG, using GFP-Dia-N′ and GFP-Dia-N′ΔBD, respectively, as templates. The resulting constructs were subsequently cloned into GFP-pUAST-attB at the NotI-XbaI sites.

Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your interesting manuscript “Apical targeting of the formin Diaphanous in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tubular epithelia” to <italic>eLife</italic>. We are happy to say that all the reviewers were generally positive about your submission, and feel that the quality and scope is appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>: “The experiments described here show the power of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics to reveal interdependent regulatory mechanisms that are key to protein localization (and presumably function) in tissues of a multicellular organism. Overall, the manuscript is beautifully written, the experiments are clear, and clearly described, and the conclusions are generally well justified by the data.”</p><p>However, there were some issues that should be addressed in your revised submission. All the reviewers felt that the manuscript would benefit from additional quantification of the localization of several constructs, as well as some additional verification of the biochemical interactions indicated below.</p><p>1) Quantification of BD localization: “My one significant concern relates to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and the authors’ assertion that the Dia-BD domain is not sufficient for apical localization, an assertion that then leads to the model presented in Figure 8 and in the text. Although I understand that the authors’ believe that there is an inherent bias toward apical staining in the larval salivary gland, the image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> clearly seems to indicate an apical localization for this construct. For this reason it is difficult to accept the authors’ assertion that this construct shows no apical enhancement. I suggest that the authors need to carefully, and quantitatively, compare the localizations of GFP alone (displayed in a very small panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) to that of the GFP-Dia-BD construct to validate their claim that the two are indistinguishable. This can be done using the same sort of quantitative analysis that they used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig5 fig7">Figures 1, 2, 5, and 7</xref>.”</p><p>2) Quantification of Rho1 localization in the figure supplements: “In the supplemental figures, it is stated that disruptions of PI(4,5)P2 did not affect Rho1, and that Rho1 localization is independent of Dia. In the current quantitation, the authors compared apical to cytoplasmic Rho1; however, it appears that the lateral membrane localization of Rho1 increases when Skittles is expressed. It also seems as if the localization of Rho1 changes upon PTEN RNAi. Quantitation of apical membrane compared to basolateral membranes is needed to clarify these points.”</p><p>3) Biochemical validation of the Rho1 mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>): “to complete the biochemical connection, as well as showing that the interaction between Rho1 and Dia is not affected by removal of the BD domain, it is also necessary to do the pull-downs with the mut<sup>G</sup> version used in vivo to demonstrate that it does not bind Rho1.</p><p>Finally, the reviewers had several suggestions that they thought would improve the manuscript, though these changes are not essential for acceptance:</p><p>A) The manuscript would be improved by the addition of immunoblotting to test the relative levels of FL versus ΔDAD.</p><p>B) The claim that the PIP2-Dia interaction is mediated by direct binding through the BD domain would be better substantiated by lipid flotation assays showing that the BD domain binds PIP2 and that the introduced point mutations abrogate binding. As these experiments take time and may not be possible in a reasonable time frame, the authors should at least acknowledge that direct binding was not tested.</p><p>C) The results with exogenous PIP2 and MDCK cells strongly suggest that PIP2 alone is sufficient to direct Dia localization, if one assumes that there was no effect on RhoA localization in this experiment. Ideally RhoA localization should be examined in the MDCK assay; however, at the very least the authors should reconcile this result with their model, which suggests that even in the open conformation Dia requires interaction with Rho to localize properly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00666.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Quantification of BD localization: “My one significant concern relates to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and the authors’ assertion that the Dia-BD domain is not sufficient for apical localization, an assertion that then leads to the model presented in Figure 8 and in the text.

The apical bias that results from the unique morphology of these cells is apparent with both constructs.</p><p>•Quantitative analysis of apical localization comparing the two constructs in both larval and embryonic salivary gland cells was added in a new supplementary figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1I</xref>. This analysis clearly shows that the values for the two constructs are similar.</p><p>Images of these constructs as well as of GFP-Dia-N’ and GFP-Dia-N’ΔBD in embryonic tissues were transferred to this figure from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Quantification of Rho1 localization in the figure supplements: “In the supplemental figures, it is stated that disruptions of PI(4,5)P2 did not affect Rho1, and that Rho1 localization is independent of Dia.

The ratio between the apical membrane and the lateral membrane (left chart, A/SJ, measured in the septate junction domain) even slightly increases upon Sktl over-expression, indicating that there was no increase in the lateral localization of Rho1. The percentage of intensity that is concentrated in the SJ domain (right chart) is not significantly changed upon Sktl overexpression.</p><p>Quantification of Rho1 localization at the basal membrane upon PTEN-RNAi expression was added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3F</xref>. A very mild decrease in the ratio between the apical and basal domains (A/B) is observed.</p><p><italic>3) Biochemical validation of the Rho1 mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>): “to complete the biochemical connection, as well as showing that the interaction between Rho1 and Dia is not affected by removal of the BD domain, it is also necessary to do the pull-downs with the mut<sup>G</sup> version used in vivo to demonstrate that it does not bind Rho1</italic>.</p><p>We have carried out the co-IP studies of Dia constructs with Rho1, following expression in larval salivary glands. While GFP alone did not pull down Rho1, all other constructs (including the mut<sup>G</sup>) displayed a band of equal intensity that was recognized by Rho antibodies. We do not believe this reflects a bona-fide interaction, and have therefore removed this experiment from the paper. We also went one step further and carried out mass spectrometry analysis on a similar pull down with Dia-DAD (using a larger number of salivary glands, up to 500 per sample). The Rho1 protein could not be identified by this analysis, indicating that the sensitivity of the method does not allow the detection of endogenous levels of activated Rho that bind Dia, or that the extraction conditions used in the pull down were not sufficiently harsh to effectively remove membrane embedded proteins like Rho1.</p><p>Nevertheless, based on previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Otomo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rose et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lammers et al., 2008</xref>), we are confident that the two mutations we have introduced in mut<sup>G</sup> (in two residues conserved between Dia and mDia1 and mDia2) lead to abrogation of binding to Rho1.</p><p>There are a number of indications from previous reports and this work, demonstrating the modular and independent nature of the Rho-binding domain within Dia, which we have added to the manuscript:</p><p>•“Previous studies of the mDia1-Rho1 interaction showed that the BD is dispensable for the formation of an mDia1-Rho1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Otomo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rose et al., 2005</xref>).”</p><p>•We added an experiment that supports the notion of two distinct functional modules for Dia binding. Co-expression of GFP-Dia-N’ΔBD with <italic>Rho1</italic>-RNAi or expression of a GFP-Dia-N’ΔBD mut<sup>G</sup> construct, resulted in complete loss of apical localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>; quantification was added in 7G). This indicates that the residual apical localization observed for the GFP-Dia-N’ΔBD construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) can be attributed to Rho1 binding. A textual description was added to the Results section.</p><p><italic>A) The manuscript would be improved by the addition of immunoblotting to test the relative levels of FL versus ΔDAD</italic>.</p><p>We added an immuno-blotting experiment showing similar levels of GFP-Dia-FL and GFP-DiaΔDAD expressed in embryos using <italic>drm</italic>-Gal4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>. Live imaging of whole embryos expressing these constructs was added as well.</p><p><italic>B) The claim that the PIP2-Dia interaction is mediated by direct binding through the BD domain would be better substantiated by lipid flotation assays showing that the BD domain binds PIP2 and that the introduced point mutations abrogate binding. As these experiments take time and may not be possible in a reasonable time frame, the authors should at least acknowledge that direct binding was not tested</italic>.</p><p>Preforming the suggested experiments was not possible in a reasonable time frame. However, we changed the wording to say: “<italic>Drosophila</italic> Dia also contains an N-terminal basic domain which is critical for apical localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and <italic>is likely to</italic> mediate the association with PI(4,5)P2 through electrostatic interactions with the acidic phospholipid.”</p><p><italic>C) The results with exogenous PIP2 and MDCK cells strongly suggest that PIP2 alone is sufficient to direct Dia localization, if one assumes that there was no effect on RhoA localization in this experiment. Ideally RhoA localization should be examined in the MDCK assay; however, at the very least the authors should reconcile this result with their model, which suggests that even in the open conformation Dia requires interaction with Rho to localize properly</italic>.</p><p>The MDCK system was used in this work to examine a causal role for PI(4,5)P2 in Dia recruitment. It was chosen because of the reported enrichment of PI(4,5)P2 in the apical domain and its critical role for lumen formation. We agree that in light of our model that was formulated for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues, the dramatic apical localization of the GFP-DiaΔDAD construct in MDCK cysts could stem either from interactions only with PI(4,5)P2 (which may be exceptionally enriched in this system), or from an additional interaction with the heterologous RhoA. We do not know if such an interaction is possible, and if there is an apical bias for activated RhoA. A paragraph discussing this matter has been added to the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
