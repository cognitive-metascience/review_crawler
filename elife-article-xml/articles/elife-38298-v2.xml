How TALE repeat domains wrap around DNA, often extending more than 1.5 helical turns, without using external energy is not well understood. Here, we examine the kinetics of DNA binding of TALE arrays with varying numbers of identical repeats. Single molecule fluorescence analysis and deterministic modeling reveal conformational heterogeneity in both the free- and DNA-bound TALE arrays. Our findings, combined with previously identified partly folded states, indicate a TALE instability that is functionally important for DNA binding. For TALEs forming less than one superhelical turn around DNA, partly folded states inhibit DNA binding. In contrast, for TALEs forming more than one turn, partly folded states facilitate DNA binding, demonstrating a mode of ‘functional instability’ that facilitates macromolecular assembly. Increasing repeat number slows down interconversion between the various DNA-free and DNA-bound states.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38298.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA contains all the information needed to build an organism. It is made up of two strands that wind around each other like a twisted ladder to form the double helix. The strands consist of sugar and phosphate molecules, which attach to one of for bases. Genes are built from DNA, and contain specific sequences of these bases. Being able to modify DNA by deleting, inserting or changing certain sequences allows researchers to engineer tissues or even organisms for therapeutical and practical applications.</p><p>One of these gene editing tools is the so-called transcription activator-like effector protein (or TALE for short). TALE proteins are derived from bacteria and are built from simple repeating units that can be linked to form a string-like structure. They have been found to be unstable proteins. To bind to DNA, TALES need to follow the shape of the double helix, adopting a spiral structure, but how exactly TALE proteins thread their way around the DNA is not clear.</p><p>To investigate this, Geiger-Schuller et al. monitored single TALE units using fluorescent microscopy. This way, they could exactly measure the time it takes for single TALE proteins to bind and release DNA. The results showed that some TALE proteins bind DNA quickly, whereas others do this slowly. Using a computer model to analyze the different speeds of binding suggested that the fast binding comes from partly unfolded proteins that quickly associate with DNA, and that the slow binding comes from rigid, folded TALE proteins, which have a harder time wrapping around DNA. This suggest that the unstable nature of TALEs, helps these proteins to bind to DNA and turn on genes.</p><p>These findings will help to design future TALE-based gene editing tools and also provide more insight into how large molecules can assemble into complex structures. A next step will be to identify TALE repeats with unstable states and to test TALE gene editing tools that have intentionally placed unstable units.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TALE repeat</kwd><kwd>single-molecule biophysics</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>functional instability</kwd><kwd>deterministic modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM008403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geiger-Schuller</surname><given-names>Kathryn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM1129659</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ha</surname><given-names>Taekjip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY 1430124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ha</surname><given-names>Taekjip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM068462</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barrick</surname><given-names>Doug</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single molecule DNA-binding trajectories and deterministic modeling analyses demonstrate a functional role for high energy partly folded states in Transcription Activator-Like Effectors that could improve future TALEN design.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are bacterial proteins containing a domain of tandem DNA-binding repeats as well as a eukaryotic transcriptional activation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Römer et al., 2007</xref>).

Because TALEs contain on average 17.5 repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boch and Bonas, 2010</xref>), most form over 1.5 full turns around DNA. Many multisubunit proteins that form rings around DNA require energy in the form of ATP to open or close around DNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">O'Donnell and Kuriyan, 2006</xref>), yet TALEs are capable of wrapping around DNA without energy from nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis. One possibility is that TALEs bind DNA through an energetically accessible open conformation. Consistent with this possibility, we previously demonstrated that TALE arrays can populate partly folded and broken states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geiger-Schuller and Barrick, 2016</xref>). By measuring the length-dependence of protein stability and employing a statistical mechanics Ising model, we previously described several different TALE partly folded states termed ‘end-frayed’, ‘internally unfolded’, and ‘interfacially fractured’ states. Although the calculated populations of partly folded states in TALE repeat arrays are small, they are many orders of magnitude larger than populations of partly folded states in other previously studied repeat arrays (consensus ankyrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aksel et al., 2011</xref>] and DHR proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geiger-Schuller et al., 2018</xref>]) suggesting a potential functional role for the high populations of partially folded states in TALE repeat arrays.</p><p>Consensus TALEs (cTALEs) are designed homopolymeric arrays composed of the most commonly observed residue at each of the 34 positions of the repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geiger-Schuller and Barrick, 2016</xref>). In addition to simplifying analysis of folding and conformational heterogeneity in this study, the consensus approach simplifies analysis of DNA binding, eliminating contributions from sequence heterogeneity and providing an easy means of site-specific labeling.</p><p>Here we characterize DNA binding kinetics of cTALEs using total internal reflection fluorescence single-molecule microscopy. We find that consensus TALE arrays bind to DNA reversibly, with high affinity. Analysis of the dwell-times of the on- and off-states reveals multiphasic binding and unbinding kinetics, suggesting conformational heterogeneity in both the free and DNA bound state. We develop a deterministic optimization analysis that supports such a model, and provides rate constants for conformational changes in the unbound and bound states, and rate constants for binding and dissociation. Comparing the dynamics observed here to previously characterized local unfolding suggests that locally unfolded states inhibit binding of short cTALE arrays (less than one full superhelical turn around DNA), whereas they promote binding of long arrays (more than one full superhelical turn). Whereas local folding of transcription factors upon DNA binding is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spolar and Record, 1994</xref>), local unfolding in the binding process is not. Our results present a new mode of transcription factor binding where the major conformer in the unbound state is fully folded, requiring partial unfolding prior to binding. The critical role of such high energy partly folded states is an exciting example of ‘functional instability’, in which formation of a functional complex is impeded by the fully folded native state, and is instead facilitated by partial disruption of native structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>cTALE design</title><p>Consensus TALE (cTALE) repeat sequence design was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geiger-Schuller and Barrick, 2016</xref>).

However, both types of cTALEs are more likely to populate many of these partly folded states than cAnk is to populate even the lowest energy partly folded state, the end frayed state. Thus, compared to ankyrin repeats, cTALEs are locally unstable, meaning they are likely to form partly folded states. As these states disrupt the superhelix, they may facilitate DNA binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Single-molecule studies of cTALE binding to DNA</title><p>To ask if cTALE local instability is relevant for DNA binding kinetics, DNA binding trajectories were measured using single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (smTIRF). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows a schematic of the smTIRF experiments performed to measure DNA binding. For site-specific cTALE labeling, R30 is mutated to cysteine in a single repeat. Position 30 is frequently a cysteine in naturally occurring TALEs (in earlier folding studies, arginine was chosen in the consensus sequence to avoid disulfide formation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geiger-Schuller and Barrick, 2016</xref>). This cysteine was Cy3 (FRET donor)-labelled using maleimide chemistry, and the Cy3-lablelled TALE array was attached to biotinylated slides via the C-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag and α-Penta•His antibodies. At salt concentrations below 300 mM NaCl, cTALEs aggregate. Because DNA binding is weak at high salt concentrations, measuring binding kinetics in bulk at high salt is not possible. However, tethering cTALEs to the quartz slide at high salt prevents self-association, even at the low salt concentrations required to study DNA binding kinetics. A histogram of NcTALE<sub>8</sub> (8 NS-type repeats and the N-terminal domain) labeled via a cysteine in the first repeat shows a single peak at zero FRET efficiency, as expected for donor-only constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38298.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>cTALEs bind dsDNA reversibly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of single-molecule FRET assay, with donor-labelled cTALE attached to a surface, and acceptor-labelled DNA free in solution.

These FRET distributions are similar to those obtained from tethering cTALEs to the surface and adding free dsDNA, suggesting that the interaction of cTALE arrays with dsDNA is not significantly impacted by surface immobilization. Since cTALEs tend to associate at physiological salt concentration, we used the format where cTALEs were tethered to the slide and incubated with freely diffusing dsDNA for all subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>cTALE arrays display multiphasic DNA-binding and -unbinding kinetics</title><p>In addition to the short smTIRF movies used to generate smFRET histograms from many molecules, long movies were also collected to examine the extended transitions of individual molecules between the low- and high-FRET (0 and 0.45) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). A transition from low to high FRET (0 to 0.45) indicates that the acceptor fluorophore on DNA moved close enough to the donor on the protein for FRET and is likely a binding event.

Low-FRET states show low colocalization with signal upon direct excitation of the acceptor, confirming that high-FRET states are DNA-bound states and low-FRET states are DNA-free states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Because there are three more base pairs than TALE repeats, there are several available binding registers where all TALE repeats are bound to DNA; ignoring end-effects, these registers are expected to have similar energetics. Although variation in registry would not be expected for natural TALE arrays that bind to high-complexity DNA sequences, it is more likely for the simple poly-A sequence here. To test whether bound-state heterogeneity results from a variation in cTALE-DNA registry, we altered the dsDNA sequence to promote a specific bound state. Previous studies indicate that the addition of a 5’ T to the binding sequence, referred to as a T-anchored binding site, greatly enhances TALE binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boch et al., 2009</xref>) depending also on the presence of certain RVDs and degree of mismatch relative to cognate DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schreiber and Bonas, 2014</xref>).

Compared to the unbinding kinetics measured for the homopolymeric DNA, the anchored unbinding cumulative distributions are well-fitted by a single exponential (although the model with bound-state heterogeneity still fits slightly better, as shown below). There are two possible interpretations of this result. Either the T-anchored DNA impacts the binding mechanism such that unbinding involves one simple unimolecular processes, or the T-anchored DNA shifts the microscopic rate constants such that, although unbinding involves two (or more) unimolecular processes, the amplitudes are very different, or apparent rates are too close to resolve them.

Cumulative distributions were generated from dwell times at low Cy5 signal (unbound states, with lifetimes representing binding kinetics), and at high Cy5 signal (bound states, with dwell times representing unbinding kinetics). As with the eight repeat constructs, unbound cumulative distributions for these longer TALE arrays are best-fit by double exponential decays, particularly at high DNA concentrations (compare the cumulative distribution at low DNA concentration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>, to cumulative distribution at 5 nM DNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

This four-state model includes a TALE isomerization step in the absence of DNA from a DNA-binding incompetent conformation (which we refer to as TALE) to DNA-binding competent conformation (which we refer to as TALE*). The DNA-binding competent TALE* conformer binds and unbinds DNA (called TALE* when DNA free and TALE*~DNA when DNA-bound). Before unbinding, a fraction of TALE*~DNA isomerizes to a longer-lived DNA-bound state called TALE<sup>‡</sup>~DNA.</p><p>Based on this mechanism, the rate laws for binding are given in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equations 1a - 1d</xref>.<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1a)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(1b)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(1c)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(1d)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Since the single-molecule dwell-time histograms of the unbound states are insensitive to the isomerization after DNA binding, the equation describing the time evolution of the long-lived bound state (TALE<sup>‡</sup>~DNA) is not relevant to our analysis of unbound-state lifetimes.</p><p>To determine microscopic rate constants k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>-1</sub>, and k<sub>2</sub>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2 equ3">Equations 1a-1c</xref> were numerically integrated in Matlab, and the fraction of TALE*~DNA as a function of time was fitted to the low-FRET cumulative distributions (NcTALE<sub>8</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>) or to the no colocalization cumulative distributions (NcTALE<sub>16</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J–K</xref>).

Increasing the number of repeats from 8 to 12 repeats decreases the apparent K<sub>d</sub> modestly, but further increasing from 12 to 16 repeats leaves the K<sub>d</sub> unchanged. This affinity increase is small compared to that reported in a previous report studying length dependence on the affinity of designed TALEs (dTALEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rinaldi et al., 2017</xref>), although in that study affinity also became insensitive to repeat number for large arrays when K<sub>D,app</sub> was in the low nM range. Because the K<sub>D,app</sub> of cTALE<sub>8</sub> is already in the low nM regime (2.5 nM), we speculate that this may represent a similar maximum binding affinity observed for the longer arrays in the previous Rinaldi <italic>et al.</italic> report. Thus, because cTALE<sub>8</sub> is near a maximum affinity, the addition of four and eight cTALE repeats has only a modest impact on the apparent binding affinity.</p><p>TALEs are believed to read out sequence information from one strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boch et al., 2009</xref>). Due to the asymmetry of our DNA sequences (poly-dA base-paired with poly-dT), in principle, the FRET efficiency contains information on the binding orientation (and thus strand preference). However, based on the crystal structure of the DNA-bound state of TAL-effector PthXo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mak et al., 2012</xref>), we estimate that the distance between the donor site of NcTALE<sub>8</sub> (repeat 1) to the 5’ acceptor site on the DNA (Cy5-A<sub>15</sub>/T<sub>15</sub>) should be similar for both the dA-sense or dT-sense orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Thus, the FRET data does not discriminate between the two modes of binding for the eight-repeat construct. However, for the 16 repeat NS RVD cTALE arrays, the PthXo1 model suggests very different distances (25 Å versus 73 Å for the dT-sense or dA-sense respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>) between the donor site (TALE repeat 14) and the acceptor site (5’ Cy5-A<sub>23</sub>/T<sub>23</sub>). To restrict the number of binding positions available to longer cTALE arrays, the 23 base pair DNA used for NcTALE<sub>16</sub> measurements (as well as DNA depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>) has the same number of additional base pairs as repeats (eight additional repeats and eight additional base pairs) compared to the 15 base pair DNA used for NcTALE<sub>8</sub> measurements (as well as DNA depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). While we limited the number of available binding positions, it may be possible for cTALEs to slide along DNA. However, taking into account the four repeat N-terminal capping domain, there are only three available base pairs in the bound complex. Thus we don’t expect the distance measurements to change by more than 10 Å (~3 base pairs) if sliding occurs. The observation that there is colocalization but no measurable FRET when NcTALE<sub>16</sub> is bound to DNA suggests that cTALEs containing the NS RVD prefer adenine (the dA-sense mode) compared with thymine bases, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boch et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conformational heterogeneity in the unbound state may be caused by local unfolding</title><p>The cumulative distributions of dwell-times in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> provide clear evidence for conformational heterogeneity in both the free and DNA-bound cTALEs.

In the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the binding competent state is the fully folded conformation, whereas the binding incompetent state includes partly folded conformations. Consistent with this interpretation, increasing populations of partly folded states through addition of 1M urea and through entropy enhancing mutations decreases apparent binding rates of 8 repeat cTALEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is also consistent with a partly folded DNA-binding incompetent state in shorter cTALE arrays.</p><p>For 12 and 16 repeat cTALE arrays, the DNA-binding incompetent state is more highly populated than the DNA-binding competent state. In the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the DNA-binding competent state is a high-energy conformation required for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). Because 12 and 16 repeat cTALEs are expected to form 1 and 1.4 turns (excluding the N-terminal domain), we hypothesize that the binding competent state includes some partly folded states that allow access to DNA. Not all partly folded states open the array to access DNA; therefore, the binding incompetent state includes some nonproductive partly folded states in addition to the fully folded state.</p><p>In arrays containing 12 or more repeats, the binding competent and binding incompetent states likely include mixtures of many specific partly folded states. Because the types of partly folded states are unknown, connecting equilibria between binding competent and binding incompetent states to calculated partly folded equilibria (using folding free energies similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is challenging. Future work towards understanding the structural characteristics of the binding competent state in TALE arrays of one or more turns would inform which partly folded states to include in the calculation, making this comparison meaningful. A better structural understanding of the DNA binding competent state may also allow an opportunity for precise placement of destabilized repeats in designed TALEN arrays which may enable more efficient gene editing methodologies in both clinical and basic research applications.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>TALE functional instability presents a new mode of transcription factor binding</title><p>Here we demonstrate kinetic heterogeneity in DNA-bound and unbound TALE arrays, and we subsequently link the observed heterogeneity to partial unfolding of TALE arrays.

The functional instability described is particularly surprising given the small population of partly folded states which we expect to be DNA binding competent (partly folded states similar to internally unfolded and interfacially fractured states depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Discovery of a functional role for the observed conformational heterogeneity is even more surprising, given the sequence identity of each of our repeats.

Our work with the homopolymeric DNA sequences suggests that cTALEs have multiple bound states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To gain more insight into conformational heterogeneity in the bound state, we performed binding experiments with T-anchored binding sequences and with divalent magnesium cation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplementa 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">4</xref>).

Although we have no structural information on how these two registers differ (for NcTALE<sub>8</sub> binding to A<sub>15</sub>/T<sub>15</sub> DNA, the two registers appear to have the same FRET efficiency), our deterministic modeling suggests that the two registers differ in their ability to dissociate. The TALE*-DNA state, which we refer to as ‘register 1’ in the mechanistic model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, can directly dissociate to the unbound state; likewise, it appears to be the direct product of association. In contrast, the TALE<sup>‡</sup>-DNA state, which we refer to as ‘register 2’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, does not directly dissociate; rather, dissociation from register two involves conversion back to register 1.</p><p>To determine how the observed kinetic changes are partitioned into underlying kinetic steps in unbinding, we fitted various kinetic models to the cumulative distributions for unbinding (binding to T-anchored DNA is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>; binding in the presence of 40 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Although the model does not provide information on the structure of this conformational change, it is likely that this conformational change involves cTALEs shifting register by 1–3 base pairs on the homopolymeric DNA. Overall, the dissociation results demonstrate that TALE-DNA complexes are heterogeneous, and their rates of interconversion and dissociation depend on sequence, repeat number, and solution conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression, purification, and labeling</title><p>Consensus TALE repeat constructs were cloned with C-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tags via an in-house version of Golden Gate cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cermak et al., 2011</xref>).

To reduce the number of incorrectly identified transitions arising from increased background and noise at higher Cy5-labeled DNA concentrations, a thresholding algorithm with two limits was implemented (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). All FRET and colocalization data are well described by models with two distinct states (0.0 FRET and ~0.45 FRET as well as low colocalization and high colocalization).

Your article has been reviewed by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Adam J Bogdanove.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. While the reviewers are positive about the relevance of the problem and the potential importance of the results in understanding how partially folded states help TALE binding, they raise a number of significant concerns. Each of these concerns can be addressed by performing additional experiments.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors use a combination of single-molecule FRET experiments and modeling to study the kinetics of DNA binding for TALE constructs containing different length repeat sequences (8, 12, 16 repeats). The main results include evidence of conformational heterogeneity of the DNA-bound state for TALE proteins, together with the development of a kinetic model that explains the role of different interconvertible binding-competent and binding-incompetent states in DNA binding and how the largely fully folded protein must undergo a local unfolding transition to bind DNA. The experimental approach and the modeling are elegant and widely applicable and therefore likely of broad interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) By using a homopolymeric cTALE (all NS) and a homopolymeric substrate (all A on one strand and all T on the other), the experimental design provides no anchor for register. As an alternative to the hypothesis presented in Figure 6, it is possible that the partially bound (&quot;encounter&quot;) state inferred by the authors is due to entry somewhere in the middle of the DNA, resulting in some corresponding C-terminal number of repeats &quot;hanging off&quot; the end (or to the side). In such a scenario, couldn't the slower transition of the longer cTALEs to the &quot;locked&quot; (fully bound) state (the bound state isomerization, subsection “A deterministic approach to modeling cTALE-DNA binding kinetics”) be the result of the longer time need to slide 5' along the DNA to allow the C-terminal repeats to hop or fold on (or could the &quot;loose&quot; end be contributing energy toward dissociation, or some combination)? The authors should repeat the experiments using some type of anchor for register. TALEs have a strong preference for T at position -1 in the binding site, dictated by the N-terminal cryptic repeats, and these repeats provide much of the binding energy. Indeed, they are theorized to nucleate the protein-DNA interaction. Incorporating a T at the beginning of the polyA sequence should do the trick, but for good measure, it wouldn't hurt to also incorporate a few different, specific RVDs and corresponding bases early in the arrays. Based on the available structures, RVDs do not appear to differentially impact the inter-repeat interfaces.</p><p>Perhaps related to the potential problem of no anchor, it is surprising that the 16 repeat cTALEs do not have significantly higher affinity than the 8 repeat cTALE and that the relationship between length and the bimolecular microscopic binding and unbinding constants is not linear (subsection “A deterministic approach to modeling cTALE-DNA binding kinetics”). Rinaldi et al., showed that increasing numbers of repeats increases affinity for target DNA but that the gain in affinity with more repeats decays exponentially (they observed that affinity for non-specific DNA increases as well, but with a slower rate of decay of gain). Despite the decrease in the rate of gain, one would still expect to see higher affinity for the 12 and 16 repeat cTALEs relative to the 8. Is it possible that, unanchored, cTALE-DNA interactions that do not span the length of the array are confounding the results observed by the authors? The authors surmise based on the estimated distance between the fluorophores (Figure 4—figure supplement 3) that the absence of FRET using the 16 repeat TALE is due to its binding the 'A' sense strand rather than the 'T' sense strand, and they are correct in observing that NS prefers A to T, but NS can bind T (Miller et al., 2015), so it is unclear whether some population of the protein is wrapped in the other direction, using one of the T's as its position -1. As above, the authors should address this possibility in their discussion or with an anchored setup.</p><p>2) Single molecule FRET experiments are performed by surface tethering the C-terminus of the repeat region to a solid surface. A major finding of the paper is the TALEs exhibit conformational heterogeneity during dynamics. With the protein immobilized, there is a concern that the surface tethering affects conformational changes and kinetics during these dynamic processes. A critical control experiment is to have the DNA anchored to the surface and the protein free in solution.</p><p>3) Most/all of the experiments reported conditions of monovalent salt. Did the authors include any divalent salt in solution during any of the experiments? It would seem that in vivo conditions would include some amount of divalents. The main point is that all of the kinetic parameters were determined with monovalent salts only.</p><p>4) FRET was observed for the Cy3-labeled TALE with an 8-repeat sequence, but not for the 12 and 16-repeat TALEs. Why? This is not clear from the paper. How did the authors decide on the location of dye labeling for the TALE proteins? The structure shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 3 (as best as I can tell) suggests that FRET should be possible for the larger TALE constructs. Second, the 8 and 12 repeat TALEs were labeled at the first repeat, whereas the 16 repeat TALE was labeled at the 14th repeat. What is the rationale for this labeling strategy? Clearly labeling location will affect the absence or presence of FRET, and it is unclear that this was studied in a systematic manner.</p><p>5) Only the 8 repeat TALE exhibited FRET, whereas the 12 and 16 repeat TALEs did not. For the 8-repeat TALE, a transition to low FRET is interpreted as &quot;likely an unbinding event&quot;. However, no FRET is then observed for the 12 and 16 repeat TALEs, so the co-localization method is used. The main point here is that the interpretation of FRET (or acceptor signal) does not seem to be uniform between the different constructs in terms of the actual structural information or dynamics. For example, does this mean that the low FRET state in the 8-repeat TALE is fundamentally different than no FRET in the 12 and 16-repeat sequences? This is related to the next point (6).</p><p>6) In drawing schematics such as that shown in Figure 6, and in using the FRET (or localization data) to extract rate constants from the kinetic model, the authors rely on a large amount of speculation about the underlying dynamics and structure (or hypothesis). In this particular case, the behavior in the schematic (Figure 6) does not appear (in my opinion) to be solidly supported by the experimental data presented in the paper. It is largely speculative, and as the authors admit in the Discussion section &quot;such [experimental/computational] analysis provides little information about the structural nature of TALE conformational heterogeneity&quot;. How can we directly attribute different kinetic states to partially folded (or not) TALE proteins? Bottom line is that the ideas in the schematic are interesting and potentially novel (and significant), but too preliminary to be proposed based on the experimental data.</p><p>7) In the Introduction, the authors refer to 'partly folded or broken states' without sufficient explanation. These ideas are drawn heavily upon in the paper, but they need more clear explanation. Moreover, are the concepts in Figure 1 presented as new results and findings for this paper, or are they presented as prior results? In either case, more explanation is needed. How are δ G values determined?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38298.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) By using a homopolymeric cTALE (all NS) and a homopolymeric substrate (all A on one strand and all T on the other), the experimental design provides no anchor for register.

Such a scenario might suggest that the kinetic complexity we see in unbinding results from binding in multiple registers along the DNA. To test this, we performed additional experiments with a T-anchored DNA (Cy5-TA<sub>14</sub>/A<sub>14</sub>T) as suggested. We show these data inthe new Figure 4 and describe them in the new subsection “Modifying the dsDNA sequence to include an anchoring 5’ T impacts unbinding kinetics”.We find that binding to the Tanchored DNA remains multi-phasic (similar to the homopolymeric DNA), but unbinding kinetics are impacted. This result suggests that indeed, heterogenous bound states contribute to complexity in unbinding kinetics.</p><p>We discuss this bound state heterogeneity in the subsection “Conformational heterogeneity in the bound state”. We interpret the bound state heterogeneity in the homopolymeric constructs as conversion between distinct isoenergetic states (‘register 1’ and ‘register 2’). With homopolymeric constructs, there are several additional DNA base pairs (1-3 in the case of cTALE<sub>8</sub> binding A<sub>15</sub>/T<sub>15</sub>) available as alternate binding registries. Without unbinding, cTALEs may shift registry one or more base pairs where all repeats still contact DNA. Additionally, binding should also be able to occur where the protein binds the DNA near to one end, and only binds with a subset of TALE repeats (and bases), although such partly bound states should be higher in energy and as such, should contribute little to the observed kinetics. The Tanchored DNA experiments suggested by the reviewers provided great insight into the unbinding mechanism and to heterogeneity in the bound state. Deterministic analysis shows that there is still some (albeit significantly decreased) heterogeneity in the bound state by breaking the symmetry and stabilizing one of the two registries (in which, we presume, the T-anchor is engaged with the N-terminal cap). Consistent with this stabilization, we detect a significantly slower conversion from ‘registry 1’ to ‘registry 2’ as well as a decrease in the unbinding rate constant in unbinding kinetics measured with the T-anchoring DNA.</p><p>In terms of the length dependence of DNA affinity, the reviewers are correct that we do not see much decrease between arrays of 8, 12, and 16 repeats. Table 1 shows a two-fold decrease in Kd going from 8 to 12 repeats, but essentially no decrease going from 12 to 16 repeats. The elegant study of Rinaldi et al., (2017) clearly shows an increase in affinity over this range, although for longer arrays the increase in affinity appears to saturate. Also, Rinaldi et al., show that for two different DNA sequences (specific and nonspecific), saturation occurs at different lengths. It is possible that in our homopolymeric system this saturation is &quot;rightshifted&quot; compared to those of Rinaldi et al., Figure 3 and Figure 4. We share the reviewers' intuition that affinity should increase with length. We speculate that because cTALEs have a high binding affinity at 8 repeats (K<sub>D,app</sub> = 2.5 nM for cTALE8 which is similar to Rinaldi et al. reported specific binding K<sub>D,app</sub> for 26 RVDs), adding additional repeats does not increase this affinity very much. We expect that if we looked at cTALEs with fewer repeats we may have seen a relationship with the number of repeats and binding affinity that followed a similar trend as what was observed in the elegant Rinaldi et al. We discuss this in the text added to subsection “cTALEs containing NS RVD bind DNA with high affinity”.</p><p>As to potential binding in the opposite orientation, the similar FRET level for the T-anchored TALE complex suggests the two DNAs bind in the same orientation. As we expect the T-anchored DNA to bind in the intended orientation, we expect the orientation is the same for the polyA sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Single molecule FRET experiments are performed by surface tethering the C-terminus of the repeat region to a solid surface.

We show in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and the updated subsection “Untethered cTALEs bind dsDNA” that DNA binding is similar in the original orientation (with tethered cTALEs) and the reverse orientation (with tethered dsDNA). Unfortunately, we cannot study a wide range of protein concentrations since the protein aggregates at low salt and low glycerol concentrations.</p><p> <italic>3) Most/all of the experiments reported conditions of monovalent salt.

We display these data in Figure 7—figure supplement 3 and Figure 7—figure supplement 4 and discuss them in the updated subsection “Conformational heterogeneity in the bound state”. Similar to what we previously observed with 200 mM KCl, binding and unbinding kinetics are multi-phasic in the presence of 40 mM MgCl2, although we do observe changes in the rate of unbinding as well as the rate of conversion between different isoenergetic bound state registries (referred to here as ‘register 1’ and ‘register 2’).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) FRET was observed for the Cy3-labeled TALE with an 8-repeat sequence, but not for the 12 and 16-repeat TALEs.

We observe a low FRET value near 0.2 for the A<sub>23</sub>/T<sub>23</sub> bound cTALE<sub>12</sub> state indicating that the fluorophores on cTALE<sub>12</sub> and A<sub>23</sub>/T<sub>23</sub> dsDNA are further apart than in cTALE<sub>8</sub> binding to A<sub>15</sub>/T<sub>15</sub>. Attempts to increase the FRET efficiency by moving the FRET donor label to a different location in the cTALE<sub>16</sub> protein (to the fourteenth repeat) were unsuccessful. Because we see correlated changes in FRET and colocalization when monitoring kinetics of cTALE<sub>8</sub> binding and unbinding (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), we feel confident in comparing both FRET and colocalization kinetics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Only the 8 repeat TALE exhibited FRET, whereas the 12 and 16 repeat TALEs did not.

This is related to the next point (6).</p></disp-quote><p>Our response to the previous point (4) helps resolve this question. We describe rationale for attachment of fluorophores and decision to measure colocalization of FRET in the updated subsection “Longer cTALEs have slower DNA binding and unbinding kinetics”. We do think there is a difference between the low-FRET &quot;state&quot; for the 12- and 16-repeat constructs, because at high protein concentration, most of the protein is bound to DNA, even though it does not show FRET. We know it is bound from co-localization. We can only speculate on the structural differences that prevent FRET in the bound states with longer constructs, but our main goal here is to use fluorescence as a signal for binding, which the co-localization studies provide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In drawing schematics such as that shown in Figure 6, and in using the FRET (or localization data) to extract rate constants from the kinetic model, the authors rely on a large amount of speculation about the underlying dynamics and structure (or hypothesis).

We think that the experiments with the T-anchored DNA provide additional insight into the heterogeneity in the bound state, demonstrating that the DNA plays a key role in this heterogeneity. Thus, we think we are on more solid ground in our picture of heterogeneity in the bound state relating to shifts in binding register.</p><p>As to the multiphasic binding kinetics, there are a few possibilities. One possibility is that either of the reactants (the protein or the DNA) could be heterogeneous (which is our interpretation). In bulk kinetic schemes, heterogeneity can also result from intermediates along a reaction pathway. We know which kinetic phase corresponds to association (the fast one) since it is DNA concentration dependent. In principle, the kinetic intermediate could either before or after the rate-limiting step. But in our case, since we know that the product of the fast phase has full bound-state fluorescence, the &quot;kinetic intermediate&quot; cannot be past the DNA binding step, because we would not be able to detect it. Thus, the intermediate is before the binding step. This is consistent with our data, where the &quot;intermediate&quot; is a binding competent form of the TALE protein. Although it is possible the kinetic complexity in binding comes from the DNA, we expect these simple oligonucleutids to be pretty homogeneous; instead, our previous measurement of the conformational heterogeneity of these TALE arrays through Ising analysis suggests a high level of conformational heterogeneity in the protein, so we feel it is not unreasonable to suggest a connection between these two observations. Also, data shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 demonstrate that increasing populations of partly folded states in the 8 repeat construct (through both chemical and mutational destabilization) decreases apparent binding rates, further implicating the protein as the source of heterogeneity. We have more clearly referenced this data in the subsection “Conformational heterogeneity in the bound state” and thoroughly explain the significance of this evidence to support our model in the revised manuscript. We hope that in a revised manuscript, the reviewer will agree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the Introduction, the authors refer to 'partly folded or broken states' without sufficient explanation.
