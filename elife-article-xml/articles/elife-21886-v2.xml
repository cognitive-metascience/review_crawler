We are surprised by, move towards, and often explore new objects. But how does the brain control these responses?</p><p>Dopamine is a molecule that controls many processes in the brain and plays critical roles in various mental disorders, diseases that affect movement, and addiction. Rewarding experiences (like a glass of cold water on a hot day) can trigger dopamine neurons and studies have also shown that dopamine neurons respond to new experiences. This suggested that novelty may be rewarding in itself, or that novelty may signal the potential for future reward. On the other hand, it may be that different groups of dopamine neurons play different roles in responding to new or rewarding experiences.</p><p>In 2015, it was reported that dopamine neurons connected to the rear part of an area in the brain called the striatum receive signals from different parts of the brain than most other dopamine neurons. The dopamine neurons connected to this “tail” of the striatum preferentially received inputs from regions involved in arousal rather than reward, suggesting that they may have a unique role and transmit a different type of information.</p><p>Now, Menegas et al. have shown that dopamine signals in different areas of the striatum separate reward from novelty and other signals in mice. The results demonstrate that new odors activate dopamine neurons projecting to the tail of the striatum, but that this activity fades as the novelty wears off (as the mice learn to associate the odor with a particular outcome). By contrast, dopamine neurons projecting to the front of the striatum do not respond to novelty, but rather become more active as mice learn which odors accompany rewards (only responding to odors that predict reward). The experiments also show that dopamine neurons in the tail of the striatum encode information about the importance of a stimulus.</p><p>Together, these findings indicate that some of the roles dopamine plays in the brain may not be related to reward, but are instead linked to the novelty and importance of the stimulus. The next challenge will be to find out how the separate reward and novelty signals in dopamine neurons relate to the animals’ behavior. This may help us to better understand dopamine-related psychiatric conditions, such as depression and addiction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21886.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21886.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>novelty</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH095953</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uchida</surname><given-names>Naoshige</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Harvard Mind Brain and Behavior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uchida</surname><given-names>Naoshige</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH101207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uchida</surname><given-names>Naoshige</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH110404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uchida</surname><given-names>Naoshige</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPE20150331860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Babayan</surname><given-names>Benedicte M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dopamine novelty signals are localized in the posterior tail of the striatum along with general salience signals, while dopamine in the ventral striatum reliably encodes reward prediction error.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals respond to new stimuli in a characteristic way across species, historically characterized as an ‘orienting reflex’ or a ‘what is it reflex’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pavlov and Anrep, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sechenov, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sokolov, 1963</xref>). Detection of novel stimuli is advantageous for survival because novel stimuli can signal potential rewards or potential threats. Orienting towards a novel stimulus and understanding it through exploration can allow future exploitation of potential rewards. In addition to behavioral advantages, novelty detection is fundamental for computation in our brain. For example, novelty detectors, or ‘novelty filters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kohonen and Oja, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marsland et al., 2002</xref>), can reduce the amount of total information so that we can focus on unexpected perceptions as inputs to pay attention to and to learn from. Indeed, behavioral studies have repeatedly shown that both humans and other animals have enhanced memory for novel items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kishiyama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Restorff, 1933</xref>).</p><p>Physiologically, it is widely accepted that novelty responses are distributed over a network of many brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Courchesne et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kishiyama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Knight, 1996</xref>). Among these, single unit recordings have shown that dopamine neurons in the midbrain increase their firing in response to the presentation of a novel stimulus in several species and behavioral paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horvitz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ljungberg et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schultz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Steinfels et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>As animals experience the repeated association of a stimulus and a reward, they learn to expect the reward when the stimulus is presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pavlov and Anrep, 1927</xref>). Dopamine neurons are thought to be the neural substrate underlying this type of learning because they signal reward prediction error: the difference between actual and expected reward values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayer and Glimcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>). These neurons are thought to guide decision-making by broadcasting this information to many regions of the forebrain and reinforcing behaviors that lead to reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dayan and Niv, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haber, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Montague et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Novelty responses in dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horvitz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schultz, 2015</xref>) were initially puzzling because animals cannot know whether a novel stimulus will reliably predict an outcome with a positive or negative value. One hypothesis was that dopamine neurons take an optimistic approach toward novel stimuli, assuming that they will predict a valuable outcome until proven wrong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hazy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kakade and Dayan, 2002</xref>). This ‘optimistic initialization’ in dopamine neurons may have advantages. For example, the novelty responses in dopamine neurons may induce orienting behaviors towards novel stimuli, similar to dopamine responses to reward or reward-predicting cues that induce orienting behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hazy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kakade and Dayan, 2002</xref>). Further, dopamine novelty responses may allow computational exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dayan and Sejnowski, 1996</xref>), or storage of the novel stimulus in working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braver and Cohen, 1999</xref>), so that animals have a better chance to associate novel stimuli to potential rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hazy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kakade and Dayan, 2002</xref>). However, these hypotheses do not necessarily fit with conflicting observations of animals’ behavioral responses to novel stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gershman and Niv, 2015</xref>). Indeed, depending on the experimental context, animals sometimes approach and sometimes avoid novel options compared to familiar ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gershman and Niv, 2015</xref>).</p><p>One explanation for why some dopamine neurons respond to novel stimuli could be that some subpopulations of dopamine neurons are not strictly related to reward prediction error coding. Recent studies have shown that there is substantial diversity among dopamine neurons at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grimm et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lacey et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roeper, 2013</xref>) as well as in their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brischoux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>). For example, single unit recordings in monkeys showed that some dopamine neurons are inhibited by aversive outcomes and others are excited by them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>). This suggests that there are distinct types of dopamine neurons and that some do not encode pure value. Instead, the data suggest that some dopamine neurons encode value and others might encode ‘motivational salience’ (the absolute value of ‘value’).</p><p>Recent anatomical studies have revealed that dopamine neurons with different projection targets are embedded in separate circuits. The entire set of inputs to dopaminergic nuclei includes a large number of regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geisler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geisler and Zahm, 2005</xref>). Neural circuit tracing using a modified rabies virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wickersham et al., 2007</xref>) enabled us to specifically label the monosynaptic inputs onto dopamine neurons, revealing that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons receive slightly different inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</xref>). More recent studies have shown that dopamine neurons with different projection targets receive different inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, we found that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior ‘tail’ of the striatum (TS) have unique inputs compared to dopamine neurons projecting to many other brain regions, including the ventral striatum (VS), suggesting that these neurons could have a distinct function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Based on our previous anatomical findings, in this study, we compared the dopamine axon activity in VS and TS while mice learned new odor-outcome associations (we will call the bulk calcium signal that we observed from the axons of DAT+ midbrain dopamine neurons in the striatum ‘VS dopamine’ and ‘TS dopamine’ in the following sections). Our results revealed opposite dynamics for learning new cue-outcome associations in VS dopamine and TS dopamine. We observed a large response to novel cues in TS dopamine which subsequently decreased over the course of associative learning. On the other hand, we saw no response to novel cues in VS dopamine. Instead, VS dopamine gradually developed responses to reward-predicting cues during learning. These findings revealed that dopamine novelty coding is localized to the posterior part of the striatum, while VS dopamine faithfully encodes reward prediction error. Thus, novelty responses in dopamine may be better formalized separately from the reward prediction error (RPE) framework, rather than being included in the RPE framework.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Recording activity from dopamine axons in the striatum</title><p>We used optical fiber fluorometry (fiber photometry) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kudo et al., 1992</xref>) to record bulk calcium signals from the axons of midbrain dopamine neurons projecting to several regions of the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Parker et al., 2016</xref>).

TS dopamine showed significant excitation above baseline following the presentation of novel odors (p = 1.76x10<sup>−6</sup>, t-test, n = 12 animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), whereas responses to novel odors in VS dopamine were not significantly different from baseline (p = 0.354, t-test, n = 13 animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>The responses to novel odors in TS dopamine decreased significantly over the course of the first 30 odor presentations (p = 5.10x10<sup>−11</sup>, repeated measures ANOVA, n = 12 animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). The responses after five odor representations (6–10 trials) were significantly smaller than the responses in the first five trials (p = 1.45x10<sup>−4</sup>, paired t-test, n = 12 animals). To determine whether this decrease in signal was caused by a decrease in effective odor concentration within sessions, we compared responses to fast-decaying and slow-decaying odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). TS dopamine responses to novel odors, both fast-decaying and slow-decaying odors, decreased over the course of a session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), whereas TS dopamine responses to familiar odors did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Notably, this was independent of any CS response developing.

We trained nine mice with VS fiber implants and 11 mice with TS fiber implants by introducing a new odor paired with a reward or no outcome every day for a week, and then measured dopamine activity while learning new odor-water or odor-nothing associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We found that repeated training with odor-reward associations did not change responses to new odors in VS dopamine or TS dopamine. VS dopamine did not respond to new odors (p = 0.8749, t-test, n = 9 animals, trial one or p = 0.322, t-test, n = 9 animals, trial 1–5 vs baseline, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>) and TS dopamine strongly responded to new odors (p = 0.0059, t-test, n = 11 animals, trial one or p = 0.0027, t-test, n = 11 animals, trial 1–5 vs baseline, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–K</xref>). Indeed, TS dopamine showed excitation to 91% of new odor presentations (response in trial one vs baseline). Dopamine axon signals in mice repeatedly trained on learning odor-outcome contingencies displayed the same trends in the dynamics, but at a much faster rate: within a single session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) rather than over the course of weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). VS dopamine showed a decrease in US response followed by an increase in CS response, with no response to novel stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–F</xref>). TS dopamine decreased responses to either novel odor (nothing-predicting or water-predicting) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–L</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the dopamine response to novel odors, we also paired new odors with an aversive air puff in these well-trained mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). As in the cases of novel odors predicting water or nothing, VS dopamine showed no odor responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) and TS dopamine responded strongly to the novel odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Notably, the decrease in TS dopamine response to novel odors predicting air puff was much smaller than the decrease of TS dopamine response to novel odors predicting no outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the dynamics of the response depend on what the novel odor cue predicts.</p><p>Anticipatory licking in response to the rewarded odor increased after a few trials (p = 0.0387, paired t-test, n = 20 animals, trial 1–5 water CS lick vs baseline) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The animals showed differences in anticipatory licking frequency depending on cues within 10 trials of training (p = 0.000259, paired t-test, n = 20 animals, trial 6–10 water CS lick vs nothing CS lick), indicating learning of the outcomes of the odor cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

With respect to reward prediction, both VS and TS dopamine had a larger excitatory response to reward-predicting cues than cues predicting nothing (VS: p = 1.8x10<sup>−10</sup>, TS: p = 6.5x10<sup>−6</sup>, t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,D</xref>). Similarly, both VS and TS dopamine had a smaller response to a predicted reward than an unpredicted reward (VS: p = 5.1x10<sup>−11</sup>, TS: p = 1.0x10<sup>−4</sup>, t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,D</xref>). However, there was a significant difference in the response to the omission of a predicted reward: whereas VS dopamine showed a dip below baseline following reward omission (VS: p = 4.8x10<sup>−7</sup>, t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,D</xref>), TS dopamine axon signal was still significantly higher than baseline following omission (p = 2.2x10<sup>−8</sup>, t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,D</xref>). In TS, reward prediction elicited sustained activity over the interval between odor presentation and reward onset, and reward delivery caused only a small increase above this level. In fact, although the average peak response was slightly higher in rewarded trials than unrewarded trials (p = 0.0014), the total response (area under each curve) after the outcome (reward delivery or omission) did not differ significantly (p = 0.81).</p><p>Interestingly, we found that the signals observed in TS dopamine displayed components of prediction error in response to non-rewarding stimuli as well. For example, TS dopamine showed less excitation to predicted air puff or tone than unpredicted air puff or tone (p = 0.00016, p = 0.00074, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). Additionally, TS dopamine cue responses to air puff or tone predicting cues were larger than the responses to cues predicting no outcome (air puff: p = 6.8x10<sup>−4</sup>, tone: p = 3.4x10<sup>−4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). Similar to water omission, the omission of an expected tone or expected air puff did not cause a dip or increase in signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>).</p><p>In summary, VS dopamine encodes RPE whereas TS dopamine responds to salient stimuli in general. TS dopamine encodes the prediction of salient stimuli, and decreases the responses to salient stimuli once they are predicted, which are characteristics of prediction error. Notably, however, we did not observe clear responses to the omission of expected salient stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Organization of dopamine novelty responses in VS and TS</title><p>Finally, we examined the relationship between different responses in dopamine and location in the striatum more carefully. For this purpose, in addition to VS and TS, dopamine axon signals in more anterior parts of the dorsal striatum (DMS and DLS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) were recorded. Signals in each animal were pooled across sessions and the average was compared in relation to the location of recording sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

We next examined responses to cues predicting rewarding, neutral or aversive outcomes, and responses to the omission of reward.

Our data demonstrate dramatic differences between dopamine axon signals in the ventral striatum (VS) (hereafter, VS dopamine) and dopamine axon signals in the tail of the striatum (TS) (hereafter, TS dopamine). Over the course of associative learning, TS dopamine and VS dopamine exhibited opposite initialization to novel cues. Large TS dopamine responses to novel cues gradually decayed, whereas VS dopamine had no response to novel cues and gradually developed responses to cues that predicted reward. Our previous study showed that dopamine neurons that project to the TS are anatomical outliers compared to many other dopamine neurons including dopamine neurons that project to the VS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>). These new results suggest that dopamine neurons that project to TS are not only anatomically, but also functionally, distinct compared to dopamine neurons that project to VS.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Opposite initialization to novel cues in VS and TS dopamine</title><p>The novelty responses we observed in TS dopamine, and especially the lack of novelty responses in VS dopamine, stand in stark contrast to popular theories explaining how novelty responses could fit into the dopamine RPE framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hazy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kakade and Dayan, 2002</xref>). These theories proposed that dopamine neurons show ‘optimistic initialization’ to novel cues, promoting physical and/or computational exploration in search of potential rewards (often referred to as a ‘novelty bonus’). However, our results suggest that the ‘pure value’-coding VS dopamine axon signal does not include a novelty response, while the salience-coding TS dopamine axon signal does include a novelty response.</p><p>Over the course of classical conditioning, dopamine axon signals in VS and TS showed different coding principles. For a cue with an unknown outcome, VS dopamine initialized with no value prediction and gradually accumulated evidence for value, whereas TS dopamine began with a large excitation to novel cues and gradually decreased its responses. These dynamics can be conceptualized such that CS-value in VS dopamine was initialized with no value, while CS-salience in TS dopamine was initialized with very high salience.</p><p>The opposite dynamics in VS and TS dopamine during learning are reminiscent of two different views of associative learning: US associability and CS associability. Many models, including delta-rule, Rescorla-Wagner and temporal difference (TD) models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Widrow and Hoff, 1960</xref>), emphasize US associability; when an animal learns to associate a CS to a US, the nature of the <italic>US</italic> determines how well the animal can learn the association. In these models, US associability is determined by the prediction error of the US (i.e. the discrepancy between prediction and reality). Once the prediction error decreases, the US loses its effectiveness for creating an association with a CS. By contrast, other models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mackintosh, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pearce and Hall, 1980</xref>) emphasize CS associability; when an animal learns to associate a CS to a US, the nature of the CS determines how well the animal can learn the association. In these models, CS associability alters attention to a stimulus, or the storage of a stimulus in working memory, to promote association with a US.</p><p>Dopamine dynamics in VS are well suited to serve as US associability, the teaching signal of the Rescorla-Wagner model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>). TS dopamine does not follow the dynamics that the Rescola-Wagner model predicts. During the learning of novel odor-outcome associations, rather than US responses, CS responses were predominant and then decreased with learning. The dynamics of TS dopamine suggest that they may serve as CS associability, providing the attention signals for learning.</p><p>Novel stimuli may excite TS dopamine because of the unpredictability of the novel stimulus itself (i.e. it occurs with no cue or context predicting it) or because the outcome of these novel stimuli is unknown (i.e. they could predict a positive outcome, a neutral outcome, or a negative outcome). These two phenomena have been implemented in the framework of CS associability. For example, Wagner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wagner, 1978</xref>) proposed that CS associability is correlated with the weakness of CS-context association (or the ‘unpredictability’ of the CS in the context). On the other hand, Pearce and Hall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pearce and Hall, 1980</xref>) defined the CS associability as the unpredictability of the US (by the CS) in the previous trial. In either case, the novelty would promote learning because of high CS associability, although the latter model did not define CS associability on the very first trial. Our data could be explained with either framework, but one observed phenomenon prefers the latter model. The responses to a novel odor decreased more slowly when the odor was associated with some outcome (water or air puff) than when it was associated with no outcome. If novelty responses are determined solely by odor-context association, responses to both odors should decrease at the same speed. Furthermore, this would lead to an equal response to all familiar odors, which we did not observe.</p><p>Importantly, previous learning models incorporated teaching signals in the Rescorla-Wagner model and attention signals by novelty responses in one dopamine RPE system, with novelty responses as an exception or a bonus to the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hazy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kakade and Dayan, 2002</xref>). Here, we propose that CS associability, or the ‘attention’ term in dopamine signals may not be an exception in RPE, but instead may be a separate system – localized in particular brain regions such as in TS. Thus, dopamine in TS signals novelty and salience, and dopamine in VS signals RPE, although both systems may co-exist in some brain areas. In general, one big limitation of the current reinforcement learning algorithms is the so-called ‘curse of dimensionality’. As the number of stimuli in an environment becomes large as in most natural environments, it quickly becomes difficult to properly assign credit to relevant objects. Attention would be critical to reduce the amount of information for learning to a more realistic amount. Dopamine in TS may be specialized for this function. In line with this idea, a recent study suggested that putative dopamine neurons in lateral SNc in monkey represented ‘cognitive salience’, which was correlated with working memory load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsumoto and Takada, 2013</xref>). Behaviorally, previous studies suggested that SNc is important for the acquisition of enhanced CS associability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2006</xref>). Mechanistically, dopamine in the prefrontal cortex has been modeled to serve a ‘gating’ function to provide flexible updating in working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braver and Cohen, 1999</xref>), and a similar mechanism may apply to dopamine in TS. Of note, different from adjacent striatal areas, TS, categorized in caudal extreme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hintiryan et al., 2016</xref>), does not receive projections from sensorimotor cortex, suggesting a functional distinction from other areas in the striatum. All in all, TS dopamine may function to ‘pre-process’ sensory inputs to weigh potentially important stimuli to make reinforcement learning more efficient in a complex environment.</p><p>Thus, during the learning of an association between a stimulus and a reward, dopamine signals in VS and TS may cooperate. Salience prediction error in TS dopamine may serve as the CS associability of the stimulus, whereas value prediction error in VS dopamine may serve as the US associability of the reward. Alternatively, similar to value prediction error in VS dopamine during stimulus-reward association, salience prediction error in TS dopamine may reinforce stimulus-stimulus associations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Different time-courses of CS and US responses in dopamine axons during learning</title><p>In contrast to TS dopamine, VS dopamine activity appeared to faithfully signal RPE. Several theories have arisen to explain how the reward prediction error could be computed in the brain. Of these, popular models such as Houk’s model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Houk and Adams, 1995</xref>) and temporal difference (TD) models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sutton, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>) assume that a single system controls both CS-related and US-related dopamine firing. Under these models, higher expectation causes CS responses to become larger and US responses to become smaller at the same time. However, we observed that changes in CS and US responses were not simultaneous. In VS, the decrease in response to predicted rewards (US) was faster, occurring over the course of a single session, whereas the increase in response to reward-predicting odors (CS) required weeks of training. Over-training accelerated the time course of these events, but not their temporal order.</p><p>The development of CS responses in VS dopamine was also much slower than the associative learning observed at the behavioral level. By contrast, US responses decreased as anticipatory licking increased. These results demonstrate that US responses in VS dopamine are well suited as prediction error signals in the Rescorla-Wagner learning model, whereas CS responses are not time-locked to this learning.</p><p>The time course of CS responses we observed in VS dopamine is not easily explained by simple TD models. In these models, during learning, RPE signals gradually transfer from the timing of the reward to the timing of the preceding stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>). Although the step-wise transfer may explain a delay between the decrease of US responses and emergence of CS responses, such a gradual transfer has not been observed in single neuron recording of dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pan et al., 2005</xref>). With any learning rate longer than one trial, transferred signals may become temporally smeared until they become time-locked to the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>), which may not be detected in recording of single units. This theory would predict that we would observe some increase in signal between the stimulus and outcome (either smeared or sharp) during learning because the monitoring of population activity likely provides more reliable detection of small signals. However, this type of increase was not apparent with our bulk recording method. Instead, we observed a gradual development of a CS response directly following cue presentation. It is possible that distinct mechanisms could cause VS dopamine excitation in response to a reward-predicting CS and VS dopamine suppression in response to a predicted US, as proposed in several previous models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O'Reilly et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Relation to previous studies</title><p>There are different types of novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schomaker and Meeter, 2015</xref>). One example is spatial novelty, which could be signaled by different arrangements of objects/stimuli in the environment. This kind of environmental novelty is known to induce exploration of animals and accelerate learning in this environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Otmakhova et al., 2013</xref>). Another example is stimulus novelty, which is associated with objects/stimuli that animals have never encountered or do not remember. It has been reported that dopamine activity in VTA and dopamine in the ventral striatum increased in the former case, in novel environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Segovia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, in the present study, we focused on the latter type of novelty. Dopamine axon responses to novel stimuli were localized in TS. One potential explanation is that depending on the training history and environments, a given type of novelty may cause the animals to expect potential rewards, resulting in the excitation of the value system. Interestingly, previous studies found that different brain areas are responsible for different kinds of novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schomaker and Meeter, 2015</xref>). Further studies are needed to determine how dopamine in different striatal areas responds to different kinds of novelty in different training environments.</p><p>In our previous study, dopamine neurons that project to TS were mainly observed in the lateral SNc of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>). A previous study proposed that putative dopamine neurons in the lateral SNc of monkeys encode ‘motivational salience’, which is the absolute value of positive or negative ‘value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>). On the other hand, another study proposed that excitation of dopamine neurons in response to non-rewarding stimuli encodes the stimulus intensity, regardless of value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fiorillo et al., 2013</xref>). In the present study, the excitation of TS dopamine elicited by various neutral stimuli suggested that the responses in TS could be related to more general salience rather than motivational salience, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the tone and odor predicting nothing had positive or negative motivational values. On the other hand, the fact that signals encoded by TS dopamine are modulated by prediction suggests that they are not encoding pure physical salience (i.e. stimulus intensity). Instead, TS dopamine appears to encode general stimulus salience prediction error, which includes prediction-dependent suppression and prediction. The novelty responses we observed may be the extreme case of salience prediction error, causing large excitation because of minimum prediction, rather than an exception.</p><p>A recent study found that putative dopamine neurons which project to the tail of the caudate (part of posterior striatum) in monkey formed another group of dopamine neurons. These dopamine neurons did not respond to water reward but encoded ‘sustained values’ of visual cues, whereas putative dopamine neurons projecting to the anterior caudate encoded ‘updating values’, when cue-outcome contingency was frequently changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). However, our results indicate that the difference between VS and TS dopamine extends beyond their flexibility. The dynamics between them are different in nature, not only in learning speed. Most importantly, we found that TS dopamine did not encode ‘values’.</p><p>Where do salience signals come from? How are salience signals regulated by novelty and experiences? A map of monosynaptic inputs to TS-projecting dopamine neurons should provide critical information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies showed that various brain areas including olfactory and visual systems are modulated by experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boehnke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). Whether dopamine neurons receive this processed information from sensory systems or whether more abstract information about salience and novelty is passed to dopamine neurons and sensory systems in parallel is an open question. Of note, behavioral responses to novel odors are very quick, within one respiration cycle in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wesson et al., 2008</xref>). The responses to novel odors in TS dopamine that we observed began within 200 ms, most likely within one respiration cycle, suggesting a potential contribution at the early stages of novelty.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Technical considerations</title><p>Optical fiber fluorometry (fiber photometry) was developed by Kudo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kudo et al., 1992</xref>) and has been applied in many studies to record the population activity of neurons from cell bodies, dendrites, or axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelsberger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis and Schmidt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Murayama et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we recorded the population activity of dopamine axons in the striatum using GCaMP6m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akerboom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Parker et al., 2016</xref>). We should point out several limitations associated with the present technique. First, previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fiorillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schultz, 2015</xref>) proposed that there is a temporal separation of two signals (stimulus intensity and value) in single dopamine neurons. However, we may only be able to measure the sum of these signals because of the limited temporal resolution of our method (population calcium imaging using GCaMP6m). Second, a recent study found that dopamine axons with distinct signals (locomotion and reward) coexist in the dorsal-most part of the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>). Axons signaling different information might also co-exist in other areas of the striatum, and this could not be resolved with our bulk-imaging method (because such signals would effectively be ‘averaged’). Third, because the spatial resolution of z-axis is large with fluorometry (~500 µm), we have to be careful in interpreting the analysis of differences along dorsal-ventral axis.</p><p>Dopamine axons passing through and below the ventral striatum to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aransay et al., 2014</xref>) may have contributed to the signals in VS dopamine, although calcium transients in passing axons are smaller than in axon terminals and boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koester and Sakmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Llano et al., 1997</xref>). Finally, the activity of axons of dopamine neurons may not directly correspond to amounts of dopamine release at synapses or spike activities in cell bodies. Dopamine neurons that project to the ventral striatum (mainly medial shell) are able to co-release glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stuber et al., 2010</xref>). Neuronal activities can be modulated locally at axon terminals in the striatum by cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>). Most importantly, observed calcium transients may not reflect spike counts, because of autofluorescence, bleaching, motion artifacts and inevitable normalization. Although we only applied baseline normalization (i.e. signals were subtracted with and then divided by the average signal in a 1 s period before CS in each trial) in this study, additional methods using activity-independent wavelength of excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kudo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>) or examination of emission spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cui et al., 2013</xref>) may improve fidelity, especially in freely moving animals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that dopamine responses to novel stimuli are more localized than previously believed. We propose to revise current RPE models so that novelty-driven and salience-driven attention is attributed to TS dopamine, rather than added to the RPE framework as a bonus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kakade and Dayan, 2002</xref>). Thus, TS dopamine may be specialized for functions apart from value, such as attentional orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Redgrave et al., 1999</xref>), working attention, and/or as a filter for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braver and Cohen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dayan and Sejnowski, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsumoto and Takada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pearce and Hall, 1980</xref>). Further, our proposal includes another important point: RPE is not contaminated or distorted in VS dopamine. VS dopamine purely signals RPE, increasing the validity of the original ideas regarding dopamine’s role in reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>85 male adult mice were used.

Animals were housed on a 12 hr dark/12 hr light cycle (dark from 07:00 to 19:00), one to a cage, and performed the task at the same time each day. All procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Harvard Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Viral injections, fiber implants, and head-plate installation</title><p>To prepare animals for recording, we performed a single surgery with three key components: (1) AAV-FLEX-GCaMP virus infection into the midbrain, (2) head-plate installation, and (3) one or more optic fiber implants into the striatum. At the time of surgery, all mice were 2–3 months old. All surgeries were performed under aseptic conditions with animals anesthetized with isoflurane (1–2% at 0.5–1.0 l/min). Analgesia (ketoprofen, 5 mg/kg, I.P.; buprenorphine, 0.1 mg/kg, I.P.) was administered for 3 days following each surgery.</p><p>To express GCaMP specifically in dopamine neurons, we unilaterally injected 250 nl of AAV5-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6m (1 × 10<sup>12</sup> particles/ml, Penn Vector Core) into both the VTA and SNc (500 nl total). To target the VTA, we injected virus at Bregma −3.0, Lateral 0.6, at all depths between 4.5 and 4.0 mm. To target SNc, we injected virus at Bregma −3.3, Lateral 1.6, at all depths between 4.0 and 3.5 mm. Virus injection lasted several minutes, and then the injection pipette was slowly removed over the course of several minutes to prevent damage to the tissue.</p><p>So that mice could be head-fixed during recording, we installed a head-plate onto each mouse. To do this, we removed the skin above the surface of the brain, dried the skull using air, and glued the head-plate onto the top of the skull with C and B Metabond adhesive cement. We used circular head-plates to ensure that the skull above the striatum would be accessible for fiber implants. Finally, during the same surgery, we also implanted optic fibers into the VS, DMS, DLS, and TS (1–4 fibers per mouse). To do this, we first slowly lowered optical fibers (either 200 µm or 400 µm diameter, Doric Lenses) into the striatum. The coordinates we used for targeting were as follows: (VS) Bregma 1.0, Lateral 1.25, Depth 4.1, (DS) Bregma 0.0, Lateral 1.5, Depth 2.25, (DLS) Bregma −0.5, Lateral 2.75, Depth 2.5, (TS) Bregma −2.0, Lateral 3.25, Depth 2.5. Once fibers were lowered, we first attached them to the skull with UV-curing epoxy (Thorlabs, NOA81), and then a layer of black Ortho-Jet dental adhesive (Lang Dental). After waiting fifteen minutes for this glue to dry, we applied a very small amount of rapid-curing epoxy (Devcon, A00254) to attach the fiber cannulas even more firmly to the underlying glue and head-plate. After waiting fifteen minutes for the epoxy to dry, the surgery was complete.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Fiber fluorometry</title><p>Fiber fluorometry (photometry) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kudo et al., 1992</xref>) allows for recording of the activity of genetically defined neural populations in behaving mice by expressing a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, GCaMP6m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akerboom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) and chronically implanting an optic fiber. The optic fiber (200 µm or 400 µm diameter, Doric Lenses) allows chronic, stable, minimally disruptive access to deep brain regions and interfaces with a flexible patch cord (Doric Lenses) on the skull surface to simultaneously deliver excitation light (473 nm and 561 nm, Laserglow Technologies) and collect GCaMP and tdTomato fluorescence emission (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Activity-dependent fluorescence emitted by cells in the vicinity of the implanted fiber’s tip was spectrally separated from the excitation light using a dichroic, passed through a single band filter, and focused onto a photodetector connected to a current preamplifier (SR570, Stanford Research Systems). To record Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from dopamine terminals, we injected a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying the GCaMP6m gene into the VTA and SNc of transgenic DAT-Cre mice and implanted 200 µm or 400 µm diameter optic fibers in the striatum.</p><p>During recording, optic fibers were connected (1–2 per recording session) to patch cables which delivered excitation light (473 nm and 561 nm) and collected all emitted light. The emitted light was subsequently split and filtered (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and collected by a photodetector connected to a current preamplifier. This preamplifier output a voltage signal which was collected by a NIDAQ board. The NIDAQ board was connected to the same computer that was used to control odor, water, tone, and air puff delivery with Labview, so GCaMP and tdTomato signals could be readily aligned to task events such as odor delivery or reward delivery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavior</title><p>After surgery, mice were given three weeks to recover and become habituated to the installed head-plate and implanted optic fibers. Additionally, this allowed time for viral expression. After this recovery period, mice were handled for 2–3 days and water deprived. Weight was maintained above 90% of baseline body weight.</p><p>In the first 2–3 sessions, mice were head-fixed and given unexpected water at random intervals (randomly drawn, between 1 and 20 s, with a mean of 10 s and a normal distribution). This allowed mice to become habituated to being head-fixed and allowed us to determine the appropriate laser power (typically between 0.1 mW and 0.25 mW) to record &gt;5% dF/F free water responses (typically between 10% and 50%). These sessions were important, so that recordings during odor-water association could begin from the very first odor presentation on the first day of data collection (see Experimental Timeline).</p><p>The volume of water was constant for all reward trials (predicted or unpredicted) in all conditions. Similarly, the same mild tone (15 kHz, 0.5 s, ~50 dB) was used in all tone trials and the same intensity air puff was used in all air puff trials. Each behavioral trial began with an odor cue (a puff of odor lasting 1 s), followed by a 1 s delay, and then an outcome (either water, nothing, tone, or air puff). Odors were delivered using a custom olfactometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Uchida and Mainen, 2003</xref>). Each odor was dissolved in mineral oil at 1:10 dilution. 30 µl of diluted odor was placed inside a filter-paper housing (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ). Example PID measurements are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. Odors were selected pseudorandomly for each animal. Odorized air was further diluted with filtered air by 1:14 to produce a 1500 ml/min total flow rate. A variable inter-trial interval of 6–12 s (random) was placed between trials. All trial types were randomized in all of the sessions. Each day, the mice did about 300 trials over the course of about an hour. On a recording day, they performed the same task, and we recorded for ~45 min, which is approximately 250 trials, with constant excitation from the laser and continuous recording. Recordings from the same fiber were interspersed with at least two days of no recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Experimental timeline</title><p>On the first day of classical conditioning, odors were presented to mice for the first time, and either predicted no outcome or reward. We quantified the ‘novelty response’ as the response to the first odor presentation that the mouse experienced, which was associated with no outcome (for n = 13 VS-implanted mice and n = 12 TS-implanted mice). For comparison, the response to the first unpredicted water presentation in those sessions was quantified as well. These ‘novelty responses’ were the first trials of the first day of classical conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), while the average responses for these sessions are reported as ‘Day 1’ and compared with later sessions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Due to technical difficulties we encountered in recording the first response of a session, some of the first responses were not recorded. Therefore, the sample size (number of animals) is lower for first trial responses (n = 12 mice for TS) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> than for average responses during ‘Day 1’ (n = 19 mice for TS) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>During classical conditioning, odor cues (also called ‘conditioned stimuli’ or ‘CS’) were associated with either reward or no outcome. In the case of reward trials, water (the ‘unconditioned stimulus’ or ‘US’) would follow odor presentation after 2 s, 90% of the time (i.e. 10% omission). In ~10% of trials, unpredicted water was delivered without odor presentation. During training, GCaMP responses were recorded at time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) rather than daily, to minimize bleaching or tissue damage. After 3 weeks of this classical conditioning training (with one water predicting odor, one nothing-predicting odor, and occasional unpredicted water), mice were introduced to new odor-outcome association types.</p><p>At this point in training, mice were also presented with odor-tone associations (20% of trials) or odor-air puff associations (20% of trials), in addition to the two familiar odors associated with water and with no outcome, allowing us to multiplex data from learning onto this data regarding value or salience coding and prediction error coding. Unpredicted tone or air puff was also delivered in ~5% of trials. Data from these sessions was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, including data from DMS-implanted or DLS-implanted mice.</p><p>Finally, a subset of these mice (n = 11) were trained with two new odors each day (one associated with water and one associated with no outcome), every day for a week, until mice began to discriminate between odors behaviorally within a few trials (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) rather than over the course of many days (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We referred to these mice as ‘overtrained mice’. After this training, we recorded GCaMP and licking signals from these overtrained mice as they learned either new odor-water (one third of sessions) or new odor-nothing associations (one third of sessions) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. In one third of sessions, a new odor associated with air-puff was introduced in addition to the two familiar odors associated with water or with no outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We randomized whether the new odor of a session would predict water, nothing, or air puff to ensure that mice could not generalize that novel odors reliably predicted a particular outcome. Mice performed one session per day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fiber fluorometry and licking data analysis</title><p>GCaMP and tdTomato signals were collected as voltage measurements from the current preamplifiers using Labview (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The 'dF/F' measurement was calculated by comparing the average signal in a 1 s period before each trial (‘F<sub>1</sub>’) with the signal at any given point during the trial (‘F<sub>2</sub>’). The calculation for each point in the trial (calculated in 1 ms bins) was then simply dF/F = (F<sub>2</sub> – F<sub>1</sub>) / F<sub>1</sub>. We used this measurement because it readily normalized signals (i.e. in the case of low signal to noise ratio, the denominator would be larger). The average responses to a stimulus type within a session (often ~50 trials per stimulus type) were averaged, and these session averages were used as the data in each figure (individual session averages can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, and example individual single trial traces are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>These session averages were compared across animals in two basic ways. (1) Traces were averaged and plotted (as the average of all session averages) along with the standard error (the total number of sessions being the sample size) as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, left panels. (2) Peak responses to cues/outcomes were quantified by finding the point with the maximum absolute value during 2 s following cue/outcome for each trial, then comparing the averages between sessions as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, right panels. Because traces were aligned using task events (i.e. cue on time) rather than behavioral events (i.e. first inhalation), comparing peak responses ensured that signals, which were slightly offset in time relative to odor presentation, could be compared.</p><p>To compute the latency of responses to novel cues, each trial was tested for difference from baseline in the first five novel odor trials using time bins of 50 ms. We called the ‘latency’ of the response (in each trial) the center of the first time bin where five consecutive time bins all showed significant difference from baseline. To compute the latency of novelty discrimination, the sessions were tested for significant difference between familiar and novel odors in the first five trials using time bin of 50 ms. We called the ‘latency’ of discrimination the center of the first time bin where five consecutive time bins all showed significance.</p><p>While recording GCaMP signals, we also recorded licking. To measure licking, we used a detector that output a voltage based on the disruption of its infra-red light path. We set a threshold for signal corresponding to a ‘lick’ and then made the signal binary by finding each time point where the signal crossed the threshold so that it could easily be quantified. Our main quantification for licking was counting the number of ‘anticipatory licks’, the licks following an odor (CS) and preceding the arrival of the outcome (US).</p><p>GCaMP responses and licking responses were collected through Labview during the training for offline analysis. Statistical analyses (i.e. t-tests, ANOVA) were run using Matlab (Mathworks). All analyses considered a value of p≤0.05 significant, and exact p-values are reported in the text. To quantify body movement, we used a video camera to capture images of the mice while they performed the task and made a rough estimate of total body movement by subtracting each frame of the video from the last frame, using the ‘imabsdiff’ function in Matlab. We reported these values, which we took to be a proxy for body movement, as ‘arbitrary units’ or ‘a.u.’ because they were measured in pixels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Tissue clearing using CLARITY</title><p>Brains were cleared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>) at 37°C for 2 days, with a constant current of 1.2 amps.

A 5-gallon plastic container (US Plastic #97,028, Lima, Ohio, United States) was used as a clearing solution reservoir and tubing was run though a second 5-gallon plastic container filled with water to cool the solution flowing through it. Chambers were constructed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung and Deisseroth, 2013</xref>) using a Nalgene chamber (Nalgene 2118–0002, Rochester, NY, United States) and platinum wire (Sigma-Aldrich 267228, St. Louis, MO, United States). Clearing was done in a room held at 37°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Imaging using light-sheet microscope</title><p>Images were acquired with the Zeiss Z.1 Light-sheet microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Brains were glued to the tip of a 1 ml syringe (without needle) such that the posterior tip of the cerebellum was in contact with the syringe. A 488 nm laser was used to excite GFP and a 647 nm laser was used to produce autofluorescence. Images were collected through a 5× objective with PCO-Edge scMOS 16 bit cameras (PCO, Kelheim, Germany) with 1920 × 1920 pixels. Each frame was 2000 × 2000 μm, so each pixel was roughly 1.04 μm. The step size between images was set to 5.25 μm, so the voxels were not isotropic. Brains were imaged horizontally from the dorsal side, and then rotated 180° for horizontal imaging from the ventral side. Each view was tiled with 7 × 6 tiles (14,000 × 12,000 μm) and the two views were combined to create a continuous image. Autofluorescence images were subsequently downsized to 1400 × 1200 × 700 pixels for alignment to the reference space. In these downsized images, voxels have 10 μm spacing in all three dimensions. Brains were aligned to a previously described reference space comprised of the average of 25 brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>). Alignment to this reference space was performed using Elastix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klein et al., 2010</xref>). We performed affine alignment followed by B-spline alignment based on mutual information, as previously proposed for human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Metz et al., 2011</xref>). After alignment, fiber positions were manually determined by tracing the fiber paths to their termination points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Classification of implant sites</title><p>After clearing and imaging each brain as a whole volume and aligning these images to determine the exact location of each fiber, we classified each fiber as either (1) an implant into VS, (2) an implant into DS, (3) an implant into TS, or (4) an incorrectly targeted fiber. Our analysis in the current paper focuses on comparing VS-implanted fibers to TS-implanted fibers. Most implants were successfully targeted to VS or TS. We classified implants as successful based on the following criteria. For VS: any fiber within the nucleus accumbens core or shell, between Bregma 2.0 and Bregma 0. For DS: any fiber within the striatum anterior to Bregma 1.5. For TS: any fiber within the striatum posterior to Bregma −1.5. We discarded data from eight animals which had fibers incorrectly targeted. The fibers in these animals were often in areas of cortex directly adjacent to the intended recording site. We observed very little or no signal (compared to our other recordings) in these cases, likely due to the relatively sparse dopaminergic innervation of cortex relative to striatum in mouse.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank members of the Uchida lab for comments on the manuscript and helpful discussions.

They used fiber photometry to record calcium responses from DA axons and tracked these signals across learning. The major result is a dramatic difference between dopamine signals in the ventral striatum (VS) compared to the tail of the striatum (TS). While VS projecting DA neurons followed the classical reward prediction error patterns and did not respond to novel cues, TS projecting DA neurons responded strongly to novel cues and also to the overall salience of cues and outcomes. This is a beautiful manuscript reporting on a very timely and important topic. The design of the experiments is elegant and the observed difference between DA responses is striking. The manuscript is very well written and describes an important finding with attention to the points listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be important to measure the timecourse of the odor signals to assess whether cue responses in the TS are concordant with what is expected based on adaptation in the olfactory bulb or piriform cortex. Please use PID measurements of olfactometer output. This would also inform the issue of whether TS implements a novelty filter or rather it inherits novelty signals.</p><p>2) Why did the authors use TdTomato as the control instead of the 405 emission? Did the authors also collect this? Do the authors have some evidence that different emission wavelengths produce identical mechanical deflections, or might there be chromatic aberrations that make this different? At this point, the appropriate controls for fiber photometry are still up for discussion, so it would be useful to have the authors directly discuss this issue.</p><p>3) The description of TS signals beyond novelty and their relationship to RPE is confusing. Would it be correct to simplify the responses as the absolute value of RPE plus a novelty bonus? Either way, please clarify.</p><p>4) It was not convincing that the neutral tone stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) are perceived as truly neutral. Why then do they provoke negative inflections in the RPE-type signal observed in VS? Perhaps video tracking of startle response would help to exclude this possibility.</p><p>5) The authors should not discuss the signals as &quot;dopamine signals&quot; as they are only looking at the calcium transients within dopamine neurons that may co-release glutamate. They should instead refer to these signals as &quot;signals from VTA DAT+ neurons in the VS or TS&quot; or something similar, and separately discuss what this can reflect.</p><p>6) It would be important to see histology showing representative expression of GCaMP-expressing fibers in each of the regions sampled</p><p>7) How much of the photometry signal is due to terminals versus axons of passage?</p><p>8) Regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: What happens if the authors sort the trials where there was licking versus no licking (in water trials) in terms of the response to the water delivery.

During odor-association learning, we observed that novel-odor-cue-evoked calcium signals in TS-projecting dopamine axons decreased within a session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for initial learning and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> for repeated learning), as well as over days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>One potential explanation for the within-session decrease in signal could be that the effective concentration of the odorants decreased over time within a session, and that the TS dopamine axon signals encode stimulus intensity and merely reflect the concentration change. To test this idea, we quantified the change in the effective concentration of the odorants used in our study over trials within a session, as well as the latency of odor delivery within single trials, using a photoionization detector (PID) (Aurora Scientific, 200B: miniPID Dispersion Sensor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that some odors were slow to decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>), and others decayed significantly over the course of a session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Therefore, we split our odors into two groups, based on whether they decayed slowly or quickly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We then compared TS dopamine axon responses to novel odor cues based on the stability of the odorant over time. We found that responses to both types of odors decreased dramatically over the course of a session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Another way to address this potential concern is to look at TS dopamine axon responses to a familiar odor over the course of a session. We performed this analysis and found that responses to familiar cues were stable over the course of a session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Finally, we also observed a decrease in responses to novel odors across days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which would not be affected by any within-session decay of odor concentration. Taken together, we do not think that changes in odorant concentrations affected our main conclusions. We added sentences to the Results section, as specified below.</p><p>“To determine whether this decrease in signal was caused by a decrease in effective odor concentration within sessions, we compared responses to fast-decaying and slow-decaying odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). TS dopamine responses to novel odors, both fast-decaying and slow-decaying odors, decreased over the course of a session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), whereas TS dopamine responses to familiar odors did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).”</p><p>Whether the decrease of TS dopamine axon responses to novel cues is due to sensory adaptation is also a fundamental question meriting some discussion. First, studies using anesthetized animals have shown that neurons in the piriform cortex, but not in the olfactory bulb, quickly adapt to repeated odor presentations, and recover in a relatively short time period, normally within tens of seconds (Wilson 1998, Best and Wilson 2004). Our observation that dopamine novelty response decreases over days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) cannot be explained simply by this type of adaptation. In addition, the decay in response was unique to novel odors and we did not observe similar decay in signal elicited by familiar odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Further, the speed of decrease in responses to novel odors depends on whether the odor predicted nothing, water, or air puff. We observed that TS dopamine axon responses to novel odors decreased more slowly when the novel odor predicted water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) or airpuff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) than when it did not predict any outcome. It is unlikely that these differences in the decay time course can be explained simply by sensory adaptation.</p><p>A recent study suggested that neurons in the olfactory bulb of awake mice (Kato et al., 2012) modulated their responses to the repetitive exposure of odors following more complicated principles than the simple adaptation observed in olfactory sensory neurons (Chaput, 2000). Kato et al. showed that neurons in the olfactory bulb quickly reduced their responses to odors following repetitive exposure (within a session) and that the effects of exposure lasted for over a month. Although we cannot directly compare the time-course because of the difference of tasks (i.e. the odor presentations are interspersed with other trial types in our task, rather than repeated consecutively as in their task), the dynamics in olfactory bulb are comparable to our observation in TS dopamine axon signals.</p><p>It is also important to discuss the latency of novelty detection within a trial. Behaviorally, novelty detection occurs within 200 ms; immediately after a single sniff (Wesson et al., 2008). In order to understand which brain area could function as a novelty filter, as the reviewers mentioned, it is very important to examine the temporal dynamics of neuronal signals in response to novelty. We found that the median latency of TS dopamine axon responses to novel odors in naïve mice was 140 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) and the median latency of discrimination between novel and familiar odor in trained mice was 170 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We plotted the average of the responses to the first 5 presentations of a novel odor in 12 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). The short latency of these responses means that the signal is likely to arise within the first sniff, based on a previously reported sniff rate of 3.4 Hz (294ms/cycle) (Kato et al., 2012). Because we used GCaMP, a calcium-based indicator, our temporal resolution is somewhat limited. This is also an issue with the previous studies that we mentioned (Kato et al., 2012, Wesson et al., 2008). Notably, the peak of the average response we observed in TS dopamine axon responses to novel odors was not until 600 ms after odor delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>In order to understand the precise temporal relationship between these signals, functional analysis and more precise measurements of timing (single unit and simultaneous awake recording), as well as consideration of temporal coding in the olfactory bulb (Cury and Uchida, 2010) is necessary. In short, our results demonstrate that TS dopamine axons signal novelty quickly (within the first sniff), but future studies will examine which brain area or areas function as novelty filters. We added a brief paragraph to the Discussion (subsection “Relation to previous studies”) to address this issue.</p><p>“Where do salience signals come from? How are salience signals regulated by novelty and experiences? A map of monosynaptic inputs to TS-projecting dopamine neurons should provide critical information (Menegas et al., 2015). Previous studies showed that various brain areas including olfactory and visual systems are modulated by experience (Boehnke et al., 2011; Kato et al., 2012). Whether dopamine neurons receive this processed information from sensory systems or whether more abstract information about salience and novelty is passed to dopamine neurons and sensory systems in parallel is an open question. Of note, behavioral responses to novel odors are very quick, within one sniff in rats (Wesson et al., 2008). The responses to novel odors in TS dopamine that we observed began within 200 ms, most likely within one sniff, suggesting a potential contribution at the early stages of novelty.”</p><p><italic>2) Why did the authors use TdTomato as the control instead of the 405 emission? Did the authors also collect this? Do the authors have some evidence that different emission wavelengths produce identical mechanical deflections, or might there be chromatic aberrations that make this different? At this point, the appropriate controls for fiber photometry are still up for discussion, so it would be useful to have the authors directly discuss this issue.</italic> </p><p>Optical fiber fluorometry has long been used in various preparations (Kudo et al., 1992, Duff Davis and Schmidt, 2000, Adelsberger et al., 2005, Murayama et al., 2007). Signals collected from excitation with different wavelengths are sometimes used to normalize signals with the goal of removing the effects of autofluorescence, bleaching, and movement (Kudo et al., 1992, Lerner et al., 2015). This is an especially important consideration in freely moving animals, where the interface between the implanted fiber and the patch cord used to collect signal can cause additional artifacts. In this paper, we used a head-fixed preparation and reported the signal from GCaMP. We did not normalize by the tdTomato signal because we were not confident that the ratio of GCaMP: tdTomato would be constant between mice. Specifically, TdTomato levels were likely to be similar (because this was genetically encoded), but the virally-delivered GCaMP was likely to be present at slightly different levels in each animal. This problem would not likely be solved by using 405 nm excitation to separately collect a baseline as previously outlined (Lerner et al., 2015) because this autofluorescence signal would also not scale with GCaMP infection size. We added sentences in the Discussion (“Technical considerations”).</p><p>“Most importantly, calcium transients may not enhance spike counts, because of autofluorescence, bleaching, motion artifacts and inevitable normalization. Although we only applied baseline normalization in this study, additional methods using activity-independent wavelength of excitation (Kudo et al., 1992; Lerner et al., 2015) or examination of emission spectrum (Cui et al., 2013) may improve fidelity, especially in freely moving animals.”</p><p>In order to avoid drift in signals due to bleaching, we minimized laser power for each mouse (approximately 0.25 mW, subject to slight fluctuations in power between days) and ensured that our recording was limited to approximately 45 min per day. Additionally, although we trained mice every day, we recorded only at time points during training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We found that responses to free water did not change significantly within sessions in VS dopamine axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) or TS dopamine axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We added this to our Results section as well (Results “Excitation to novel cues in TS dopamine”).</p><p>“To determine whether changes in signal intensity observed within a session were likely to have been related to bleaching, we compared responses to free water and familiar odors over the course of sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that both VS dopamine responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and TS dopamine responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) to free water remained constant within sessions. Similarly, TS dopamine responses to familiar odors predicting no reward remained constant as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).”</p><p>To determine whether our signals were likely to have been contaminated by movement-related artifacts, we collected video of mice (n=6) performing the task and analyzed body movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We quantified total body movement from all regions of the mouse, and found that they were not time-locked with novel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>) or familiar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>) odor presentation. However, we did find that there was body movement time-locked to the delivery of odors predicting reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This is not surprising, because mice often perform a type of approach behavior (taking a few steps) when they expect reward, despite being head-fixed. We added a paragraph regarding motion artifacts to the results (Results “Excitation to novel cues in TS dopamine”). Moreover, the tdTomato traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> show that in the case of free water trials, when mice start licking at water delivery, no change in signal was observed in the tdTomato signal. Taken together, our analysis does not support the idea that the signals we discuss in the manuscript are contaminated by movement artifacts (gross body movements or licking).</p><p>“To determine whether the signals we observed could have been caused by a movement-related artifact, we used video analysis to quantify the total body movements of mice performing the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We found that mice did not show gross body movements in response to odors predicting no outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>) or novel odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>), although they performed a stereotypical approach behavior in response to odors predicting reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) The description of TS signals beyond novelty and their relationship to RPE is confusing. Would it be correct to simplify the responses as the absolute value of RPE plus a novelty bonus? Either way, please clarify.</italic> </p><p>There is a controversy about the excitation of dopamine neurons in response to aversive stimuli, and we therefore tried to avoid oversimplifying our results.</p><p>Hikosaka and colleagues (Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009) found that some dopamine neurons are activated by both aversive and appetitive stimuli. They interpreted this result as dopamine neurons encoding “motivational salience” (the absolute value of RPE). In this definition, it is the “aversiveness” or “negative value” of the stimulus that makes these stimuli motivationally salient. However, Fiorillo (Fiorillo et al., 2013) acquired a very similar dataset, but proposed that the excitation of dopamine neurons was better explained by stimulus intensity. He argued that this excitation was not correlated with aversion, which he estimated based on choice preferences. Unfortunately, our task was not designed to distinguish between these possibilities. Nonetheless, our data do not perfectly match with either of the ideas. First, we observed similar amplitudes of excitation in response to water and a very quiet tone in thirsty mice. For comparison to other studies, a 90 dB tone did not affect the utility function in thirsty monkeys (Fiorillo et al., 2013), and we used a 55 dB tone with our thirsty mice. Second, we also observed large responses to novel cues. We think that it is important to distinguish these TS dopamine axon signals from those proposed in previous studies. We therefore propose that signals in TS are general salience prediction error signals (containing both salience and novelty) rather than conceptualizing them as the absolute value of salience plus a separate bonus for novelty.</p><p>We cannot formally exclude other possibilities regarding TS dopamine axon signals. For example, if novel odors and mild tones are both aversive, TS dopamine axons could be signaling the absolute value of RPE. Or, as a reviewer suggested, responses to novel cues might be differentially conceptualized as a “bonus” added to the signal rather than an aspect of salience. We rephrased parts of our Results and Discussion to try to make our proposals clearer (Discussion “Relation to previous studies”).</p><p>“A previous study proposed that putative dopamine neurons in the lateral SNc of monkeys encode ‘motivational salience’, which is the absolute value of positive or negative ‘value’ (Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009). On the other hand, another study proposed that excitation of dopamine neurons in response to non-rewarding stimuli encodes stimulus intensity, regardless of value (Fiorillo et al., 2013). In the present study, the excitation of TS dopamine elicited by various neutral stimuli suggested that the responses in TS could be related to more general salience rather than motivational salience, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the tone and odor predicting nothing had positive or negative motivational values. On the other hand, the fact that signals encoded by TS dopamine are modulated by prediction suggests that they are not encoding pure physical salience (i.e. stimulus intensity). Instead, TS dopamine appears to encode general stimulus salience prediction error, which includes prediction-dependent suppression and prediction. The novelty responses we observed may be the extreme case of salience prediction error, causing large excitation because of minimum prediction, rather than an exception.”</p><p><italic>4) It was not convincing that the neutral tone stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) are perceived as truly neutral. Why then do they provoke negative inflections in the RPE-type signal observed in VS? Perhaps video tracking of startle response would help to exclude this possibility.</italic></p><p>To address this concern, we have performed behavioral measurements of responses to tones of various sizes. We found that there was not a large behavioral response to the size of tone that we used. However, we cannot say with certainty that the tone was not slightly aversive, so we changed our language in the text from “neutral tone” to “mild tone” or “quiet tone”.</p><p>To try to minimize the aversiveness of the tone, we used a very small 55 dB tone for this experiment. For reference, ambient noise in the room where recordings were performed was approximately 50 dB. Startle responses have been observed in response to very loud tones, in experiments with background tones that were louder than the tone that we chose (105 dB startle stimulus with 65-80 dB background with monkeys, Schneider et al., 2013, 139 dB with 70 dB background with rats, Hoffman and Searle, 1967, 110 dB with mice, Ouagazzal et al., 2001, 118 dB startle stimulus with 72 dB background with mice, Sallinen et al., 1998). It should also be noted that startle experiments could also actually have a component of perceptual salience (or, “surprise”), rather than pure aversion.</p><p>Because we used a tone that was not much louder than the background noise in the room, and because mice became familiar with this tone, we do not think that it was perceived as aversive. To test this, we measured the behavioral responses of mice when presented with tones of different volumes: 55 dB to 105 dB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that mice did not generally respond to smaller tones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and a louder tone was required to cause mice to freeze or remain motionless (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We plotted the relationship between tone intensity and motion, and found that freezing occurred in response to tones larger than approximately 80 dB in our condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Again, for comparison, the tone that we used in experiments was only 55 dB – and mice did not tend to freeze in response to this tone.</p><p>Fiorillo examined the effect of a louder tone (90 dB) on the utility function in a water-reward-choice tasks, and showed that their tone did not cause aversion in monkeys (Fiorillo et al., 2013). This means that the sound did not bias the monkey’s choice such that it would prefer an equally valuable option less often to prevent the sound from being played. Based on these (admittedly indirect) pieces of evidence, we suggest that signals in TS are likely to encode general salience rather than aversion or the absolute value of “value”. However, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the 55 dB tone we chose was aversive to mice. Therefore, we rephrased the related sections of the paper. Specifically, we replaced “neutral” to “non-rewarding” in the Results and added a discussion on the behavioral responses we observed to this tone (Results section). Please also see Essential Revision #3.</p><p>“Responses to rewarding and non-rewarding stimuli in VS and TS dopamine</p><p>After several weeks of this training, in some sessions, trials with odors predicting either a mild tone (55 dB) or an air puff were interleaved in addition to trials with water and trials with no outcome. We chose a very mild tone with a similar intensity to the background noise in the room to try to minimize the aversiveness of this stimulus. To estimate the aversiveness of auditory stimuli, we measured the behavioral responses to tones of different volumes in a different set of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that quiet tones did not cause freezing.”</p><p>The question of why we observed decreases in VS dopamine in response to tone is interesting, and likely to be related. Our tasks include a high probability of reward (~50% of trials are rewarded). In such high reward contexts, neutral stimuli might be interpreted as a signal for “no reward” because they predict that reward will not come in the very near future (Fiorillo, 2013, Matsumoto et al., 2016). Because of this, we have to be careful when interpreting inhibition in VS caused by tone-predicting odor cues or by tones themselves. Notably, familiar odors predicting no outcome also caused a negative inflection in the RPE-type signal that we observed in VS that was similar in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) The authors should not discuss the signals as &quot;dopamine signals&quot; as they are only looking at the calcium transients within dopamine neurons that may co-release glutamate. They should instead refer to these signals as &quot;signals from VTA DAT+ neurons in the VS or TS&quot; or something similar, and separately discuss what this can reflect.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer. We changed our wording in many parts of the paper (Abstract, Introduction and other places) to make it clear that the signals we observed are due to increases in calcium in the axons of midbrain dopamine neurons (DAT+) found in either VS or TS. We added a detailed explanation of our nomenclature in the Introduction and at the beginning of the Results section and added some discussion of the meaning of these axon signals in the Discussion section (Introduction, Results “Recording activity from dopamine axons in the striatum”, Discussion “Technical considerations”).</p><p>“We will call the bulk calcium signal that we observed from the axons of DAT+ midbrain dopamine neurons in the striatum “VS dopamine” and “TS dopamine” in the following sections”.</p><p>“We used optical fiber fluorometry (fiber photometry) to record bulk calcium signals from the axons of midbrain dopamine neurons projecting to several regions of the striatum (Kim et al., 2016; Kudo et al., 1992; Parker et al., 2016).”</p><p>“In this study, we recorded the population activity of dopamine axons in the striatum using GCaMP6m (Chen et al., 2013; Akerboom et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2016; Parker et al., 2016).”</p><p><italic>6) It would be important to see histology showing representative expression of GCaMP-expressing fibers in each of the regions sampled</italic> </p><p>We added images of GCAMP-expressing fibers throughout the striatum in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. Specifically, we showed representative images from an animal with no virus injection (first row), VTA virus injection (second row), SNC virus injection (third row), and VTA+SNC virus injection (fourth row). All data in the paper was collected from animals with injections into both VTA and SNC.</p><p><italic>7) How much of the photometry signal is due to terminals versus axons of passage?</italic> </p><p>It is difficult to exclude the possibility of having collected signals from passing axons, we estimated that most of the signals we observed come from axon terminals based on four arguments to this effect.</p><p>First, the striatum is the main target of dopamine neurons and projections to other areas are much weaker than projection to the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Second, tracing studies of single dopamine neurons have shown that the striatum is the termination point of dopamine neurons, such that single dopamine neurons have a massive arborization in the striatum and that dopamine neurons which project to other brain areas do not pass through the striatum, with the notable exception of dopamine neurons that project to the cortex (Aransay et al., 2015, Cebrian and Prensa, 2010, Matsuda et al., 2009, Gauthier et al., 1999). Although the cortex shows much weaker labeling of dopamine axons than other areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), axons passing under VS potentially contributed to the signals in VS (Aransay et al., 2015). The axon tract from the midbrain to the forebrain runs along the ventral part of the brain, so any contamination of our signal was much more likely in VS than TS. Third, dopamine neurons that project to TS and VS are largely segregated and we did not observe axons passing through the opposite targets. Notably, dopamine neurons that target a particularly part of the striatum seldom pass through other parts of the striatum (Aransay et al., 2015, Cebrian and Prensa, 2010, Matsuda et al., 2009, Gauthier et al., 1999). Fourth, calcium transients in passing axons are much weaker than in axon terminals and boutons (Koester and Sakmann, 2000, Llano et 10, 1997). We added these points to our discussion (Discussion “Technical considerations”).</p><p>“Dopamine axons passing through and below the ventral striatum to the cortex (Aransay et al., 2014) may have contributed to the signals in VS dopamine, although calcium transients in passing axons are smaller than in axon terminals and boutons (Koester and Sakmann, 2000; Llano et al., 1997).”</p><p><italic>8) Regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: What happens if the authors sort the trials where there was licking versus no licking (in water trials) in terms of the response to the water delivery. No licking may indicate that the mouse did not recognize/detect/attend to the odor cue?</italic> </p><p>We sorted our data based on anticipatory licking (rather than time) and plotted responses to new water-predicting odors and water delivery in VS and TS. We added a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Particularly this figure makes it clear that VS dopamine cue responses do not develop until after behavioral learning occurs. Additionally, it shows that TS cue responses were present before changes in behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is in agreement with our proposal regarding “CS effectiveness” and “US effectiveness” (discussed below). Trial-to-trial correlation was also observed in a previous study of VTA dopamine neurons (Matsumoto et al., 2016). These data may support the relationship between responses and task engagement and/or learning, but we do not have direct evidence that they are related to attention and/or perception.</p><p><italic>9) It would be nice to see the anatomy: if the authors retrogradely label VTA DA neurons that project to VS versus TS, where do these TS neurons reside? What is the distribution? This would be helpful information in terms of joining this information with the work by Stephan Lammel on the arrangement of VTA DA neurons projecting to mPFC or NAc m shell or NAc l shell.</italic> </p><p>We compared 8 subpopulations of dopamine neurons, including ones projecting to mPFC, and published this data in our previous paper (Menegas et al., 2015). VS-projecting DA neurons are mostly found in the VTA and TS-projecting DA neurons are mostly found in the lateral part of the SNC. This segregation along the medial-lateral axis could roughly coincide with the segregation of axons in the striatum along the anterior-posterior axis. We referenced this in the Discussion (“Relation to previous studies”).</p><p>“In our previous study, dopamine neurons that project to TS were mainly observed in the lateral SNc of mice (Menegas et al., 2015). A previous study proposed that putative dopamine neurons in the lateral SNc of monkeys encode ‘motivational salience’, which is the absolute value of positive or negative ‘value’ (Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009).”</p><p><italic>10) Did the authors control for the order of all of the manipulations? Were the order of manipulations randomized for both the trial types within A, B, C and the epochs (particularly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>)?</italic> </p><p>Trial types in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> were randomized.

Within a session, all trial types were randomized. Reward sessions, reward and air puff sessions, and reward and tone sessions were also randomized. We apologize for having poorly described our task parameters. We added an explanation of trial types and the order of sessions (Results (“Responses to rewarding and non-rewarding stimuli in VS and DS dopamine”) and Materials and methods (“Behavior”)).
