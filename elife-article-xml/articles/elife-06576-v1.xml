where and how this occurs in the brain is unknown. To identify the neural substrate for these debilitating disorders, we induced both tinnitus and hyperacusis with an ototoxic drug (salicylate) and used behavioral, electrophysiological, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to identify the tinnitus–hyperacusis network. Salicylate depressed the neural output of the cochlea, but vigorously amplified sound-evoked neural responses in the amygdala, medial geniculate, and auditory cortex. Resting-state fMRI revealed hyperactivity in an auditory network composed of inferior colliculus, medial geniculate, and auditory cortex with side branches to cerebellum, amygdala, and reticular formation. Functional connectivity revealed enhanced coupling within the auditory network and segments of the auditory network and cerebellum, reticular formation, amygdala, and hippocampus. A testable model accounting for distress, arousal, and gating of tinnitus and hyperacusis is proposed.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06576.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06576.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06576.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>One in three adults over the age of 65 will experience a significant loss of hearing. This is often worsened by related conditions, such as: tinnitus, an unexplained constant buzzing or ringing sound; and hyperacusis, whereby everyday sounds are perceived as too loud or painful.</p><p>Most hearing loss is caused by damage to the sound-sensitive cells within a structure in the inner ear called the cochlea. Some studies have also identified regions of the brain that show abnormal activity in people with tinnitus and hyperacusis. However, the results from different patients have often been inconsistent and sometimes contradictory, and so it remains unclear what exactly causes these conditions.</p><p>To overcome this problem, Chen et al. made use of the fact that tinnitus and hyperacusis are common short-term side effects of certain drugs and measured the brain activity in rats before and after they were given one such drug. Before receiving the drug, the rats had first been trained to expect to receive a food pellet from the left side of their cage when they heard a steady buzzing sound. The rats were also trained to expect a food pellet from their right if they heard nothing at all. Shortly after receiving the drug, the rats often failed to respond correctly in the ‘quiet tests’ and behaved like they were already experiencing a constant buzzing sound, as would be expected if they had tinnitus. Further tests confirmed that the drug also triggered behavior in the rats that is typical of people with hyperacusis.</p><p>Chen et al. then discovered that the drug treatment reduced the nerve signals that are sent from a rat's cochlea. Moreover, the drug treatment greatly increased the activity in response to sound within parts of the rat's brain; these and other parts of the brain also became overactive in drug-treated rats in the absence of sound. Finally, further experiments revealed that drug-treated rats had stronger connections between these brain regions than in normal rats.</p><p>Chen et al. used these results to propose a model to explain the underlying causes of tinnitus and hyperacusis. However, because the drug treatment only induces short-term hearing impairment, further studies are needed to see if this model also applies when these conditions are long-term.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06576.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06576.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A third of adults over the age of 65 suffer from significant hearing loss, a condition exacerbated by two debilitating condition, subjective tinnitus, a phantom ringing or buzzing sensation, and hyperacusis, normal sounds perceived as intolerably loud or even painful. Roughly 12% of adults experience tinnitus, but the prevalence skyrockets to 50% in young combat personnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leske, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cave et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Michikawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hebert et al., 2013</xref>). Tinnitus is costly with more than $2 billion paid annually in veteran disability payments. Hyperacusis affects roughly 9% of adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2002</xref>), but its prevalence is likely higher because of the difficulty of self-diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gu et al., 2010</xref>). Remarkably, among those whose primary complaint is hyperacusis, 90% also suffer from tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baguley, 2003</xref>). Since tinnitus and hyperacusis are often triggered by cochlear hearing loss, it was long assumed that these auditory distortions resulted from hyperactivity disorders in the peripheral auditory nerve. This hypothesis, however, is contradicted by studies showing that auditory nerve spontaneous and sound-evoked firing rates are depressed in subjects with cochlear damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kiang et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, surgical section of the auditory nerve fails to eliminate tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baguley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lockwood et al., 2001</xref>). These negative results plus recent imaging studies now suggest that tinnitus and hyperacusis arise from maladaptive neuroplastic change in the central nervous system (CNS) provoked by cochlear pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lockwood et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Husain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sereda et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Several models of tinnitus and hyperacusis have been proposed that involve increased central gain, altered functional connectivity (FC), and aberrant neural oscillations in neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weisz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sereda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henry et al., 2014</xref>). Most of these conceptual models have emerged from human imaging studies using magnetoencephalography, electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and functional MRI (fMRI) of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llinas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weisz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moazami-Goudarzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leaver et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maudoux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Husain and Schmidt, 2014</xref>). In the context of central gain models, some human imaging data indicate that hyperacusis is associated with enhanced sound-evoked activity in multiple-auditory processing centers, namely auditory cortex (ACx), medial geniculate body (MGB), and inferior colliculus (IC), whereas tinnitus can be triggered solely by enhanced central gain in the ACx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gu et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, active loudness models suggest that tinnitus arises entirely from increased central noise independent of gain, whereas hyperacusis results exclusively from increased nonlinear gain that results in loudness intolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zeng, 2013</xref>).</p><p>While cross-sectional human brain imaging studies have identified many different sites of aberrant neural activity, published results from patients have often produced diverse, inconsistent, or contradictory findings. Some discrepancies are likely due to confounding factors such as patient heterogeneity, unknown etiology, genetic diversity, social and environmental factors, and duration or severity of tinnitus and hyperacusis. Animal models could potentially overcome many of these limitations provided that tinnitus and hyperacusis can be reliably induced, behaviorally measured, and functionally imaged. While tinnitus can develop in some individuals after intense noise exposure, the percentage of affected individuals is highly variable and its duration is unpredictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heffner and Harrington, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lobarinas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heffner, 2011</xref>). High doses of aspirin, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, have long been known to consistently induce acute tinnitus in humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Myers and Bernstein, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Myers et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mongan et al., 1973</xref>). Moreover, high-dose sodium salicylate (SS), the active ingredient in aspirin, not only consistently induces tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jastreboff et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lobarinas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stolzberg et al., 2013</xref>), but also hyperacusis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayes et al., 2014</xref>); these perceptual disorders disappear a day or two post-treatment. The highly predictable time course of SS-induced tinnitus and hyperacusis makes it an extremely powerful tool for studying the neural correlates of these perceptual disturbances. Therefore, we took advantage of our unique behavioral techniques for assessing SS-induced tinnitus and hyperacusis in rats and combined this with focused electrophysiological measurements plus global fMRI assessment techniques to map out the regions of neural hyperactivity and enhanced FC that characterize the tinnitus–hyperacusis network. To identify regions of heightened or depressed spontaneous neural activity, we measured the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in resting-state fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wen et al., 2013</xref>) and combined this with resting-state FC to identify regions of increased or decreased functional coupling between regions of the auditory pathway and other parts of the CNS. This is the first animal study to use ALFF and FC combined with detailed electrophysiological measures to provide a comprehensive neurological map of the tinnitus–hyperacusis network.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Three complimentary experiments involving behavioral, electrophysiological, and functional imaging were conducted in separate groups of rats. In Experiment 1, three behavioral studies were performed on separate groups of rats to assess SS-induced tinnitus, hyperacusis, and startle reflex hyperactivity. In Experiment 2, electrophysiological measurements were carried out on a separate group of rats to determine how SS altered the neural input/output functions in cochlea, as reflected in the compound action potential (CAP) from the auditory nerve, and the local field potentials (LFP) recorded in the MGB, ACx, and lateral amygdala (LA). In Experiment 3, resting-state fMRI studies were conducted in another group of rats to determine how SS altered the ALFF and FC patterns obtained with seeds placed in ACx, MGB, and IC.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Tinnitus</title><p>To determine if SS-induced tinnitus, we tested three rats using our 2AFC-tinnitus paradigm.

During baseline testing (B1–B4; B6–B9), rats correctly identified Quiet (no sound stimulus) trials at greater than 70% correct and AM and NBN trials &gt;80% correct. The saline-control treatment had no noticeable effect on performance during Quiet, NBN, or AM trials. However, when the rats were treated with SS, performance dropped to 50% or less only on Quiet trials, that is, rats shifted their response preference from the feeder associated with Quiet to the feeder associated with a continuous NBN, behavior indicative of tinnitus.

The same amount of threshold shift occurred at higher levels of the auditory pathway indicating that the SS-induced hearing loss originates in the cochlea and is relayed centrally. SS also reduced the CAP neural output by ∼70% at suprathreshold intensities. Paradoxically, suprathreshold LFP amplitudes in the MGB, ACx, and LA were larger than normal despite the massive reduction in the output of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). These provocative findings provide compelling evidence for an increase in central gain, a form of homeostatic plasticity implicated in tinnitus and hyperacusis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Salvi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auerbach et al., 2014</xref>). The enhanced LFPs seen in ACx are consistent with the enhanced fMRI response observed in the ACx of tinnitus patients, whereas the enhanced LFPs seen in both ACx and MGB are consistent with the enhanced fMRI responses observed these regions in hyperacusis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gu et al., 2010</xref>). These results are consistent with previous models and data linking tinnitus and loudness intolerance to increased central gain in the central auditory pathway in particular regions from the IC to ACx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Salvi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Qiu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auerbach et al., 2014</xref>). In some models, enhanced central gain amplifies central neural noise resulting in tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Noreña, 2010</xref>). However, in other models, central neural noise increases independent of central gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zeng, 2013</xref>); this could potentially explain why some patients only experience tinnitus, but not hyperacusis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baguley, 2003</xref>). However, this distinction is clouded by the fact that many tinnitus patients are unaware of their mild hyperacusis, that is, hyperacusis may be more prevalent in tinnitus patients than currently believed because many patients are unaware of their hyperacusis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Many cellular mechanisms could enhance central gain, but one likely candidate is reduced inhibition (disinhibition). Considerable evidence exists for dysregulated inhibition in central gain-control models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auerbach et al., 2014</xref>). First, SS can suppress GABA-mediated inhibition and enhance excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gong et al., 2008</xref>). Second, SS enhances sound evoked activity in ACx when given systemically or applied locally to the LA or ACx, whereas it depresses ACx responses when only applied to the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Third, drugs that enhance GABA-mediated inhibition, prevent SS-induced gain enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lu et al., 2011</xref>), and suppress tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brozoski et al., 2007b</xref>).</p><p>Behaviorally, hyperacusis was initially observed at 50 dB SPL; the same low intensity at which sound-evoked neural hyperactivity occurred in the ACx. In contrast, sound-evoked hyperactivity occurred at noticeably higher intensities for the LA (∼60 dB SPL), MGB (∼70 dB SPL), and acoustic-startle reflex amplitude (∼95 dB SPL). These results suggest that neural responses from the ACx may be one of the most sensitive biomarkers of hyperacusis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Juckel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gu et al., 2010</xref>). However, since neural responses increased in magnitude from cochlea to cortex, loudness intolerance issues likely result from multiple stages of neural amplification as signals are relayed rostrally from the cochlea to the ACx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auerbach et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, there is growing evidence that the neural amplification gradually develops in the auditory brainstem and serially accumulates to supernormal levels after reaching the MGB and ACx consistent with previous electrophysiological results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Qiu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schaette and McAlpine, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Tinnitus</title><p>Some models of tinnitus are based on changes in spontaneous spiking patterns such as increased firing rate or increased neural synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eggermont, 2015</xref>). SS either decreased or had no effect on spontaneous spike rate in primary ACx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ochi and Eggermont, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2007</xref>) and reportedly no effect on synchrony between neuron pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eggermont, 2015</xref>). Since the BOLD and LFP responses mainly represent presynaptic activity, it is difficult to directly relate our results to these spiking models. However, the increase in very low-frequency BOLD oscillations (0.01 Hz) represented by ALFF could be interpreted as evidence for increased presynaptic synchrony, which would likely enhance spike synchrony albeit at much longer time intervals than previously studied or over much larger neuronal populations than that reflected by spike correlations between neuron pairs. SS has also been found to increase gamma-band (50–100 Hz) oscillatory activity in ACx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stolzberg et al., 2013</xref>); oscillations substantially higher than in ALFF. An alternative view is that the tinnitus percept is derived from coordinated activity among several auditory and nonauditory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Horwitz and Braun, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Husain et al., 2006</xref>). Enhanced FC between the HIP and auditory areas provides a substrate for assigning a spatial location to a phantom sound, while coordinated activity between specific auditory areas and the reticular formation and AMY may draw attention to and add emotional significance to neural activity in the auditory pathway. Thus, functionally coordinated activity within the network may be essential for bringing tinnitus into consciousness.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Reallocating network resources</title><p>Tinnitus and hyperacusis, like phantom limb pain and cutaneous allodynia, are triggered by peripheral damage presumably leading to widespread changes in the CNS that involve altered connections in networks that include portions of the central auditory pathway and other regions linked to emotion, memory, attention, and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llinas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leaver et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Husain and Schmidt, 2014</xref>).

SS also enhanced sound-evoked LFP in the MGB and ACx suggesting a key role for these auditory structures in amplifying auditory information that could manifest as loudness intolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gu et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cerebellar gating and gain</title><p>Although the cerebellum is mainly involved in motor planning and control, some cerebellar regions such as the PFL and vermis receive inputs from auditory centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Petacchi et al., 2005</xref>) and respond to sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lockwood et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, the perception of tinnitus has been linked to activation of the PFL and vermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brozoski et al., 2007a</xref>) consistent with our results. Since ablation or inactivation of the PFL eliminates the perception of noise-induced tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>), some have suggested that the PFL acts as a gain control mechanism comparing the afferent input from the cochlea with descending signals from the ACx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this view, our results show that SS leads to hyperactivity in the ACx and increases the FC between the ACx and PFL and CB4. If this cerebellar-tinnitus gating hypothesis is correct, then ablating or inactivating the PFL should suppress behavioral measures of SS-induced tinnitus and possibly hyperacusis, providing a clear test of this model. The functional role of the PFL in tinnitus–hyperacusis network could be further elucidated by inactivating the PFL and determining the effects this has on SS-induced changes we observed in our electrophysiological and fMRI measures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Negative valence</title><p>The AMY, which assigns emotions such as fear or anxiety to sensory events, lies outside the classical auditory pathway; however, it is linked to several auditory areas and responds robustly to sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Romanski and LeDoux, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stutzmann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). In the resting state, SS enhanced the ALFF in the AMY and increased FC between ACx and AMY consistent with prior results showing increased coupling between ACx and AMY in tinnitus patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2012</xref>) and increased c-fos immunolabeling in the AMY following SS treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wallhäusser-Franke et al., 2003</xref>). SS also enhanced sound-evoked activity in the AMY consistent with the increased activation seen in the AMY of hyperacusis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levitin et al., 2003</xref>). Importantly, infusion of SS directly into AMY increases sound-evoked activity in the ACx, effects that illustrate the potent independent role that the AMY can exert on central auditory function and aural perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Collectively, these results reinforce the view that the AMY contributes to the fear and anxiety experienced by many patients with tinnitus and hyperacusis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Veen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Juris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aazh et al., 2014</xref>). Sound and cognitive therapies aimed at reducing the emotional distress of tinnitus and hyperacusis would be expected to reduce the level of activity in the AMY and/or the functional coupling between the AMY and ACx without necessarily eliminating aberrant auditory percepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hazell and Jastreboff, 1990</xref>). Human imaging studies employing ALFF and FC could be used to test this hypothesis and provide an objective and independent assessment of how these therapies work and their effects on the tinnitus–hyperacusis neural network.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Arousal</title><p>A novel finding observed during resting-state fMRI was the SS-induced enhancement of ALFF in the reticular formation (RN, PnO, and PMr) together with increased FC between the reticular formation and ACx. The reticular formation is an important arousal center with numerous inputs from the cochlear nucleus and IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kandler and Herbert, 1991</xref>). Giant neurons in pontine reticular formation control the amplitude of the acoustic startle reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koch et al., 1992</xref>), and stimulation of the AMY enhances the response of these giant neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koch et al., 1992</xref>). Thus, the SS-induced increases of ALFF observed in the AMY and reticular formation likely contribute to the enhancement of the acoustic startle reflex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Feeling and seeing</title><p>SS unexpectedly increased ALFF in SSCx, VCx, and SC raising the question of whether this might be linked to phantom visual or somatosensory perceptions. However, after an extensive search, we were unable to find evidence of such aberrant somatosensory or visual phenomena. While the heightened ALFF response in these areas is novel, such changes seem reasonable, given the multisensory interactions known to exist between auditory, somatosensory, and visual areas. One possibility is that heightened ALFF activity in ACx, MGB, and IC could spill over and enhance activity in visual and somatosensory areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murray et al., 2005</xref>). However, these increases may not lead to altered perception because FC was not enhanced in visual or somatosensory areas. Alternatively, the SS-induced cochlear loss could unmask pre-existing multisensory circuits in visual and somatosensory areas leading to increased activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barone et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Tinnitus–hyperacusis network</title><p>Although SS has long been known to cause tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mongan et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jastreboff et al., 1988</xref>), it is now clear that it also induces strong hyperacusis-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayes et al., 2014</xref>). Although tinnitus and hyperacusis could conceivably arise from different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zeng, 2013</xref>), they frequently co-occur more frequently than previously believed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gu et al., 2010</xref>). Tinnitus and hyperacusis do not exist in isolation but are linked to other brain regions associated with emotions, arousal, memories, spatial location, and motor activity as schematized in the tinnitus–hyperacusis network model defined by our imaging results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). With the seed region in IC, a significant increase in FC occurred in the MGB; this increase is likely due to the SS-induced enhancement of ALFF in the IC, which is relayed rostrally to the MGB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, thick black line) resulting in a larger and more coherent MGB response. Similarly, with the seed in the MGB, increased FC occurred in the ACx; this increase is likely due to the increased ALFF and FC occurring in MGB, which is relayed rostrally to the ACx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, thick black line). With the seed in the ACx, increased FC was seen in the same two lower auditory centers, the MGB and IC, raising the possibility of a recurrent feedback loop in this auditory subnetwork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, shaded area, bidirectional dashed red lines). These data combined with our electrophysiological results suggest that SS enhances the FC and response magnitude in a central auditory subnetwork that extends from the IC through the MGB to the ACx.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06576.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Tinnitus–hyperacusis network model.</title><p>Schematic showing some of the major centers in the auditory pathway and areas in the CNS showing increased FC with the auditory cortex (ACx).

SS increased ALFF response magnitudes and FC in a central auditory subnetwork (gray shaded area) comprised of the IC, MGB, and AC. The AC serves as a major hub with side branches to the amygdala (AMY), reticular nuclei (RN), and parafloccular lobe (PFL) and cerebellar lobules 4 (CB4); these side branch regions contribute to the emotional, motoric, and conscious awareness of tinnitus and/or hyperacusis.

The side branch connecting the ACx to the AMY provides a pathway through which emotional significance can be attached to tinnitus or hyperacusis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>) consistent with earlier studies linking anxiety, annoyance, and fear to tinnitus and hyperacusis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moller, 2007</xref>). The ACx-RN network provides a conduit by which increased arousal can increase awareness or attention, enhance motivation, or amplify motor responses to tinnitus or suprathreshold sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlson and Willott, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Paus, 2000</xref>). The ACx-cerebellar branch could serve as a gating path for tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyen et al., 2014</xref>) or modulate the motor responses to or perceptual salience of suprathreshold sounds thereby contributing to hyperacusis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mobbs et al., 2007</xref>). Increased FC between HIP-MGB and HIP-IC could facilitate the formation or stabilization of a memory trace for tinnitus, assign a spatial location to the phantom sound within or outside the head, or promote the retrieval of previously stored auditory memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Ridder et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ulanovsky and Moss, 2008</xref>). Our network model can be explicitly tested by administering a high-dose of SS while activating or inactivating part of the network, such as the PFL, and determining if the manipulation abolishes tinnitus or hyperacusis or alternatively determining how such manipulations affects the electrophysiological and fMRI properties of the network. Since high-dose SS is one of the most predictable and reliable inducers of tinnitus and hyperacusis, SS provides researchers with a powerful tool to gain mechanistic insights into the neurophysiological conditions needed to induce these debilitating auditory perceptions. Since SS-induced tinnitus and hyperacusis are transient phenomena that begin shortly after drug treatment, some of the neuro-pathophysiological changes we observed are likely to be similar to those that occur during the early stages of tinnitus or hyperacusis induced by acoustic trauma, Meniere's disease, or sudden hearing loss. In cases of acoustic overstimulation, most individuals develop transient tinnitus immediately post-exposure, which gradually disappears; interestingly only a small percentage develops permanent tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilles et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Degeest et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, an important question that remains to be answered is whether the neural correlates of chronic tinnitus and hyperacusis are similar or different from the immediate and acute condition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Summary</title><p>SS-induced tinnitus and hyperacusis appear to arise from enhanced central gain and increased FC in an auditory network with four side branches.

Seven food-restricted rats were trained to detect a broadband-noise burst (300 ms, 5 ms rise/fall) presented at intensities from 30 to 90 dB SPL. The rat initiated a trial by holding its nose in a nose-poke hole for 1–4 s until a noise-burst stimulus was presented. If the rat withdrew its nose from the hole during a 2-s response interval that began at noise-burst onset, it received a food pellet, and the trial was scored as a ‘hit’. Failure to respond during the 2-s response interval was scored as a ‘miss’ and not rewarded. Approximately, 30% of trials were catch trials (no stimulus). If the rat removed its nose on a catch trial (‘false alarm’), the light in the test chamber was turned off and the rat received a 4-s timeout. However, if it continued to nose-poke through the response interval during a catch trial the trial was scored as a ‘correct rejection’, and no reinforcement was given. Reaction time measures were only recorded on trials scored as a ‘hit’. After obtaining stable baseline reaction time measurements, rats were treated either with SS (300 mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or an equivalent volume of Saline and tested on the go/no-go paradigm for approximately 60 min beginning 2 hr post-treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-4"><title>Tinnitus assessment</title><p>Details of our two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) behavioral paradigm to test for tinnitus are described in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stolzberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Three food-restricted rats (85–90% free feeding weight) were trained to nose-poke a center-hole to start a trial and then wait 4–8 s for a cue light to come on before responding in a bidirectional manner to one of three randomly presented ongoing stimuli. If an unmodulated narrow-band noise (NBN, 50% of trials) was present (4, 5, 6, 7, or 11 kHz center frequency, ∼70 dB SPL), the rat was trained to nose-poke the left feeder to obtain a food pellet. In contrast, if an amplitude-modulated (AM, 30% of trials) narrow-band noise (100% modulation depth, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 11 kHz center frequency, ∼70 dB SPL) or if no sound (Quiet, 20% of trials) was present, the rat was trained to nose-poke the right feeder to obtain a food pellet. During baseline testing, performance was typically greater than 80% correct. After reaching criterion, rats were treated either with SS or an equivalent volume of Saline and tested daily on the 2AFC paradigm for approximately 75 min beginning 2 hr post-treatment. Since the rats were trained to respond left to a steady NBN vs right to fluctuating AM noise or Quiet, we expected that if a rat developed SS-induced tinnitus, it would only shift its response on Quiet trials from the right side (associated with Quiet) to the left side (associated with a steady NBN) as previously discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stolzberg et al., 2013</xref>).

Sequential data processing steps included: slice-timing adjustment, realignment and correction for head-motion, spatial normalization to the standard rat brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Paxinos and Watson, 2004</xref>), smoothing with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 1 mm), detrending and filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz).

Images for the ALFF analysis were band-pass filtered (0.01–0.1 Hz). Afterward, a fast Fourier transform was performed on the corrected time series data to obtain the power spectrum in each voxel within the brain; the square root of the power spectrum was calculated to obtain the amplitude at each frequency. To identify significant differences in ALFF values between the SS experimental group and the Saline control group, a between-group, two-sample t-test was calculated. Thresholds were set at a corrected p value of p &lt; 0.001 (cluster size &gt; 10 voxels) using the multiple comparison correction obtained with the AlphaSim method employing Monte Carlo simulation. Region of interest (ROI)-based FC analysis was performed for three auditory regions consisting of 9 voxels in the ACx, MGB, and IC. These regions were chosen based on the increased ALFF values observed in these areas during SS and because of their putative roles in tinnitus and hyperacusis. The mean time series for each of these three ROIs was computed for the reference time course. Cross-correlation analysis was then carried out between the mean signal change in each ROI and the time series of every voxel in the whole rat brain.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Heidi Johansen-Berg (Reviewing editor) and Jos Eggermont (peer reviewer). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers found the paper technically sound, and felt it provided a number of interesting and novel findings but they raised particular concerns about presentation of results and interpretation. The following points would be essential to address in a revised submission.</p><p>1) The fact that only transient tinnitus and hyperacusis activity was studied makes the value of these experiments for chronic tinnitus in humans not immediately clear. This should be explained in the paper. The Title (“That loud phantom buzz…”) suggests that the paper is about tinnitus, whereas at most it reflects neural correlates for hyperacusis. The Title should be changed.</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript hyperacusis and tinnitus are interpreted as a similar pathology. There is strong evidence that this may not be true: see e.g. Zeng FG et al., 2012, Hear Res etc. This should be discussed. In addition, it should be made clear throughout which animals (tinnitus or hyperacusis) are being considered. If possible, results should be reported separately for tinnitus and hyperacusis groups for all experiments.</p><p>3) The data from experiment 3 are new and exciting. However it would be helpful to see the BOLD data for baseline and after SS application separately. It would also be helpful to see data for tinnitus and hyperacusis animals separately if possible.</p><p>4) For BOLD data please clarify how many animals are included in each analysis illustrated (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3 and 4</xref>).</p><p>5) Because all activity recorded is presynaptic (LFPs and BOLD) there is no way to relate this to spike recordings in the auditory system. Whereas the LFP and spontaneous BOLD amplitude increases after SS, spike recording in the central auditory system typically decrease. This offers an opportunity for discussion of what constitutes neural correlates of tinnitus. This is missing in the paper. If only presynaptic activity is reflected in these data, then of course the increased spontaneous activity as measured in the BOLD response relates to the evoked LFP activity that suggests increased central gain.

The distinction between chronic and acute tinnitus and hyperacusis may not be as clear cut as these terms imply. Chronic tinnitus and hyperacusis sometimes disappears spontaneously or after therapy. On the other hand repeated episodes of acute noise-induced tinnitus can develop into long-lasting tinnitus and/or hyperacusis. One of the most puzzling aspects of tinnitus and hyperacusis induced by noise, aging or ototoxic drugs is why only a small proportion of hearing-impaired humans develop these debilitating symptoms while the majority does not. Salicylate has proved to be a powerful tool for consistently inducing both tinnitus and hyperacusis in humans and animals and for identifying the neural correlates of these disturbing auditory disorders.</p><p><italic>The Title (“That loud phantom buzz…”) suggests that the paper is about tinnitus, whereas at most it reflects neural correlates for hyperacusis. The Title should be changed</italic>.</p><p>The title of the paper was modified to reflect the fact that salicylate induced both tinnitus and hyperacusis were being studied. The new title is: “Tinnitus and Hyperacusis Involve Hyperactivity and Enhanced Connectivity in Auditory-Limbic-Arousal-Cerebellar Network”.</p><p><italic>2) Throughout the manuscript hyperacusis and tinnitus are interpreted as a similar pathology. There is strong evidence that this may not be true: see e.g. Zeng FG et al. 2012, Hear Res etc. This should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>The Introduction and Discussion sections were modified to take into account differing views regarding the pathologies and neural mechanism that potentially give rise to tinnitus and hyperacusis. The models of Norena and Zeng are discussed along with data indicating that hyperacusis may be under reported in tinnitus patients as noted by Gu et al.</p><p><italic>In addition, it should be made clear throughout which animals (tinnitus or hyperacusis) are being considered. If possible, results should be reported separately for tinnitus and hyperacusis groups for all experiments</italic>.</p><p>There appears to be a misunderstanding of how the animals in the behavioral studies of tinnitus and hyperacusis relate to the electrophysiological and fMRI studies. All salicylate-treated rats develop both tinnitus and hyperacusis, not just one of these perceptual disorders. One group of rats was used to document that high dose salicylate induced tinnitus and a second group of rats was used to document that high dose salicylate induces hyperacusis. We have tried to make it clear throughout the revised manuscript that high dose salicylate induces both tinnitus and hyperacusis in all animals. Confusion may have occurred because one group of rats was used to demonstrate that high-dose salicylate reliably induced tinnitus and another group of rats was used to demonstrate that high-dose salicylate reliably induces hyperacusis. We used two separate groups of rats because it would be extremely difficult to train rats on two distinctly different behavioral paradigms. The two groups of behaviorally trained rats were tested at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, NY, USA. Another group of rats was used to obtain the electrophysiological data at the University at Buffalo. Finally, a fourth group of rats was used for the fMRI experiment conducted at Southeast University in Nanjing, China. The manuscript now clearly identifies these four groups.</p><p><italic>3) The data from experiment 3 are new and exciting. However it would be helpful to see the BOLD data for baseline and after SS application separately. It would also be helpful to see data for tinnitus and hyperacusis animals separately if possible</italic>.</p><p>According to your suggestions, we add the BOLD data for baseline and after SS application separately. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>. However, as discussed above, high dose salicylate induces both tinnitus and hyperacusis in all animals, not just one of these perceptual disorders. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to acquire the BOLD data for tinnitus and hyperacusis animals separately. We have tried to make it clear throughout the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) For BOLD data please clarify how many animals are included in each analysis illustrated (i.e.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4"><italic>Figures 3 and 4</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>In the original manuscript we clearly stated the number of animals for the fMRI analysis. Animals were divided into two groups, a Saline control group (n = 15) and a SS treated group (n = 15).</p><p><italic>5) Because all activity recorded is presynaptic (LFPs and BOLD) there is no way to relate this to spike recordings in the auditory system. Whereas the LFP and spontaneous BOLD amplitude increases after SS, spike recording in the central auditory system typically decrease. This offers an opportunity for discussion of what constitutes neural correlates of tinnitus. This is missing in the paper. If only presynaptic activity is reflected in these data, then of course the increased spontaneous activity as measured in the BOLD response relates to the evoked LFP activity that suggests increased central gain. The fact that no (compound) spiking activity is recorded needs to be addressed in all their discussions</italic>.</p><p>In the revised Discussion we point out that we only measured LFP and BOLD responses, but we discuss the spiking data previously reported by ourselves and others, in particular spontaneous rates and neural synchrony. We provided additional discussion on previous spontaneous spiking models of tinnitus and the potential role that functional connectivity in a neural network may play in bringing tinnitus into consciousness.</p></body></sub-article></article>
