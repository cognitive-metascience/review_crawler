We define the mode of target interference and role in antiviral defense for two CRISPR-Cas systems in <italic>Marinomonas mediterranea</italic>. One system (type I-F) targets DNA. A second system (type III-B) is broadly capable of acquiring spacers in either orientation from RNA and DNA, and exhibits transcription-dependent DNA interference. Examining resistance to phages isolated from Mediterranean seagrass meadows, we found that the type III-B machinery co-opts type I-F CRISPR-RNAs. Sequencing and infectivity assessments of related bacterial and phage strains suggests an ‘arms race’ in which phage escape from the type I-F system can be overcome through use of type I-F spacers by a horizontally-acquired type III-B system. We propose that the phage-host arms race can drive selection for horizontal uptake and maintenance of promiscuous type III interference modules that supplement existing host type I CRISPR-Cas systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Marinomonas mediterranea</italic></kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>phage</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>phage-host arms race</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM37706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fire</surname><given-names>Andrew Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cooperation between evolutionarily disparate CRISPR-Cas modules allows bacteria to counter mutational escape by viruses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CRISPR-Cas systems enable adaptive immunity in prokaryotes in three stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>). First, molecular memories of infection are formed by the acquisition of short segments of foreign nucleic acids, which are stored as ‘spacers’ in CRISPR arrays (<italic>adaptation</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deveau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>). Second, these CRISPR arrays are transcribed into precursor transcripts, then processed into CRISPR RNAs (crRNA <italic>processing</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brouns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hochstrasser and Doudna, 2015</xref>). Finally, the crRNAs form complexes with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins that execute a variety of protective responses against matching nucleic acid targets (<italic>interference</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Plagens et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, CRISPR-Cas systems function as sequence-specific nucleases that degrade invasive genetic elements.</p><p>CRISPR-Cas loci have been organized into six phylogenetic types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shmakov et al., 2015</xref>). All characterized CRISPR-Cas systems utilize crRNAs for sequence-specific identification of targets. However, different types exhibit varying modes of target interference. Type I, type II, and type V systems use crRNAs to guide the recognition and destruction of DNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brouns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>), whereas crRNA-guided recognition of RNA targets occurs in type VI systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abudayyeh et al., 2016</xref>). In type III systems, the interference complex recognizes nascent RNA transcripts containing the reverse complement of the crRNA sequence, and degrades both the transcript and its template DNA in a process termed transcription-dependent DNA interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hale et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tamulaitis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Samai et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, interference can only occur if type III crRNAs, and hence spacers, are antisense to their cognate RNA targets. CRISPR transcription is unidirectional; as such, new type III spacers must be inserted into CRISPR arrays in a specific orientation to produce crRNAs that are functional in interference.</p><p>Other CRISPR-Cas types also require integration of new spacers in one specific orientation. Type I, II, and V CRISPR-Cas systems rely on the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) to distinguish foreign DNA targets from the host-copy of the spacer, thereby preventing lethal self-targeting of the host CRISPR loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mojica et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stern et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Westra et al., 2013</xref>). A consequence of PAM-based target authentication is that spacers must be oriented such that the PAM-proximal ends of crRNAs are positioned correctly with respect to the PAM-sensing domain of the interference complex. During CRISPR adaptation in these systems, a PAM-sensing domain in the Cas1-Cas2 spacer acquisition complex ensures spacers are integrated in the correct orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shipman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nuñez et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, type III CRISPR-Cas systems typically do not rely on PAMs to prevent self-targeting, although a highly degenerate RNA sequence constraint (rPAM) has been reported in <italic>P. furiosus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>). Instead, base-pairing between the CRISPR repeat-derived 5’ crRNA handle and the protospacer flanking sequence has been proposed to suppress target recognition, thereby preventing self-targeting in the context of the host CRISPR array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2010</xref>). Whether, and how, spacers are oriented in type III CRISPR arrays remains unclear.</p><p>Type III CRISPR-Cas systems comprise a large and diverse group, divided into 4 subtypes (III-A, B, C, and D). Type III-A systems usually possess spacer acquisition and pre-crRNA processing factors (Cas1-Cas2 and Cas6 homologues, respectively), whereas many type III-B, C, and D systems lack these components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>). Such systems commonly occur in genomes containing type I CRISPR-Cas loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makarova et al., 2011</xref>), and in many cases share ‘communal’ CRISPR arrays utilizing the same repeat sequences as the co-habiting type I systems. In support of this, co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the association of ‘shared’ crRNAs with type III interference complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Staals et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Staals et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elmore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Majumdar et al., 2015</xref>). These associations can also lead to transcription-dependent interference against protospacer-containing plasmids in <italic>Sulfolobus islandicus</italic> REY15A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>). There are no type III-specific CRISPR spacer arrays in the <italic>S. islandicus</italic> and <italic>P. furiosus</italic> genomes; such type III interference modules have thus been proposed to stably co-reside with type I CRISPR loci, and to depend on type I factors for spacer acquisition and crRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>). While the frequent co-habitation of type III with type I systems could provide benefits to the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>), the mechanistic underpinning of this evolutionary association is unknown. Moreover, the biological and ecological role(s) of interactions between evolutionarily disparate CRISPR-Cas systems remain unexplored.</p><p>Recently, we showed that the <italic>Marinomonas mediterranea</italic> MMB-1 type III-B system uses a reverse transcriptase (RT)-Cas1 fusion protein to acquire spacers directly from RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silas et al., 2016</xref>). The <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> genome contains a type I-F and a type III-B system, each with a full complement of spacer acquisition, processing, and interference components. Furthermore, each system possesses its own CRISPR loci, with distinct repeat sequences. Here, we show that the <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> type III-B effector complex naturally utilizes crRNAs from both type III-B and type I-F CRISPR loci for interference, despite their divergent CRISPR repeat sequences. We demonstrate that this surprising plasticity in crRNA selection allows the type III-B interference machinery to use type I-F spacers to counter infection from natural <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> phages abundant in the native host ecosystem, which have escaped the type I-F defenses through genetic (PAM) mutations. Based on the analysis of the sequences of highly related bacterial strains, we propose that some type III-B systems exhibiting plasticity in their crRNA utilization criteria behave as promiscuous modules. This flexibility in crRNA usage might serve as an important trait for their selection following horizontal transfer into bacterial hosts that are challenged by phages that had escaped their type I CRISPR-Cas defenses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcription-dependent degradation of DNA by the <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> type III-B CRISPR-Cas system</title><p>The <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> MMB-1 genome contains type III-B and type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Despite the clear shift in bias in the absence of type III-B interference, antisense spacers did not constitute the overwhelming majority; arguing against a strong, concerted mechanism to orient incoming spacers into the CRISPR array. Moreover, the strand bias entirely disappeared when the RT-deleted version of RT-Cas1 (RTΔ RT-Cas1) was supplied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), thereby highlighting an intrinsic difference between spacer acquisition from RNA and DNA sources (RTΔ RT-Cas1 has previously been shown to acquire spacers only from DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silas et al., 2016</xref>]). Finally, we tested whether the strand bias of newly acquired spacers in other CRISPR-Cas mutants was consistent with their interference capabilities. With over-expressed WT RT-Cas1, all strains supported spacer acquisition from host RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As expected, the mutants capable of plasmid interference showed a bias for spacers matching the sense strand of source RNAs. Conversely, mutants incapable of interference showed a moderate bias for spacers matching the reverse complement of the source RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In summary, the orientation of new type III-B spacers bears only a partial relationship to the strandedness of the source transcript. Additionally, host-derived spacers integrated in the antisense orientation are negatively selected in the presence of type III-B interference, due to transcription-dependent autoimmune self-targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>M. mediterranea</italic> type I-F spacers provide protection against an abundant marine phage</title><p>To evaluate type III-B targeting in an ecological context, we isolated <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> phages from the original source of the MMB-1 strain in seawater from <italic>Posidonia oceanica</italic> seagrass meadows off the Mediterranean coast in south-eastern Spain.

Furthermore, deletion of the type III-B CRISPR-Cas operon did not impair plasmid elimination, whereas removal of the type I-F operon, in isolation or conjunction with the type III-B operon deletion, abrogated interference. Deletion of the type I-F <italic>cas1</italic> and <italic>cas2-3</italic> genes resulted in interference only when the reverse complement of the spacer sequence was transcribed from the plasmid. This indicates that type III-B targeting using type I-F crRNAs occurs concurrently with the type I-F targeting, but is only evident when type I-F interference is disabled. We also examined whether the type I-F targeting module could use type III-B crRNAs, by inserting GG PAM sequences in our plasmids containing type III-B protospacers.

It is conceivable that sharing of spacers and specificities between CRISPR-Cas systems would result in redundancy by allowing type I spacers to be backed up in efficacy through the activity of co-occurring type III machinery. To evaluate the possible generality of such a backup process, we carried out experiments to test for spacer sharing in a substantially divergent host, <italic>Serratia</italic> sp.

Each CRISPR-Cas system in <italic>Serratia</italic> (types I-E, I-F and III-A) possesses at least one type-specific CRISPR array and spacer acquisition module. The type III-A operon encodes Cas1 and Cas2 but no RT-Cas1 fusion.

However, the type I-E and type I-F target-containing plasmids were only subject to interference when they possessed canonical PAMs for their respective systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

This would have led to selective advantage following acquisition of a PAM-independent CRISPR-Cas system (i.e. the type III-B operon) that was able to provide immunity against CPG1g by using the pre-existing phage-matching type I-F crRNAs.

Moreover, the repeats of the MMB1 and CPR1 type III-B CRISPR arrays are dissimilar (~50% identity). These data are indicative of the independent horizontal acquisition of a distinct type III-B system in this strain. The IVIA-Po-186 genome contains a putatively defunct CRISPR array with degraded type III-B repeats, which is present within the same genomic context as the type III-B locus in MMB-1. This indicates that a type III-B system likely once resided in IVIA-Po-186 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We hypothesize that once selective pressure for maintaining the supposed type III-B system alleviated (for example the threat of a specific phage abated), the protein-coding operon was lost due to recombination between flanking CRISPR arrays. No remnant of the MMB-1 type III-B system was found in CPR1, and no remnant of the CPR1 system was found in either MMB1 or IVIA-Po-186.

Another new phage, named CB5A, was isolated and genome sequencing revealed that CB5A is a close relative of phages CPG1g/CPP1m, with only a few differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Most notably, the protospacer targeted by the second spacer in the <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> MMB-1 type I-F CRISPR04 array contained a canonical PAM (GG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Moreover, the protospacer in phage CB5A that matches spacer 3 in the host CRISPR04 array contains only 3 mismatches versus 5 for phage CPG1g. Therefore, we propose that CB5A more closely resembles the ‘pre-escape’ ancestor of CPG1g. CB5A showed almost no ability to infect WT MMB-1, with extremely small plaques forming only at very high phage concentrations (near the assay limit of detection) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the absence of type I-F mediated defense (the ΔI-F Cas123 strain) we observed a ~50 fold increase in sensitivity to CB5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), but with very small plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This demonstrates that interference by the type I-F system contributes to immunity against CB5A ‒ consistent with the intact PAM for the protospacer matched by the <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> MMB-1 CRISPR04 spacer 2. This is in contrast to CPG1g infection (i.e. a PAM-escape mutant), where the type I-F system alone does not confer measureable immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, deletion of the MMB-1 type III-B module resulted in a &gt;1000 fold increase in sensitivity to CB5A (relative to WT host) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, the type III-B system provides greatly enhanced defense against CB5A infection. However, CB5A ‘pre-escape phage’ plaques on the ∆III-B indicator strain were still smaller than those of CPG1g on the same indicator strain (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), likely due to type I-F‒mediated targeting of the PAM-containing protospacer in CB5A. Maximal sensitivity to CB5A, evident in both plaquing efficiency and plaque size, was observed when both the type I-F and type III-B systems were removed, or in the strain with the type I-F operon deleted ‒ in the latter case this is a consequence of removal of the type I-F CRISPR array containing the phage-matching spacers.

Cultures of WT and ∆III-B strains were infected with CB5A, and the phage populations were passaged on fresh host cells the following day. The resulting phage titers were then determined on several host mutants. We found that the phage populations had been eliminated from the WT cultures in just one re-inoculation step, with the absence of any detectable plaque formation on any indicator strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In contrast, phage populations passaged through cultures of the ∆III-B strain yielded small plaques on lawns of the WT indicator strain, suggesting the presence of ‘escape phage’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These phage populations displayed a ~ 5,000–10,000 fold increased EOP for infection of ΔIII-B versus WT indicator strains, and no additive effect compared with the ∆I-FΔIII-B strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Moreover, the plaque sizes were greatly increased on the ∆III-B indicator strain, unlike the original CB5A phage that produced small plaques on ΔIII-B lawns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that passaging of CB5A in cells possessing only type I-F immunity results in rapid proliferation of phage variants that evade the host type I-F defenses. To confirm genetic changes to the phage population, we attempted to sequence the genomes of 2 escape phages isolates from each of the 6 independent evolution experiments with the ∆III-B host. All 11 successfully sequenced phage genomes contained a deletion or seed-region mutation in the PAM-containing protospacer (subject to type I-F interference), but not in the PAM-lacking protospacer, nor in the mismatched protospacer that already contained a seed mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In all, 8 distinct escape mutations (6 large deletions spanning the entire protospacer, 1 seed substitution, 1 seed frameshift) were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). None of the escape mutations were observed across multiple independent trials of the evolution experiment, suggestive of a diversity of escape phages which could not proliferate when passaged with the WT host due to simultaneous PAM-independent type III-B targeting at both the first and second protospacers. Finally, we tested the ability of three escape phages (containing the seed mutation, the seed frameshift, and a deletion spanning the PAM-containing protospacer respectively) to infect various <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> mutants. We found small plaques on WT and ∆I-F Cas123 indicator strains, and large plaques on ∆III-B and ∆I-F∆III-B hosts for all three escape phages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), similar to the naturally occurring escape phage CPG1g. These findings confirm that in the absence of the <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> MMB-1 type III-B CRISPR-Cas system, phage variants that escape host type I-F immunity, such as CPG1g, can proliferate.

Here we demonstrated that this system directs DNA interference in a transcription-dependent manner. Complementarity between crRNA guides and target RNA is a requirement for this mechanism, hence new spacers (whether DNA or RNA derived) need to be integrated directionally in the CRISPR array to function. By eliminating biases associated with autoimmunity, we showed that the orientation of new spacers derived from host RNAs was only marginally in favor of the functional (antisense) direction. Therefore, almost half of the RT-Cas1 acquired spacers are useless for RNA and DNA interference. This is surprising and raises the question of why higher fidelity spacer orientation mechanisms, such as observed in PAM-dependent CRISPR-Cas systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shmakov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Staals et al., 2016</xref>), have not arisen.</p><p>Characterizing <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> defense against phages, we uncovered an ecologically functional plasticity in crRNA selection and utilization by the type III-B interference machinery that allows for cross-talk between the (otherwise autonomous) type III-B system and spacers stored in a type I-F CRISPR array. We show that the type III-B effector complex can use type I-F crRNAs despite the stark dissimilarity between the respective CRISPR repeat sequences. Use of type I-F crRNAs by the type III-B system provides protection to <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> MMB-1 from infection by a phage abundant in the native environment of the host. The type I-F system contains immunological memory of the phages isolated in this study, CPG1g/CPP1m and CB5A, but is unable to provide effective defense against CPG1g due to PAM mutations in the phage genome. Type III-B interference against CPG1g (and other phage variants that ‘escape’ type I-F defenses) using type I-F spacers, but without requiring a specific PAM, serves as an additional line of defense for <italic>M. mediterranea</italic>. We found that this cross-system spacer usage is reliant on the type I-F pre-crRNA processing activity of Cas6f (Csy4). Consistent with this, a chimeric CRISPR-Cas system in the related bacterium <italic>Marinomonas</italic> sp. MWYL1 comprises a set of genes encoding a type III-B effector complex, with a type I-F <italic>cas6f</italic> gene and type I-F CRISPR array. In addition, the ability to process type I pre-crRNAs might be carried within some type III operons; for example, the type III-B system in <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> CPR1 encodes two diverse Cas6-family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) that may enable the system to independently process pre-crRNAs from different CRISPR-Cas systems. This would be interesting for future study.</p><p>Although it is possible that the <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> MMB-1 type III-B system gained the ability to use type I-F crRNAs during prolonged co-residence with the type I-F system, our comparative genomic data support an alternate theory. We propose that CPG1g escaped the defenses of a progenitor <italic>M. mediterranaea</italic> host – which only contained a type I-F system – through the acquisition of PAM mutations. Proliferation of the escape phage drove selection for <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> strains that had subsequently acquired the type III-B CRISPR-Cas system, which could co-opt the existing type I-F crRNAs to provide defense against CPG1g. Despite the fact that the <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> MMB-1 strain containing the CPG1g- and CB5A-matching spacers was isolated ~20 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Solano et al., 1997</xref>), the phage protospacer sequences do not appear to have acquired further mutations to avoid type III-B interference. Previous studies have shown that type III systems are more tolerant of mutations in their target protospacer and flanking sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tamulaitis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Staals et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the probability of escape from the type III system is likely to be less than for type I-F systems.

The diversity of type III-B CRISPR-Cas configurations co-occurring with type I systems in <italic>Marinomonas</italic> species, and the presence of the chimeric type III/I-F system in <italic>Marinomonas</italic> sp. MWYL1 suggest that the use of type I crRNAs by type III-B effector modules is not limited to <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> MMB-1. The ability to borrow crRNAs from disparate CRISPR loci could explain why type III-B systems also often lack CRISPR arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>). For example, a type III-B system lacking CRISPR arrays in <italic>Sulfolobus islandicus</italic> REY15A has been reported to utilize crRNAs from a type I-A locus for interference in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2013</xref>). These type III systems might have lost their system-specific CRISPR arrays over time. Alternatively, we propose they could have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer as promiscuous ‘backup’ interference modules, adding an additional layer of support to the host type I systems. Consistent with this, genomic analyses of other <italic>S. islandicus</italic> strains revealed that while the type I-A locus is always present, modular reassortments of type III Cas modules are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Held et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>One hypothesis that might explain the difference between type III-A and other type III systems is that the effector complexes encoded by type III-B/C/D loci could possess a higher degree of plasticity in their crRNA selection criteria. Certainly, in <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> MMB-1, the type III-B effector complex can use its own type III-B associated arrays, but is also able to utilize information stored in the type I-F CRISPR array despite both loci possessing highly dissimilar repeat sequences. This plasticity could not be examined in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>) because the host genomes in those studies only contained type I CRISPR arrays with identical repeats. Future research will be required to determine the molecular requirements that enable plasticity in crRNA usage by type III systems. For instance, previous studies have documented the processing and tight interaction between Cas6f and mature crRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haurwitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Przybilski et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting the possibility of direct interactions between Cas6f and components of the type III-B Cmr complex. With well-characterized CRISPR adaptation and immunity pathways and an accessible habitat for the isolation of natural strains and parasites, <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> could serve as a valuable model system for interrogating such interactions. A high degree of plasticity in crRNA usage criteria would enhance the success of mobile genetic elements containing type III interference modules, as they could be beneficial immediately upon acquisition by a CRISPR-compatible host.</p><p>If widespread, plasticity in crRNA selection by type III interference modules could help to explain the frequent co-occurrence of type III and type I systems in prokaryotic genomes. In this regard, it is salient that we observed adherence of the type III self/non-self discrimination mechanism with type I-F crRNAs. This mechanism permits the ‘universal’ avoidance of self-targeting, without a specific sequence requirement such as a PAM, potentially allowing for broad non-specific crRNA use by type III-B systems. The emerging picture is one of fluid interactions between bacterial genomes and a diversity of mobile elements, including not only phage and plasmids but CRISPR-Cas systems as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Godde and Bickerton, 2006</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that longitudinal studies of CRISPR adaptation in ecological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson and Banfield, 2008</xref>) could benefit from whole genome sequencing of highly-related host strains to identify horizontal transfer of complete CRISPR-Cas modules and de novo formation of chimeric systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>High throughput sequencing data</title><p>All sequencing data generated in this study (SRP103952) were deposited at the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) and are additionally summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The plasmid constructs used for spacer acquisition and in vivo pre-crRNA processing studies in <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silas et al., 2016</xref>).

For each system, a series of samples of 500 spacers each were randomly chosen in silico from a list of all genes based on the sizes of the individual genes using the stochastic universal sampling algorithm. Sets of 1000 such trials were used to generate a range of null relationships between gene expression and spacer acquisition.

The number of colony forming units per mL of conjugation mixture was determined by dilution and plating on selective medium (2216 marine agar with 50 μg/mL Kanamycin and 50 μg/mL Rifampicin) at 25°C.

To standardize the nucleic acid extraction, log-phase cultures of MMB-1 strains carrying pKT230 plasmids with each protospacer configuration (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) were pooled. RNA was extracted from the pooled samples using TRIZOL reagent and treated with TURBO DNase (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The DNase was subsequently removed by extracting the digests once with a 1:1 mixture of Tris-saturated-phenol (pH 8.0) and CHCl<sub>3</sub>, and once with CHCl<sub>3</sub> in Heavy Phaselock Gel tubes (5 Prime). Purified RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Superscript III (Life Technologies), according to the high GC content protocol, with the gene-specific primer AF-SS-425 (TTCAGTTTTCTGATGAAGCGCGAAT). AF-SS-425 binds downstream of the protospacer sequence in a region of the vector backbone common to all plasmids in the mixture. cDNA was treated with RNase H and libraries were prepared for sequencing by a two round PCR method adapted from the spacer acquisition assay. The protospacer locus of the plasmid was amplified from the cDNA sample with primers binding to the same sites in all plasmid configurations, and assayed for the presence or absence of the various protospacer configurations by high throughput sequencing. Round 1 PCR was performed with primers AF-SS-426 (CGACGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNN AGATGCTGAAGATCAGTTGG) and AF-SS-427 (ACTGACGCTAGTGCATCA AGAAATATCCCGAATGTGCA) as follows: (98°C, 1 min), 2x (98°C, 10 s; 52°C, 20 s; 72°C, 30 s), 16-19x (98°C, 15 s; 65°C, 15 s; 72°C, 30 s), (72°C, 9 min). This simultaneously generated amplicons of near-identical length from all protospacer constructs in a single reaction. Sequencing adaptors were then attached in a second round of PCR with 0.01 volumes of the previous reaction as template, using AF-SS-44:55 (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT NNNNNNNN GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCACTGACGCTAGTGCATCA) and AF-KLA-67:74 (AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC NNNNNNNN ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT) where the (N)<sub>8</sub> barcodes correspond to Illumina TruSeq HT indexes D701-D712 (reverse complemented), and D501-D508 respectively. Cycling conditions for this step were: (98°C, 1 min), 2x (98°C, 10 s; 54°C, 20 s; 72°C, 30 s), 3x (98°C, 15 s; 70°C, 15 s; 72°C, 30 s), (72°C, 9 min).

Three mixtures were tested in separate experiments: a mixture of 8 strains in the Cmr2 GGAA mutant background, and two mixtures of 4 strains each in the WT and Cmr4 D26A mutant backgrounds. Relative protospacer RNA incidence is shown as the log<sub>10</sub> of the number of RNA-derived sequencing reads normalized to the log<sub>10</sub> of the number of identical DNA reads. This metric is comparable between the various plasmid configurations in a given experiment, but is not a measure of the transcript-to-template ratio in any individual cell because the RNA and DNA libraries were prepared separately and sequenced to similar depths.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mobile type III CRISPR-Cas systems can provide redundancy to counteract viral escape from type I systems&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom served as Guest Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Edze Westra (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Work by these authors previously showed that the Type III-B system in M. mediterranea MMB-1 is capable of acquiring new spacers from RNA by using an RT-Cas1 fusion protein. Here they extend this work to address questions related to the orientation of newly integrated spacers, the mechanism(s) of target degradation by the I-F and III-B systems, the promiscuity of sharing spacers between these systems, and speculate on the selective pressures that would explain the co-occurrence of these two systems. The referees agree that the work is generally well-performed but the novelty is substantially overstated.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Claims that the work presents unique and new insights into CRISPR biology are largely overstated and these claims should be revised to more accurately reflect the contribution of previous work.</p><p>2) The rather poor immunity provided by the type III-B system when using the type I-F spacer, indicates that type III-B-mediated interference using a type I-F-derived spacer is impaired. It is critical that type III-B-mediated phage defense is measured with spacers derived from its own type III-B array. In addition, RNA-seq from pull-down type I-F and III-B complexes should be used to corroborate that type I-F crRNAs are also present in the type III-B complex but not vice versa.</p><p>3) The authors state that the type III-B system provides an additional layer of protection. However, all experiments are performed using fixed genotypes. To demonstrate that type III limits phage escape, we recommend evolutionary experiments. Phage challenge of cells with a wild type immune system (i.e. I-F and III-B), as well as the isogenic mutant lacking III-B, would allow the authors to test the hypothesis by looking for phage escape mutants after 1, 2 and 3 days.</p><p>4) The authors describe a scenario that might explain the selective force that caused the III-B and I-F systems to end up in the same host. However, the sparse genomic data used is not convincing and the proposed scenario seems contrived. This section of the paper should be moved to the Discussion.</p><p>5) Repeat spacer analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> with spacers acquired from plasmids.</p><p>Title:</p><p>The title is inaccurate because there is little proof of the mobility of the studied type III-B system. The title is also confusing because it gives the impression that the investigators are reporting experiments about the transfer of the type III system, for example via conjugation or another form of gene transfer route.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27601.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Claims that the work presents unique and new insights into CRISPR biology are largely overstated and these claims should be revised to more accurately reflect the contribution of previous work.</italic> </p><p>We have carefully revised the text to ensure that the novel aspects of our study are clear in the context of previous work in the field. Specifically, identifying a deficiency in type III spacer acquisition (the apparent lack of a mechanism to correctly orient new spacers in the CRISPR loci), the plasticity of crRNA utilization by type III interference machinery (as it is able to utilize crRNAs with diverse CRISPR repeats), the biological function of crRNA-stealing (or sharing) among cohabiting CRISPR-Cas systems (including type III-style self- non-self- discrimination with type I-F crRNAs), and the physiological consequences of this in the native host ecosystem (providing defense against phage that escape type I-F immunity and suppressing proliferation of such mutants).</p><p>In terms of the specific history of utilization of the same crRNAs by different CRISPR-Cas systems, we have expanded our introductory discussion of several studies in which co-precipitation analyses suggested some cross-association between RNAs and various interference complexes (Staals et al., 2013; Staals et al., 2014; Elmore et al., 2015; Majumdar et al., 2015), and the studies by Deng et al., 2013 and Elmore et al., 2016 that provided the first evidence of functional “crRNA sharing” from “communal” arrays using engineered plasmids. These indications spark considerable interest in the possibility that such immunological redundancy might be effective in a natural ecosystem. With some new data, we provide explicit evidence (below) that promiscuous crRNA use by the type III-B system in <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> MMB-1 provides PAM-independent backup to type I-F CRISPR-Cas immunity against naturally occurring phages that have PAM mutations allowing them to escape type I-F interference. We hope the revised manuscript provides a clearer description of the unique new insights of our work in the context of the existing literature.</p><p>We have also clarified another significant aspect of the cooperation between CRISPR systems, related to the architecture of the CRISPR-Cas systems. Type III systems (such as the type III-B loci in <italic>S. islandicus</italic> REY15A used by Deng et al., and the type III-B loci in <italic>P. furiosus</italic> used by Elmore et al.) often lack CRISPR arrays, as well as components for acquisition of spacers (i.e. <italic>cas1</italic> and <italic>cas2</italic>) and for crRNA processing and maturation (i.e. <italic>cas6</italic>). The earlier data were consistent with models (certainly still plausible) that different systems co-habiting the same host might potentially share ‘communal’ CRISPR arrays, with the systems having co-evolved to use identical CRISPR repeat sequences for crRNA selection and loading onto the interference machinery. In contrast, the type III-B system in <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> MMB-1 has evidently been recently acquired (relative to the type I-F system that is conserved in very closely related <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> strains, whereas the type III-B systems differ both in sequence and genomic context) and contains its own components for each step of the CRISPR immunity pathway, including CRISPR arrays that we demonstrate are specific to the type III-B system (yielding precursor crRNAs that can only be processed by type III-B factors). The observation that the <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> MMB-1 type III-B system can also use type I-F crRNAs, shows an opportunistic and potentially adaptive flexibility to both own and borrow guides, and establishes an entirely new model of plasticity in crRNA selection by the type III interference machinery.</p><p>The key points here have been substantially strengthened in the revised manuscript through the isolation and sequencing of an additional phage, and through characterization of the corresponding infectivity patterns in laboratory evolution experiments. We hope that we have now better articulated how these findings fit within, and extend, the context of previous work – in particular, the previously enigmatic co-occurrence of type III and type I systems.</p><p>Please also refer to our response to point 4.</p><p><italic>2) The rather poor immunity provided by the type III-B system when using the type I-F spacer, indicates that type III-B-mediated interference using a type I-F-derived spacer is impaired. It is critical that type III-B-mediated phage defense is measured with spacers derived from its own type III-B array. In addition, RNA-seq from pull-down type I-F and III-B complexes should be used to corroborate that type I-F crRNAs are also present in the type III-B complex but not vice versa.</italic> </p><p>We now explain this in more detail in the paper. Multiple lines of evidence support a substantially effective immune response by the type III-B system. This should now be clearer, both from more explicit explanation and some additional data in the paper.</p><p>Immunity can be measured on a variety of scales, and the immunity provided by the type III-B system using the type I-F spacers is substantial in each of the individual assays. Our plasmid inference assays provide a direct comparison for the type III-B system using its own spacers versus type I-F spacers. In both cases we observed at least a two order-of-magnitude decrease in plasmid conjugation efficiency. (E.g. compare results of the plasmid interference assay with the ∆I-Fcas123 strain (only type III interference possible in this strain) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (type III interference using spacers from the type III-B array) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> (type III interference using spacers from the type I-F array). To make the corollary argument: that anti-plasmid type I and type III interference efficiencies are similar, compare type III interference using type I spacers in the ∆I-Fcas123 strain (only type III interference possible, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) with PAM-enabled type I interference using type I spacers in the ∆III-B strain (only type I interference possible, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>)). Because different spacer sequences provide differing levels of immunity, even within the same system (e.g. Xue, NAR 2015), we had performed the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>, and 5C-D with two examples of each spacer type.</p><p>In regards to phage defense, although the ~10 fold increase in CPG1g phage EOP observed in the absence of the type III-B system might appear modest, this is still greater than the immunity provided by the type I-F system (owing to the PAM and protospacer mutations in the phage) – representing a fitness advantage for strains possessing the type III-B system (see also our response to the reviewers’ point 4). Moreover, plaque formation is a complex process dependent on several factors (e.g. the host growth rate, phage burst time and size) and the absolute difference in plaque numbers (EOP) provides only one metric of immunity. As such, we now emphasize both the EOP and plaque size (e.g. larger plaques are formed in the absence of type III-B immunity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>An additional set of arguments comes from our isolation of a new phage, CB5A, which is targeted by the <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> MMB-1 type I-F system with a canonical PAM (GG) (see also our response to reviewers’ point 3). This has enabled us to present a broader examination of the role type I-F spacers play in phage immunity, and to directly address the reviewers’ concern that type III immunity relative to type I anti-phage defense is somehow impaired. When we examined efficiency of plaquing for CB5A, we observed that knockout of the type III-B system increases the EOP &gt;1000 fold, whereas the knockout of type I-F interference (the <italic>cas1, cas2-3</italic> deletion strain) only increases the EOP ~50 fold (note that the type I-F system can only use one spacer to target CB5A, compared with multiple type I-F derived spacers used by the type III-B system). The differences between CB5A and CPG1g infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>) in the presence or absence of various CRISPR-Cas components highlight that the type III-B system provides robust anti-phage defense using type I-F crRNAs, and likely reflect the evolutionary divergence of these phage, driven by host CRISPR-Cas immunity (see also the expanded Results section “The type III-B CRISPR-Cas system counteracts viral escape from the type I-F system”).</p><p>In response to the second point of the reviewer’s comment (that RNAseq from pull-downs of the type I-F and type III-B complexes should be performed) we feel that although it might be nice to include complementary data such as this, it would not provide any additional biological insights beyond what we have extensively demonstrated with functional assays in vivo. Given the strong functional evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C-D</xref>; of particular note, assays indicating that type III interference using type I-F spacers requires multiple type III-B components including Cmr2, Cmr4, and the GGDD motif in Cmr2) and challenges in interpreting co-precipitation data (e.g. non-specific RNA-protein binding could occur even in the absence of a functional interaction; conversely,the lack of an association in a co-immunoprecipitation assay would not provide a reliable assessment of the lack of an interaction in vivo), we consider these experiments to be beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>3) The authors state that the type III-B system provides an additional layer of protection. However, all experiments are performed using fixed genotypes. To demonstrate that type III limits phage escape, we recommend evolutionary experiments. Phage challenge of cells with a wild type immune system (i.e. I-F and III-B), as well as the isogenic mutant lacking III-B, would allow the authors to test the hypothesis by looking for phage escape mutants after 1, 2 and 3 days.</italic> </p><p>We share the reviewer’s enthusiasm for these laboratory-evolution type experiments. We were initially precluded from performing these, due to the lack of a phage-host combination where the host possessed type I-F–specific immunity against the phage (due to the PAM mutations in CPG1g). We investigated ‘engineering’ a relationship in our phage-host setup, but this would be impractical. Fortunately, we were able to address this point by isolating another new phage from the marine environment. We performed additional phage isolations from sediment samples obtained from Mediterranean sea-grass meadows in Calabardina (Aguilas, Spain) using a previously isolated <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> strain with a histidine kinase mutation that renders the host more sensitive to CPG1g infection (in addition to altering the regulation of other physiological processes such as melanin synthesis). The new phage, designated CB5A, is closely related to CPG1g and may more closely represent an ancestor of phage CPG1g. This phage contains an intact PAM next to a protospacer that perfectly matches the second native spacer in the type I-F CRISPR04 array in the MMB-1 genome. The intact PAM implies that this protospacer would be recognized by both the type I-F and III-B systems. Consistent with this expectation, it produces small plaques on lawns of the ∆I-F Cas123 strain (i.e. lacking type I-F interference), or the ∆III-B strain (lacking type III-B interference; note that CPG1g – an “escape” phage itself – produces large plaques on this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>)). Phage CB5A was passaged on WT and ∆III-B strains with the addition of fresh host cells daily at each sub-culturing step, and mutant phage escaping the type I-F system arose after just one re-inoculation on the ∆III-B host, but not with the WT – providing evidence that the ability of the III-B system to use I-F crRNAs reduces the proliferation of “escape” phages.</p><p>Eleven CB5A escape mutants from 6 independent evolution experiments were isolated and characterized by whole genome sequencing: all contained deletions or mutations of the PAM-containing protospacer. These phage isolates were also shown to match the CPG1g “escape” plaquing phenotype (i.e. large plaques on the ∆III-B host) instead of the CB5A phenotype (small plaques on the ∆III-B host). These results are described in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and its supplements, and are congruent with our model that the type III-B system helps to counter phages that escape type I-F defenses, thereby providing a fitness advantage to the host. We thank the reviewers for suggesting we pursue this experiment as we consider that this has added significant evolutionary context for our findings.</p><p><italic>4) The authors describe a scenario that might explain the selective force that caused the III-B and I-F systems to end up in the same host. However, the sparse genomic data used is not convincing and the proposed scenario seems contrived. This section of the paper should be moved to the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the feedback on this section. It is our view that the genomic sequencing and comparative genomics data in this section are a critical part of the narrative. We have also clarified this in the reworked discussion of this section.</p><p>To better convey the close genetic relationship between the <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> strains that we sequenced as part of this study, we have performed average nucleotide identity (ANI) analyses to definitively establish relationships between these isolates of <italic>M. mediterranea.</italic> From this analysis, it is clear that theseare very closely related strains of the same species that exhibit remarkable differences between the type III CRISPR-Cas loci that they possess and/or lack. One of the key differences between our study and previous work, is that past studies (e.g. Deng et al., 2013, Elmore et al., 2016) suggest a model where type III systems stably co-reside with type I loci to provide redundancy or prevent evasion by anti-CRISPRs or phage escape mutants. We demonstrate that type III systems can indeed provide immunological redundancy in nature, with the genomic data presented in this section of our paper leading strongly to a model in which type III-B systems in <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> were more recently acquired than the type I-F system (which is conserved in all sequenced <italic>M. mediterranea</italic> strains). Thus, a more dynamic situation occurs in natural populations of <italic>M. mediterranea</italic>, whereby uptake and/or loss of diverse type III modules could be selected for by pressures arising in the course of the phage-host arms race. We propose that the apparent horizontal mobility of type III CRISPR interference modules even in closely related bacterial genomes (shown here for <italic>Marinomonas</italic> species, and also previously observed for strains of <italic>S. islandicus</italic> by Held et al., 2013) is advantageous due to their ability to use crRNAs from type I CRISPR loci, rather than a sign of their dependence on type I systems. In addition, as detailed in our earlier responses, our new data provide experimental evidence that the MMB-1 type III-B system suppresses proliferation of phage mutants that might otherwise have escaped type I-F defenses – supporting a selective advantage for III-B systems through co-opting type I-F crRNAs.</p><p><italic>5) Repeat spacer analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> with spacers acquired from plasmids.</italic> </p><p>We have performed these analyses as recommended. Despite the acquired spacer counts from plasmid being low, the binary relationships between the sense and antisense fractions were maintained in all experiments (with one exception, ∆Cmr4, likely a statistical anomaly from the low plasmid-derived-spacer counts). As nothing unexpected arose from this analysis, we would prefer to omit these results from the figures to avoid potential, unnecessary overwhelming of readers.
