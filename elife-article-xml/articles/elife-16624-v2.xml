subcellular localization, levels and activity of the unconventional myosin Dachs. To better understand this process, we have performed a structure-function analysis of Dachs, and used this to identify a novel and important mediator of Fat and Dachs activities, a Dachs-binding SH3 protein we have named Dlish. We found that Dlish is regulated by Fat and Dachs, that Dlish also binds Fat and the Dachs regulator Approximated, and that Dlish is required for Dachs localization, levels and activity in both wild type and <italic>fat</italic> mutant tissue. Our evidence supports dual roles for Dlish. Dlish tethers Dachs to the subapical cell cortex, an effect partly mediated by the palmitoyltransferase Approximated under the control of Fat. Conversely, Dlish promotes the Fat-mediated degradation of Dachs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16624.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16624.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Hippo</kwd><kwd>planar cell polarity</kwd><kwd>Fat</kwd><kwd>Dachs</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>DHHC palmitoyltransferase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS028202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blair</surname><given-names>Seth S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007015</institution-id><institution>University of Wisconsin-Madison</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Department of Zoology Guyer Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS034783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fehon</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Fat-regulated scaffolding protein Dlish controls the activity, levels and cortical localization of Warts-inhibiting myosin Dachs by linking Dachs to a critical Dachs regulator, the DHHC palmitoyltransferase Approximated, and to the Fat-mediated regulation of Dachs stability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heterophilic binding between the giant Drosophila protocadherins Fat and Dachsous (Ds) both limits organ growth, via regulation of the Hippo pathway, and orients planar cell polarity (PCP), through cell-by-cell polarization of Fat, Ds and their downstream effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blair, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Irvine and Harvey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matis and Axelrod, 2013</xref>). Loss of Fat and, to a lesser extent, Ds, leads to the profound overgrowth of the Drosophila imaginal discs that give rise to adult appendages, and loss of either disorders the polarity of cell divisions, hairs and other morphological features in a variety of Drosophila tissues. But while players and pathways have been defined that are genetically downstream of Fat-Ds binding, only a little is known about the biochemical links between these and their most powerful regulator, the intracellular domain (ICD) of Fat.</p><p>A good deal of the recent work on Fat effectors has focused on the regulation of unconventional type XX myosin Dachs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matakatsu and Blair, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rauskolb et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>). Dachs is critical first because it provides the only known marker specifically sensitive to changes in the Fat/Ds branches of both the Hippo and PCP pathways. Dachs is normally concentrated in the subapical cell cortex, overlapping subapically-concentrated Fat and Ds. Loss of Fat greatly increases subapical Dachs levels, and polarization of Fat and Ds to opposite cell faces can in turn polarize Dachs to the face with less Fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambegaonkar AA, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bosveld et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mao et al., 2006</xref>). Fat thus inhibits or destabilizes subapical Dachs, while Ds may do the opposite. Downstream changes in Hippo or PCP activities do not affect Dachs.</p><p>Dachs changes are also critical because they play a major role downstream of Fat. Dachs binds to and inhibits the activity of the kinase Warts (the Drosophila Lats1/2 ortholog), both reducing Warts levels and changing its conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rauskolb et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vrabioiu and Struhl, 2015</xref>). Warts is concentrated in the subapical cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matakatsu and Blair, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun et al., 2015</xref>), and thus the increased cortical Dachs of <italic>fat</italic> mutants should reduce the phosphorylation of Yorkie by Warts, allowing Yorkie to move into the nucleus to drive the transcription of growth-promoting target genes. Indeed, Dachs is necessary for the overgrowth and increased Yorkie target gene expression of <italic>fat</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mao et al., 2006</xref>). Dachs overexpression also causes overgrowth, although more weakly than the overgrowth caused by the loss of Fat, indicating that Dachs is partly sufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rauskolb et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Dachs can also bind to the core PCP pathway component Spiny legs (Sple) and alter its localization, thus influencing PCP in the subset of tissues that rely on Sple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayukawa et al., 2014</xref>). The increased levels of unpolarized Dachs in <italic>fat</italic> mutants may misdirect Sple, accounting for at least some of the PCP defects; <italic>fat</italic> mutant hair PCP defects are improved, although not eliminated, by loss of <italic>dachs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambegaonkar and Irvine, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blair, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matakatsu and Blair, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Dachs has not been shown to interact directly with Fat’s ICD, and only three other proteins are known to affect Dachs accumulation in the subapical cell cortex, the casein kinase 1ε Discs overgrown (Dco), Approximated (App) and F-box-like 7 (Fbxl7). Dco may act through Fat itself: Dco binds and phosphorylates the Fat ICD, and loss of Dco function causes strong overgrowth and increases subapical Dachs, similar to loss of Fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feng and Irvine, 2009</xref>; Matakatsu, Blair and Fehon, Unpublished; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodrigues-Campos and Thompson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sopko et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>App suggests a mechanism in which Fat inhibits the tethering of Dachs to protein complexes in the subapical domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>app</italic> mutants decrease subapical Dachs levels and reduce Dachs activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matakatsu and Blair, 2008</xref>). Thus, like <italic>dachs</italic> mutants, <italic>app</italic> mutants reverse the overgrowth and increased Yorkie target gene expression normally observed in <italic>fat</italic> mutants, and improve hair PCP. App is one of 20 Drosophila DHHC palmitoyltransferases, transmembrane proteins responsible for adding palmitates to cytoplasmic proteins and thereby anchoring them to cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fukata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Linder and Deschenes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nadolski and Linder, 2007</xref>). App is also concentrated in the subapical cell membrane and can bind both Dachs and the Fat ICD (Matakatsu, Blair and Fehon, Unpublished). Thus, in the simplest model App palmitoylates or tethers Dachs, concentrating it in the cell cortex, and Fat works in part by sequestering or inhibiting App. However, Dachs is not detectably palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matakatsu and Blair, 2008</xref>; Matakatsu, Blair and Fehon, Unpublished).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16624.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Models of Fat-mediated regulation of subapical Dachs by Fat-inhibited subapical tethering and Fat-stimulated destabilization.</title><p>In wild type, Dlish binds Dachs, and when palmitoylated by Approximated helps tether Dachs to the subapical membrane where Dachs can inhibit Warts; Dachs contributes to tethering by binding the F-actin cytoskeleton.

Dlish promotes the destabilization of Dachs, either indirectly by tethering it near Fat-bound ubiquitin ligases, or directly by helping Dachs complex with those ligases. In <italic>dlish</italic> mutants both the tethering and destabilization of Dachs are reduced; excess Dachs accumulates in the cytoplasm but no longer inhibits Warts.

Fbxl7 binds Fat’s ICD, and Fbxl7 localization and function are regulated by Fat; moreover, subapical Dachs increases in Fbxl7 mutants, causing moderate overgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodrigues-Campos and Thompson, 2014</xref>). Like other F-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>), Fbxl7 could function in a Skp-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, thereby targeting Dachs for proteasome-mediated degradation or trafficking away from the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, Fbxl7 has not been shown to bind Dachs or change its total levels in cells, and the two studies differ about its ability to stimulate Dachs ubiquitination. Nor does loss of Fbxl7 completely reproduce the strong overgrowth caused by loss of Fat or Dco. Nonetheless, the idea that Fat regulates a complex for the ubiquitination of Dachs is an attractive one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), given Fat’s ability to locally reduce the accumulation of Dachs. In fact, loss of Fat greatly increases the total levels of Dachs in imaginal disc cells (Matakatsu et al., Unpublished), a result we will confirm.</p><p>Below, we will describe the function of a novel Dachs binding protein, and show that its effects provide strong evidence for both the palmitoylation-dependent and degradation-dependent regulation of Dachs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our structure-function analysis of Dachs found regions required for its normal subapical localization, and we used this information as the basis for a screen for novel Dachs binding partners. We found a direct binding partner for the Dachs C-terminus, the previously uncharacterized SH3 domain protein CG10933, which we have renamed <underline>D</underline>achs <underline>li</underline>gand with <underline>SH</underline>3s, or Dlish. We show that the activity and subapical concentration of Dlish are regulated by Fat, Dco and Dachs, and that Dlish in turn is required for the subapical concentration and full activity of Dachs in both wild type and <italic>fat</italic> mutant cells. Dlish localization also depends on App; furthermore Dlish binds to and is palmitoylated by App, and that palmitoylation can be suppressed by Fat. Loss of Dlish also increases the total levels of Dachs, likely by blocking Fat-mediated destabilization of Dachs. We propose that Dlish targets Dachs to subapical protein complexes in part via Fat-regulated, App-mediated palmitoylation. Dlish thereby concentrates Dachs where it can efficiently inhibit subapical Warts, and conversely links Dachs to the machinery for Fat-dependent destabilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hippo-specific subdomains of the Fat ICD affect the accumulation of subapical Dachs</title><p>Overexpression of a version of Fat that lacks its extracellular domain (FatΔECD) can rescue the overgrowth and heightened Yorkie target gene expression normally seen in <italic>fat</italic> mutant wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matakatsu and Blair, 2006</xref>).

There was, however, a profound effect on anti-Dachs staining that was reminiscent of the Dachs mislocalization caused by the removal of its Dlish-binding C terminus. Dachs levels increased throughout the cytoplasm, and the concentration of Dachs at the subapical cell cortex was slightly to severely disrupted, depending on the strength of the Dlish knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L–O</xref>; additional examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H,I</xref>).</p><p>Dlish is also sufficient to change Dachs localization and activity.

Alternatively, Dlish could be directly mediating the regulation of Warts by Dachs, independent of its effects on Dachs localization. We favor the first alternative, as we have not found binding between Dlish and Warts or other Warts-binding proteins (see above). In addition, we found that tethering Dachs to the cell cortex by adding a CAAX prenylation site at its C-terminus can override the requirement for Dlish.

Yet <italic>dlish</italic> knockdown increases cytoplasmic Dachs, whereas in <italic>fat</italic> mutants the increase is subapical. To explain this, we hypothesize that as Dlish targets or stabilizes Dachs in the subapical cell cortex, it places Dachs in or near complexes where it can also be destabilized by Fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). When Fat is lost destabilization no longer occurs, so the total and subapical levels of Dachs increase.

Dachs is not detectably palmitoylated in vitro or in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matakatsu and Blair, 2008</xref>; Matakatsu, Blair and Fehon, Unpublished). We therefore directly examined the palmitoylation of Dlish using the Acyl Biotinyl Exchange (ABE) method, which uses N-ethylmaleimide to block free cysteines, hydroxylamine (HAM) to break palmitoyl-thioester bonds, and sulfhydryl-reactive biotin to label those bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drisdel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drisdel and Green, 2004</xref>).

We have confirmed binding in S2 cells, and found that App can co-IP not only with the domains C-terminal to the Hippo domains (FatΔECDΔN-6), but also the domains most strongly active in Dachs and Hippo pathway regulation (FatΔECD-PH+Hippo) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). Like Dlish, App failed to bind to FatΔECDΔ4-C and FatΔECD-Hippo, which have, respectively, no or reduced Hippo activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Matakatsu and Blair, 2012</xref>). These results raise the possibility that Fat binding might regulate the activity of App on substrates like Dlish.</p><p>We therefore tested whether the addition of FatΔECD could alter App-stimulated Dlish palmitoylation in S2 cells, and found a marked decrease compared with the addition of App alone (6 of 6 repeats; example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>; averages and significance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 12—source data 1</xref>). This result is consistent with the model that Fat reduces subapical Dachs by interfering with or modifying the interaction between App and Dlish, reducing App’s ability to palmitoylate Dish and tether the Dlish-Dachs complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The unconventional myosin Dachs is an important effector Fat/Ds-regulated Hippo signaling, as its heightened subapical levels in <italic>fat</italic> mutants inhibit and destabilize Warts, freeing Yorkie to increase the expression of growth-promoting genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rauskolb et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vrabioiu and Struhl, 2015</xref>). We used a structure-function analysis of Dachs as a springboard to search for new binding partners that are critical for Dachs localization and function, and have found Dlish (CG10933), a novel SH3 domain protein. Dlish binds directly to the Dachs C-terminus, and loss of Dlish disrupts Dachs localization, levels and function: subapical accumulation of Dachs is reduced and cytoplasmic and total levels increase, both in wild type and <italic>fat</italic> mutant tissue, while activity is lost. Importantly, Dlish is regulated by Fat, as loss of Fat greatly increases Dlish levels in the subapical cell cortex and, like Dachs, Dlish is needed for much of the <italic>fat</italic> mutant overgrowth.</p><p>Dlish also binds the ICD of Fat and other Fat-binding proteins, including two that likely mediate part of its function: the palmitoyltransferase App and the F-box protein Fbxl7. Thus Dlish provides a new biochemical link from the Fat ICD to Dachs regulation. Our evidence indicates that Dlish plays two different and opposing roles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). First, it helps tether Dachs in the subapical cell membrane, in part via Fat-regulated, App-dependent palmitoylation, so that Dachs can more efficiently inhibit Warts. Second, it links Dachs to Fat-organized machinery for Dachs destabilization, including Fbxl7, and thus helps reduce Dachs levels.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Dlish, App and subapical tethering</title><p>Dlish and Dachs cooperate to target or tether the Dlish-Dachs complex, as each is necessary, and to a weaker extent sufficient, for the subapical concentration of the other. The Dachs contribution is likely through tethering the complex to the cortical cytoskeleton, as we found that loss of the F-Actin-binding myosin head blocks the subapical localization of Dachs. This would agree with recent biochemical analyses that suggest that Dachs has no motor function, acting rather as an F-Actin-binding scaffolding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The Dlish contribution, on the other hand, depends at least in part on its ability to bind the transmembrane DHHC palmitoyltransferase App. Loss of App (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matakatsu and Blair, 2008</xref>; Matakatsu, Blair and Fehon, Unpublished) and Dlish have very similar effects on Dachs localization and activity. We found that loss of App disrupts the subapical accumulation of Dlish in vivo, and that App can stimulate palmitoylation of Dlish in vitro. Thus, palmitoylation of Dlish likely stimulates membrane association of both Dlish and its binding partner Dachs.</p><p>App also has additional effects on Fat pathway activity. First, App has palmitoyltransferase-independent activity and can co-IP Dachs in vitro (Matakatsu, Blair and Fehon, Unpublished). Thus, while palmitoylation of Dlish may mediate some of App’s activity, subapical App may simultaneously help localize the Dlish-Dachs complex by physical tethering. And while both palmitoylation and tethering of the Dlish-Dachs complex is likely critical for the <italic>fat</italic> mutant phenotype, App also has a function that depends on the presence of Fat, as App can bind, palmitoylate and inhibit the activity of Fat’s ICD (Matakatsu, Blair and Fehon, Unpublished).</p><p>An important question is whether the absence of Fat regulates the App-dependent tethering of the Dlish-Dachs complex. The Fat ICD can complex with both Dlish (this study) and App (Matakatsu, Blair and Fehon, Unpublished). We found that Dlish and App can bind not only the C-terminal region of the Fat ICD where Fat is palmitoylated, but also the PH and Hippo domains which we showed played the strongest role in Dachs regulation. An attractive mechanism is that Fat inhibits the interaction between App and Dlish, reducing App’s ability to palmitoylate and tether the Dlish-Dachs complex. In the absence of Fat, App and Dlish are freed to tether Dachs, and Dachs now inhibits and destabilizes Warts, causing overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In support of this model, we found that overexpression of Fat’s ICD in vitro can reduce App-stimulated palmitoylation of Dlish.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dlish and the regulation of Dachs levels</title><p>Our evidence further indicates that Dlish targets Dachs for Fat-dependent destabilization. Loss of Fat increases not only subapical Dachs, but also total Dachs levels (Matakatsu, Blair and Fehon, Unpublished), a result we have confirmed. In the presence of Dlish the increased Dachs remains subapical. Loss of Dlish also increases the total levels of Dachs, but now that increase is cytoplasmic, and much less effective at inhibiting Warts. These Dachs increases are unlikely to have independent causes, as they are not additive; total Dachs levels are similar after loss of Fat, Dlish or both.</p><p>We propose that in wild type cells there is a flux of the Dachs-Dlish complex from the cytoplasm to the subapical cell cortex, where a Fat-dependent complex destabilizes Dachs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Normally the tethering effects of Dlish predominate over the Fat-dependent destabilization, and moderate levels of subapical Dachs are maintained. Destabilization is lost without Fat; this combines with Dlish-mediated tethering to increase subapical Dachs. Without Dlish the subapical tethering of Dachs is disrupted, access to Fat-dependent destabilization is lost and the now cytoplasmic Dachs increases. The model thus explains why the excess, largely cytoplasmic Dachs caused by reduced Dlish function is not greatly influenced by the presence or absence of Fat.</p><p>In addition to any effects caused by changing the subcellular localization of Dachs, Dlish may also provide a direct link to the machinery for protein ubiquitination, as Dlish can co-IP with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Fbxl7, as well as the related F-box ubiquitin ligase Slimb. Fbxl7 is particularly intriguing, as it binds to and is regulated by Fat’s ICD, and reduces subapical Dachs, perhaps via ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodrigues-Campos and Thompson, 2014</xref>). Slimb can bind and ubiquitinate Expanded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), a subapical regulator of Hippo signaling with links to Fat and Dachs function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Irvine and Harvey, 2015</xref>). But while we found that loss of Fbxl7 or Slimb increases subapical Dachs and Dlish, these effects are weak (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; Matakatsu, Blair and Fehon, Unpublished), and the large increase in total Dachs levels caused by loss of Dlish or Fat must involve additional partners.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Fat, Dachs and Dlish in other taxa</title><p>Mutations in Fat’s closest mammalian homolog Fat4 (FatJ) and its Ds-like ligands strongly disrupt PCP-like processes, and have in humans been associated with the multisystem defects of Hennekam and Van Maldergem syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saburi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zakaria et al., 2014</xref>).

But the mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown, and Fat4 cannot regulate Hippo signaling in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bossuyt et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>It is therefore important to note that while homologs of Dachs and Dlish are found throughout the animal kingdom, they are apparently absent from vertebrates. This suggests that the Dachs-Dlish branch of the Fat-Ds pathway, with its powerful effect on Warts activity, is also lacking. Nonetheless, it has been suggested that Drosophila Fat and Ds can affect Hippo pathway activity in a Dachs-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Degoutin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaspar et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Barry Thompson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors identify and characterize the SH3 domain protein Dlish as a novel player in the Fat-Dachs pathway upstream of Hippo signaling. Dlish seems to function at the level of Dachs, and like Dachs positively regulate growth. The authors convincingly show that Dlish can interact and colocalize with Dachs, that Dlish and Dachs reciprocally regulate each other's subapical localization and that the localization of both Dlish and Dachs is regulated by Fat in a similar fashion. Strikingly, loss of Dlish can rescue fat mutant flies to adulthood, indicating Dlish plays a major role in Fat signaling and the fat mutant phenoytpe. Additionally, Dlish interacts with and is palmitoylated by App, which is hypothesized to help tether Dachs to the membrane and offers an attractive model for the poorly understood App-Dachs relationship. However, other topics investigated, such as the role of Dlish in regulating Dachs stability or the function of Dlish as a biochemical link between Fat and Dachs, are not conclusively demonstrated and should be investigated more carefully (or removed, as there is already a great deal of data). Overall, the findings are novel and of interest to the field and are appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> if the following concerns can be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref> show binding assays of different Fat constructs with Dlish and App, respectively. Strangely, the same results are observed for both proteins that don't seem to be conclusive, a fact that is not discussed in the text: in both experiments the &quot;PHHippo&quot; construct strongly binds, while the &quot;Hippo&quot; construct alone doesn't; However, the &quot;∆4-C&quot; construct, which contains the PH domain, doesn't bind, ruling out that it is simply the PH domain that mediates binding. Adding to the confusion, the C-terminus (as tested by ∆N-6) is independently able to interact with Dlish/App. I cannot see how these experiments help the story; I assume that the idea was to link the &quot;Hippo&quot; domain of Fat to Dlish/App and to link back to the regulation of Dachs as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; but based on the results shown I cannot agree with this logic. Additionally, I would worry that some of these cell culture results might be overexpression artifacts or caused by disrupting the proper structure/folding of Fat.</p><p>Considering the data, statements in the text (e.g. at the end of the Results section) are too strong.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> is used to argue that the second SH3 domain of Dlish mediates Dachs binding. A less overexposed blot for Dlish (I assume the IP is shown?) that allows assessment of expression levels, as well as a blot showing Dachs input levels should be provided.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> would benefit from showing additional panels. For example, in E the reader has to guess where the hh domain starts (please provide a co-stain of Dachs or similar). In F, H and I an additional panel showing a split channel image clearly indicating clone boundaries should be added. Similarly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N and O</xref> panels with Flag stainings need to be shown.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> It is unclear from text and figure if 100% of fat-fd, <italic>dlish<sup>04</sup></italic> animals have rescued lethality and survive to adulthood. Please provide information about the efficiency of the rescue.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and L</xref> images appear to originate from different discs. It would be more convincing to show the effect of <italic>dlish</italic> knockdown on Dachs localization within the same wing disc and to provide a z-stack (as in Figure 5B2).</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref> is a poor representation of an adult eye section and should be considered to be removed. If not, a better picture and clarification what &quot;occasional&quot; means (&quot;occasional ommatidial reversal&quot;), should be provided. I is unclear, as the entire panel I1 seems to have purple signal, while I2 suggests that Dachs is represented in purple and gone in the lower third of the panel. The nature of the green staining is not indicated. It is further unclear where the ptc-domain is (provide Dlish co-stain). J is unconvincing, as the Dlish staining looks qualitatively very different from other Dlish stainings shown (for example in K).</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1L-P</xref> explores the effects of CAAX-mediated membrane tagging of Dachs. At this point, this does not add a lot of value to the manuscript. However, an experiment could be designed to test if the effect on Yki target genes (such as bantam reporter as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) of Dlish knockdown/<italic>dlish<sup>04</sup></italic> clones can be repressed/rescued by expression of Dachs-CAAX (e.g. using MARCM). This would argue that the main role of Dlish is indeed to tether Dachs at the membrane. It seems that the authors are trying to implicate something similar in the text (at the end of the subsection “<italic>dlish</italic> is required for normal Dachs localization and fat mutant overgrowth”), however I don't think this conclusion can be easily drawn from overexpression data (levels of dachs-CAAX overexpression would need to be controlled; maybe Dachs-CAAX is less efficient in regulating growth, but the difference in signaling strength is compensated for by increased levels (panel N indicates increased Dachs-CAAX overexpression compared to M).</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A/B</xref> appears to be the result of only one experiment, judging from the lack of error bars. Please provide averaged results from three independent experiments with standard deviation (I realize that one repeat with slightly different numbers is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> but believe three repeats are needed).</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> indicates that Dachs total levels are regulated by Fat and Dlish and suggests this could be due to a recruitment of Slimb, Fbxl7 or other members of the ubiquitination/degradation machinery. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D-E</xref> clearly shows that Slimb has no effect on Dachs or Dlish. As this is an important piece of information, please move D-E into the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> to not mislead readers.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> would greatly benefit from the addition of the ladder (which is generally a good idea), to help the reader evaluate the size of the ubiquitinated band. Please also comment on the fact that despite a reduction in Dachs ubiquitination after Dlish knockdown, total Dachs levels are unchanged, indicating no change in Dachs stability/degradation. And if Dlish is indeed promoting Dachs degradation, why are Dachs levels less increased in <italic>fat-, dlish-RNAi</italic> wing discs than in <italic>fat-</italic> wing discs (panel A-B)?</p><p>To strengthen the correlative relationship between Dachs stability/levels and Dlish's ability to bind Slimb and Fbxl7, the authors might consider investigating the ability of Fbxl7 to ubiquitinate/degrade Dlish and to repeat the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D-E</xref> with <italic>fbxl7</italic> RNAi.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref> is very confusing and it is not clear how this adds anything to the story. First of all, this appears to be data from only one experiment, due to the lack of error bars. It is my understanding that S2 cells don't express Fat, which explains why the fat RNAi treatment doesn't have any effect on Dachs, but makes me wonder why this experiment was performed in the first place. Fat∆ECD in S2 cells localizes abnormally, which might explain the opposite effect on Dachs levels than in vivo. At this point the authors have already investigated Dachs level regulation in vivo, which is much more credible. The authors should consider removing this from the manuscript.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-B</xref> shows basal/cytoplasmic increase of Dlish and Dachs in app clones. Please provide pictures of the subapical plane or z-axis view of z-stacks. Presumably similar results as in C are expected.</p><p>12) The assay used by the authors to argue that Dlish is palmitoylated is not specific enough to make this claim. Any other cysteine modifications sensitive to hydroxylamine would also give a signal – including any other fatty acids. The conclusions should be modified to reflect this uncertainty – alternatively using &quot;clickable' palmitate could give a more interpretable result.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16624.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>In this manuscript the authors identify and characterize the SH3 domain protein Dlish as a novel player in the Fat-Dachs pathway upstream of Hippo signaling.

Overall, the findings are novel and of interest to the field and are appropriate for publication in eLife if the following concerns can be addressed.</italic> </p><p>First, we, like the reviewers, felt that the activity of Dlish and Approximated needed to be tied more closely to the activity of the ICD of Fat. Our co-IP between Dlish, Approximated and the Fat ICD suggested such a connection, and we now have new data that greatly strengthens this. As we showed previously, adding Approximated to our in vitro palmitoylation assay increased the palmitoylation of Dachs. We now show that this App-stimulated palmitoylation is reliably decreased by the addition of Fat△ECD (6 of 6 trials). This supports our model that the Fat ICD inhibits the activity of Approximated, decreasing the palmitoylation of Dlish and therefore the tethering of the Dlish-Dachs complex to the cell membrane. This new data is included at the end of the Results, as part of a new figure that combines the new and old palmitoylation data. This also provides a strong rationale for retaining the co-IP data upon which the model is based.</p><p>Next, we generated a new <italic>dlish</italic> mutant that allowed us to compare the activities of overexpressed Dachs and the membrane-directed Dachs-CAAX in a <italic>dlish</italic> mutant background. As predicted, the removal of Dlish inhibits the activity of Dachs, but this requirement is overridden by directing Dachs-CAAX to the cell membrane. We describe this valuable experiment in more detail below in our comments on Essential Revision 7.</p><p>Third, we have added multiple trials and statistics to our demonstration of increases in total Dachs levels in <italic>dlish</italic> mutant, <italic>fat</italic> mutant and <italic>fat dlish</italic> double mutants. We have also greatly increased the number of trials for our Dlish palmitoylation assays, and this has allowed us to perform statistical analyses of the effects of App (and now Fat△ECD). Both of these new data sets strengthen the claims we made in the original manuscript.</p><p>Finally, we strongly feel that it is worthwhile retaining our data on the regulation of Dachs levels by Dlish and Fat, as it is both novel and a prominent feature of their phenotypes, and constrains the models of how they work. We also have new evidence that <italic>fbxl7</italic> can regulate subapical Dlish in vivo, and with a stronger <italic>slimb</italic> loss than the RNAi we used previously, can now also see increases in subapical Dlish and Dachs. This provides a much stronger rationale for the co-IP binding to Fbxl7 and Slimb.</p><p>However, we agree that the data on ubiquitination is incomplete, and we have removed it for use in a future study. As the reviewers pointed out, we have not worked out the basis for our in vitro ubiquitination result, and moreover Dlish could be a target of Fbxl7 and Slimb. The mutual co-dependence of subapical Dlish and Dachs makes this difficult to determine with any in vivo genetic test, as the absence of one will prevent subapical localization of the other, leaving none for subapical Fbxl7 or Slimb to work on. Our first in vitro tests of Dlish ubiquitination have been slowed by difficulties getting a strong enough Dlish signal, and this has prevented us from completing them in the time frame of the revision. We have nonetheless retained some speculation about ubiquitination in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref> show binding assays of different Fat constructs with Dlish and App, respectively. Strangely, the same results are observed for both proteins that don't seem to be conclusive, a fact that is not discussed in the text: in both experiments the &quot;PHHippo&quot; construct strongly binds, while the &quot;Hippo&quot; construct alone doesn't; However, the &quot;∆4-C&quot; construct, which contains the PH domain, doesn't bind, ruling out that it is simply the PH domain that mediates binding.

Additionally, I would worry that some of these cell culture results might be overexpression artifacts or caused by disrupting the proper structure/folding of Fat.</italic> </p><p><italic>Considering the data, statements in the text (e.g. at the end of the Results section) are too strong.</italic> </p><p>As discussed in the text, the C-terminal ∆N-6 region in Fat’s ICD likely plays an important role modulating the activity of the Hippo domains. It also binds to several of the proteins that bind to Dlish by co-IP (App, Fbxl7, Dco), as well as others (Grunge/Atrophin, Lowfat), and the region is phosphorylated by Dco. That Dlish can complex with this region is therefore not so surprising. What is important is that App and Dlish can co-IP with the PHHippo domains. This is the first report of any protein complexing with this critical region, and in our studies co-IP this to this region has been rare. We feel strongly that this needs to be reported.</p><p>We do not see binding to the smaller Hippo region in S2 cells, even though the identical region retains some, although weaker, biological activity in vivo. As the reviewers mention, there may be some trivial reasons for this, such as abnormal protein folding in S2 cells. We thought it would be dishonest not to include this data, however. Therefore we have added the following to the text about the Dlish co-IP:</p><p>“We did not observe co-IP with the smaller Fat△ECD-Hippo construct that lacks the PH domain. Although in vivo the PH region is not absolutely required for activity of the adjacent Hippo domains (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; Matakatsu and Blair 2012; Pan et al. 2013), it does strengthen that activity (Matakatsu and Blair 2012), and in the different environment found in S2 cells may be more critical for proper folding or the formation of protein complexes.”</p><p>We have also changed the text as follows:</p><p>“We have confirmed binding in S2 cells, and found that App can co-IP not only with the domains C-terminal to the Hippo domains (Fat△ECD-△N-6) where biotinylation occurs, but also the domains most strongly active in Dachs and Hippo pathway regulation (Fat△ECD-PHHippo) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). Like Dlish, App failed to bind to Fat△ECD△4-C and Fat△ECD-Hippo, which have, respectively, no or reduced Hippo activity in vivo (Matakatsu and Blair, 2012).”</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> is used to argue that the second SH3 domain of Dlish mediates Dachs binding. A less overexposed blot for Dlish (I assume the IP is shown?) that allows assessment of expression levels, as well as a blot showing Dachs input levels should be provided.</italic> </p><p>Although we thought the levels were clear on the original, we have as requested substituted a lower exposure, and labeled this more clearly as an IP. Also, as the loading levels for Dlish-△6, containing just the third SH3 of Dlish, are lower than those of the other constructs, we have added an equivalent GST pulldown experiment to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> that shows the same failure in Dachs binding to a GST-Dlish containing just the third SH3 domain, even with high input levels.</p><p>We have added back the GST-tagged input lane to all of our IVT experiments. Since the GST-tagged protein is first purified as a single preparation, and then equal amounts of that preparation incubated with each of the FLAG-tagged, in vitro translated binding candidates, there were equal levels of GST-protein input for each of the FLAG-tagged binding candidates. The single input lane is thus a bit redundant, as it confirms what is already obvious from the positive anti-FLAG IPs, that we successfully made and purified GST-tagged protein.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> would benefit from showing additional panels. For example, in E the reader has to guess where the hh domain starts (please provide a co-stain of Dachs or similar). In F, H and I an additional panel showing a split channel image clearly indicating clone boundaries should be added. Similarly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N and O</xref> panels with Flag stainings need to be shown.</italic> </p><p>We were originally trying to save space in what were already quite large figures. We have however added the extra frames for the original 4H, 6N and 6O. For the original 4F and 4I we have increased the intensity of the clone marker in the multicolor frames to make the clone regions obvious, and added an outline to the original 4I. And as some might question whether the clone in 4I is in the correct focal plane, being near a fold in the disc, we added a control frame showing unchanged subapical DE-cadherin from the same focal plane. To make room, we removed the adjacent RFP clone marker panel from the <italic>fat dachs</italic> double mutant clone, as there was already a panel marking the clone boundary by the absence of Dachs.</p><p>With these and other requested changes the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) has gotten a bit large, so we have removed the <italic>fat</italic> mutant data and made it into a separate figure.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> It is unclear from text and figure if 100% of fat-fd, dlish<sup>04</sup> animals have rescued lethality and survive to adulthood. Please provide information about the efficiency of the rescue.</italic> </p><p>The rescue is over 50%; we have added the phrase “the majority” to the text and added precise numbers to the figure legend. Keeping in mind that this only rescues the Hippo signaling aspect of Fat function, and not the orientation information for planar cell polarity that would be transmitted by binding between the extracellular domains of Fat and Dachsous, this level of rescue is quite good, better than we get by expressing Fat△ECD and about the same as we get expressing full-length Fat in <italic>fat</italic> mutants (Matakatsu and Blair, 2012).</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and L</xref> images appear to originate from different discs. It would be more convincing to show the effect of dlish knockdown on Dachs localization within the same wing disc and to provide a z-stack (as in Figure 5B2).</italic> </p><p>We have added a cross-section Z-stack image of a single disc, with the posterior labeled with anti-Engrailed. This is in fact anti-Dachs and anti-En from the same Z-stack used to show Dlish localization in the original Figure 5B2.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref> is a poor representation of an adult eye section and should be considered to be removed. If not, a better picture and clarification what &quot;occasional&quot; means (&quot;occasional ommatidial reversal&quot;), should be provided.</italic> </p><p>We have added a lower magnification image of the retina, and a larger detail with the polarities marked, so that an example of a reversed ommatidium can be more easily compared with its normal neighbors. Reversals were rare, around 2%, and we have added that information to the text.</p><p><italic>I is unclear, as the entire panel I1 seems to have purple signal, while I2 suggests that Dachs is represented in purple and gone in the lower third of the panel. The nature of the green staining is not indicated. It is further unclear where the ptc-domain is (provide Dlish co-stain).</italic> </p><p>The green staining was in fact indicated as being <italic>ptc-gal4</italic>-driven <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> (“<italic>ptc &gt; GFP</italic>”). Thus it shows the anterior <italic>ptc-gal4</italic> domain, so Dlish staining is not needed. We agree, however, that the green hides the higher basolateral Dachs shown in purple in the double color image, so we have simply followed the reviewer’s previous suggestion and now show GFP and Dachs in side-by-side panels.</p><p><italic>J is unconvincing, as the Dlish staining looks qualitatively very different from other Dlish stainings shown (for example in K).</italic> </p><p>We have changed this to a better image, and for reasons of continuity now added this to the main figures (see below). The reason for the difference in the original image is that subapical anti-Dlish staining is never as clean in the <italic>dlish<sup>04</sup></italic>/ heterozygotic discs as they are in wild type discs, likely due to low levels or abnormal localization of the Dlish<sup>04</sup> protein.</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1L-P</xref> explores the effects of CAAX-mediated membrane tagging of Dachs. At this point, this does not add a lot of value to the manuscript. However, an experiment could be designed to test if the effect on Yki target genes (such as bantam reporter as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) of Dlish knockdown/dlish<sup>04</sup> clones can be repressed/rescued by expression of Dachs-CAAX (e.g. using MARCM). This would argue that the main role of Dlish is indeed to tether Dachs at the membrane. It seems that the authors are trying to implicate something similar in the text (at the end of the subsection “dlish is required for normal Dachs localization and fat mutant overgrowth”), however I don't think this conclusion can be easily drawn from overexpression data (levels of dachs-CAAX overexpression would need to be controlled; maybe Dachs-CAAX is less efficient in regulating growth, but the difference in signaling strength is compensated for by increased levels (panel N indicates increased Dachs-CAAX overexpression compared to M).</italic> </p><p>We agree that the cleaner experiment is not to rely on the opposite effects of Dachs and Dachs-CAAX expression on Dlish levels, as in the original manuscript, but rather see how the different Dachs constructs act in a <italic>dlish</italic> mutant background. We were not previously able to do this experiment because of the UAST-YFP.Rab26.Q250L P element insertion of the <italic>dlish<sup>04</sup></italic> allele, which causes wing abnormalities in the presence of the Gal4 used to drive <italic>UAS-dachs</italic> expression. However, as the manuscript was out for review we obtained a new CRISPR allele of <italic>dlish</italic> that gives phenotypes very similar to <italic>dlish<sup>04</sup></italic> (now shown in the revised manuscript). The experiment required building new stocks with this allele, which occupied much of our time since we received the reviews. Importantly, the results match our prediction: the <italic>dlish</italic> mutation greatly reduced the overgrowth and Yki target gene expression induced by <italic>UAS-dachs</italic>, but not those induced by <italic>UAS-dachs-CAAX.</italic> We also show that overexpressed Dachs-CAAX remains cortically localized in the <italic>dlish</italic> mutant, while Dachs becomes largely cytoplasmic. Therefore, membrane localization of Dachs can compensate for the loss of Dlish. We have substituted this new experiment for our previous results, and moved the data from the supplement to a new figure.</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A/B</xref> appears to be the result of only one experiment, judging from the lack of error bars.

We have therefore as requested repeated this experiment multiple times.

And if Dlish is indeed promoting Dachs degradation, why are Dachs levels less increased in fat-, dlish-RNAi wing discs than in fat- wing discs (panel A-B)?</italic> </p><p><italic>To strengthen the correlative relationship between Dachs stability/levels and Dlish's ability to bind Slimb and Fbxl7, the authors might consider investigating the ability of Fbxl7 to ubiquitinate/degrade Dlish and to repeat the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D-E</xref> with fbxl7 RNAi.</italic> </p><p>The remainder of comment 9 concerned the ubiquitination experiment which has been removed from this version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref> is very confusing and it is not clear how this adds anything to the story. First of all, this appears to be data from only one experiment, due to the lack of error bars. It is my understanding that S2 cells don't express Fat, which explains why the fat RNAi treatment doesn't have any effect on Dachs, but makes me wonder why this experiment was performed in the first place. Fat∆ECD in S2 cells localizes abnormally, which might explain the opposite effect on Dachs levels than</italic> in vivo<italic>. At this point the authors have already investigated Dachs level regulation</italic> in vivo<italic>, which is much more credible. The authors should consider removing this from the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>Comment 10 concerned the ubiquitination experiment that has been removed from this version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-B</xref> shows basal/cytoplasmic increase of Dlish and Dachs in app clones. Please provide pictures of the subapical plane or z-axis view of z-stacks.

While we have tried several trials of this experiment, the subapical signal outside the clone is simply too poor to make this a fair test.

Any other cysteine modifications sensitive to hydroxylamine would also give a signal – including any other fatty acids. The conclusions should be modified to reflect this uncertainty – alternatively using &quot;clickable' palmitate could give a more interpretable result.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer makes a good point about the ABE possibly detecting other cysteine modifications, and so we have changed the text about our results from “palmitoylation” to the more accurate “HAM-induced biotinylation”. However, the sensitivity of this biotinylation to the levels of the palmitoyltransferase App make it very unlikely that change is due to some other modification. We have therefore also added the following text:</p><p>“This strongly argues that a substantial fraction of the biotinylation represents App-sensitive palmitoylation.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
