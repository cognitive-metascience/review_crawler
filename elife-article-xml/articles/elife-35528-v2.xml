Here, we identified all subunits of the mammalian GID/CTLH complex and provide a comprehensive map of its hierarchical organization and step-wise assembly. Biochemical reconstitution demonstrates that the mammalian complex possesses inherent E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, using Ube2H as its cognate E2. Deletions of multiple GID subunits compromise cell proliferation, and this defect is accompanied by deregulation of critical cell cycle markers such as the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor, phospho-Histone H3 and Cyclin A. We identify the negative regulator of pro-proliferative genes Hbp1 as a <italic>bonafide</italic> GID/CTLH proteolytic substrate. Indeed, Hbp1 accumulates in cells lacking GID/CTLH activity, and Hbp1 physically interacts and is ubiquitinated in vitro by reconstituted GID/CTLH complexes. Our biochemical and cellular analysis thus demonstrates that the GID/CTLH complex prevents cell cycle exit in G1, at least in part by degrading Hbp1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>E3 ubiquitin ligase</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>N-end rule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT- 000376/2014-L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lampert</surname><given-names>Fabienne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003006</institution-id><institution>Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Picotti</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name><name><surname>Stoffel</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><name><surname>Peter</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peter</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Stoffel</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peter</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteomic, biochemical and cell-based analyses of the heterodecameric core GID/CTLH E3 ligase complex reveal its molecular architecture, activity determinants, and function in targeting the tumor suppressor Hbp1 and other substrates required for cell proliferation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular proteostasis involves the coordinated and compensatory action of pathways that control biogenesis, folding, trafficking and breakdown of proteins allowing the cell to adapt to physiological or pathological environmental changes. A hallmark of proteome balance is the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) that degrades roughly 80% of multi-ubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins and Goldberg, 2017</xref>). In humans, about 600 distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases mark short-lived, malfunctioning and toxic molecules for degradation by 26S proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with the fundamental role of this major cellular quality control nexus, perturbations within the network are associated with many human diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>). The UPS is also required for cells to adjust to different nutrient conditions such as limiting carbon sources. Indeed, changing metabolic flux is often controlled by regulating the relative abundance of rate-limiting enzymes that function in distinct exergonic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakatsukasa et al., 2015</xref>). Particularly in yeast, an organism where gluconeogenesis and glycolytic activity are intermittently coordinated, the multi-subunit GID E3 ligase complex specifically targets the surplus of gluconeogenic enzymes, including the conserved Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (Fbp1), for proteasomal degradation. Adequate glucose levels trigger the enzymatic activity of the complex by either inducing the stabilization and/or de novo synthesis of its critical subunit Gid4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Santt et al., 2008</xref>). These original findings were broadened by a recent study, suggesting the presence of a new GID-based constitutive proteolytic pathway termed the Pro/N-end rule pathway, wherein N-terminal proline residues and a subsequent stretch of partially flexible amino acids provide the signature for GID-E3 substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Although the generality of such a model is tempting, to date known GID substrates are limited to enzymes that switch on glucose production in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources. In mammals, gluconeogenesis is almost exclusively performed by hepatocytes but also takes place, albeit to a much lower extent, in the kidney cortex and intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mutel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Previs et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, maintenance of blood glucose levels during fasting/starvation and/or rigorous exercise is primarily achieved through the breakdown of liver glycogen stocks (glycogenolysis) and the conversion of non-sugar carbon substrates via gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rui, 2014</xref>). Thus, while the biochemistry of many metabolic pathways is largely equivalent from bacteria to humans, the biological relevance and control mechanisms have adapted to the needs of the respective organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Otterstedt et al., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, all seven yeast GID proteins have homologous proteins in humans. Some of them, RanBP9 (Gid1), Rmnd5 (Gid2), Armc8 (Gid5), Twa1 (Gid8) and MAEA (GID9), have been found together in an ubiquitously expressed high-molecular weight assembly localized both to the nucleus and cytoplasm, also referred to as the C<italic>-</italic>terminal to LisH (CTLH) complex, after a sequence motif shared between several subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>). However, neither the counterpart of the critical yeast regulatory subunit Gid4, c17orf39, nor the Gid7 sequence homologue, WDR26, were identified within the mammalian complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Francis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>). Instead, Mkln1, a protein involved in cell adhesion and the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics, was suggested to replace WDR26 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Francis et al., 2013</xref>). In turn, the WD40-containing protein WDR26 was previously identified as a substrate adaptor for the large family of Cullin4-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL4s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Higa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piwko et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, the majority of the mammalian GID/CTLH complex components are poorly characterized, with the exception of the non-canonical member of the Ran-binding protein family RanBP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salemi et al., 2017</xref>). RanBP9 was reported to integrate into multiple protein complexes, has numerous interaction partners and was proposed to regulate a diverse set of cellular processes ranging from transcriptional regulation, cell morphology and cell cycle progression to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atabakhsh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salemi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Suresh et al., 2012</xref>). However, to date a comprehensive analysis of the mammalian GID complex as a functional entity and putative E3 ligase is still missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salemi et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, none of the human GID proteins have been studied in the context of a potentially conserved role in negatively regulating gluconeogenesis in mammals. We have a longstanding interest in the function and regulation of CRL4 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mouysset et al., 2015</xref>), and WDR26 was identified as a presumptive CRL4 adapter protein, possibly involved in cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piwko et al., 2010</xref>). However, it remains to be examined whether WDR26 indeed functions as a CRL4 adaptor in this context or alternatively acts as the sequence homologue of Gid7 incorporated in the putative GID/CTLH E3 ligase complex. Interestingly, using a combinatorial approach of systematic AP-MS, biochemical reconstitution and cellular phenotyping, we discovered that WDR26 is a stable subunit of the human GID/CTLH complex. Moreover, we identified additional human GID subunits and demonstrate that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of this multi-subunit complex is evolutionary conserved. Finally, we provide evidence that cellular GID activity is critical for maintenance of normal cell proliferation rates, possibly by direct ubiquitination of the transcription factor Hbp1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparative proteomics identifies ten core components of the human GID/CTLH complex</title><p>To investigate whether the putative CRL4 adapter WDR26 contributes to cellular fitness, we first deleted WDR26 from RPE cells using lentiviral transduction of the CRISPR-Cas9 system and observed a significant growth inhibition phenotype in these cells as judged by clonogenic and MTT assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). To clarify whether the proliferation defect following WDR26 perturbation is attributable to the loss of a specific Cul4-based E3 ligase function, we used proteomics to examine the global WDR26-interactome. Interestingly, the data exposed WDR26 as a core part of a protein network encompassing the entire set of homologous <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> GID complex subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This cluster additionally comprises the protein Mkln1, which was previously suggested to replace WDR26 in the human complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Francis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>). By contrast, the CRL4 core components Ddb1 and Cullin4A/B were absent or not significantly enriched in WDR26 pull-downs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Consistent with this observation, untagged WDR26 does not associate with the core CRL4 subunit Ddb1 in cells relative to the canonical CRL4 substrate adapter protein WDR23 (DCAF11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). From these results, we conclude that WDR26 is not strongly linked to Cul4 proteins but rather a central subunit of the mammalian GID/CTLH complex.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35528.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The human GID complex is composed of 10 subunits and possesses E3 ligase activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative clonogenic survival assay and corresponding quantification of RPE cells (technical replicates, n ≥ 2) treated with lentiviruses expressing either control gRNAs (WT) or two gRNAs deleting the GID subunit WDR26 (WDR26-KO).

YPEL5 and RanBP10, a protein highly homologous to RanBP9, also cluster as GID subunits with high probability. To validate these proteomics data, we probed Armc8-, GID4- and Rmnd5a-immunoprecipitates for the presence of individual GID proteins using available antibodies against WDR26, YPEL5, Twa1, RanBP9 and MAEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, these experiments underscored that in cells the identified proteins assemble a stable and soluble heterodecameric functional unit, which we will from now on refer to as the hGID complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly, YPEL5 is homologous to the yeast protein Moh1, which was reported to associate with several GID subunits including Gid1, 2, 5, 7 and 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ho et al., 2002</xref>). To test whether Moh1 is indeed a functional GID-subunit, we monitored degradation of the gluconeogenic enzyme Fbp1 after switching <italic>moh1Δ</italic> cells from a non-fermentable carbon source to glucose-containing media. However, Moh1-deficient cells degrade TAP-tagged Fbp1 with wild-type kinetics, whereas - as expected - Fbp1 levels remain high in cells lacking Gid4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We thus conclude that the yeast YPEL5, Moh1, is dispensable for catalytic GID activity.</p><p>Both Rmnd5 and MAEA harbor conserved C-terminal RING domains, which are predicted to bind upstream ubiquitination enzymes and typically confer ligase activity. To interrogate a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase function of the human complex, we purified native GID-immunocomplexes from HEK-293 cells and incubated them in the presence of ubiquitin, ATP and a mix of E1 and several E2 enzymes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, these reactions produced a pronounced ubiquitin smear, which is likely the result of autoubiquitination of one or several subunits in the absence of a cognate substrate. Thus, although residual contaminant E3 ubiquitin ligases in the sample preparation cannot be entirely excluded, these assays provide experimental evidence that the native human GID complex holds an intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reconstitution of the human GID complex reveals a conserved architecture</title><p>With a molecular weight of ≥550 kDa, the mammalian GID complex potentially constitutes an exceptionally large E3 ubiquitin ligase of roughly half the size of the major cell-cycle regulator anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). We sought to collect comprehensive topological and enzymatic information on the macromolecular GID complex by expressing all 10 full-length human GID subunits in Sf9 insect cells. To simultaneously identify potential stable GID subcomplexes within the putative heterodecamer, we applied a strategy of mixing various GID baculovirus combinations. After co-infection, the respective complexes were purified by means of single step FLAG-pulldowns and peptide elution. This approach revealed that the conserved proteins RanBP9 and WDR26 bind the catalytic body of the E3 ligase, a trimeric complex composed of the two RING proteins Rmnd5, MAEA and the scaffolding protein Twa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and E</xref>). This stable pentameric assembly migrates as an individual peak in size-exclusion experiments, and is also catalytically active in autoubiquitination assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and data not shown). Densitometry quantification of Sypro Ruby-stained gels after gel filtration chromatography suggests a 2:1 molar ratio of Twa1 over the other subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This is consistent with recent data where isolated untagged Twa1 was found as a constitutive dimer or oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Francis et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the pentameric core GID complex shows an elution profile indicative of a large hydrodynamic radius or higher order assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To analyze the absolute molecular mass of the GID pentamer in solution we subjected the subcomplex to size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle static light scattering (SEC-MALS). SEC-MALS yielded two major peaks; the first peak, comprising all five GID proteins, with an average molecular mass of the 543 kDa, is consistent with the formation of a dimer (calculated molecular mass of the pentamer with two molecules of Twa1: ~285 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The broad second peak encompasses protein assemblies ranging from ~155 kDa to 60 kDa which corresponds to the summarized mass of the catalytic Twa1::MAEA::Rmnd5a trimer (calculated molecular mass: 140 kDa) and dimerized Twa1 dissociated from the subcomplexes (calculated molecular mass of the Twa1: ~27 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). In yeast, deletion analysis to map Gid-Gid protein interactions identified the homologue of Twa1, Gid8, as the central hub connecting the RING dimer to the proteins Gid1 (RanBP9) and Gid7 (WDR26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Menssen et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, within the human complex, Twa1 is pivotal for efficient MAEA and Rmnd5a RING dimerization and downstream recruitment of the peripheral members of the protein complex in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and data not shown). Together, the reconstitution data strongly predict cellular disintegration of the complex in the absence of the core protein Twa1. Indeed, when the complex was purified by immunoprecipitation from HEK-293 cells depleted for Twa1 using a pool of siRNAs, the otherwise stable GID network was largely disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Furthermore, step-wise in vitro reconstitution of the entire complex revealed that the pentameric core GID proteins form the platform strictly required for the downstream recruitment of the metazoan-specific protein Mkln1, YPEL5 and an independent unit formed by Armc8 and GID4 wherein GID4 only incorporates into the complex in the presence of Armc8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and data not shown).

Furthermore, the decrease in cell proliferation was not due to an increment in apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), but is manifested by a pronounced downregulation of both the levels and phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and of several other cell cycle markers including Cyclin A and to a lower extent Cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To corroborate this result, we next analyzed the rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzymes FBP1 and PCK1 levels in HEK-293 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes treated with control siRNA or siRNA oligos targeting all GID subunits undergoing a metabolic switch from gluconeogenesis to glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Complementation assays with inducible expression of a RNAi-resistant version of WDR26 confirmed that Hbp1 stabilization is a direct consequence of crippled GID activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Together, these findings not only highlight the physiological relevance and regulation of this macromolecular machine, but also serve as a basis for acquiring further molecular insights into the mechanisms of GID substrate selection and ubiquitin transfer.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Architectural and enzymatic conservation of the core human GID/CTLH E3 ligase complex</title><p>It has been previously suggested that orthologs of the budding yeast GID complex are present in most phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Francis et al., 2013</xref>). However, until now it was unclear if these complexes entail organism-specific variations in their composition and enzymology. By merging systematic proteomics with in vitro reconstitution, we discovered remarkable parallels between yeast and human GID complexes. First, the catalytic core is compositely formed by the RING proteins MAEA and either Rmnd5a or its paralog Rmnd5b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, RING dimerization is a functional requirement of several non-catalytic RING E3 ligases to stabilize the E2 ~ubiquitin thioester bond for ubiquitin transfer. Dimerization can be either mediated by the RING domain alone or facilitated by flanking helical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berndsen and Wolberger, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, for the GID complex, we observed that optimal RING association is dependent on the small scaffolding protein Twa1. Our data additionally suggest that Twa1 itself dimerizes to form a central hub for the downstream recruitment of the core and peripheral members of the protein complex. A similar dependency on Gid8/Twa1 for complex assembly has also been reported for the yeast complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Menssen et al., 2012</xref>). Together, Twa1, the RING proteins, RanBP9, WDR26 and Mkln1 form a stable hexameric complex in vitro. Furthermore, Armc8 incorporation is imperative for subsequent GID4 binding. In yeast, Gid4 association is tightly regulated and the protein acts both as substrate adapter for gluconeogenic enzymes as well as an activator of the E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Santt et al., 2008</xref>). Mechanistically, Gid4 may induce a conformational change that allows for more efficient E2 binding and/or optimal positioning of the catalytic core towards the substrate. However, our data suggest that at least in vitro the human GID complex without the Armc8/GID4-module efficiently cooperates with Ube2H in autoubiquitination assays. Structural analysis will be required to establish a complete map of intra- and intermolecular contact sites and to understand the underlying topological integrity and enzymatic activity of the hGID complex. For example, it remains open if the highly homologous proteins RanBP9 and RanBP10 co-reside in individual complexes as suggested by our proteomics data. Moreover, it will be important to dissect the structural determinants that explain the Ube2H specificity and activation of ubiquitin-transfer by the RING proteins Rmnd5 and MAEA.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35528.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model illustrating newly identified and potential GID E3 ligase functions in human cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the mammalian GID complex summarizing its subunit composition, potential architecture and major catalytic features. In brief, the multi-subunit E3 ligase complex is formed around a stable catalytic core formed by the RING proteins MAEA and Rmnd5. The RING proteins MAEA and Rmnd5 are strictly required for normal complex formation and catalysis. Twa1 is a dimer that is critical for association of both RING proteins and downstream complex assembly. Armc8 is required for recruitment of GID4. The E2 enzyme Ube2H cooperates with the GID complex in substrate ubiquitination. (<bold>B</bold>) Based on our results we suggest that the GID complex is a conserved and ubiquitously expressed E3 ligase that resides both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and regulates cell proliferation in human cells. While it remains to be investigated if and how the activity of the complex is spatially and/or temporally regulated, we speculate that the more peripheral subunits such as WDR26, RanBP9, Mkln1 and possibly GID4 may play important roles in anchoring the complex at specific subcellular locations and/or provide distinct docking sites for substrates. This might in part help to explain the plethora of interacting proteins reported for RanBP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salemi et al., 2017</xref>). We were neither able to identify an obvious role for the metazoan GID complex in targeting gluconeogenic enzymes for proteasomal degradation nor find direct evidence for a potentially conserved function in a Pro/N-end rule pathway. A series of AP-MS experiments however, isolated novel GID-interacting proteins including the transcription factor and negative regulator of several pro-proliferative genes Hbp1. Hpb1 protein turnover is regulated by the GID E3 ligase and biochemical evidence suggests that Hbp1 is directly ubiquitinated by the complex, which might contribute to the intermittent proliferation phenotype observed for GID-KO cell lines.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-35528-fig6-v2"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional heterogeneity of eukaryotic GID complexes</title><p>In yeast, the GID complex is activated when the carbohydrate metabolism is reversed and cells rapidly switch from gluconeogenesis to glycolysis. In this process, GID activity balances the excess gluconeogenic enzymes. Surprisingly, despite the structural evolutionary conservation, the levels of the rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzymes FBP1 and PCK1 are unresponsive to GID depletion in mammalian cells. However, previous findings identified a specific role for the mammalian N-end rule enzyme UBR5 in degrading the gluconeogenic enzyme PCK1 under high-glucose conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>) and a MAGE-TRIM28 E3 ligase complex targeting FBP1 for proteolytic degradation in a hepatocellular cancer background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jin et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, despite the UPS playing an important part in fine-tuning the concentration of gluconeogenic enzymes in metazoans, the mechanisms and enzymes involved appear fundamentally different. Compared to unicellular organisms, higher eukaryotes are highly specialized within tissues and organs in their internal biochemistry. Gluconeogenesis is largely restricted to hepatocytes and only activated upon extended periods of fasting. However, the GID complex is ubiquitously expressed, pointing towards an extended substrate repertoire, possibly depending on the prevailing cellular milieu and/or metabolic programs of different cell types. Interestingly, we found that hGID complexes interact with the mitochondrial protease HTRA2, suggesting that the GID E3-ligase may play a more general role in metabolism and/or protein quality control under normal growth or specific stress conditions.</p><p>Notably, a shared feature of all identified yeast GID substrates to date are proline residues in the first or second position after their start methionine and the presence of this amino acid is critical for GID-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Menssen et al., 2012</xref>). Recently it was postulated that the yeast GID complex operates within a novel Pro/N-end rule pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the substrate-binding pocket of yeast and human Gid4 is highly conserved and human GID4 is able to recognize and bind various proline-containing N-degrons (Dong et al., 2018). Our complete list of Armc8 interactors include proteins, such as the RNA-helicase proteins DDX50 and DDX21, that conform to the consensus sequence of the mammalian Pro/N-end rule protein quality control branch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref> and data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2018</xref>). However, the hGID-substrate Hbp1 identified here does not possess a proline-containing N-degron. Since our AP-MS data suggest that GID4 is more loosely associated with the complex than other subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>), we speculate that different mechanisms for regulated substrate recruitment may exist for mammalian GID E3 ligase complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The GID complex controls cell proliferation and targets the transcription factor Hbp1</title><p>Analyses of RanBP9-KO mice revealed that this GID subunit is critical for early embryonic development, but some pups survive and are significantly smaller than their wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palavicini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Puverel et al., 2011</xref>). Available evidence suggests that individual deletions of critical GID subunits, such as the RING protein MAEA and the structural integrity protein Twa1, result in proliferation defects in several cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hart et al., 2015</xref>). This cell cycle defect is characterized by loss of mitotic markers and significantly reduced expression of critical cell cycle markers such as Cyclin A and pRb, characteristic for cells exiting into a quiescence state. Interestingly however, this strong cell cycle defect is only transient, and after a few days, individual cells resume normal proliferation rates and are morphologically and biochemically indistinguishable from control cells. While at present we do not know the molecular mechanisms underlying this suppression, we conclude that the hGID complex is not essential for cell proliferation per se, but negatively regulates one or several cell cycle inhibitors, possibly involved in cell cycle exit. Interestingly, our targeted AP-MS experiments identified the transcription factor Hbp1 as a proteolytic target of the E3 ligase in various human cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Hbp1 was proposed to function as a tumor suppressor and has been implicated in regulating cell cycle exit. Indeed, cells overexpressing Hbp1 were previously shown to enter a quiescent-like G<sub>0</sub> state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shih et al., 2001</xref>). Molecularly, Hbp1 executes dual transcriptional functions by directly binding high-affinity elements on negatively regulated target genes, including N-Myc and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), but also transcriptionally activates genes, such as p16, p21 and histone H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, our proteomic data suggest that the majority of Hbp1 is tightly embedded into a multi-subunit Sin3a corepressor complex. However, in sharp contrast to Hbp1, Sin3a-related proteins are excluded from the GID-interactome. Therefore, it is conceivable that continuous GID-mediated proteolytic clearance of Hbp1 in cycling cells is installed to avert the assembly of a repressor complex that controls the expression of a set of anti-proliferative genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). While attractive, we were unfortunately unable to directly test this hypothesis, as GID-depleted cells rapidly acquired suppressor mutations. Moreover, while immunoblotting of adapted GID-KO cells might suggest partial normalization of Hbp1 protein abundance, the effect is not robust enough to account for the phenotype reversal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Given the high expression of the predominantly nuclear E3 ligase, it is not unlikely that GID-deficient cells have to cope with multiple deficiencies resulting from deregulated nuclear proteins. Deconvolution of the global molecular signature of the GID complex using transcriptomics in a side-by-side comparison with cells of differential GID-activity states should clarify whether transcriptional plasticity is an important mechanism to promote acquired resistance of specific cell types to loss of GID function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mammalian cell culture</title><p>HeLa, HEK-293, RPE and BJ human fibroblast cells were grown in NUNC cell culture dishes in Dulbecco’s modified medium (DMEM) from Invitrogen supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine 100x (PSG, Life Technologies).

Subsequently, samples were boiled for 5 min at 95°C in 1x LDS (Novagen) and 10 mM DTT. For immunoprecipitation of SSH-tagged proteins, protein bait expression was induced by addition of 1 μg/ml of Doxycycline for 12 hr. Cell pellets of two confluent 15 cm dishes were resuspended in lysis buffer as described above and the chromatin sheared by passing the extract multiple times through a 26G needle. The extract was then cleared by centrifugation at 14 500 rpm at 4°C for 25 min, the protein concentration determined and adjusted. Subsequently, the lysate was incubated for 1.5–2 hr with 20 μl of pre-equilibrated Anti-HA antibody-coupled beads (Sigma). After binding, the beads were washed 3x with IP buffer, 3x with Wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) and eluted from the affinity gel by addition of HA-peptide at a concentration of 1 mg/ml (ApexBio). Native GID particles were then boiled for 5 min at 95°C in 1x LDS (Novagen) and 10 mM DTT and proteins resolved by standard SDS-PAGE or NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Protein Gels (Invitrogen) before transfer onto Immobilon-P or Nitrocellulose transfer membranes (Millipore). Before incubation with the respective primary antibodies, membranes were blocked in 5% milk-PBST (MIGROS) for 1 hr.

Expression cultures were seeded at a density of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and infected with baculovirus stocks to obtain the full-length human GID complex or individual subcomplexes. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 3 min and snap-frozen. For protein purification, insect cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet) and homogenized using a 15 ml Dounce homogeniser with 15 strokes. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation in a SS34 rotor at 17,000 rpm, at 4°C for 30 min. Protein extracts were then subjected to a single step FLAG purification. In brief, anti-FLAG-M2 affinity agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer and incubated with the extract for 1 hr, rotating at 4°C. Subsequently, the beads were washed 3x with each lysis- and wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol), and the proteins eluted with 1 mg/ml 3xFLAG peptide (APEXbio) in wash buffer, agitating for 1 hr at 4°C. E2 enzymes were expressed in bacteria as N-terminal GST-TEV fusion proteins. Expression was induced o/n with 0.1 mM IPTG at 18°C.

At the indicated time points, 10 μl of the reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For native HSS-GID particles we performed immunoprecipitation experiments and ubiquitination assays as described above with the following modifications; 25 μl of HSS-GID eluate (GID2 or GID5) was incubated with 100 nM UbE1, 1 μM E2 enzyme, 15 μM Ubiquitin and in a total of 50 μl E3 reaction Buffer. 10 μl samples were taken at variable time points and autocatalytic activity of the GID complex analyzed by Western Blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of murine primary hepatocytes and HEK-293 cells</title><p>Mice used for this study were on a C57BI/6N background. Primary hepatocytes were isolated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mobin et al., 2016</xref>). In short, livers were perfused with LiberaseTM (Roche) and isolated hepatocytes were seeded at a density of 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in BD Corning Primaria 6-well plates in DMEM low glucose supplemented with 10% FBS. After attachment, the hepatocytes were transfected with siRNAs using iMax reagent (Invitrogen) in Hepatozyme serum-free medium. HEK-293 cells were seeded at a confluency of 300.000 cells per well in six well plates and reverse transfected using iMax reagent in Optimem Medium. Cells were washed 3x with PBS 68–72 hr after transfection and glucose-free medium (DMEM A14430-01), supplemented with 20 μM forskolin, 0.22 g/l pyruvate and 2.24 g/l lactate, was added and cells were incubated for 5 hr. For the switch from gluconeogenic to glycolytic conditions the medium was changed to Hepatozyme (containing 25 mmol/l glucose) supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin and incubated for 2, 3, 4, and 5 hr. For HEK-293, DMEM high glucose (25 mmol/l glucose) was used instead of Hepatozyme medium. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNAse treatment was performed using DNA free kit (Ambion) followed by reverse transcription using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). RT-PCR was carried out in an LC480 II Lightcycler (Roche) using gene-specific primers and Sybr Fast 2x Universal Master mix (Kapa). Results were normalized to 36b4 transcripts. Whole cell lysates for Western blotting were prepared in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)), incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm at 4°C.

Subsequently, the gel was stained with InstantBlue (Invitrogen), the protein bands cut into small pieces, washed 3x for 20 min with 200 μl 5 mM ABC/50% ACN and dehydrated for 10 min with 200 μl 100% ACN. For cysteine alkylation, the gel pieces were first reduced for 45 min at 56°C with 200 μl 10 mM DTT in 20 mM ABC, alkylated for 30 min with 200 μl 55 mM IAA in 20 mM ABC in the dark, followed by a 2x wash for 20 min with 200 μl 5 mM ABC/50% ACN. After that, the samples were dehydrated for 15 min with 200 μl 100% ACN and placed in the SpeedVac to remove any residual ACN. The dried gel pieces were rehydrated in 40 μl 12.5 ng/μl Trypsin in 20 mM ABC and incubated for 10 min at 22°C before adding 80 μl 20 mM ABC and incubating overnight at 37°C shaking at 750 rpm.

All the supernatants were pooled and the liquid reduced to 40 μl in the SpeedVac. For the peptide clean-up, C<sub>18</sub> Ziptips (Millipore) were first washed 10x in 100% ACN, followed by additional 10 washes with 3% ACN/0.2% FA before loading the peptides. The tips were then washed 10x with fresh 3% ACN/0.2% FA, eluted 4x with 10 μl 80% ACN, dried in the SpeedVac and resuspended in 4 μl 0.1% FA.</p><p>Peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a Q-Exactive plus (QE+) mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source. Chromatographic separation of peptides was done with an EASY nano-liquid chromatography system (Proxeon) equipped with a 40 cm fused silica column with 75 μm inner diameter (New Objective), packed with Reprosil Pur C18 Aq 1.9 μm beads (Dr. Maisch) and heated to 50°C. 1 ul of the peptide mixtures was separated with a linear gradient from 5% to 35% acetonitrile in 90 min at 0.3 µl/min.

An intensity threshold for fragmentation of 3.6e4 and a dynamic exclusion window of 30 s were used. The collected spectra were searched using Sequest HT within Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific, version 1.4) against the Uniprot human proteome from November 2015. Trypsin was set as the digesting protease with the tolerance of 2 missed cleavages and fully-tryptic termini. The monoisotopic peptide and fragment mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines (+57.0214 Da) was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionines (+15.99492 Da) was set as a variable modification. Peptide spectrum matches were filtered using Percolator at a false discovery rate of 1%, determined using a reverse-sequence decoy database.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Semi-quantitative densitometric analysis of immunoblots (acquired with a Fusion FX) and Sypro Ruby-stained gels (acquired with a Typhoon FLA9000) was performed using ImageJ software.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jakob Nilsson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General review:</p><p>Following their interest in the regulation and function of Cul4-based CRLs, the authors question here the role of WDR26 as a potential substrate adaptor. Their interaction proteomics results suggest that instead, WDR26 co-purifies with human orthologues of the yeast GID complex, in accord with the fact that WDR26 displays some homology to yeast Gid7. The GID complex is a yeast multisubunit RING-based E3 involved in the degradation of gluconeogenic enzymes. The structural conservation of its components in human (aka CTHL complex) led to suggestions that it may also be an E3 but this had not been experimentally demonstrated. It is really exciting to finally have some functional data on this complex in human cells.</p><p>The authors convincingly show that this complex possesses an intrinsic E3 activity. The recombinant expression and purification of this multisubunit complex is a tour de force allowing them to begin to address the composition/stoichiometry/interactions within the complex, its E3 ligase activity and its mode of substrate recognition.</p><p>The authors claim that murine GID does not target the gluconeogenic enzyme FBPase, but I find it hard to conclude this with the existing data. If this were true, this is not so surprising anyway, given the differences in cellular physiology that the authors highlight very well in the discussion. However, they obtained convincing evidence using an unbiased method (IP-MS) and further confirmation that the transcription factor and tumour suppressor, Hbp1, is a GID interactant, and a substrate. The latter part is particularly well performed and solid, with siRNA or CRISPR of multiple subunits, on endogenous Hbp1 protein, measurement of protein levels but also stability, with complementation with siRNA-resistant constructs, etc. in vitro ubiquitylation of Hbp1 by hGID is also provided. Recently published data showed that the yGID is a Pro-targeted N-end rule E3 (Chen et al., 2017, cited). Interestingly, Hbp1 does not seem to follow the Pro-N-end rule, and accordingly, yFBP1 is not an in vitro substrate of hGID. In order to further improve their conclusions the authors are invited to address the following:</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) CRISPR-based KO of two subunits, MAEA and WDR26, leads to defects in proliferation reminiscent of previous work on other GID subunits (cited in the manuscript).The only thing missing is the final proof that cell proliferation defects caused by GID knock-down/out are caused by the observed increase in Hbp1 expression. The authors should try to address this issue, even though this may be difficult since the proliferation defect may also be multifactorial with additional, unknown substrates beyond Hbp1 as noted in the Discussion.</p><p>2) It does not appear clearly which subunit was silenced in Figure 3F and in Figure 3—figure supplement 1E (&quot;GID siRNA&quot;: which GID?). Anyway, this experimental setup cannot allow to conclude that mFBP1 is not a substrate of murine GID since mFBP1 appears not to be degraded upon switching to a glycolytic mode even in WT hepatocytes (despite the drop in transcript level). To claim this, the authors should use a different setup (different cell type, different way to operate a metabolic switch), or a different readout (what about PEPCK, MDH etc.). Otherwise, they should tone down and claim that they have no evidence that the GID is involved in the degradation of gluconeogenic enzymes, and not be so decisive about the lack of involvement in this process. The model and its legend are far-reaching, there is no definitive demonstration that gluconeogenesis is not affected, nor of which subunit interacts with Hbp1, nor that some subunits may target the GID at multiple places in the cell etc.</p><p>3) Figure 2B suggests that the authors are looking at a mix of complexes, it is not convincing that this is a stable complex looking at the elution profiles of the individual subunits. The authors should run SEC-MALS to address this issue. Also looking at staining of Figure 2A this could also indicate differences in stoichiometry.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35528.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>1) CRISPR-based KO of two subunits, MAEA and WDR26, leads to defects in proliferation reminiscent of previous work on other GID subunits (cited in the manuscript).The only thing missing is the final proof that cell proliferation defects caused by GID knock-down/out are caused by the observed increase in Hbp1 expression.

First, we performed simultaneous depletion of MAEA and Hbp1 by siRNA in RPE cells. The consecutive phenotypical analysis however was hampered by inefficient downregulation of both Hbp1 and GID subunits. Second, we aimed to downregulate Hbp1 by siRNA in MAEA- or WDR26-KO RPE cells. However, these early GID-KO cells are severely compromised and did not tolerate additional transfections. Third, we tried to delete Hbp1 by CRISPR in an already established MAEA-KO RPE cell line but were unable recover a viable clone with the desired genotype. Finally, we created Hbp1-KO RPE cells but failed to isolate a viable clone where Hbp1 is fully deleted. Nevertheless, we processed partial Hbp1-KO cells and additionally deleted WDR26 and MAEA. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain the required cells due to deleterious cytotoxic effects. Thus, we are currently not able to answer this pressing question. We are now constructing auxin-degradable knock-in RPE cell lines to acutely remove Hbp1 and GID-subunits. In parallel, we started to screen for chemical compounds that specifically inhibit the enzymatic activity of the hGID ligase. We are confident that these efforts will be of great benefit to learn more about Hbp1 and other GID substrates, but find these experiments clearly beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It does not appear clearly which subunit was silenced in Figure 3F and in Figure 3—figure supplement 1E (&quot;GID siRNA&quot;: which GID?).</p></disp-quote><p>A pool of siRNAs that target the subunits MAEA, Rmnd5a, RanBP9, Armc8, GID4, WDR26 and Twa1 has been used for these experiments (collectively termed “GID siRNA).

We also immunoblotted for additional proteins regulating the gluconeogenic pathway, including PCK1 as suggested. Consistent with our results in primary hepatocytes, we were not able to detect a substantial change in both FBP1 and PCK1 protein levels when shifting cells from gluconeogenesis to glycolysis in GID-depleted cells (revised Figure 3, new panels F and G). Likewise, increasing the incubation time when shifting cells to glycolysis did not change PCK1 and FBP1 levels. To confirm that the cells indeed switch from gluconeogenesis to glycolysis we immunoblotted for phosphorylated Akt(Ser473)<sup>1</sup>. Moreover, RT-qPCR data from control and GID-depleted primary hepatocytes and HEK-293 cells showed that FBP1 and PCK1 are as expected transcriptionally regulated, but this regulation is not dependent on the murine GID E3 ligase<sup>2,3</sup>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35528.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Murine GID is dispensable for the regulation of gluconeogenic enzymes FBP1 and PCK1.</title><p>A, B.

SEC-MALS yielded two major peaks; the first peak, with an average molecular mass of the 543 kDa, is consistent with the formation of a GID dimer (calculated molecular mass of the pentamer: ~ 285 kDa). As shown in the Sypro-stained SDS-PAGE in Figure 2B the complex separates on the Superose 6 column into a second stable trimeric subcomplex consisting of Twa1, MAEA and Rmnd5a and dimeric Twa1 which in SEC-MALS corresponds to a broad second peak ranging from ~ 155 kDa to 60 kDa in agreement with the predicted molecular weight of the respective proteins and constitutive dimerization of Twa1 (calculated molecular mass of the Twa1: ~ 27 kDa).
