populations but its molecular control is unknown. Here, we investigate whether thyroid-hormones (TH) and their receptors (TR) coordinate the larval recruitment of the coral-reef-fish <italic>Acanthurus triostegus</italic>. We demonstrate an increase of TH-levels and <italic>TR</italic>-expressions in pelagic-larvae, followed by a decrease in recruiting juveniles. We generalize these observations in four other coral reef-fish species. Treatments with TH or TR-antagonist, as well as relocation to the open-ocean, disturb <italic>A. triostegus</italic> larvae transformation and grazing activity. Likewise, chlorpyrifos, a pesticide often encountered in coral-reefs, impairs <italic>A. triostegus</italic> TH-levels, transformation, and grazing activity, hence diminishing this herbivore’s ability to control the spread of reef-algae. Larval recruitment therefore corresponds to a TH-controlled metamorphosis, sensitive to endocrine disruption. This provides a framework to understand how larval recruitment, critical to reef-ecosystems maintenance, is altered by anthropogenic stressors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27595.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many animals go through a larval phase before developing into an adult. This transformation is called metamorphosis, and it is regulated by hormones of the thyroid gland in vertebrates. For example, most fish found on coral reefs actually spend the first part of their life as free-swimming larvae out in the ocean. The larvae usually look very different from the juveniles and adults. When these fish become juveniles, the larvae undergo a range of physical and behavioral changes to prepare for their life on the reef. Yet, until now it was not known what hormones control metamorphosis in these fish.</p><p>To address this question, Holzer, Besson et al. studied the convict surgeonfish <italic>Acanthurus triostegus</italic>. This herbivorous coral-reef fish lives in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, and the results showed that thyroid hormones do indeed regulate the metamorphosis of its larvae. This includes changing how the larvae behave and how their adult features develop. Further, Holzer, Besson et al. found that this was also true for four other coral-reef fish, including the lagoon triggerfish and the raccoon butterflyfish. In <italic>A. triostegus</italic>, thyroid hormones controlled the changes that enabled the juveniles to efficiently graze on algae growing on the reef such as an elongated gut.</p><p>When the fish larvae were then exposed to a pesticide called chlorpyrifos, a well-known reef pollutant, their hormone production was disturbed. This in turn affected their grazing behavior and also their metamorphosis. These fish had shortened, underdeveloped guts and could not graze on algae as effectively.</p><p>Herbivorous fish such as <italic>A. triostegus</italic> play a major role in supporting coral reef ecosystems by reducing algal cover and therefore promoting coral recruitment. These new findings show that pollutants from human activities could disturb the metamorphosis of coral-reef fish and, as a consequence, their ability to maintain the reefs. A next step will be to test what other factors can disrupt the hormones in coral-reef fish and thus pose a threat for fish populations and the coral-reef ecosystem.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Thyroid hormones</kwd><kwd>Metamorphosis</kwd><kwd>Coral reef fish</kwd><kwd>Chlorpyrifos</kwd><kwd>Acanthurus triostegus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Coral reef fish larval recruitment is a metamorphosis that can be disturbed by reef pollutants, as it is under the influence of the environment through the direct control of thyroid hormone signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Life history transitions are critical for many animal species and often correspond to concomitant developmental and ecological shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, little is known about how internal and external cues act in concert during these events. The life cycle of most teleost reef fish include a major developmental and ecological transition. Adults reproduce in the vicinity of the reef, emitting eggs that disperse and hatch in the ocean, where the larvae grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leis and McCormick, 2002</xref>). Larvae migrate back and enter reefs where they become juveniles, a step called larval recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leis and McCormick, 2002</xref>). This step involves the perception of environmental cues for larvae to localize and settle in the reef, and is accompanied by major morphological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCormick et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lecchini et al., 2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lecchini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barth, 2015</xref>). This transition of pelagic larvae into reef-associated juveniles is often referred to as metamorphosis and is critical for the maintenance of reef fish populations, but its molecular control remains largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dufour and Galzin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doherty, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leis and McCormick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCormick et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dixson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barth, 2015</xref>). Since larval recruitment is an ecological event coupled to a morphological transformation, reminiscent of the situation in amphibians, it may correspond to a thyroid hormones (TH) controlled metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Cai, 2007</xref>).</p><p>TH and their receptors (TR) trigger and coordinate metamorphosis of many species such as <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Cai, 2007</xref>) or flatfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Solbakken et al., 1999</xref>). The thyroid gland produces mainly the thyroxine hormone (T4), which is peripherally transformed into triiodothyronine (T3), the active form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chopra, 1996</xref>). The transformation of T4 into T3, and the degradation of T4 and T3 are controlled by a family of enzymes called deiodinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianco and Kim, 2006</xref>). TH levels peak at the climax of metamorphosis. Precocious treatment with TH triggers metamorphosis whereas goitrogen (TH synthesis inhibitors) treatment blocks it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tata, 2006</xref>). Similar mechanisms have been described in several teleost fishes, but in contexts disconnected from the natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Jesus et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yamano and Miwa, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawakami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marchand et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McMenamin and Parichy, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the convict surgeonfish <italic>Acanthurus triostegus,</italic> larvae have a planktonic diet while juveniles and adults are herbivorous, and external morphological changes occurring at recruitment have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Randall, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCormick, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCormick et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frédérich et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, crest-captured larvae can delay their metamorphosis when relocated to the external slope of the reef (open ocean), showing an influence of the environment on their morphological transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCormick, 1999</xref>). Nevertheless, again, the molecular mechanisms remain unknown.</p><p>Here we report that <italic>A. triostegus</italic> larval recruitment to the reefs corresponds to metamorphosis with major pigmentation changes, remodeling of the digestive tract and behavioral modifications. Our results show that TH levels and <italic>TR</italic> expressions control this remodeling process. Furthermore, recruiting larvae can freeze their TH signaling when relocated on the external slope, demonstrating an influence of the environment on metamorphosis. Chlorpyrifos (CPF), a known reef pollutant and endocrine disruptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botté et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Juberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Slotkin et al., 2013</xref>), affects <italic>A. triostegus</italic> metamorphosis by impairing TH signaling, preventing intestine lengthening, and inhibiting fish grazing activity. CPF therefore impairs <italic>A. triostegus</italic> control on algae spreading, which is a major threat for reef conservation. We extend our observation upon TH levels to four other coral reef fish species. Our work provides a unifying framework that integrates the developmental, ecological and evolutionary perspectives of vertebrate life history transitions. The involvement of the TH signaling pathway in this key post-embryonic step, thus prone to endocrine disruption, provides an obvious entry point to study how anthropogenic stressors may affect reef fish populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Acanthurus triostegus</italic> larvae undergo a major and rapid remodeling at recruitment</title><p><italic>A. triostegus</italic> crest captured individuals (n = 297) experience an important weight loss between day 1 (0.71 ± 0.01 g) and day 8 (0.53 ± 0.01 g) following their entry in the reef (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>).

Crest larvae present tiny and poorly mineralized pointed teeth at the distal ends of the jaws (red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1R</xref>) that are likely remnants of an oceanic larval dentition (dentition A). Other medium-sized and more mineralized teeth are in function in medial areas of the jaws (blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). These teeth display pointed cusps and belong to a more advanced dental generation (dentition B). Lastly, much larger teeth of the next generation (green, dentition C) are about to erupt from jaws in crest larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>) and replace A and B previous dentitions in day 2 to day 8 juveniles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N–Q</xref>). These teeth are highly similar to the shovel-shaped adult teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1S</xref>) that serve for grazing algae on hard substrata. The rapid formation of dentition C is consistent with a diet shift from planktivorous to herbivorous at recruitment. This shift is precisely organized, since it begins in the sagittal area of all individuals, and secondarily extends to the distal parts of the jaw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M–Q</xref>). The fact that crest captured larvae already have teeth of the C dentition about to erupt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>) indicates that fish are prepared for reef life conditions before reef entry.</p><p>The intestine also goes through a drastic remodeling at recruitment. In particular, the gastro-intestinal tract lengthens from about 2.52 ± 0.07 cm in crest captured larvae to 7.38 ± 0.14 cm in day 8 juveniles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1W</xref>). To characterize this change, we performed histological sections on the middle part of the intestine during the larval recruitment process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R–V</xref>). Intestines of crest larvae and day 2 juveniles have a thick wall with many muscle fibers and regular villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R and S</xref>). At day 3, intestines undergo a spectacular remodeling with the disappearance of the epithelium, leaving only the muscular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1T</xref>), while epithelium reformation occurs later at day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1U</xref>). In day 8 individuals, the intestine is fully remodeled: the epithelium is thicker and exhibits villi again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1V</xref>). Such spectacular remodeling events are also observed in the proximal and distal portion of the intestines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–O</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether and to what extent this intestine remodeling was correlated to a diet shift at larval recruitment, we sequenced <italic>A. triostegus</italic> digestive tract content (18S mass sequencing) to identify its eukaryotic composition. We investigated crest captured individuals, day 8 juveniles and adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1W</xref>) using a blocking primer to minimize amplification of host sequences. Crest larval intestines are largely empty although we identified sequences of fungi and algae. In day 8 juveniles, the intestinal content is different with more brown and red algae, as well as few protostome sequences. This indicates a shift in the eukaryotic gut content between crest individuals and day 8 juveniles. Adults gut content is less diversified and is mainly composed of brown algae, red algae and alveolates, different from those found in day 8 juveniles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1W</xref>). Using 16S metagenomic sequencing, we found differences in the relative quantity of bacterial community between the juveniles at day 2, 5 and 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1P</xref>). The 16S profile of the adult is also different from the juvenile profile, with the notable presence of <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, among which the giant bacteria <italic>Epulopiscium fishelsoni</italic> is a well-known symbiont of Acanthuridae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clements and Bullivant, 1991</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Thyroid hormone signaling peaks at larval recruitment</title><p>Given the role of TH in vertebrate metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laudet, 2011</xref>) and the spectacular transformations that <italic>A. triostegus</italic> undergoes at larval recruitment, we analyzed TH levels in larvae captured in the far ocean (from 5 to 10 km offshore, n = 3), near ocean (2 km offshore, n = 5), crest-captured larvae and juveniles (raised in situ in lagoon cages, n = 297) up to day 8 after recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27595.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Thyroid hormone signaling during <italic>Acanthurus triostegus</italic> metamorphosis.</title><p>Error bars represent standard errors. *p-value&lt;0.05; **p-value&lt;0.01; ***p-value&lt;0.001.

This indicates a peak of T4 in near ocean and in crest larvae. Far ocean larvae exhibit a high level of T3 but with an important variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Although these larvae live in the same ecological niche (<italic>i.e.</italic> open ocean) and are roughly of the same size (4.7, 5.5, and 6.3 mm), they were captured in different locations and are probably not at the same developmental stage.

T3 + IOP treatment increases the length of the intestine in day 2 and day 5 juveniles (p-values&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, blue). On the contrary, NH3 treatment partially prevents the intestines lengthening occurring after recruitment (p-values&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, green). Injections of T3 + IOP + NH3 result in an intestine length similar to the control individuals at day 2 and day 5 (p-values=0.486 and 0.444 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This shows that T3 and NH3 effectively compete, and confirms the non-toxicity of NH3. In parallel, intestines of fish relocated on the external slope are shorter than those of their lagoon counterparts at day 2 and day 5 (p-value&lt;0.001 and p-value=0.042 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, orange). This shows that their development has been slowed down, similarly to what we observed with the NH3 treatment. A similar pattern was observed concerning the microvilli remodeling within guts. In the anterior part of the guts, while T3 + IOP treatment accelerates the loss of the intestinal microvilli at day 2 and accelerates the development and the thickening of a new epithelium at day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, second column), NH3 treatment and external slope relocation prevent microvilli renewal at both day 2 and day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, third and fourth column). These observations can be extended to the anterior, medium and posterior sections of the guts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These changes are consistent with the notion that TH control remodeling of the guts at metamorphosis in <italic>A. triostegus</italic>. We did not observe any effect on teeth development neither with T3 + IOP or NH3 treatment, nor with external slope relocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given that teeth remodeling is a lengthy process that starts very early on in oceanic larvae and therefore before reef colonization, it is not surprising that the treatments performed on crest captured larvae do not affect (or are too late to affect) teeth development. Also, contrarily to individuals relocated on the outer slope, we did not observe any effect of T3 + IOP nor NH3 treatments on skin pigmentation at day 2 and day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that pigmentation during the larva to juvenile transition is strongly coupled to the environment but is not directly under TH control that may not sustain such rapid pigmentation changes. Taken together: (i) intestine lengthening and remodeling are mediated by TH signaling; and (ii) disturbing the TH pathway disrupts the normal development of fish after larval recruitment, showing that TH effectively controls some major aspects of <italic>A. triostegus</italic> metamorphosis.</p><p>Finally, we tested how TH signaling influences fish behavior. To achieve this, we used grazing activity (number of bites on algal turf), as <italic>A. triostegus</italic> larvae start to graze a couple of days after colonizing the reef, to investigate how TH signaling and metamorphosis completion influence the behavior of recruited fish. T3 + IOP treatment increases the grazing activity by around 50% in day 5 juveniles when compared to the control individuals (p-value=0.004, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, blue lanes). On the contrary, NH3 treatment significantly decreases the number of bites at day 2 by 33% (p-value&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, green lane). The grazing activity of fish relocated on the external slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is also diminished by more than 4-fold at day 2 (p-value&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, orange lanes). These data indicate that TH signaling promotes the biting activity of <italic>A. triostegus</italic> and subsequent grazing behavior adopted at larval recruitment. This shows that TH controls the transformations of the feeding process not only at the morphological and physiological levels but also at the behavioral level.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Thyroid hormone-mediated metamorphosis is conserved in coral reef fishes</title><p>To widen our understanding of coral reef fish metamorphosis, we investigated the TH signaling during larval recruitment in four other coral fish species (<italic>Rhinecanthus aculeatus</italic>, <italic>Chromis viridis</italic>, <italic>Chaetodon lunula</italic> and <italic>Ostorhinchus angustatus</italic>) from distant families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Near et al., 2012</xref>).

These results highlight profound anatomical and physiological transformations of the skin and the whole digestive tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–W</xref>). In particular, the differences in 16S gut content are likely the consequence of a diet shift (carnivorous to herbivorous) and an environmental shift occurring during larval recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frédérich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sullam et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesize that intestine remodeling (i.e. the loss of the villi and internal structures) accelerates the shift of the gut microbiota by allowing the establishment of a new bacterial community fitting the diet change. The presence of <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> in the adult but not in the larvae is consistent with the hypothesis that this family of bacteria is acquired through the environment in surgeonfishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miyake et al., 2016</xref>). Altogether, these observations reinforce the notion that the fish bacterial community depends on their diet and environment. These shifts of 16S and 18S gut contents, occurring between crest individuals and day 8 juveniles, strikingly coordinate with both the changes of the intestine and teeth morphologies observed during larval recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M–V</xref>). All these changes from teeth to microbiota are consistent with <italic>A. triostegus</italic> change of diet after entering the reefs, conforming to previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Randall, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCormick, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frédérich et al., 2012</xref>). This complete remodeling is associated with a severe weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that larval recruitment corresponds to a real metabolic challenge.</p><p>The molecular investigation of TH signaling in the recruiting larvae indicates a surge of TH levels and <italic>TR</italic> expressions in near ocean larvae and crest individuals, and a drop in juveniles, after reef entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). This indicates that migration towards the reefs marks the onset of metamorphosis and starts very early on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Consequently, the transformation process is already well advanced when larvae reach the reef, suggesting that this event is triggered in the open ocean by, yet unknown, environmental cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). After reef entry, T3 treatment increases gut length while external slope relocation and NH3 treatment delay the metamorphosis, although they could not completely interrupt it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). These results are consistent with the model of metamorphosis in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Cai, 2007</xref>) and other fish species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McMenamin and Parichy, 2013</xref>). It is interesting to relate the morphological and physiological changes we have observed in <italic>A. triostegus</italic> with the TH-controlled post-embryonic process known in zebrafish (the major teleost fish developmental model, one of the few teleost fishes in which we have a functional knowledge of the metamorphosis process). Indeed, in both species, as well as in flatfish, another classical teleost model of metamorphosis, major pigmentation and craniofacial changes occur at metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McMenamin and Parichy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>). It is not clear if the appearance of the dark melanophore stripes in zebrafish and <italic>A. triostegus</italic> is controlled by similar mechanisms. In <italic>A. triostegus</italic>, this event is extremely rapid (as fast as 2 hr after reef entry, MB pers. obs.), and strongly environmentally coupled, whereas in zebrafish juveniles the pigment pattern changes very gradually and is presumably not under selection for rapid change during metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>). However, melanophores can differentiate rapidly (in less than 12 hr) when appropriately stimulated in juvenile zebrafish. For example, acute stimulation with TH may initiate rapid melanophore differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, if the melanophore precursors are already in place and poised to differentiate in <italic>A. triostegus</italic>, it is possible that they could become melanized within a few hours upon direct stimulation with TH. Our NH3 treatments suggest that this may not be the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), but this remains an open question that requires further investigation. Altogether, our findings indicate that the onset and coordination of metamorphosis are two distinct events, both coordinated by TH and under environmental control. They further demonstrate that <italic>A. triostegus</italic> larval recruitment is a TH-controlled metamorphosis, as in amphibians and flatfishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Cai, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laudet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McMenamin and Parichy, 2013</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27595.035</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of <italic>Acanthurus triostegus</italic> metamorphosis and disruption by chlorpyrifos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of coral reef fish larval recruitment.

Interestingly, variations in the magnitude of TH changes among the five coral reef fish species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) are reminiscent of the situation in stickleback, where differences in TH signaling between two ecotypes support life history trait variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kitano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kitano and Lema, 2013</xref>). We anticipate that this post-embryonic developmental step is shaped by evolution and varies according to species-specific life history traits such as pelagic larval duration, size at reef colonization and pigmentation status (i.e., metamorphic state of advancement) at recruitment. Given the dramatic diversity of life history strategies they propose, coral reef fish could be excellent models to decipher how these changes are elicited by changes in hormonal systems.</p><p>Among the endocrine disruptors already evidenced and encountered in coral reefs, CPF is known to be a thyroid disruptor with adverse effects on fish behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sandahl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kavitha and Rao, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botté et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deb and Das, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Juberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Slotkin et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sarah K McMenamin (Reviewer #1); David Hazlerigg (Reviewer #2); Alexander Schreiber (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper considers the role of thyroid hormone in larval development in reef dwelling fish, with an emphasis on endocrine disruption and possible impacts on ecosystem health. Although the implication of TH in metamorphic change in reef dwelling fish is not surprising, the predicted impacts in terms of reef grazing are quite impressive. Thus, this is an important and timely study, one that successfully integrates endocrine, developmental, ecological, and toxicological influences on a key life history transition in a reef fish. Much of the text is cumbersome to read due to English not being the primary language of the authors. Specific required changes are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) On the drug / endocrine disruptor treatments, the authors are vague about mode of action. E.g. iopanoic acid (IPA) is described as &quot;an inhibitor of T4 degrading enzymes&quot;: actually IPA inhibits TH deiodinases, which act on both T4 and T3, and at least in mammals it is selective for outer ring deiodination by dio2. In fish the picture is probably less clear, due to uncertainties about pharmacological selectivity. Some more effort at clarity in this direction – not only for IPA but also for the other compounds employed – would be welcome.</p><p>2) By far the most interesting aspect of the study is the determination that larval recruitment in this species is indeed a TH-mediated process that induces diverse morphological and behavioral changes. The effects of chlorpyrifos on metamorphosis are interesting, but it is certainly a stretch to imply that chlorpyrifos is representative of all pollutants (there are many pollutants that likely don't affect TH, but instead affect other pathways, such as estrogen signaling). Therefore, the title should be revised as follows: &quot;Larval fish recruitment to reefs is a thyroid hormone-mediated metamorphosis sensitive to the pesticide chlorpyrifos&quot;.</p><p>3) The various morphological and histological analyses performed on natural <italic>A. Triostegus</italic> metamorphosis are excellent, and the changes in the gut are particularly fascinating! Considering this, it is surprisingly that the authors did not report the effects of T3/NH3 treatment or of CPF on any of these morphological features. Do these compounds have any effect on cross-sectional development of the gut, pigmentation, or dentition? If so, this should be reported and shown in a figure/table.</p><p>4) Please add more discussion of the gut 16S sequencing results. What does this imply about the ecology of larval vs. adult fish, and how does it integrate with the changes in craniofacial/tooth morphology and gut structure?</p><p>5) Are there any changes in pigment pattern, dentition or gut morphology in goitrogen-treated fish relative to controls? These should be shown, or if there are no changes, the lack of changes should be discussed.</p><p>6) Are there ocean samples for the other species examined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>?

We have corrected this mistake and changed this text into: “IOP being used as an inhibitor of the deiodinase enzymes”. To introduce the deiodinases to the reader we have also added the following sentence and reference in the Introduction: “The transformation of T4 into T3, and the degradation of T4 and T3 are controlled by a family of enzymes called deiodinases (Bianco and Kim 2006).” Concerning the selectivity of IOP (or IPA) for the outer ring deiodination performed by dio2, we are not aware of such a specificity. We have found some research discussing the effective inhibition of dio3 by IOP in mammals (Simonides et al. 2008; Medina et al. 2011). Moreover, in amphibians, both the inner ring and outer ring deiodination are inhibited by IOP, indicating that all the types of deiodinases are inhibited by IOP (Galton and Hiebert 1987; Galton and Hiebert 1988; Galton 1989). Nevertheless, we agree that deiodinases are less known in fish than in mammals and amphibians, because of fewer research. In our study, we used IOP to prevent the rapid degradation of T3 in the injected fish. Such treatments are routinely performed in fish to inhibit deiodinases (Little et al. 2013; Lorgen et al. 2015). Given the existing literature about IOP and its use, we believe that adding IOP to T3 can effectively prevents T3 degradation to ensure that the treatment exert a biological activity. We have added these clarifications in the Results section: “T3 + iopanoic acid (IOP) both at 10<sup>-6</sup> M, IOP being used as an inhibitor of the deiodinase enzymes that therefore prevents the degradation of injected T3 (Galton 1989; Little et al. 2013; Lorgen et al. 2015)”, and in the Materials and methods section: “IOP was used as an inhibitor of deiodinase enzymes, as evidenced in mammals and amphibians (Galton and Hiebert 1987; Galton and Hiebert 1988; Galton 1989; Simonides et al. 2008; Medina et al. 2011; Renko et al. 2012), and as routinely used in fish to prevent the immediate degradation of injected T3 (Little et al. 2013; Lorgen et al. 2015)”.</p><p>The other compound that we used is NH3, a TR antagonist that binds mammalian TR with a nanomolar affinity (Figueira et al. 2011). This compound works by preventing the binding of TH on TR (by occupying the pocket to which T3 normally binds) therefore impairing the recruitment of coactivators on TR, which thus remain in an inactive conformation (Figueira et al. 2011). To confirm the efficiency of NH3 as an antagonist on <italic>A. triostegus TRs</italic>, we have added, as a new panel D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, the results of a transactivation assayexperiment. This experiment shows that, in <italic>A. triostegus</italic>, the TR transcriptional activity induced by T3 is competitively inhibited in presence of NH3, in a dose dependant manner. Consequently, we have also added this clarification about NH3 in the Results section: “NH3 at 10<sup>-6</sup> M, NH3 being used as an antagonist of TR that prevents the binding of TH on TR (Lim et al. 2002; Renko et al. 2012) therefore disrupting <italic>A. triostegus</italic> TH pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>)” and in the Materials and methods section: “NH3 is a known TR antagonist in vertebrates (Lim et al. 2002), a notion we confirmed in <italic>A. triostegus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). NH3 prevents the binding of TH on TR and impairs the binding of transcriptional coactivators to TR, which therefore remain in inactive conformation (Figueira et al. 2011; Lim et al. 2002).”.</p><p>We did not use goitrogens in this study, indeed goitrogens are inhibitor of TH synthesis and given that the TH level are already high in the crest captured larvae and decrease in the following days, we believe that goitrogen treatment would not be appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) By far the most interesting aspect of the study is the determination that larval recruitment in this species is indeed a TH-mediated process that induces diverse morphological and behavioral changes. The effects of chlorpyrifos on metamorphosis are interesting, but it is certainly a stretch to imply that chlorpyrifos is representative of all pollutants (there are many pollutants that likely don't affect TH, but instead affect other pathways, such as estrogen signaling). Therefore, the title should be revised as follows: &quot;Larval fish recruitment to reefs is a thyroid hormone-mediated metamorphosis sensitive to the pesticide chlorpyrifos&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers. We have changed the manuscript title accordingly to the reviewers’ recommendations: &quot;Fish larval recruitment to reefs is a thyroid hormone-mediated metamorphosis sensitive to the pesticide chlorpyrifos&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The various morphological and histological analyses performed on natural A. Triostegus metamorphosis are excellent, and the changes in the gut are particularly fascinating! Considering this, it is surprisingly that the authors did not report the effects of T3/NH3 treatment or of CPF on any of these morphological features. Do these compounds have any effect on cross-sectional development of the gut, pigmentation, or dentition? If so, this should be reported and shown in a figure/table.</p></disp-quote><p>Following reviewers’ recommendations we have conducted additional analyses in order to answer these concerns. These analyses have been performed on additional samples that we possessed since our initial sampling campaigns, and on new samples that we captured during a new sampling campaign dedicated to these revisions. As suggested we have looked for effect of these compounds on teeth and guts development, as well as pigmentation.</p><p>First, we did not observe any difference in teeth development between larvae treated with T3, NH3, or relocated on the external slope (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, first column). Actually, it is not surprising that neither 2 to 5 days hormonal treatments nor environmental conditioning affect this developmental process, since teeth remodeling starts very early on in oceanic larvae, even before they enter in the reef (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore this remodeling is a lengthy process (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M-Q</xref>). We have discussed this point in our manuscript by adding: “We did not observe any effect on teeth development neither with T3+IOP or NH3 treatment, nor with external slope relocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given that teeth remodeling is a lengthy process that starts very early on in oceanic larvae and therefore before reef colonization, it is not surprising that the treatments performed on crest captured larvae do not affect (or are too late to affect) teeth development”.Consequently to this observation, we did not proceed teeth morphology analyses in fish exposed to chlorpyrifos (CPF), as it seems unlikely that such exposure could lead to any teeth remodeling difference given that hormonal treatments did not.</p><p>Second, concerning pigmentation, black stripes appear rapidly in <italic>A. triostegus</italic> after larvae enter the reef (in 2 to 4 hours post-settlement, MB pers. obs.), and the white body pigmentation between the black vertical stripes appears at day 2 after reef entry (McCormick 1999). A clear pigmentation delay was observed in fish relocated on the external slope, as evidenced by McCormick (1999). We have presented this result more clearly: “In order to study how the environment controls the metamorphosis processes, we first relocated crest-captured larvae back to the external slope immediately after their reef entry. […] Similar to this earlier study, we observed a striking delay in the white pigmentation appearance between the vertical black stripes in day 2 relocated fish compared to their lagoon raised counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lower panel).”</p><p>However, we did not observe any obvious difference in pigmentation between control larvae and larvae treated with T3+IOP, NH3 or exposed to CPF, both at day 2 and day 5. We have provided two additional figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) to present these observations that we have added in the Results section as follows: “Also, contrarily to individuals relocated on the outer slope, we did not observe any effect of T3+IOP nor NH3 treatments on skin pigmentation at day 2 and day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that pigmentation during the larva to juvenile transition is strongly coupled to the environment but is not directly under TH control that may not sustain such rapid pigmentation changes” and: “We did not observe any effect of CPF treatments on fish pigmentation at day 2 and day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).” We suspect other hormonal systems to be at play here (cortisol in particular) and we are planning to test this hypothesis in a future study.</p><p>Finally, concerning the gut histology, we have performed and analyzed cross-sections of guts in fish treated with T3+IOP or NH3, as well as in fish relocated on the external slope. We observed interesting effects of these treatments on the microvilli remodeling during metamorphosis and we have added two additional figures to present these results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, we observed an early disappearance of microvilli in T3+IOP treated fish at day 2 post-settlement (in comparison to the control group, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, second column, first row) and an advanced development of the second batch of microvilli (accompanied with an advanced thickening of the gut epithelium) in T3+IOP treated fish at day 5 post-settlement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, second column, second row). At the opposite, NH3 treatment and external slope relocation both prevented guts remodeling at both day 2 and day 5, as evidenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> (third and fourth column). These changes are perfectly consistent with the notion that guts remodeling at metamorphosis (both the lengthening and the microvilli renewal) are controlled by TH.</p><p>We have presented and explained these results in the Results section as follows: “A similar pattern was observed concerning the microvilli remodeling within guts. […] These changes are consistent with the notion that TH control remodeling of the guts at metamorphosis in <italic>A. triostegus.</italic>”</p><p>Please note that for reading convenience, the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, is now the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> as the guts cross-sections have been inserted as the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>. Also former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C-E</xref> have been relabeled <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B-D</xref> to present the experimental setup of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> earlier in the text (which lead us to also present the results of the external slope relocation earlier in the text, and therefore to relabel all the panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Concerning CPF exposure, we do not possess biological samples that would permit us to analyze guts histology. Indeed, despite our substantial efforts and the additional sampling campaign, we did not succeed to capture/handle/transfer (from French Polynesia to France) these specific fish. However, we performed gut length analyses on extra frozen samples that we had conserved, and we observed, as expected, that the guts’ lengthening usually occurring at metamorphosis is delayed when fish are exposed to 5 and 30 µg.l<sup>-1</sup> CPF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This lengthening delay is similar to the one observed with NH3 treated fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and is consistent with the notion that gut lengthening is controlled by TH (as evidenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) as CPF exposure decreases T3 levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These results on guts length and CPF exposure are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and are discussed as follows: “However, CPF exposure at 30 µg.l<sup>-1</sup> prevents guts’ lengthening at day 2 (p-value = 0.024, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> left panel), and both exposure at 5 and 30 µg.l<sup>-1</sup> prevent intestines’ lengthening at day 5 (p-values = 0.047 and 0.029 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> right panel).” and: “Consistently with our observations on NH3 treated fish, exposure to CPF impairs metamorphosis, as evidenced with the repression of guts’ lengthening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please add more discussion of the gut 16S sequencing results. What does this imply about the ecology of larval vs. adult fish, and how does it integrate with the changes in craniofacial/tooth morphology and gut structure?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the discussion following our 16S sequencing experiment results (in the Results section) was too short. We have complemented this discussion and moved it in the Discussion section: “These results highlight profound anatomical and physiological transformations of the skin and the whole digestive tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-W</xref>). […] All these changes from teeth to microbiota are consistent with <italic>A. triostegus</italic> change of diet after entering the reefs, conforming to previous observations (Randall 1961; McCormick 1999; Frédérich et al. 2012).” As explained above, we believe that changes in the gut bacterial community in <italic>A. triostegus</italic> are the consequence of the concomitant diet and environmental shifts occurring at larval recruitment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Are there any changes in pigment pattern, dentition or gut morphology in goitrogen-treated fish relative to controls? These should be shown, or if there are no changes, the lack of changes should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>There is apparently some sort of misunderstanding here as we did not treat the fish with goitrogens. We preferred to use NH3, a TR antagonist, to block the TH pathway instead of goitrogens (like methimazole and KClO<sub>3</sub>) that block the assimilation of iodine in the thyroid follicles or the TH synthesis in those same follicles (Schmidt et al. 2012). As evidenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, 2B and 2C</xref>, levels of TH and expressions of <italic>TR</italic> are peaking at and before ref entry, so the use of goitrogens on crest captured larvae would not have been appropriate (i.e., too late). In contrast the use of NH3, a TR antagonist, was, to our knowledge, the best solution to disrupt the TH pathway in crest captured larvae. As discussed in full in our response to comment 3), we have effectively scrutinized the effect of NH3 on the pigmentation pattern, the dentition and the gut morphology. As mentioned above, we do observe a consistent effect of NH3 on gut histology and we invite the reviewers to see our reply to comment 3 for more details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Are there ocean samples for the other species examined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>? It would be valuable to show the increase in TH as fish approach the crest.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this comment we have performed TH level measurements on <italic>Rhinecanthus aculeatus</italic> and <italic>Chromis viridis</italic> oceanic larvae (near ocean samples) that we have added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Unfortunately and despite our effort, we were not able to sample oceanic larvae of <italic>Chaetodon lunula</italic> and <italic>Ostorynchus angustatus</italic> in neither our previous nor novel near ocean and far ocean sampling campaigns. However, results on <italic>R. aculeatus</italic> and <italic>C. viridis</italic> confirm our model of TH peaking between oceanic and crest-captured individuals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We have edited the Results section for this figure as follows: “To widen our understanding of coral reef fish metamorphosis, we investigated the TH signaling during larval recruitment in four other coral fish species (<italic>Rhinecanthus aculeatus, Chromis viridis, Chaetodon lunula</italic> and <italic>Ostorhinchus angustatus</italic>) from distant families (Near et al. 2012). In these species, both T4 and T3 levels drop between day 1 and day 8, up to 3-fold for T4 (in O. angustatus, p-value = 0.029) and up to 4-fold for T3 (in <italic>R. aculeatus</italic>, p-value = 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). […] This suggests some potential species-specific variation in coral reef fish TH profiles at recruitment that would be extremely interesting to decipher in future studies on additional species and with regards to other aspects of coral reef fish ecology (e.g., diets, size and pigmentation status at recruitment).”</p><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for this excellent suggestion that strengthens the generalization of our TH-mediated metamorphosis and larval recruitment model to other coral reef fishes and opens new insights for future research in this domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Are there any phenotypic aspects of metamorphosis that are blocked with CPF treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers in their comment 3, we have analyzed the impact of CPF exposure on guts lengthening (which occurs at metamorphosis). We demonstrated that CPF diminished this lengthening, in very similar way as NH3 treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We have performed these requested analyses using supplementary frozen biological samples from our previous sampling campaign. Unfortunately, these frozen samples were not appropriate for gut histology analyzes. Also, we did not analyze the effect of CPF exposure on teeth remodeling since we did not observe any effect of T3 and NH3 treatments, as well as external slope relocation, on this teeth remodeling (as discussed in our reply to reviewers’ concern 3). Considering the lengthy process of teeth remodeling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M-Q</xref>) and the fact that this process is already well advanced in crest individuals, it is not surprising that hormonal treatments and external slope relocation did not alter this remodeling, and it would be very unlikely that CPF exposure acts differently. Lastly, there was no effect of CPF exposure on pigmentation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We invite the editor and the reviewers to see our reply to comment 3 for more details.</p><p>We believe that the additional analyses performed on guts lengthening (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), accompanied by the initially performed analyses on the impact of CPF on <italic>A. triostegus</italic> feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) will be convincing enough for the reviewers to acknowledge that CPF is effectively impairing some aspects of metamorphosis (dropping TH levels, inhibiting guts lengthening and impairing the feeding behavior). In addition, we can also ensure that CPF is impairing other aspect of <italic>Acanthurus triostegus</italic> young settlers’ ecology, as we relate in a parallel study the impact of CPF on visual lateralization during settlement in <italic>A. triostegus</italic> (Besson et al. 2017, Exposure to agricultural pesticide impairs visual lateralization in a</p><p>larval coral reef fish, Scientific Reports, In Press). This study demonstrates that CPF can impair and even reverse visual lateralization in <italic>A. triostegus</italic> during this critical recruitment step.</p></body></sub-article></article>
