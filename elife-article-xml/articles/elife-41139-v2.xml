The Mitotic Exit Network (MEN), a Ras-like GTPase signaling pathway, integrates spatial and temporal cues to ensure that cytokinesis only occurs after the genome has partitioned between mother and daughter cells during anaphase. Here we show that signal integration does not occur at a single step of the pathway. Rather, sequential components of the pathway are controlled in series by different signals. The spatial signal, nuclear position, regulates the MEN GTPase Tem1. The temporal signal, commencement of anaphase, is mediated by mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation of the GTPase’s downstream kinases. We propose that integrating multiple signals through sequential steps in the GTPase pathway represents a generalizable principle in GTPase signaling and explains why intracellular signal transmission is a multi-step process. Serial signal integration rather than signal amplification makes multi-step signal transduction necessary.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Mitotic Exit Network</kwd><kwd>cyclin dependent kinase</kwd><kwd>spindle position checkpoint</kwd><kwd>CDC14</kwd><kwd>signal integration</kwd><kwd>Cdc14 Early Anaphase Release Network</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD085866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amon</surname><given-names>Angelika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amon</surname><given-names>Angelika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By distributing regulation to both the GTPase and downstream kinases, the Mitotic Exit Network creates a single signal from spatial and temporal inputs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate chromosome segregation is essential for genome maintenance and viability of the organism.

G1 CDKs promote cell cycle entry, S phase CDKs initiate DNA replication, and mitotic CDKs drive entry into mitosis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morgan, 1997</xref>). Events during mitosis are controlled by a ubiquitin ligase known as the Anaphase Promoting Complex or Cyclosome (APC/C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peters, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thornton and Toczyski, 2006</xref>). The APC/C together with its specificity factor Cdc20 degrade the anaphase inhibitor Securin (Pds1 in budding yeast; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shirayama et al., 1999</xref>), to allow the protease Separase (Esp1 in budding yeast) to cleave cohesins, the proteins that hold the duplicated sister chromatids together. Cleavage of cohesins initiates anaphase. APC/C-Cdc20 not only targets Securin for degradation, the ubiquitin ligase also ubiquitinylates S phase and mitotic cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Irniger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">King et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sudakin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tugendreich et al., 1995</xref>). In budding yeast, APC/C-Cdc20 promotes the complete destruction of the S phase cyclin Clb5 and degradation of approximately half the pool of the mitotic cyclin Clb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shirayama et al., 1999</xref>).

The mitotic spindle is disassembled, chromosomes decondense and cytokinesis ensues. Mitotic CDK inactivation brings about this transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bardin and Amon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weiss, 2012</xref>). In mammals, CDK inactivation occurs in a single step initiated at the metaphase to anaphase transition. In budding yeast CDK inactivation is a two-step process (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sullivan and Morgan, 2007</xref>). CDK inhibition begins at the metaphase to anaphase transition when APC/C-Cdc20 targets all S phase cyclins and a fraction of mitotic cyclins for destruction. Then, in a second step, APC/C bound to a specificity factor related to Cdc20 - Cdh1 - brings about the complete degradation of mitotic cyclins and hence complete mitotic CDK inactivation. This results in mitotic exit. APC/C-Cdh1 is aided in mitotic CDK inactivation by the CDK inhibitor Sic1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wäsch and Cross, 2002</xref>).</p><p>APC/C-Cdh1 and Sic1 activity are controlled by the essential protein phosphatase Cdc14. Cdc14 dephosphorylates Cdh1 and Sic1 thereby activating them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jaspersen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Visintin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zachariae et al., 1998</xref>). Given the central role of Cdc14 in control of exit from mitosis, it is not surprising that the phosphatase is tightly regulated. For most of the cell cycle Cdc14 is bound to its inhibitor Cfi1/Net1 in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Visintin et al., 1999</xref>). During anaphase the phosphatase dissociates from its inhibitor spreading through the nucleus and cytoplasm to dephosphorylate many proteins including Sic1 and Cdh1.</p><p>Two signaling pathways have been identified that control the interaction between Cdc14 and its inhibitor. The Cdc14 Early Anaphase Release (FEAR) network releases Cdc14 from its inhibitor in the nucleolus upon anaphase entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stegmeier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pereira and Schiebel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Amours et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lavoie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sullivan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Higuchi and Uhlmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khmelinskii et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Woodbury and Morgan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roccuzzo et al., 2015</xref>). The FEAR network only transiently releases Cdc14 from its inhibitor. Cdc14 will return to the nucleolus unless the mitotic exit network (MEN) becomes active. Activation of the MEN in late anaphase causes the sustained release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus, resulting in exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Visintin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Visintin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jaspersen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The FEAR network is comprised of some of the same proteins that control chromosome segregation at the onset of anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Separase not only cleaves cohesins, the protease also associates with Slk19 which leads to the phosphorylation of the Cdc14 inhibitor Cfi1/Net1 by an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yellman and Burke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Queralt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang and Ng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzam et al., 2004</xref>). Cfi1/Net1 phosphorylation combined with activation of the FEAR network protein Spo12 then leads to Cdc14 release from its inhibitor in the nucleolus. While Cdc14 released from Cfi1/Net1 by the FEAR network has many roles in facilitating anaphase chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rock and Amon, 2009</xref>), the network is not essential for exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Amours et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yoshida et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pereira et al., 2002</xref>). Inactivation of the FEAR network only causes a 20 min delay in exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stegmeier et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The Mitotic Exit Network (MEN) is activated during anaphase and promotes the sustained release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus. Released Cdc14 then triggers complete CDK inactivation and hence exit from mitosis. The MEN is essential. Cells lacking MEN function arrest in late anaphase failing to exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shirayama et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geymonat et al., 2002</xref>). The signaling pathway resembles a Ras-like GTPase signal transduction cascade and is comprised of the GTPase Tem1, the protein kinases Cdc15 and Dbf2-Mob1, and the signaling scaffold Nud1 (see Figure 7A for a MEN diagram; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stegmeier and Amon, 2004</xref>). MEN components are scaffolded onto spindle pole bodies (SPBs), the yeast equivalents of centrosomes, by Nud1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>). Tem1 recruits Cdc15 to SPBs during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Visintin and Amon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rock and Amon, 2011</xref>). Cdc15 then activates Dbf2-Mob1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rock et al., 2013</xref>). Active Dbf2-Mob1 promotes the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mohl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Manzoni et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>One function of the MEN is to ensure that sustained Cdc14 activation only occurs when the nucleus moves into the bud during anaphase. Asymmetric localization of MEN activators and inhibitors causes the MEN to react to spindle position. Kin4, which activates the Tem1 GTPase activating protein (GAP) complex Bub2-Bfa1 and hence maintains Tem1 in the GDP bound form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shirayama et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geymonat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloecher et al., 2000</xref>) localizes to the mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>). Lte1, which inhibits Kin4 and hence activates Tem1, localizes to the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertazzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Falk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falk et al., 2016a</xref>). Thus, Kin4 and Lte1 create a MEN inhibitory zone in the mother cell and a MEN activating zone in the bud, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan and Amon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Falk et al., 2016b</xref>). This setup ensures that the MEN can only be activated when a SPB carrying the MEN GTPase translocates into the bud during anaphase, hence making the MEN responsive to spindle position.</p><p>While an appealing model for how cells sense spindle position, this zone model of MEN activation fails to explain how mitotic exit is coordinated with cell cycle progression. It has previously been observed that when cells experience a prolonged metaphase arrest the nucleus moves into the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Palmer et al., 1992</xref>), yet these cells do not exit from mitosis. Why does the MEN not promote exit from mitosis in these metaphase arrested cells despite a MEN GTPase-bearing SPB moving into the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>)? We show here that high mitotic CDK activity prevents MEN activation in metaphase, even when a MEN GTPase-bearing SPB moves into the bud. We further show that APC/C-Cdc20 dependent cyclin degradation and activation of Cdc14 by the FEAR network lowers mitotic CDK activity to permit MEN activation upon movement of the SPB into the bud. Surprisingly, antagonism by CDKs does not inhibit the MEN GTPase Tem1, but rather causes phosphorylation of downstream components of the MEN, the protein kinases Cdc15 and Mob1-Dbf2. CDK inhibition of the MEN kinase cascade prevents the feedback loops that would otherwise be initiated upon movement of a MEN GTPase-bearing SPB into the bud. Our study shows that the MEN integrates spatial and temporal signals at different steps of the signaling pathway, demonstrating logical ‘AND gate’ control of the pathway. This signal integration logic ensures that exit from mitosis only occurs after anaphase entry AND after partitioning of the genetic material between mother and daughter cell. Utilizing multi-point regulation explains how GTPase pathways perform signal integration and provides a rationale for why signaling pathways are multi-step processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MEN activity is confined to anaphase in the strain W303</title><p>The MEN promotes exit from mitosis.

This promotes the association of Dbf2-Mob1 with SPBs, resulting in activation of the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Visintin and Amon, 2001</xref>). Dbf2-Mob1 then activates Cdc14 to trigger exit from mitosis.</p><p>A recent study reported that the MEN kinases Cdc15 and Dbf2-Mob1 are active prior to anaphase and prior to a SPB moving into the bud, but that this activity cannot be measured by conventional kinase activity assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hotz and Barral, 2014</xref>). This metaphase-specific MEN activity was reported to affect spindle positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hotz et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hotz et al., 2012b</xref>) by controlling the localization of the spindle positioning factor Kar9. When the MEN was inactivated, Kar9 localization to astral microtubules emanating from the old, daughter bound SPB was impaired, resulting in the aberrant inheritance of the newly synthesized SPB by the daughter cell. These results raised the interesting possibility that low levels of SPB-localized MEN activity promote spindle positioning during metaphase but are insufficient to bring about exit from mitosis. A key question arising from this observation is how MEN activity is controlled in a manner that allows the pathway to fulfill its spindle orientation function in metaphase, yet does not promote exit from mitosis even when a MEN-bearing SPB transiently moves into the bud during metaphase.</p><p>To address this question, we examined Kar9 localization in cells either harboring a temperature sensitive (<italic>cdc15-2</italic>) or an analog sensitive (<italic>cdc15-as1</italic>) allele of the MEN kinase <italic>CDC15</italic>. Kar9 association with astral microtubules is asymmetric. Kar9 preferentially binds to microtubules that emanate from the old SPB, that is destined to move into the bud during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liakopoulos et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hotz et al.

We found that Kar9 localization was not affected by MEN inhibition. Kar9 localization in <italic>cdc15-2</italic> and <italic>cdc15-as1</italic> cells was indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–M</xref>).

Inactivation of the MEN did not affect Kar9 localization in either experimental set up.</p><p>The changes in Kar9 localization found in MEN mutants was reported to cause spindle pole body inheritance defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hotz et al., 2012a</xref>). In wild-type cells, the old SPB is inherited by the daughter cell, whereas the newly synthesized SPB remains in the mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pereira et al., 2001</xref>). In MEN mutants this stereotypic inheritance pattern was reported to be perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hotz et al., 2012a</xref>). To measure SPB inheritance we fused the SPB protein Spc42 to the slow <italic>maturing</italic> mCherry fluorophore. This fusion makes the old SPB appear brighter than the newly synthesized one, allowing us to follow SPB inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pereira et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1O</xref>).

However, inactivation of <italic>CDC15</italic> using the <italic>cdc15-as1</italic> allele, did not affect SPB inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1N</xref>). We conclude that in our strain background, W303, there is no evidence for MEN activity prior to anaphase onset. We propose that strain background differences could be the reason why our results differ from those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hotz et al. (2012a)</xref>. Based on a lack of evidence for MEN activity outside of anaphase in our strain background, we will define ‘MEN activity’ by its ability to promote mitotic exit throughout the remainder of the paper.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>APC/C-Cdc20 activity is required for MEN activation</title><p>The nucleus has been observed to make transient excursions into the bud prior to anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Palmer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yeh et al., 1995</xref>). This is particularly evident in APC/C mutants that arrest in metaphase.

During the arrest, 97% of cells move part or the entirety of the undivided nucleus into the bud. To determine whether MEN activation occurs in <italic>cdc23-1</italic> cells in which the nucleus translocated into the bud, we analyzed Mob1 localization. In wild-type cells, Mob1 associates with SPBs when the MEN is activated during anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rock et al., 2013</xref>).

This observation suggests that the MEN retained at least some ability to respond to spindle position. Yet, the low level of Mob1 association with SPBs combined with lack of Cdc14 release from the nucleolus and lack of rebudding indicates that MEN activation is suppressed during metaphase.

In this mutant both forms of the APC are inactive and neither mitotic cyclins nor Securin can be degraded.</p><p>Next, we examined the effects of lowering mitotic CDK activity in the two APC/C mutants. Inactivating the mitotic cyclin Clb2 using the <italic>clb2-VI</italic> allele caused mitotic exit in <italic>cdc20-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D</xref>). Importantly, this exit from mitosis depended on spindle position. Mitotic exit only occurred in cells in which the nucleus had moved into the bud during the arrest. A similar dependence was observed when analyzing the ability of <italic>cdc23-1</italic> cells to exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). <italic>cdc20-1</italic> mutants were more likely to undergo mitotic exit than <italic>cdc23-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), most likely because <italic>cdc20-1</italic> mutants can still activate the APC/C-Cdh1, whereas <italic>cdc23-1</italic> mutants cannot. We note that unlike in <italic>cdc20-1 bub2Δ</italic> mutants spindle elongation did not occur in either <italic>cdc20-1 clb2-VI</italic> or <italic>cdc23-1 clb2-VI</italic> mutants. Spindle elongation requires mitotic CDK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rahal and Amon, 2008</xref>). The <italic>clb2-VI</italic> allele likely lowers mitotic CDK activity below the level necessary to accomplish this task.</p><p>To determine whether the exit from mitosis we observed in <italic>cdc20-1 clb2-VI</italic> mutants was due to activation of the MEN, we examined MEN activity in this strain. As mitotic exit did not occur in all cells we developed a live cell assay for MEN activation that was compatible with co-observation of Cdc3 localization. To selectively measure MEN activity we took advantage of the finding that the MEN kinase Dbf2-Mob1 phosphorylates the NLS of Cdc14, increasing cytoplasmic Cdc14 when the MEN is active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mohl et al., 2009</xref>). We fused the C-terminus of Cdc14, which contains the NLS, to a fluorescent reporter (NLS<sub>Cdc14</sub>). Release of NLS<sub>Cdc14</sub> from the nucleus into the cytoplasm depended on MEN activity, validating this novel MEN assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Furthermore, in the FEAR network mutant <italic>slk19Δ</italic>, export of NLS<sub>Cdc14</sub> from the nucleus was delayed by 20 min, which is consistent with the 20 min delay in MEN activation observed in <italic>slk19Δ</italic> mutants. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). Most importantly, the analysis of <italic>slk19Δ</italic> mutants demonstrated that the NLS<sub>Cdc14</sub> localization assay specifically reports on MEN-dependent control of Cdc14. When we compared the release of full-length Cdc14 from the nucleolus with export of the NLS<sub>Cdc14</sub> from the nucleus we found that the time difference between the two was smaller in FEAR network mutants than in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This is due to the fact that release of full length Cdc14 from the nucleolus only depends on MEN activity in FEAR network mutants, delaying its release. As release of the NLS<sub>Cdc14</sub> is not mediated by the FEAR network, the time delay between the two events is smaller. We conclude that NLS<sub>Cdc14</sub> localization specifically reports on MEN activity.</p><p><italic>cdc20-1</italic> single mutants arrested in metaphase did not release NLS<sub>Cdc14</sub> into the cytoplasm when a SPB translocated into the bud which is consistent with their failure to disassociate Cdc3 from the bud neck and to exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Deletion of <italic>BUB2</italic> caused release of NLS<sub>Cdc14</sub> into the cytoplasm in metaphase-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). In <italic>cdc20-1 clb2-VI</italic> mutants in which exit from mitosis occurred (Cdc3 delocalized from the bud neck), we also observed translocation of NLS<sub>Cdc14</sub> from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>), indicating that exit from mitosis in this strain was preceded by MEN activation. Indeed, we found that spindle position dependent exit from mitosis in <italic>cdc20-1 clb2-VI</italic> cells required MEN activity. <italic>cdc20-1 clb2-VI cdc15-2</italic> triple mutants failed to exit mitosis upon translocation of a SPB into the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Together, our results demonstrate that MEN activation requires two signals: (1) movement of a MEN GTPase-bearing SPB into the bud and (2) a lowering of mitotic CDK activity by APC/C-Cdc20 at the onset of anaphase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>DNA damage inhibits the MEN by additional mechanisms</title><p>In budding yeast, activation of the DNA damage checkpoint causes cell cycle arrest in metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2003</xref>).

We used three methods to trigger activation of the DNA damage checkpoint: the temperature sensitive <italic>cdc13-1</italic> and <italic>cdc9-1</italic> alleles as well as hydroxyurea (HU). <italic>CDC13</italic> is required for telomere function.

This finding indicates that mechanisms in addition to high mitotic CDK activity prevent MEN activation in cells arrested in metaphase due to DNA damage. Indeed, previous reports have shown that DNA damage inhibits the MEN by activating the MEN inhibitory GAP complex, Bub2-Bfa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Valerio-Santiago et al., 2013</xref>).

At the onset of anaphase, APC/C-Cdc20 attenuates mitotic CDK activity by (1) targeting a fraction of mitotic cyclins for destruction and (2) inducing FEAR-network mediated release of Cdc14 from its inhibitor in the nucleolus. These two mechanisms restrict MEN activation to anaphase, preventing premature exit from mitosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that signal integration in the Mitotic Exit Network occurs through the regulation of multiple signaling elements rather than a central signaling hub. Regulation of the GTPase by spindle position and regulation of the downstream kinase cascade by CDK activity creates a logical ‘AND gate’. MEN activation only occurs when (1) a SPB enters the bud and (2) mitotic CDK activity has decreased. We propose that regulating the MEN signaling cascade in series decreases susceptibility to noise; a downstream dependence on CDK inactivation insulates the MEN against spindle movement prior to anaphase. Our work also provides an explanation for why signaling pathways are multi-step processes. Signal integration rather than signal amplification may be the reason for why signal transduction pathways are multi-step processes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>CDK regulation of the MEN creates anaphase specific ultrasensitivity</title><p>Positive feedback loops, such as the mutual regulation between Cdc14 and the MEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) as well as double-negative feedback loops, such as exist between CDKs and the MEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>), create ultrasensitive, switch-like responses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferrell and Ha, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferrell and Ha, 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrell and Ha, 2014c</xref>).

When a SPB moves into the bud during metaphase a slight, but appreciable MEN activation occurs. Small amounts of Mob1 localize to the SPBs, yet signaling strength (as judged by Mob1 association with SPBs) is weak and inconsistent, never leading to release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus. This emphasizes the importance of the FEAR network and mitotic cyclin degradation at the metaphase – anaphase transition. Without the FEAR network, the Cdc14 positive feedback loop is disrupted, slowing MEN activation by 20 min. Likewise, without APC/C-Cdc20 degradation of Clb2 and Clb5 at the metaphase – anaphase transition, the double-negative feedback loop between mitotic CDKs and the MEN is too heavily weighted towards CDK activity, preventing MEN activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Signal integration across multiple serial MEN signaling elements</title><p>The initial characterization of MEN regulation focused on the MEN GTPase Tem1.

Our work has revealed that MEN regulatory signals control not just Tem1 but also every subsequent step in the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Why is the MEN regulated via a serial process rather than integrating all signals through the GTPase?</p><p>The phenotype of the <italic>cdc15-7A mob1-2A</italic> double mutant indicates that control of the MEN kinases protects cells from spindle movements into the bud such as occur when cells arrest in metaphase for prolonged periods of time. It is worth emphasizing that movement of the nucleus into the bud during metaphase arrests is not merely a byproduct of cell cycle arrests brought about by mutations in genes critical for anaphase entry. DNA damage or microtubule – kinetochore attachment defects can arrest cells in metaphase for hours. Indeed, our live cell analyses show that wild-type cells arrest in metaphase at an appreciable frequency presumably due to light-induced DNA damage. In 67% of these arrested cells the spindle moves in the bud. Our data further suggest that even transient excursions of the spindle into the bud during metaphase could lead to inappropriate Tem1 activation. 15% of <italic>cdc15-7A mob1-2A</italic> double mutants exited mitosis during the metaphase arrest without obvious and hence inferred transient movement of the nucleus into the bud. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the mitotic exit observed in these 15% of cells is due to partial loss of spindle position sensing.

Twenty non-mitotic cells that subsequently move at least one SPB into the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>), reached anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>; 4B), or exited mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>, except <italic>cdc20-1</italic> which never exit mitosis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) were randomly chosen for analysis. Length of analysis is described in the figure legends. Mob1 intensity was quantified by manually segmenting the SPBs, as identified by Spc42-mCherry localization, and measuring maximum Mob1 intensity within the segmented region [max(SPB)]. Cellular background was subtracted from the maximum intensity at the SPB [max(SPB)-mean(cell)]. Cdc14 release from the nucleolus and NLS<sub>Cdc14</sub> translocation into the cytoplasm was quantified by manually segmenting the cell and measuring the coefficient of variation (CV = stdev/mean) of intensities within the cell as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neurohr and Mendoza, 2017</xref>), normalized and centered as indicated in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Nud1pT78 immunoblot</title><p>Nud1-3V5 immunoprecipitation, Nud1pT78 detection, and Nud1-3V5 detection were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rock et al., 2013</xref>) with the following modifications: Denaturing immunoprecipitations were performed on approximately 15 ODs of cells using 30 μl of anti-V5 agarose affinity gel (Sigma).

Kinase reactions were incubated for 1 hr with gentle mixing and separated by SDS PAGE. Histone H1 phosphorylation was quantified using the phosphorImaging system. Prior to this analysis, the top part of the gel was cut off the kinase assay gel and processed for Dbf2 western blot analysis. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose using semi-dry blotting. The membrane was probed with an anti-c-Myc [9E10] antibody (abcam, 1:500 dilution) and imaged using the ECL Plus system (GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fixed cell microscopy</title><p>Indirect in situ immunofluorescence microscopy to detect Tub1 was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kilmartin and Adams, 1984</xref>) using a rat anti-α-tubulin (YOL1/34, Oxford Biotechnology, 1:100 dilution). An anti-rat Cy3 antibody (Jackson Laboratory) was used as a secondary antibody. Cells were scored on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope (Zeiss.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Mitotic Exit Network integrates temporal and spatial signals by distributing regulation across multiple components&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Yves Barral (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Campbell et al. investigate the nature of the signals that trigger mitotic exit in yeast. Using a large panel of imaging and biochemical readouts, they show that mitotic exit requires the convergence of two independent signals, (1) the proper entry of a spindle pole into the bud and (2) the activation of APC, which lowers Cdk1 activity. Their conclusion is that all stages of the MEN are responsive to regulation with a spatial control on Bfa/Bub2 and CDK control of Cdc15 and Dbf2 combining to function as an AND gate to provide greater fidelity of MEN activation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Three major issues should be addressed in the revision. The first is that the studies on DNA damage should be extended since currently only the case of <italic>cdc13</italic> mutant cells is considered, which might be a very specific case. The data should be confirmed with other methods for damaging the DNA and more rigorous analyses, for example: on Pds1 degradation in the different mutants.</p><p>The second difficulty of the paper is that it uses a flurry of different assays, many of which are used for the first time without describing and validating them thoroughly, and without using them consistently throughout the paper. For example, the assay with Cdc14-NLS is novel, is used only for late parts of the paper, and is not truly validated. In contrast, more direct and better established assays for mitotic exit, such as actomyosin ring contraction, are not used and it is unclear why. More consistent assays should be used throughout the paper.</p><p>The third issue is that the paper requires substantial rewriting since it confuses mitotic exit and the mitotic exit network. The only readout of the network that the authors consider is the late one, namely mitotic exit. Early readouts that would be highly relevant to monitor the activation of the MEN, such as Hmt1 phosphorylation (Messier et al., 2013), Kar9 localization, SPB differentiation and the positioning of the metaphase spindle (Hotz et al., 2012a and 2012b; Scarfone et al., 2015; Lengefeld et al., 2017), phosphorylation of the kinesin Kip2 (Drechsler et al., 2015) are omitted. Therefore, many conclusions about the activation of the MEN are not assayed directly, only the activation of mitotic exit by the MEN. In this respect, the published literature concerning the early functions of the MEN should be properly cited; indeed some of the findings presented in the paper have been predicted by others (e.g.: Hotz and Barral, 2014).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41139.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Three major issues should be addressed in the revision.

We would like to point out that we observe a remarkable consistency between assays for MEN activity (Nud1-T78 phosphorylation, Mob1 association with SPBs, Dbf2 kinase activity, Cdc14 release from the nucleolus, Cdc14<sub>NLS</sub> export into the cytoplasm) and procedures measuring exit from mitosis (anaphase spindle disassembly, loss of Cdc3 from the bud neck, formation of a new bud). However, we acknowledge that this can make the manuscript difficult to follow. Thus, we have edited the text and figures to draw attention to how the various measures of MEN activity correlate with measures of mitotic exit. Every biochemical assay is accompanied by tubulin immuno-fluorescence to assess anaphase spindle disassembly and hence exit from mitosis. To the analysis of Mob1 and Cdc14 localization we have added analyses assessing the formation of new buds, which is yet another assay to assess exit from mitosis. Thus, every experiment provides a measure of MEN activity and exit from mitosis.</p><p>We developed the Cdc14<sub>NLS</sub> nuclear export assay because we required an assay to measure both mitotic exit and MEN activation in the same cell.This was not possible with existing techniques. We would like to emphasize that we did validate the Cdc14<sub>NLS</sub> assay, demonstrating that it is responsive to modulating MEN but not FEAR network activity. These validations are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. We expanded the description of these validations in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The third issue is that the paper requires substantial rewriting since it confuses mitotic exit and the mitotic exit network.

In our manuscript, we specifically analyzed MEN’s anaphase function that promotes Cdc14 release from the nucleolus and exit from mitosis. As requested by the reviewers we have now analyzed Kar9 localization and spindle pole inheritance in MEN mutants. This analysis is shown in new Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Unfortunately, we do not observe this previously reported metaphase function of the MEN. Neither Kar9 localization nor SPB inheritance was altered in cells lacking MEN function. We cannot explain this discrepancy besides to point to a difference in strain background. Given that we have no evidence for MEN activity during metaphase, we have focused our analyses on the well-established role of the MEN in anaphase. All this is described in a new section entitled “MEN activity is confined to anaphase”. The data are presented in new Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
