We recently proposed that the C-terminal region encompassing the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B, MUN and C<sub>2</sub>C domains of Munc13-1 (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C) bridges the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes through interactions involving the C<sub>2</sub>C domain and the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region. However, the physiological relevance of this model has not been demonstrated. Here we show that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C bridges membranes through opposite ends of its elongated structure. Mutations in putative membrane-binding sites of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain disrupt the ability of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C to bridge liposomes and to mediate liposome fusion in vitro. These mutations lead to corresponding disruptive effects on synaptic vesicle docking, priming, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered neurotransmitter release in mouse neurons. Remarkably, these effects include an almost complete abrogation of release by a single residue substitution in this 200 kDa protein. These results show that bridging the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes is a central function of Munc13-1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Munc13</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle fusion</kwd><kwd>membrane bridging</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle docking</kwd><kwd>reconstitution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quade</surname><given-names>Bradley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB958</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1315</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ro1296/7-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ro1296/8-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Berlin Institute of Health Stiftung Charite</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 NS097333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD018027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-electron tomography, reconstitution, and electrophysiological data show that a fundamental function of Munc13-1 is to bridge synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic plasma membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The release of neurotransmitters by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered synaptic vesicle exocytosis is crucial for interneuronal communication. Exocytosis occurs in several steps that include tethering of synaptic vesicles to specialized sites of the presynaptic plasma membrane known as active zones, priming of the vesicles to a release-ready state(s) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane when an action potential causes Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the presynaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Südhof, 2013</xref>). Release is exquisitely regulated by a sophisticated protein machinery that has been extensively characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rizo, 2018</xref>). Central components of this machinery are the SNAP receptors (SNAREs) synaptobrevin, syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, which form a tight four-helix bundle called the SNARE complex that brings the vesicle and plasma membranes together and is critical for membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poirier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). The SNARE complex is disassembled by N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) and soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>), whereas its assembly is orchestrated in an NSF-SNAP-resistant manner by Munc18-1 and Munc13s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). The assembly pathway involves binding of Munc18-1 to a self-inhibited ‘closed’ conformation of syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Misura et al., 2000</xref>) and to synaptobrevin to template SNARE complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parisotto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sitarska et al., 2017</xref>) with the help of Munc13s, which facilitate opening of syntaxin-1 to form the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richmond et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Synaptotagmin-1 acts as the major Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that triggers release through a combination of interactions with membranes and the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernández-Chacón et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Even with these and other advances, there are still fundamental questions that remain to be answered in order to understand the mechanisms of neurotransmitter release and its regulation. Particularly important is to elucidate the functions of mammalian Munc13s and their invertebrate homologues, Unc13s, because these large (ca. 200 kDa) proteins are essential for release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>) and modulate exocytosis in multiple presynaptic plasticity processes through the various domains in its architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rizo and Südhof, 2012</xref>). Munc13-1, the most abundant isoform in the mammalian brain, contains a variable N-terminal region with a C<sub>2</sub>A domain and a calmodulin-binding region (CaMb), as well as a conserved C-terminal region that includes the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B, MUN and C<sub>2</sub>C domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The C<sub>2</sub>A domain forms a homodimer and alternatively a heterodimer with the Rab3 effectors called RIMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulubova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2006</xref>), thus providing a switch that controls neurotransmitter release and couples exocytosis to diverse forms of Rab3- and RIM-dependent presynaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rizo and Südhof, 2012</xref>); the CaMb region mediates some forms of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Junge et al., 2004</xref>); the C<sub>1</sub> domain mediates diacylglycerol (DAG)- and phorbol ester-dependent potentiation of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>); and the C<sub>2</sub>B domain acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and PIP<sub>2</sub>-dependent modulator of short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). The MUN domain is a highly elongated module that is homologous to factors involved in tethering in diverse membrane compartments and is critical for opening syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu and Hughson, 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42806.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Functional effects caused by deleting the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>C domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depicting the domain structure of Munc13-1 and Munc13-1 ∆C<sub>2</sub>C.

Multiple evidence suggests that this domain is critical for Munc13 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Madison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stevens et al., 2005</xref>), but its biochemical properties and mechanism of action are not well understood. Based on sequence alignments, the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>C domain is not predicted to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> because it lacks some of the canonical aspartate residues that typically bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> in C<sub>2</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rizo and Südhof, 1998</xref>). Reconstitution studies of synaptic vesicle fusion and vesicle clustering assays suggested that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain binds to membranes, leading to a model whereby the conserved Munc13-1 C-terminal region bridges the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes through respective interactions with the C<sub>2</sub>C domain and the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region on opposite ends of the MUN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This model is consistent with the notion that the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains cooperate in binding to the plasma membrane through interactions with DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2017</xref>), and a role for Munc13-1 in bridging membranes seems natural given the homology of the MUN domain with tethering factors. However, no structure-function analysis of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain has been described, and the physiological relevance of the membrane bridging model has not been investigated.</p><p>The study presented here was designed to test this model and elucidate the function of the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>C domain, which is critical to understand the mechanism of action of Munc13s. We show that the Munc13-1 C-terminal region can bridge two membranes through the ends of its elongated structure and that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain is essential for this ability. Moreover, impairment of the bridging activity by mutations in putative membrane-binding residues within the C<sub>2</sub>C domain correlates with disruption of synaptic vesicle docking, priming and neurotransmitter release. Our results show that, remarkably, a single point mutation in a 200 kDa protein such as Munc13-1 practically abolishes evoked neurotransmitter release, demonstrating the crucial importance of the membrane bridging activity for Munc13-1 function and for the sequence of events that lead to synaptic vesicle fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional consequences of deleting the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>C domain</title><p>Using electrophysiological experiments in neuronal autaptic cultures, we previously showed that the conserved C-terminal region spanning the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B, MUN and C<sub>2</sub>C domains of Munc13-1 (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C) can partially rescue the readily-releasable pool (RRP) and evoked neurotransmitter release in <italic>Munc13-1/2</italic> double knockout (DKO) neurons, while an analogous fragment lacking the C<sub>2</sub>C domain was practically unable to rescue release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). These results supported the notion that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain is crucial for Munc13-1 function, but we later showed that the incomplete rescue obtained with C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C arises in part because removal of the N-terminal region containing the C<sub>2</sub>A domain impairs synaptic vesicle docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>). Since our model postulates that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain plays a key role in membrane bridging by the Munc13-1 C-terminal region and this mechanism might be at least partially redundant with the function of the C<sub>2</sub>A domain in docking, it became important to test the functional importance of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain in the context of full-length Munc13-1.

Deletion of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain also reduced the RRP strongly, although the impairment was not as severe as that observed for evoked release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). As a result, the release probability of the few vesicles that were primed was decreased for the Munc13-1 ΔC<sub>2</sub>C rescue compared with the WT rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

To confirm that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain is folded within the MUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment, we compared <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) spectra of perdeuterated samples of the Munc13-1 MUN domain and MUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment that were specifically <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C-labeled at Ile, Leu and Val methyl groups (<sup>2</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-ILV-labeled).

Given the large size of these Munc13-1 fragments (residues 859–1516 and 859–1735, respectively), substantial binding would be expected to induce much stronger broadening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rizo et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, these results show that the two fragments bind very weakly to the syntaxin-1 (2–253) fragment and that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain does not enhance the weak interaction involving the MUN domain, as the presence of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain in MUNC<sub>2</sub>C did not increase the broadening.</p><p>In previous experiments, we did not detect binding of the MUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment to membranes in liposome co-floatation assays, but the C<sub>2</sub>C domain appeared to contribute to the ability of a fragment spanning the entire Munc13-1 C-terminal region (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C) to bridge liposomes containing synaptobrevin and a lipid composition resembling that of synaptic vesicles (V-liposomes) with liposomes containing syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 heterodimers and a lipid composition that mimics the plasma membrane (T-liposomes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).

Note that membrane binding is the most common function of C<sub>2</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rizo and Südhof, 1998</xref>). Such binding is often mediated in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner through loops that form Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites at the tip of a β-sandwich structure and these loops contain exposed basic and hydrophobic residues that can bind to negatively charged phospholipids and insert into membrane bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chapman and Davis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernández-Chacón et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rizo and Südhof, 1998</xref>). In addition, some C<sub>2</sub> domains contain a polybasic region on the side of the β-sandwich that can also contribute to membrane binding (e.g. the synaptotagmin-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2006</xref>] and the RIM1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Jong et al., 2018</xref>]).

The two samples, as well as a control sample of protein-free GST-affinity resin, were incubated with liposomes that had a lipid composition that resembles that of synaptic vesicles and 2% of a rhodamine-labeled lipid (rho-liposomes). We then centrifuged the samples and recorded emission fluorescence spectra of the flow-through. The spectra obtained from the eluate of the protein-free resin was analogous to that of the original lipid solution (not shown), indicating that the rho-liposomes were not retained by the resin. The fluorescence intensity observed in the spectra of the sample eluted from the R1598E/F1658E GST-MUNC<sub>2</sub>C resin was also very similar to that of the eluate from the protein-free resin whereas the sample eluted from the WT GST-MUNC<sub>2</sub>C resin had a much weaker intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results show that WT GST-MUNC<sub>2</sub>C efficiently bound to the rho-liposomes, while there was no detectable binding for the R1598E/F1658E GST-MUNC<sub>2</sub>C mutant. In analogous experiments where we loaded the resins with a four-fold larger amount of WT and R1598E/F1658E proteins, the R1598E/F1658E mutant again failed to bind rho-liposomes, whereas the WT protein retained most of the rholiposomes on the resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), showing the specificity of the interaction.

To test this model and directly visualize whether the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment can indeed bridge two membranes through the ends of its highly elongated structure, we acquired cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) images of reconstitution reactions where T-liposomes and V-liposomes were mixed together with Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, Munc18-1, NSF and αSNAP. Indeed, we observed many instances where two liposomes were bridged by highly elongated densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–E</xref>). Measurements made for 70 of these highly elongated densities yielded an average length of 22 nm, consistent with the approximate length that can be predicted for C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C based on the crystal structure of the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN fragment (ca. 20 nm long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2017</xref>]).

To directly visualize this prediction for the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C R1598E/F1658E mutant, we again used cryo-ET and the same liposome preparations used for WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C.

It was more difficult to identify C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C molecules for the R1598E/F1658E mutant than for the WT protein, which we attribute to the fact that the R1598E/F1658E mutation disrupts its membrane-bridging activity and the protein may then have a higher chance to be sequestered at the water-air interface.

In contrast, among 123 molecules of WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C that we identified, 78 were bridging two liposomes and 45 were bound to a single liposome (25 among these 45 likely did not bridge liposomes due to steric hindrance caused by other C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C molecules at the liposome-liposome interface). These results are consistent with dynamic light scattering (DLS) data showing complete abrogation of liposome clustering by the R1598E/F1658E mutation (see below) and strongly support the notion that binding of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain to lipids is key for the membrane-bridging activity of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C.</p><p>The cryo-ET images provide a direct visualization of how the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment can bridge two membranes through sequences located at opposite ends of the MUN domain, as previously proposed based on DLS experiments that revealed the ability of this fragment to cluster V- and T-liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).

However, in this previous study , we noted that the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN fragment used ended at residue 1531 and that the sequence spanning residues 1517 to 1531 is not part of the folded structure of the MUN domain. This sequence is highly hydrophobic and is probably folded in the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment, but is not observable in the structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, this sequence is exposed and likely mediates non-specific binding to membranes, which explains the ability of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN fragment to cluster liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, to test to what extent the C<sub>2</sub>C domain is important for the vesicle clustering ability of the Munc13-1 C-terminal region, we prepared a new C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN fragment that ends at residue 1516 (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN1516) and hence lacks the C-terminal hydrophobic sequence. DLS assays showed that, in contrast to C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN1516 fragment exhibited no clustering ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These results strongly support the notion that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain is indeed crucial for the membrane bridging activity of the Munc13-1 C-terminal region.</p><p>All our previous studies with large Munc13-1 fragments used proteins expressed in Sf9 insect cells. As bacterial expression of the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN fragment ending at 1531 was recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kreutzberger et al., 2017</xref>), we prepared new vectors for expression of Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN1516 in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Although the expression yields of both new fragments were modest, they were sufficient to obtain milligram quantities. DLS experiments showed that the bacterially expressed C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN1516 fragments have analogous ability, or lack thereof, to cluster SV- and PM-liposomes as the corresponding fragments expressed in Sf9 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also measured the ability of these fragments to support fusion between reconstituted V- and T-liposomes in the presence of Munc18-1, NSF and αSNAP using an established assay that simultaneously measures lipid and content mixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). The C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragments expressed in Sf9 insect cells and <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibited comparable activities, with slow lipid and content mixing in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and fast fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN1516 fragments expressed in Sf9 insect cells and <italic>E. coli</italic> were both inactive, which correlates with the vesicle clustering results and shows the critical importance of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain for Munc13-1 to support fusion in these assays. We also note that the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN1516 fragments made in Sf9 insect cells and in bacteria exhibited the expected chromatographic behavior in gel filtration, with elution volume a little larger than the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragments (16.5 versus 16.2 ml in a Superdex S200 10/300 GL column), and a similar ability to bind to PM-liposomes in co-sedimentation assays as C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate that the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN1516 fragments are properly folded and retain the ability of the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region to bind to liposomes containing DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub>, but cannot bridge these liposomes to SV-liposomes because they lack the C<sub>2</sub>C domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Membrane bridging by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C is crucial for its ability to support liposome fusion</title><p>The R1598E/F1658E mutation, which disrupts binding of MUNC<sub>2</sub>C to membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), provides a useful tool to probe the functional importance of the membrane bridging activity of the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment, but multiple mutations are ideally required to establish clear correlations between the bridging activity and Munc13-1 function. Thus, we prepared bacterially expressed versions of Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C that contained the double R1598E/F1658E mutation, single R1598E and F1658E mutations, which might have milder effects, and a double residue substitution (K1613A/K1616A) in the polybasic region that may also participate in membrane binding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>DLS assays that monitored clustering between SV- and PM-liposomes revealed that the K1613A/K1616A mutation partially disrupts the clustering activity of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The single R1598E and F1658E mutations disrupted vesicle clustering strongly, although the R1598E mutant appeared to retain a slight clustering ability. Clustering was completely abolished by the R1598E/F1658E mutation. These results demonstrate the critical importance of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain loops for membrane bridging by the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment, and show that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain polybasic region also contributes to this activity. We note that, in principle, the hydrophobic sequence spanning residues 1517 to 1531 might be responsible for lipid binding, and the effects of the mutations in the C<sub>2</sub>C domain could arise from long-range effects due to changes in the overall electrostatic potential that increase the repulsion with the membranes. However, the fact that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain cannot be expressed in soluble form in isolation while soluble MUNC<sub>2</sub>C is readily expressed suggests that the hydrophobic sequence spanning residues 1517 to 1531 is folded and forms part of the interface between the MUN and C<sub>2</sub>C domains in fragments that contain both domains. Moreover, it is unlikely that long-range effects due to changes in overall electrostatic potential can explain the dramatic disruption of liposome binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) caused by mutations in the putative membrane-binding loops of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain. In addition, the K1613A/K1616A mutation removes two positive charges and has a moderate effect on clustering, whereas the F1658E mutation has a very strong effect on clustering while introducing only one negative charge. Conversely, the effects of the mutations can be readily rationalized by the accumulated knowledge on membrane binding to C<sub>2</sub> domains, which predicts that F1658 is a key residue that inserts into the bilayer to mediate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chapman and Davis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rhee et al., 2005</xref>), while the polybasic region including K1613 and K1616 is expected to contribute to membrane binding but to a more moderate extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42806.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mutations in putative membrane-binding sites of the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>C domain disrupt the membrane-bridging activity of the Munc13-1 C-terminal region.</title><p>DLS analysis of the ability of WT and mutant Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragments to cluster SV- and PM-liposomes.

In initial experiments, we used C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragments at 0.1 μM concentration, which allows better discrimination of the effects of mutations than the standard concentrations we normally used in these assays (0.5 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2017</xref>) and somewhat decreases the activity of the WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At this concentration, the K1613A/K1616A mutation considerably impaired fusion, whereas the R1598E, F1658E and R1598E/F1658E mutations completely abolished fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To better characterize the effects of the mutations, we then performed titrations where the mutant C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragments were added at different concentrations. The K1613A/K1616A mutant was much more active at 0.25 and 0.5 μM concentrations than at 0.1 μM, whereas at 0.75 μM K1613A/K1616A we observed a slightly decreased activity that may arise because of appreciable precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The R1598E was able to support a small amount of lipid mixing at 0.5–2.5 μM concentrations, whereas the F1658E and R1598E/F1658E supported only very small amounts of lipid mixing at 2.5 μM concentration, and any content mixing supported by these three mutants was close to the noise level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These observations were reproduced in multiple experiments with different liposome preparations and were confirmed by quantification of the amounts of lipid and content mixing observed after 500 s of reaction with 0.1 μM WT and K1613A/K1616A mutant, and of the lipid mixing observed after 1000 s for 0.5 μM WT and R1598E, F1658E and R1598E/F1658E mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).

Nevertheless, the actual pathway of SNARE complex assembly is still under intense investigation. The critical role of Munc13s in this process has generally been associated to the activity of its MUN domain in facilitating opening of syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richmond et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), but this activity alone does not account for the functional importance of the Munc13 C<sub>2</sub>C domain, which was suggested by diverse studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Madison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stevens et al., 2005</xref>) and is further supported here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). An attractive model that assigned a critical function to the C<sub>2</sub>C domain postulated that Munc13-1 can bridge the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes through interactions involving the C<sub>2</sub>C domain and the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the physiological relevance of this model had not been examined. Here, we provide compelling evidence that the highly conserved C-terminal region of Munc13-1 can indeed bridge two membranes, that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain is critical for this activity, and that membrane bridging is a key aspect of the function of Munc13-1 in synaptic vesicle docking, priming and fusion. The importance of this bridging function is emphasized by the finding that a single point mutation in this 200 kDa protein abolishes neurotransmitter release almost completely.</p><p>This dramatic result suggests that membrane bridging may in fact constitute the primary function of Munc13s, although this notion does not diminish the importance of their role in opening syntaxin-1 because the two activities are likely coupled. Formation of SNARE complexes is hindered not only by the closed conformation of syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>) but also by the furled conformation of a Munc18-1 loop that prevents synaptobrevin binding and hence hinders the SNARE complex templating function of Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sitarska et al., 2017</xref>). The bridge between the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes provided by Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) is expected to dramatically increase the number of productive encounters between synaptobrevin and the syntaxin-1-Munc18-1 complex to initiate SNARE complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2017</xref>), further facilitated by the activity of the Munc13-1 MUN domain in opening syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Note also that a membrane bridging function for Munc13s is not surprising given the homology of their MUN domain with tethering factors from different membrane compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu and Hughson, 2010</xref>). However, these factors normally do not contain C<sub>1</sub> or C<sub>2</sub> domains. The incorporation of membrane-binding C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> domains at both ends of the Munc13 MUN domain may have occurred during evolution to provide opportunities for regulation of this membrane-bridging activity, as exquisite regulation is a hallmark of neurotransmitter release and Munc13-1 acts as a master regulator of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rizo, 2018</xref>). The C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains of Munc13s are involved in DAG-phorbol ester-dependent potentiation of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-PIP<sub>2</sub>-dependent short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), respectively. The C<sub>2</sub>C domain is not known to be involved in plasticity, but it is tempting to speculate that as yet unidentified mechanisms (e.g. phosphorylation) may modulate C<sub>2</sub>C domain activity to regulate neurotransmitter release.</p><p>The finding that the C<sub>2</sub>C deletion and the mutations in the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>C domain described here impair synaptic vesicle docking, priming and release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>), in correlation with the impairments they cause in liposome clustering and fusion in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), suggests that the membrane-bridging activity of the Munc13 C-terminal region is important for more than one of the steps that lead to release. The role in docking-priming is not unexpected, as SNARE complex assembly is believed to be necessary for vesicle docking using the definition that has become widely used recently and we adopt here, that is contact between the vesicle and plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imig et al., 2014</xref>) (note that, with this definition, docking and priming may constitute the same event, although this equivalence is not fully established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rizo, 2018</xref>]). Moreover, the phenotypic spectra in Munc13-1 mutants and in syntaxin-1 titration experiments are highly similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arancillo et al., 2013</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that Munc13-1 membrane bridging and SNARE complex assembly are tightly linked. Note however that, in vivo, synaptic vesicles are believed to be tethered to the active zone through other mechanisms, for instance through RIM-Rab3 interactions, and Munc13 function may be partially redundant with that of CAPS, which contains a MUN domain and membrane-binding domains and also supports SNARE-dependent fusion in reconstitution assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">James et al., 2009</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rizo and Südhof, 2012</xref>). Such redundancy may explain the finding that the effects of the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>C domain mutations on the liposome clustering and fusion assays in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) are stronger than those observed in vesicle docking and priming in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>C mutations also disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered neurotransmitter release at least as much as they impair docking and priming. In particular, evoked release is almost abolished by the F1658E and R1598E/F1658E mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), which correlates with the finding that these mutations abolish liposome clustering and fusion in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These observations suggest that the membrane bridging activity of Munc13-1 is as important for release itself as for vesicle docking-priming. Hence, it seems likely that Munc13-1 still bridges the vesicle and plasma membranes after SNARE complex formation and contributes to controlling the probability of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered synaptic vesicle fusion. It is also plausible that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain mutations impair only SNARE complex assembly and a lower number of assembled SNARE complexes results in a stronger impairment of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion than of sucrose-induced release or the number of docked vesicles. Both explanations are not mutually exclusive, but the notion that Munc13-1 still bridges the primed vesicles to the plasma membrane, forming part of the macromolecular assembly that triggers fusion, is attractive because it can explain the multiple and distinct effects of Munc13-1 mutations on vesicular release probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Junge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, the finding that phorbol ester stimulation of Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub> domains acutely increases release probability without changing the number of docked and primed vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>) strongly suggests that modulation of the Munc13 bridging function may directly regulate the efficiency of the vesicle fusion reaction. This model is also consistent with recent super-resolution imaging data showing that mammalian Munc13-1 and invertebrate Unc13 form supramolecular assemblies that appear to define the sites for neurotransmitter release in the presynaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reddy-Alla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakamoto et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It is worth noting that the Munc13-1 C-terminal region can likely bridge two membranes in at least two different orientations that can favor SNARE complex formation and/or fusion to different extents, or can also inhibit these events, thus acting as a ‘gatekeeper’ of release. This notion emerged from the finding that the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains have their respective DAG- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding sites next to each other and can thus cooperate in binding to the plasma membrane in a defined, slanted orientation, but these domains also form a polybasic region that can bind to membranes in a different orientation, more perpendicular to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). This model provides a basis to understand DAG- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent presynaptic plasticity that depends on Munc13, and explains the observation that membrane fusion does not occur or is very slow in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> even though Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C bridges membranes under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), whereas fusion is fast upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). Mutagenesis studies of <italic>C. elegans</italic> Unc13 support the idea that Unc13 can exist in two states, one that inhibits release and another that activates release and is favored by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>). Our cryo-ET images, which were acquired in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, show that Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C can bridge two membranes in a range of orientations, some of which would prevent the membranes from coming closer while others could favor initiation of SNARE complex assembly. We previously proposed that Ca<sup>2+</sup>, DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub> favor more slanted orientations that can facilitate SNARE complex formation more efficiently and/or membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Extensive studies varying these different factors under conditions that prevent membrane fusion will be required to test this proposal.</p><p>Further research will also be required to investigate how the membrane-bridging activity of Munc13-1 is coupled to other functions, such as its role in opening syntaxin-1. In this context, a recent report has described the crystal structure of the Munc13-1 MUN bound to a fragment spanning the juxtamembrane region of synaptobrevin and has suggested that this interaction is crucial for Munc13-1 to stimulate the transition from the closed syntaxin-1-Munc18-1 complex to the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). The relevance of this structure is unclear, as the synaptobrevin juxtamembrane region contains multiple basic and aromatic residues that render it highly promiscuous and thus able to bind not only to Munc13-1 but also to Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2010</xref>) and to phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brewer et al., 2011</xref>), which are natively close to this region. Moreover, mutating two basic residues of the juxtamembrane region (R86 and K87) abrogated the MUN-synaptobrevin interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) but did not impair neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>), and the binding mode observed in the crystal structure would likely lead to steric clashes of the C-terminal region of the MUN domain with the vesicle membrane. Nevertheless, we cannot completely rule out that this interaction might cooperate with binding of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain to the membrane. Note also that, although our NMR data suggest that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain does not contribute to syntaxin-1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>), weak interactions of the MUN domain with syntaxin-1 are believed to be critical to overcome the energy barrier to open its conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, Munc13 has been shown to increase the fidelity of SNARE complex assembly by decreasing the number of SNARE complexes that are formed in an antiparallel orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lai et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that there are additional interactions of Munc13 with the SNAREs that are functionally important. Such interactions may be reminiscent of those found between tethering factors homologous to the Munc13 MUN domain and their cognate SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu and Hughson, 2010</xref>). It is not surprising that a large, highly conserved component of the release machinery such as Munc13-1 has multiple important roles. It appears that much is currently known, but there is still much to learn.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and recombinant proteins</title><p>Expression and purification of full-length <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> SNAP-25A (with its four cysteines mutated to serine), full-length <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> synaptobrevin-2, full-length <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> Munc18-1, full-length <italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic> NSF V155M mutant, full-length <italic>Bos taurus</italic> α-SNAP and <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> syntaxin-1 (2–253) in <italic>E. coli</italic> were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dulubova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2013</xref>).

Building on previous work showing that this domain is critical for function, the authors now report that the domain is needed for forming a bridge (cross-link) between synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane, and that this cross-linking is essential for the function of Munc13.</p><p>This study follows up on Liu et al., 2016 by some of the current authors and reaches the same conclusions. However, the data are extended considerably and provide more structural details. The paper therefore is seen as an important contribution to the field that goes significantly beyond the previous state.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is no evidence that the C2C domain binds directly to membranes, though the C2 mutations strongly suggest that this is the role of the C2C domain. In previous liposome co-floatation assays (Liu et al., 2016), no liposome binding was detected with the MUN-C2C fragment. Does C2C actually bind liposomes? For instance, the data in Figure 3 may be interpreted differently: that the hydrophobic sequence 1517-1531 is required for clustering irrespective of whether the C2C domain is present or not. Similarly, replacement of arginine 1598 and phenylalanine 1658 with negatively charged glutamate may increase the overall electrostatic repulsion but again does not prove that this region critically contributes to membrane binding. It would strengthen the interpretation considerably if direct binding of C2C can be demonstrated, e.g. by introducing a fluorescent label (or a spin probe) directly into the presumed interaction site, or by another approach showing that these residues bind to lipids.</p><p>2) The authors show clustering of vesicles that is attributed to the cross-linking activity of Munc-13. However, the authors performed this experiment in the presence of SNAREs, NSF, and Munc18. According to their model, clustering should be observable independent of these other proteins (including SNAREs). What is the role of these additional proteins – are they required? In particular, are the cross-links observed by cryo-EM formed between any liposomes (protein-free or not), do they form between v-SNARE-only or t-SNARE-only vesicles, or do they specifically cross-link v- and t-SNARE vesicles? We suggest to use cryo EM (or another, less labor-intensive method) to test whether membrane bridging by wt C1C2BMUNC2C is significantly lower with t- or v-liposomes only. Presently, it cannot be ruled out that cross-linking is indirect, i.e. that Munc13 interactions with the SNAREs (or other proteins) mediate clustering. Similarly, it is possible that Munc13 activates these components, and the SNAREs cluster vesicles. Open syntaxin completely bypasses the docking defects of unc-13 (Hammarlund, 2007), and it is therefore possible that the MUN domain indirectly leads to vesicle clustering by acting through the SNARE proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42806.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This study follows up on Liu et al., 2016 by some of the current authors and reaches the same conclusions.

We have in fact devoted extensive efforts for over two years to attach fluorescent labels using a non-native amino acid approach, but unfortunately all chemical reactions performed to attache the labels led to massive precipitation. We also agree with the concern that the MUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment did not appear to bind to liposomes in co-floatation assays. In the original manuscript we proposed that this result may arise because binding is weak, but the C<sub>2</sub>C domain may contribute to the liposome clustering activity of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C because of cooperativity between multiple C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C molecules. In the revised manuscript we have used a GST-pulldown assay to test for binding of liposomes to MUNC<sub>2</sub>C, as the high local concentrations of proteins accumulated on the resins can favor binding of multiple MUNC<sub>2</sub>C molecules to the same liposome. Indeed, we observed almost quantitative liposome binding to WT MUNC<sub>2</sub>C with this assay. Moreover, the R1598E/F1658E mutation completely abolishes such binding. These results are now shown in a new figure (Figure 2) and described in subsection “A Munc13-1 MUNC2C fragment binds to membranes” of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We believe that it is unlikely that the 1517-1531 sequence mediates the clustering ability of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, or the lipid binding to MUNC<sub>2</sub>C that we now show in Figure 2. However, we agree that this is a valid point and hence that the reasons why we believe that this possibility is unlikely should be explained in the manuscript. With this purpose, we have included the following paragraph (subsection “Membrane bridging by C1C2BMUNC2C is crucial for its ability to support liposome fusion”):</p><p>“We note that, in principle, the hydrophobic sequence spanning residues 1517 to 1531 might be responsible for lipid binding, and the effects of the mutations in the C<sub>2</sub>C domain could arise from long-range effects due to changes in the overall electrostatic potential that increase the repulsion with the membranes. However, the fact that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain cannot be expressed in soluble form in isolation while soluble MUNC<sub>2</sub>C is readily expressed suggests that the hydrophobic sequence spanning residues 1517 to 1531 is folded and forms part of the interface between the MUN and C<sub>2</sub>C domains in fragments that contain both domains. Moreover, it is unlikely that long-range effects due to changes in overall electrostatic potential can explain the dramatic disruption of liposome binding (Figure 2) and clustering (Figure 5) caused by mutations in the putative membrane-binding loops of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain. In addition, the K1613A/K1616A mutation removes two positive charges and has a moderate effect on clustering, whereas the F1658E mutation has a very strong effect on clustering while introducing only one negative charge. Conversely, the effects of the mutations can be readily rationalized by the accumulated knowledge on membrane binding to C<sub>2</sub> domains, which predicts that F1658 is a key residue that inserts into the bilayer to mediate binding (Chapman and Davis, 1998; Rhee et al., 2005), while the polybasic region including K1613 and K1616 is expected to contribute to membrane binding but to a more moderate extent (Li et al., 2006).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors show clustering of vesicles that is attributed to the cross-linking activity of Munc-13.

The goal was to directly visualize membrane-bridging by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C in the same context as the reconstitution experiments that we believe recapitulate basic aspects of synaptic vesicle fusion. The cryo-EM data supported the notion that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C bridges V- and T-liposomes, which we proposed in Liu et al. 2016 based on the finding that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C cannot cluster V-liposomes alone but clusters mixtures of V- and T-liposomes. We did realize however that the bridging activity might be mediated at least in part by interactions of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C with other proteins, particularly the SNAREs. To rule out this possibility and ensure that the bridging activity is mediated by interactions of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C with membranes, the DLS experiments were performed with liposomes that had the same lipid compositions as V- and T-liposomes, but were protein free (experiments shown in Figure 4A and Figure 5, which were Figure 3A and Figure 4B in the original manuscript). Unfortunately, we still described them in the original manuscript as V- and T-liposomes without noting that they did not contain proteins. We are terribly sorry about this mistake, which we have corrected in the revised manuscript by explaining the different nature of the liposomes and using the term SV- and PM-liposomes (for liposomes with lipid compositions that mimic the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes, respectively). We inserted the following paragraph in subsection “The C2C domain is required for membrane bridging by the Munc13-1 C-terminal region”:</p><p>“To ensure that the bridging activity indeed involves interactions of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C with the membranes and does not depend on binding to proteins, we performed clustering assays monitored by DLS using mixtures of protein-free liposomes with the same lipid compositions as V- and T-liposomes (referred to as SV-liposomes and PM-liposomes because these lipid compositions mimic those of synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane, respectively). The data showed that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C robustly clusters SV- and PM-liposomes in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not substantially increase this activity (Figure 4A), as observed previously with V- and T-liposome mixtures (Liu et al., 2016). These results demonstrate that membrane bridging involves direct interactions of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C with the two apposed membranes.”</p><p>The DLS experiments unambiguously demonstrate that the liposome bridging activity of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C involves interactions with membranes, as expected because of the presence of membrane-binding domains at opposite ends of the elongated MUN domain structure. The functional importance of this bridging activity in WT neurons is not incompatible with the results of Hammarlund et al., 2007, as the open syntaxin mutant facilitates SNARE complex assembly, making the bridging function of Munc13-1 less crucial for docking. Note that gain-of-function mutations in Munc18-1/Unc18 that also facilitate SNARE complex formation can also bypass the requirement for Munc13-1/Unc13 to some extent, which led to the proposal that autoinhibitory interactions within syntaxin-1 and Munc18-1 hinder SNARE complex assembly to render neurotransmitter release strictly dependent on Munc13-1/Unc13, thus enabling the multiple forms of regulation of release that are mediated by Munc13-1/Unc13 (Sitarska et al., 2017; Park et al., 2017).</p><p>We do note that a recent study reported a crystal structure of the Munc13-1 MUN domain bound to a fragment spanning the synaptobrevin juxtamembrane region and claimed that this interaction is important for Munc13-1 function (Wang et al., 2019). We have strong doubts that this structure is biologically relevant because the synaptobrevin juxtamembrane region is very promiscuous, and have included the following paragraph in the Discussion sectopn:</p><p>“In this context, a recent report described the crystal structure of the Munc13-1 MUN bound to a fragment spanning the juxtamembrane region of synaptobrevin and suggested that this interaction is crucial for Munc13-1 to stimulate the transition from the closed syntaxin-1-Munc18-1 complex to the SNARE complex (Wang et al., 2019). The relevance of this structure is unclear, as the synaptobrevin juxtamembrane region contains multiple basic and aromatic residues that render it highly promiscuous and thus able to bind not only to Munc13-1 but also to Munc18-1 (Xu et al., 2010) and to phospholipids (Brewer et al., 2011), which are natively close to this region. Moreover, mutating two basic residues of the juxtamembrane region (R86 and K87) abrogated the MUN-synaptobrevin interaction (Wang et al., 2019) but did not impair neurotransmitter release (Maximov et al., 2009), and the binding mode observed in the crystal structure would likely lead to steric clashes of the C-terminal region of the MUN domain with the vesicle membrane. Nevertheless, we cannot completely rule out that this interaction might cooperate with binding of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain to the membrane.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
