We previously demonstrated that Rgs12 is essential for osteoclast differentiation and its deletion in vivo protected mice against pathological bone loss. To characterize its mechanism in osteoclastogenesis, we selectively deleted Rgs12 in C57BL/6J mice targeting osteoclast precursors using <italic>LyzM</italic>-driven Cre mice or overexpressed Rgs12 in RAW264.7 cells. Rgs12 deletion in vivo led to an osteopetrotic phenotype evidenced by increased trabecular bone, decreased osteoclast number and activity but no change in osteoblast number and bone formation. Rgs12 overexpression increased osteoclast number and size, and bone resorption activity. Proteomics analysis of Rgs12-depleted osteoclasts identified an upregulation of antioxidant enzymes under the transcriptional regulation of Nrf2, the master regulator of oxidative stress. We confirmed an increase of Nrf2 activity and impaired reactive oxygen species production in Rgs12-deficient cells. Conversely, Rgs12 overexpression suppressed Nrf2 through a mechanism dependent on the 26S proteasome, and promoted RANKL-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and NFκB, which was abrogated by antioxidant treatment. Our study therefore identified a novel role of Rgs12 in regulating Nrf2, thereby controlling cellular redox state and osteoclast differentiation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42951.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human bodies change with age, and the skeleton is among the parts of the body most visibly affected. This is because bone tissue tends to decrease as the skeleton gets older. For example, people often get shorter as they get older, mostly because they lose bone mass in areas of the skeleton that support posture. Severe bone loss can also lead to osteoporosis, a debilitating condition where bones become brittle and fracture easily.</p><p>Human skeletons contain cells, called osteoclasts, which break down bone tissue. Osteoclasts normally cooperate with other cells that add new bone, which helps maintain the balance between ‘bone-eating’ and ‘bone-building’ responsible for sculpting a healthy skeleton. This balance is disrupted during old age when the body starts producing too many ‘hyperactive’ osteoclasts, and bone formation cannot keep up with bone loss.</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are unstable, potentially toxic molecules that have been linked with diseases of aging. Recent research has shown that low amounts of ROS can also drive the formation of new osteoclasts. Ng, Li et al. therefore wanted to determine how exactly ROS did this – specifically, whether ROS works together with the cell signaling mechanisms involved in bone loss controlled by a gene called <italic>Rgs12</italic>.</p><p>Initial experiments, using genetically altered mice, showed that removing <italic>Rgs12</italic> from immature osteoclasts was enough to stop them from maturing. The bones of these mice were also stronger and thicker than usual. In contrast, forcing osteoclasts to produce large amounts of the protein encoded by <italic>Rgs12</italic> heightened their bone-eating ability.</p><p>Analysis of the proteins made by cells without <italic>Rgs12</italic> revealed that the cells had turned on the <italic>Nrf2</italic> gene, a molecular ‘master switch’ that helps produce the enzymes capable of counteracting ROS (termed antioxidants). These cells therefore contained abnormally high amounts of antioxidants and low levels of ROS. However, osteoclasts where the <italic>Rgs12</italic> gene was present were able to generate ROS by switching off the <italic>Nrf2</italic> gene, and were thus able to reach maturity.</p><p>These results shed new light on the molecular signals that direct the development and activity of osteoclasts. In the future, a better understanding of these mechanisms could help us prevent them going wrong during aging, or even lead to better therapies for osteoporosis and other skeletal disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteoclasts</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR066101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Shuying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG048388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Shuying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rgs12 protein is a novel regulator of the Nrf2 protein by facilitating the proteasomal degradation of the transcription factor during osteoclast differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoporosis is a pervasive disorder characterized by skeletal fragility and microarchitectural deterioration that predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The disease has a significant global impact, affecting an estimated 200 million people worldwide and exerts a heavy economic burden. Moreover, disease prevalence is projected to rise by approximately 50% within the next ten years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, understanding the pathogenesis of osteoporosis is an urgent matter to develop better treatments for this debilitating disease.</p><p>Bone remodeling is carried out by the coordinated actions of the bone-forming osteoblasts (OBs) and the bone-resorbing osteoclasts (OCs). Disorders of skeletal deficiency such as osteoporosis are typically characterized by enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption relative to bone formation, thereby resulting in net bone loss. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the pathological role of OCs, the molecular pathways that drive OC differentiation remains an area needing further investigation.</p><p>Regulators of G-protein Signaling (RGS) are a family comprised of more than thirty proteins that share the eponymous and functionally conserved RGS domain; these proteins play a classical role in attenuating G protein-coupled receptor signaling through its GTPase-accelerating protein activity to inactivate the Gα subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neubig and Siderovski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keinan, 2014</xref>). RGS proteins are multifunctional proteins that can contribute to various cellular processes including cell differentiation. Rgs12 is unique in that it is the largest protein in its family. In addition to the RGS domain, Rgs12 contains a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO1 (PDZ) domain, a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, a tandem Ras-binding domain (RBD1/2), and a GoLoco interaction motif. The multi-domain architecture of Rgs12 is thought to facilitate its role as a scaffolding protein in complexes in which multiple signaling pathways might converge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Snow et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sambi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Snow et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Willard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schiff et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced as a normal byproduct of cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Callaway and Jiang, 2015</xref>) and forms the basis Denham Harman’s free radical theory of aging, which perhaps is the most enduring model of aging. The theory of aging postulates that the gradual accumulation of damage inflicted by ROS eventually manifests as degenerative diseases associated with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harman, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krause, 2007</xref>). In addition to longevity, ROS have been implicated in the management and prevention of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, macular degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease, arthritis, and many other tissues—to which the bone is no exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Naka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Domazetovic et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>More recent studies have shown that RANKL-induced ROS are indispensable for OC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Callaway and Jiang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartell et al., 2014</xref>). ROS at high levels induce oxidative stress, which if left unchecked becomes deleterious to cell. At low concentrations, however, ROS have been shown to participate in signaling events in OCs, including the RANKL-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ), nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] oscillations; all of which contribute to the activation of nuclear factor of T-cells (NFAT), the master regulator of OC differentiation. Multiple lines of evidence have consistently shown that suppression of ROS by various means could inhibit OC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartell et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, RANKL-dependent activation of PLCγ, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] oscillations, and NFAT were abrogated when OC precursors were treated with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, our previous studies demonstrated that Rgs12 silencing could inhibit PLCγ activation, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] oscillations, and the expression of NFATc1 and its downstream factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang and Li, 2007</xref>). Hence, these findings led us to hypothesize that Rgs12 may play a role in regulating the cellular redox state, thereby controlling OC differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Targeted deletion of Rgs12 selectively reduced osteoclast formation and increased trabecular bone mass</title><p>To assess the role of Rgs12 in OC differentiation and bone remodeling in vivo, we generated a conditional gene knockout mouse model by crossing <italic>Rgs12<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice with Lysozyme M-cre (LyzM<sup>Cre</sup>) transgenic mice (Rgs12 cKO).

Furthermore, a dynamic histomorphometric analysis by double calcein labeling to measure bone growth over time shows that the rate of bone formation was comparable between Rgs12 cKO and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N–P</xref>). Consequently, the results collectively support the specific role of Rgs12 in OCs and emphasizes the gene’s importance in bone remodeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rgs12 promotes osteoclast formation and bone resorptive activity</title><p>To further evaluate the role of Rgs12 in osteoclastogenesis, OC precursors isolated from wild-type mice (<italic>Rgs12<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) were differentiated using macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), the two cytokines necessary and sufficient to induce osteoclast formation. Rgs12 protein and transcript levels were dramatically upregulated upon stimulation by the differentiation factors, and seem to consistently increase into OC maturity at day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). A comparison of osteoclastogenic potential between precursors derived from Rgs12 cKO and control mice show that while control BMMs differentiated into large, TRAP<sup>+</sup> multinucleated OCs, Rgs12-deficient precursor cells showed a reduction in the number of OCs containing 6–9 nuclei and 10+ nuclei, which were also visibly smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). We also probed into the overall bone resorptive activity and found that Rgs12-deficient OCs have significantly reduced ability to resorb calcium phosphate surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). Complementing our Rgs12 knockout model, we generated an Rgs12 overexpression OC model in which the transformed murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells were stably-transfected with a vector carrying a recombinant N-terminus FLAG-tagged Rgs12 gene (Flag-Rgs12). Rgs12 overexpression in RAW264.7 cells was confirmed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Using this cell model, we next determined whether Rgs12 overexpression could promote OC formation. Contrasting our findings in Rgs12 cKO primary cells, we found that the overexpression of Rgs12 in RAW264.7 cells led to an increased number of OCs with 10+ nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>). We also observed significantly decreased numbers of smaller OCs containing 3–5 and 6–9 nuclei in Rgs12 overexpressing cells, presumably because most of the smaller OCs have fused to form large OCs containing 10+ nuclei. A previous study investigating the relationship between OC size and state of resorptive activity found that a greater proportion of large OCs were active whereas non-resorbing OCs were on average smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lees et al., 2001</xref>). In our study, the quantification of the mean areas of OCs with 10+ nuclei revealed that Rgs12-overexpressing OCs were significantly larger as compared to empty vector-transfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). To determine whether increased OC size translated to increased bone resorptive activity in our study, RAW264.7 cells were similarly cultured on calcium phosphate surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–L</xref>). Consistent with our overall findings, ectopic overexpression of Rgs12 in OCs potently increased bone resorption activity. Our findings therefore demonstrate the importance of Rgs12 in promoting OC formation and activity, which is consistent with the osteopetrotic phenotype observed in the Rgs12-deficient mouse model.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42951.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Rgs12 is essential for osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rgs12 protein and (<bold>B</bold>) mRNA expression in wild-type BMMs stimulated with M-CSF and RANKL for the indicated times.

To determine the biological significance of these altered proteins, we performed gene ontology analysis to identify the canonical pathways involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Classically processes related to OC differentiation (e.g. ‘NFAT Signaling’, ‘RANK Signaling in OCs’, and ‘Role of OCs in Rheumatoid Arthritis’) were enriched at 3 and 5 days of OC differentiation. Closer inspection showed that OC marker proteins including metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp9), TRAP, ATPase H<sup>+</sup> transporting V0 subunit D2 (Atp6v0d2), and integrin β3 (Itgb3) were significantly downregulated in Rgs12 cKO OCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Additionally, the analysis revealed several biological functions related to ROS homeostasis that were impacted by Rgs12 deletion (e.g. ‘Production of ROS’, ‘Superoxide Radical Degradation’, and NRF2-mediated Stress Response’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Inspection of the proteins involved in these pathways showed a significant upregulation of numerous Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzymes responsible attenuating oxidative stress, including: peroxiredoxin 1/4 (Prdx1/4), thioredoxin 1/2 (Trxr1), glutathione reductase (Gshr), and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (Nqo1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Upstream regulator (transcription factor) analysis by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software function identified that the antioxidant enzymes upregulated in Rgs12 cKO OCs share the common upstream regulator Nrf2, a key transcription factor that regulates cellular redox balance through the expression of protective antioxidant and phase II detoxification proteins.

Similar to tBHQ, preventing Nrf2 degradation using the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 caused Nrf2 protein to substantially accumulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, left panel). Interestingly, when Nrf2 protein levels were artificially induced, we observed the presence of a lower molecular weight band, which could correspond to a different post-translational modification state (e.g. unphosphorylated or non-ubiquitinated). Furthermore, we did not observe any changes in Keap1 protein levels. In the previous scenario wherein Rgs12 overexpression could still promote Nrf2 degradation in spite of tBHQ treatment, this was not the case when using MG-132. In fact, inhibiting the proteasome was able to reverse the ability of Rgs12 to promote Nrf2 degradation, indicating the requirement for Rgs12 in the proteasome’s function.

To discover the cellular function of Rgs12 in OCs, we employed a robust and high-throughput quantitative proteomics approach to characterize the global protein changes of OCs derived from Rgs12 cKO and cKO BMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The analysis revealed that most perturbations to the proteome was related to day 3 and 5 of OC differentiation, which coincides with the timing of Rgs12 upregulation in wild-type OCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). This overlap suggests that Rgs12 may be more important to later phases of OC differentiation, including cell-cell fusion and bone resorption. The analysis also identified the upregulation of a collection of antioxidant enzymes that are all transcriptionally regulated by the antioxidant response element (ARE) within the promoter region, which is activated by the transcription factor Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>). While the upregulation of these genes would lead one to surmise that Nrf2 should be similarly increased, the transcription factor was not detected in the proteomics analysis, which is likely result of technical limitations inherent to current LC-MS capabilities. It was previously reported that transcription factor protein levels are notoriously difficult to obtain due to many having relatively low expression levels that are generally below current mass spectrometer detection limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Simicevic and Deplancke, 2017</xref>). The quantitation of transcription factors typically entails an upstream enrichment/separation step before LC-MS analysis. Therefore, the absence of Nrf2 in our proteomics analysis is not an unusual happenstance from a technical standpoint. Alternatively, we confirmed our proteomics findings by showing increased Nrf2 protein levels and nuclear translocation activity in Rgs12-deficient osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>).</p><p>Based on our preliminary evidence, we further investigated the role of Rgs12 in Nrf2 signaling and found that Nrf2 protein levels and nuclear translocation were increased in OC precursors in which Rgs12 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Because our data showed that Rgs12 deficiency upregulated Nrf2, we expected that Keap1 levels should be reduced in order to facilitate the increased Nrf2 activity. On the contrary, Keap1 levels were upregulated in Rgs12-deficient cells, to which we speculate that Rgs12-deficient cells may be overcompensating Keap1 expression in order to rein back the increased Nrf2 activity. Nevertheless, consistent with the upregulation of Nrf2 and its corresponding antioxidant enzymes, the RANKL-dependent induction of ROS was attenuated in Rgs12-deficient cells. Through an orthogonal approach, we demonstrated that Rgs12 overexpression in OC precursors could also enhance RANKL-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and NFκB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which are established to be dependent on ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hyeon et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of intracellular ROS blocked the effect of Rgs12 overexpression, indicating that Rgs12 promotes RANKL-dependent signaling by facilitating ROS production. Overall, the data collectively demonstrate that Rgs12 promotes osteoclastogenesis by facilitating ROS generation through the suppression of Nrf2 and its target antioxidant genes.</p><p>The transcription factor Nrf2 is constitutively expressed but its activity is inhibited through its interaction with Keap1. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is restricted to the cytoplasm where it is continually depleted through the proteosomal degradation pathway. When bound to Nrf2, Keap1 recruits the cullin 3 (Cul3)-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which ubiquitinates and targets Nrf2 for degradation by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang and Hannink, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Itoh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nguyen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McMahon et al., 2003</xref>). Keap1 protein contains multiple reactive cysteine residues that serve as redox sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abiko et al., 2011</xref>) that are sensitive to stressor conditions including oxidative stress causes the electrophilic modification of Keap1, inducing conformational changes, causing the protein to dissociate from Nrf2 and thereby allowing the transcription factor to enter the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stewart et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore determined how Rgs12 regulates this well-defined mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). tBHQ is a selective inhibitor of Keap1 activity by covalently binding the protein’s reactive thiols and as a result activate Nrf2 and its downstream proteins in RAW264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abiko et al., 2011</xref>). tBHQ was also previously shown to inhibit OC differentiation via the upregulation of heme oxygenase-1, a Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamaguchi et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we determined whether Rgs12 could suppress the tBHQ-dependent upregulation of Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We reasoned that if Rgs12 relies on a Keap1-dependent mechanism, then the inhibition of Keap1 by tBHQ should prevent the ability of Rgs12 to suppress Nrf2. However, we observed that Rgs12 was still able to suppress Nrf2 despite the pharmacological blockade of Keap1 activity, thereby indicating that Rgs12 functions downstream of Keap1.</p><p>Following Keap1-mediated ubiquitination of Nrf2, the targeted protein should be degraded by the proteasome. Again, we reasoned that if Rgs12 is dependent on the proteasomal degradation pathway, then inhibition of this pathway using the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 should prevent Rgs12-mediated suppression of Nrf2. Indeed, we found that Inhibiting the proteasome was able to reverse the Rgs12-mediated degradation of Nrf2, which places Rgs12 in between Keap1 and the proteasome in the Nrf2 degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>). Thus, Rgs12 could either regulate the Cul3-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to facilitate the ubiquitination of Nrf2, or directly control proteasome activity. While Keap1 certainly plays a canonical role in Nrf2 suppression, the evidence herein suggest that Keap1 is not involved in the Rgs12 function.</p><p>It is also interesting to note that NFκB activation is also dependent on the proteasomal degradation of inhibitor of κB (IκB), which otherwise sequesters NFκB to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyce et al., 2015</xref>). If Rgs12 could modulate proteasome activity, it is possible that Rgs12 could directly promote NFκB by facilitating the degradation of IκB. However, the fact that antioxidant treatment to suppress ROS could almost completely block the phosphorylation of NFκB points to an important involvement of ROS, and not just simply the proteasomal degradation of IκB in NFκB activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Nonetheless, this potential crosstalk between the NFκB and Nrf2 pathways will need to be evaluated in future studies.</p><p>ROS is an inevitable byproduct of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (oxidative phosphorylation, OXPHOS) during ATP synthesis. Microscopy analyses have noted the high abundance of mitochondria in osteoclasts as early as 1961 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gonzales, 1961</xref>), but interest in the metabolic profile that supports OC differentiation has made a resurgence in recent years. As examples, we and others through the proteomic study of OCs have reported that proteins involved in ATP synthesis were elevated in mature osteoclasts as compared to precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">An et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ng et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, it was demonstrated that mature OCs exhibit larger mitochondria, higher levels of enzymes of the electron transport chain, and higher oxygen consumption rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lemma et al., 2016</xref>). The evidence collectively point towards OXPHOS as a main bioenergetic source for osteoclast differentiation, and can therefore be considered an integral aspect of the process. As a consequence of increased mitochondrial biogenesis, ROS would similarly be elevated due to the ‘leakiness’ of the electron transport chain, which in turn contributes to the ROS that promotes OC differentiation. As such, an increase in ROS has been associated with mitochondria biogenesis in osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2009</xref>), and mitochondrial ROS is essential for osteoclast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartell et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the analysis of OXPHOS and glycolytic patterns should not be discounted in a study that focuses on redox biology. To address this concern, we evaluated the molecular subsets in the proteome involved in the energy metabolism pathways including glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and OXPHOS pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>The loss of Rgs12 in BMMs led to the inhibition of RANKL-dependent ROS, which we demonstrated was a function of increased Nrf2 activity and elevated levels of its target antioxidant enzymes. At the same time, the proteomics analysis identified a reduction of proteins involved in the TCA cycle and OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). Interestingly, cytochrome b5 type A (CYB5A) was against the general trend and was significantly increased by ~30% in Rgs12-deficient BMMs. The TCA cycle is responsible for the consumption of acetyl-CoA to generate NADH which is fed into the OXPHOS pathway to power ATP synthase and catalyze the formation of ATP. The impediment of OXPHOS, which requires molecular oxygen as co-factor, can shift ATP production towards anaerobic glycolysis under hypoxic and other conditions. However, the proteomic analysis revealed that protein levels of phosphofructokinase (PFK), the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, were unaffected by Rgs12 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). In fact, all enzymes we detected that are involved in the glycolytic pathway with the exception of enolase 3 (a.k.a. phosphopyruvate hydratase) were unaffected by the loss of Rgs12.</p><p>On one hand, the loss of Rgs12 was associated with reduced OXPHOS, which would theoretically contribute to lower ROS levels. Conversely, the inhibition of OC differentiation could lead to reduced mitochondrial biogenesis, which could also explain lowered ROS levels in Rgs12-deficient BMMs. Therefore, mitochondrial ROS could be a contributing factor in Rgs12 function—albeit likely as a secondary effect. Although OXPHOS enzymes were reduced in Rgs12-deficient osteoclasts, only 19/83 proteins identified (22.9%) were altered, as compared to 26/26 proteins (100%) identified as Nrf2 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). Additionally, the magnitude of protein expression fold-changes was markedly higher in Nrf2 response genes as compared to OXPHOS genes. Therefore, the higher degree of intra-group concordance and magnitude of expression of Nrf2 genes both indicate a more targeted response, whereas the weak pattern of expression of OXPHOS genes suggests an equivocal effect. Secondly, Nrf2 antioxidant proteins act downstream of mitochondrial ROS formation by acting directly on ROS. This effect is best exemplified by the fact that the ectopic expression of mitochondria-targeted catalase was able to suppress ROS and inhibit OC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartell et al., 2014</xref>). In the case of Rgs12 overexpression, it could be expected that increased mitochondrial ROS production would also need the concomitant suppression of Nrf2 to raise the overall intracellular ROS level. In the current work, we demonstrate that Rgs12 could promote Nrf2 degradation. Therefore, the inhibition of RANKL-dependent ROS associated with loss of Rgs12 was unlikely to be the direct result of glycolytic shift or reduced OXPHOS. While changes in mitochondrial ROS could be an minor aspect of Rgs12 function, but Nrf2 remains an essential component in the overall scheme.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified a new gene that could modulate the Nrf2-proteasome axis, which forms the crux of redox homeostasis in many biological contexts. Our study also points to a novel role of Rgs12 in OC redox biology, thus forming the molecular basis for developing therapies to modulate ROS for osteoporosis and other diseases of bone loss. Outside of its role in bone homeostasis, Rgs12 has also been shown to hold diverse and significant roles in other clinical contexts including pathological cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), tumor suppression in African American prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), and psychostimulant-induced increases in dopamine levels in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gross et al., 2018</xref>). We speculate that the ability of Rgs12 to regulate Nrf2 could be an important clue to better understand the role of Rgs12 in the context of cardiac disease and tumorigenesis, in which ROS is known to have significant implications. Therefore, our research would have widespread appeal to audiences of different research backgrounds.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or<break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Rgs12<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2013</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>LyzM<sup>Cre</sup></italic></td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock #: 018956</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Rgs12</italic> cDNA</td><td>This paper</td><td>NCBI: NM_173402.2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>RAW264.7</td><td>American Type Culture Collection</td><td>Cat. #: TIB-71</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>CMG14-12</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10934646">10934646</ext-link></td><td/><td>Dr. Sunao Takeshita (Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan) <break/>Cell line used to produce M-CSF-containing supernatant.</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>Modified Origami B(DE3)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2016a</xref></td><td/><td>Dr. Ding Xu (University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA).

The proteomic analysis of Rgs12-deficient OCs identified novel peptides and upregulation of antioxidant enzymes under the transcriptional regulation of Nrf2 and is another strong component of the manuscript. Conversely, by showing that Rgs12 overexpression suppressed Nrf2 through a mechanism dependent on the 26S proteasome and promoted RANKL-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and NFκB, a putative mechanism for the in vivo effects has been provided.</p><p>Nevertheless, there were four major concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>First, the authors need to demonstrate in vitro functional activities of the osteoclast including resorption on dentin; this would further strengthen their argument of a major osteoclast defect as the cause of high bone mass with Rgs12 deletion.</p><p>Second, dynamic histomorphometry from tibia/femur and or vertebrae is essential to support the in vivo mechanisms proposed in the paper.</p><p>Third, further in vitro studies are needed in order to determine the differential response of bone marrow cells to mCSF and RANKL for levels of Rgs12 mRNA and protein compared to cultures treated with M-CSF alone.</p><p>Finally, no experiments were performed to test whether the altered Nrf2 levels cause the phenotype induced by Rgs12 deletion: these need to be done.</p><p>In addition, some consideration should be included about the effects of excess ROS on the metabolic program of the osteoclast.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript reports that deletion of Rgs12 in vivo increased bone mass and in vitro decreased osteoclastogenesis and ROS production and increased Nrf2 protein level and Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzymes.</p><p>1) The major conclusion of the paper, that Rgs12 deletion decreases osteoclast formation, needs to be tested in vivo by reporting quantitation of osteoclast and osteoblast numbers and activity in the histology shown in Figure 1C. The in vivo data also lacks an important control (LysM-cre;Rgs12+/+ mice) because cre expression can cause effects on bone phenotype even without the presence of a floxxed allele. The in vitro data also needs to be strengthened by measuring osteoclast activity (pit formation) rather than relying on osteoclast number and size.</p><p>2) The effects of Rgs12 deletion and overexpression on Rgs12 protein levels appear to be quite modest and not observable in the western blots, and their quantitation by densitometry is unlikely to be sensitive enough to reliably detect the small differences, which, even if true, are unlikely to be sufficient to have a major effect on the cellular phenotype. Moreover, no experiments were performed to test whether the altered Nrf2 levels cause the phenotype induced by Rgs12 deletion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, using the LysM-Cre transgenic line or overexpressing the gene in RAW264.7 cells, Ng et al. showed that Rgs12 deletion led to increased bone mass whereas its overexpression increased OC number and size. Proteomic analysis of Rgs12-deficient OCs identified an upregulation of antioxidant enzymes under the transcriptional regulation of Nrf2, the master regulator of oxidative stress. They confirmed an increase of Nrf2 activity and impaired production of ROS in Rgs12- deficient cells. Conversely, Rgs12 overexpression suppressed Nrf2 through a mechanism dependent on the 26S proteasome, and promoted RANKL-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and NFκB, which was abrogated by antioxidant treatment. In sum, the authors demonstrated a potentially novel upstream network for regulating osteoclastogenesis via the ROS pathway.</p><p>The authors have provided more insights into the role ROS plays in regulating osteoclastogenesis, clearly an important pathway in the differentiation process. The paper is well written and there is some novelty particularly in the mechanism through which Rgs12 mediates suppression of Nrf2 and that in turn, down regulates ROS via anti-oxidant factors. There are however some concerns (labelled 1-6) which are major and must be addressed; even though enthusiasm is moderate, more work is required to firmly establish the role of Rgs12 in osteoclast differentiation.</p><p>1) The mechanism underlying attenuated osteoclastogenesis in the Rgs12 deletion model is presumed to be an upregulation of the Nrf2 anti-oxidant system. Yet it is unclear why Keap1 levels are high in the Rgs12 null cells particularly since Keap1 sequesters Nrf2 and prevents its action. A more comprehensive approach to understanding that feature beyond a theoretical compensatory response is needed to fully delineate the pathway's importance for osteoclastogenesis.</p><p>2) On a similar note, it is unclear why Nrf2 protein levels are not increased in the proteomic analysis of the Rgs12 deleted cells, particularly since the downstream anti-oxidant proteins are increased, one would have expected those changes. Did the authors measure Nrf2 protein by WB in the Rgs12 null osteoclasts?</p><p>3) The conditional deletion by LysMCre of Rgs12 led to high bone mass and presumed osteoclast dysfunction. The BMM cells during differentiation showed less nuclei and lower number of OCs; however the authors did not perform studies on the functional significance of this osteoclast phenotype; did the osteoclasts from the LysMCre mice resorb less bone in vitro i.e. on a bone matrix?</p><p>4) In that same vein, there was no dynamic histomorphometry studies to assess the etiology of the high bone mass. An obvious conclusion would be that there is less resorption. However it would be important to have measured eroded surface, bone formation rates and other parameters that could be responsible for the high bone mass in the LysMCre Rgs12 deficient mice. Nor it should be noted were osteoclast numbers counted by static measurements. This needs clarification particularly if osteoclast number remained the same in the Rgs12 null mice, but the cells were not functional (less nuclei) and clastokines were still being released to stimulate osteoblasts as in the catK ko mice. Clearly more insight into the in vivo phenotype would have been preferable. Similarly, resorption markers and/or an OVX experiment would have also been useful.</p><p>5) The proteomic analysis of the Rgs12 deficient osteoclasts revealed a shift toward more glycolytic pathways. This would be consistent with less ROS generation; but is it that shift that directly impairs osteoclast function? In other words, when osteoclasts become glycolytic, the cells cannot fuse or resorb bone? It is disappointing that the authors did not examine OxPhos and glycolytic patterns during OC differentiation in these cells to complete the characterization of their metabolic programs.

They find that targeted deletion of Rgs12 in myeloid cells produces a phenotype in mice of increased bone mass. In vitro studies of BMMs demonstrates that Rgs12 deletion decreased the number of osteoclasts that formed in vitro with 6 or greater nuclei with no effect on the number of osteoclasts that had 3 to 5 nuclei. Conversely, overexpression of Rgs12 in RAW264.7 cells increased the overall size of osteoclasts that formed in vitro and the number of osteoclasts with greater than 10 nuclei. Overexpression of Rgs12 also decreased the number of osteoclasts that had less than 10 nuclei in the RAW cell cultures.</p><p>Proteomic analysis identified Nrf2-mediated stress responses as potentially mediating the effects of Rgs12 deletion on osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Consequently, the authors studied the role that Rgs12 had in mediating responses of Nrf2 in osteoclasts. They found that deletion of Rgs12 increased levels of the transcription factor Nrf2, which is induced by oxidative stress, and its regulatory protein Keap1 in BMMs that were induced to form osteoclasts with RANKL. RANKL also increased the nuclear localization of Nrf2 in Rgs12-deleted cells, which is consistent with the decrease in osteoclastogenesis seen in Rgs12-deleted BMM cultures, since Nrf2 activation is known to inhibit osteoclast formation. RANKL did not stimulate oxidative stress in Rgs12-deleted BMM cultures, implying that the increased levels of Nrf2 stimulated an antioxidant pathway to reduce ROS levels.</p><p>Overexpression of Rgs12 in RAW cells reduced the ability of a Keap2 inhibitor (tBHQ) to induce Nrf2. To better understand how this might be occurring the authors examined the effects that the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, had on Nrf2 levels in RAW cells in the presence or absence of Rgs12 overexpression. They found that in the absence of proteasome degradation, overexpression of Rgs12 did not inhibit Nrf2 protein levels but rather enhanced them suggesting that Rgs12 regulates interactions of the proteasome degradation pathway with Nrf2.</p><p>Finally, the authors demonstrated that pretreating RAW cells, which overexpressed Rgs12, with an antioxidant (to decrease ROS) inhibited ERK and NF-κB activation by RANKL. They conclude that this data implies that Rgs12 promotes ROS production as one mechanism for its ability to stimulate osteoclast formation and function.</p><p>This is a complex subject and the authors have attempted a variety of investigations to support their conclusions. In general, they have been successful but there are several criticisms that they need to address.</p><p>1) The in vivo model of targeted deletion of Rgs12 in myeloid cells is lacking any evidence that this manipulation resulted in a decrease in osteoclast number or function in the mice. The authors need to perform histomorphometric studies to confirm that the increase in bone mass that they find with targeted Rgs12 deletion is associated with a decrease in osteoclast number, size or erosion surface. Studies of osteoblasts and bone formation rate are also needed.</p><p>2) What is the effect of 1 to 5 days of RANKL treatment on levels of Rgs12 mRNA and protein in BMM cultures compared to cultures treated with M-CSF alone? This is a fundamental experiment that the authors do not present. Are levels increased, unchanged or decreased by RANKL? The authors seem to be arguing that RANKL increases Rgs12 levels since overexpression of this protein enhanced and deletion decreased RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis.

An in-depth search of publications did not yield any reports of skeletal defects associated with the LysM-Cre transgenic line. Moreover, many published work using the LysM-Cre system also use floxed mice as control, and did not include the LysM-Cre;gene<sup>+/+</sup> control.<sup>9-14</sup> Therefore, it unlikely that LysM-Cre has a significant impact on the skeletal phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The effects of Rgs12 deletion and overexpression on Rgs12 protein levels appear to be quite modest and not observable in the western blots, and their quantitation by densitometry is unlikely to be sensitive enough to reliably detect the small differences, which, even if true, are unlikely to be sufficient to have a major effect on the cellular phenotype. Moreover, no experiments were performed to test whether the altered Nrf2 levels cause the phenotype induced by Rgs12 deletion.</p></disp-quote><p>The deletion of Rgs12 in LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> BMMs resulted in approximately 70% reduction of Rgs12 transcript levels as measured by qPCR (Figure 1B). Additionally, the ectopic expression of Rgs12 in RAW264.7 cells led to an approximately doubled Rgs12 protein levels as measured by western blotting (Figure 2C).</p><p>The role of Nrf2 in osteoclasts and bone biology has been previously reported and is consistent with the findings reported in the current study. In osteoclasts, ROS is conducive towards its formation and bone resorption whereas antioxidants are inhibitory. Therefore, it should be expected that elevated Nrf2 activity and increased expression of antioxidant enzymes, as observed in Rgs12<sup>–/–</sup> mice, would suppress osteoclast differentiation. Conversely, reduced Nrf2 activity should promote osteoclastogenesis. Supporting this idea, global Nrf2 knockout mice showed increased osteoclast numbers in distal femurs and increased osteoclast surface in lumbar vertebrae.<sup>15</sup> Furthermore, Nrf2<sup>–/–</sup> mice have reduced trabecular and cortical bone, along with a reduction in bone mechanical strength, although this may likely be attributed to reduced bone mineralization and formation by osteoblasts.<sup>15-17</sup> As a confounding factor, Nrf2<sup>–/–</sup> osteoblasts also have increased RANKL expression, thereby indirectly promoting osteoclast formation in Nrf2 global knockout mice.<sup>18</sup> However, the direct role of Nrf2 in osteoclasts has been demonstrated. It was shown that RANKL stimulation of RAW264.7 cells lowers their Nrf2/Keap1 ratio and leads to a decrease in the expression of antioxidant response element (ARE) genes, whereas Nrf2 overexpression elevates antioxidant expression and suppresses osteoclast differentiation.<sup>19-21</sup> Importantly, Nrf2 deficiency in osteoclasts promotes the RANKL-induced activation of MAPKs, c-Fos, and the subsequent induction of NFATc1.<sup>21</sup> Therefore, it is clear that Nrf2 has a direct effect on osteoclasts. Whereas Nrf2 deficiencycontributes to heightened osteoclastic formation and a net bone loss phenotype,<sup>15,18</sup> we observe the exact opposite in Rgs12 conditional knockout mice wherein Nrf2 activity was elevated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The paper is well written and there is some novelty particularly in the mechanism through which Rgs12 mediates suppression of Nrf2 and that in turn, down regulates ROS via anti-oxidant factors. There are however some concerns (labelled 1-6) which are major and must be addressed; even though enthusiasm is moderate, more work is required to firmly establish the role of Rgs12 in osteoclast differentiation.</p><p>1) The mechanism underlying attenuated osteoclastogenesis in the Rgs12 deletion model is presumed to be an upregulation of the Nrf2 anti-oxidant system. Yet it is unclear why Keap1 levels are high in the Rgs12 null cells particularly since Keap1 sequesters Nrf2 and prevents its action. A more comprehensive approach to understanding that feature beyond a theoretical compensatory response is needed to fully delineate the pathway's importance for osteoclastogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Keap1 plays an important role for maintaining Nrf2 at low levels by acting as an adaptor protein for the Cullin-3-based ubiquitin E3 ligase, which mediates Nrf2 degradation via the 26S proteasome. While Keap1 levels appear to be elevated in Rgs12-deficient BMMs (Figure 4A, B), we also found that the Rgs12-mediated degradation of Nrf2 is independent of Keap1 function (Figure 5B, C). tBHQ (<italic>tert</italic>-butylhydroquinone) is a selective inhibitor of Keap1 and was shown to directly covalently modify cysteine residues on Keap1 to inhibit its activity,<sup>22</sup> but it was unable to block Rgs12-mediated degradation of Nrf2. We subsequently showed that Rgs12 is likely to regulate the interactions of the proteasome degradation pathway with Nrf2. Therefore, while Keap1 certainly plays a canonical role in Nrf2 suppression, the evidence suggests that Keap1 is not involved in the Rgs12 function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) On a similar note, it is unclear why Nrf2 protein levels are not increased in the proteomic analysis of the Rgs12 deleted cells, particularly since the downstream anti-oxidant proteins are increased, one would have expected those changes. Did the authors measure Nrf2 protein by WB in the Rgs12 null osteoclasts?</p></disp-quote><p>The upregulation of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzymes certainly points toward increased Nrf2 protein levels. However, the transcription factor was not detected in the proteomics analysis, which is likely a result of technical factors inherent to current LC-MS capabilities. It was previously reported that transcription factor protein levels are notoriously difficult to obtain due to many having relatively low expression levels that are generally below current mass spectrometer detection limits.<sup>23</sup> The quantitation of transcription factors typically entails an upstream enrichment/separation step before LC-MS analysis. Therefore, the absence of Nrf2 in our proteomics analysis is not an unusual happenstance from a technical standpoint. Alternatively, we confirmed our proteomics findings by showing increased Nrf2 protein levels and nuclear translocation activity in Rgs12-deficient osteoclasts (Figure 4A-C)</p><p>Technical reasons that could explain why Nrf2 was not detected in the LC-MS analysis as described above was added to the Discussions section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The conditional deletion by LysMCre of Rgs12 led to high bone mass and presumed osteoclast dysfunction. The BMM cells during differentiation showed less nuclei and lower number of OCs; however the authors did not perform studies on the functional significance of this osteoclast phenotype; did the osteoclasts from the LysMCre mice resorb less bone in vitro i.e. on a bone matrix?</p></disp-quote><p>We assessed the effects of Rgs12 deletion on osteoclastic bone resorption.

An obvious conclusion would be that there is less resorption. However it would be important to have measured eroded surface, bone formation rates and other parameters that could be responsible for the high bone mass in the LysMCre Rgs12 deficient mice. Nor it should be noted were osteoclast numbers counted by static measurements. This needs clarification particularly if osteoclast number remained the same in the Rgs12 null mice, but the cells were not functional (less nuclei) and clastokines were still being released to stimulate osteoblasts as in the catK ko m. Clearly more insight into the in vivo phenotype would have been preferable. Similarly, resorption markers and/or an OVX experiment would have also been useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this issue by measuring the rate of bone formation by dynamic histomorphometric analysis. 12 week-old Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> and LysM;Rgs12<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice will be given two doses of calcein label 5-7 days apart, by intraperitoneal injection.

However, as with any study using small-molecule inhibitors, off-target effects are a reasonable concern. To the point of whether NAC has other functions outside of its antioxidant role, recent findings have shown that it could directly antagonize the activity of proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, lactacystin, and MG132).<sup>29,30</sup> This would of course have significant implications in proteasome-dependent proteins such as NFκB (via IκBα degradation) and Nrf2—<italic>if</italic> NAC was used together with proteasome inhibitors.
