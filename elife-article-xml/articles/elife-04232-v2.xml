are displayed on parasite-infected human erythrocytes. We recently reported that rodent malaria parasites infect erythroblasts that express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens, which are recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contributes to the protection of mice against blood-stage malaria in a Fas ligand (FasL)-dependent manner. Erythroblasts infected with malarial parasites express the death receptor Fas. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells induce the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the infected erythroblasts in a cell-to-cell contact-dependent manner. PS enhances the engulfment of the infected erythroid cells by phagocytes. As a PS receptor, T-cell immunoglobulin-domain and mucin-domain-containing molecule 4 (Tim-4) contributes to the phagocytosis of malaria-parasite-infected cells. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective immunity exerted by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in collaboration with phagocytes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04232.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04232.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04232.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system consists of several different types of cell that work together to prevent infection and disease. For example, immune cells called cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells kill tumor cells or other cells that are infected. To do so, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells must recognize certain molecules on the surface of the tumor or infected cells and bind to them.</p><p>Malaria is an infectious disease caused by the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite, which is transferred between individuals by mosquitoes. The parasite is able to evade the immune system—so much so that it is not well understood how the immune system tries to respond to stop the infection. This has made it difficult to develop a vaccine that protects against malaria.</p><p>During the latter stages of a malaria infection, the parasite infects the host's red blood cells. It was long believed that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells did not help to eliminate the red blood cells that had been infected by <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. However, recent work in mice suggested that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells do respond to infected erythroblasts—precursor cells that develop into red blood cells—and that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells help protect mice against blood-stage malaria.</p><p>Now, Imai et al. describe how the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in mice help to kill erythroblasts infected with <italic>Plasmodium yoelli</italic>, a species of the parasite used to study malaria in mice. The infected cells display a protein called Fas on their surface. Imai et al. found that, during a malaria infection, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells produce a protein that can interact with Fas. This interaction causes the infected cell to move a signaling molecule to its outside surface, which encourages another type of immune cell to engulf and destroy the infected cell. This knowledge of how CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells fight <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites in the bloodstream could now help to develop new types of blood-stage vaccine for malaria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04232.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04232.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>erythroblast</kwd><kwd>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grants in Aid 24117504</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hisaeda</surname><given-names>Hajime</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grants in Aid 24790399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imai</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grants in Aid 26860276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imai</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Promotion of Science and Technology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hisaeda</surname><given-names>Hajime</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003478</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H24-Shitei-004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hisaeda</surname><given-names>Hajime</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Takeda Memorial Foundation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hisaeda</surname><given-names>Hajime</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cytotoxicity exerted by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells against parasitized erythroblasts helps to protect against blood-stage malaria by making parasitized cells susceptible to phagocytosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria is one of the world's three major infectious diseases, together with AIDS and tuberculosis, accounting for approximately 200 million cases annually, with 600,000 deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Snow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murray et al., 2012</xref>). With the spread of drug-resistant parasites and the lack of effective vaccines, malaria is a serious global health problem, especially in developing countries. To develop malarial vaccines, it is necessary to understand the protective immune response against malaria. However, because the malaria parasite successfully evades the host immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hisaeda et al., 2004</xref>), it is difficult to identify the truly important immune responses, hindering the development of a malarial vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Good and Engwerda, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Antibodies play a major role in the protective immunity directed against the blood-stage malaria parasite. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to protection against blood-stage malaria though induction of antibody production and macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Good and Doolan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marsh and Kinyanjui, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jafarshad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Langhorne et al., 2008</xref>). However, the contribution of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to this protection remains controversial because there are no major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens on human erythrocytes infected with the malaria parasite. Some studies have shown that infection of BALB/c mice with non-lethal <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> was controlled even after depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells comparable to control mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vinetz et al., 1990</xref>). Moreover, MHC class I null mice (beta 2-microglobulin-deficient mice) recovered from infection with <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi</italic> AS or <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi adami</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van der Heyde et al., 1993b</xref>). Other studies have reported that depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> attenuated their protection, confirming the importance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suss et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Podoba and Stevenson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van der Heyde et al., 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horne-Debets et al., 2013</xref>). However, these studies did not show the effector mechanism of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells against blood-stage malaria protection.</p><p>We have conclusively demonstrated the protective roles of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells using prime–boost live vaccination with the non-lethal rodent parasite <italic>P. yoelii</italic> 17XNL (PyNL) against challenge with the lethal <italic>P. yoelii</italic> 17XL (PyL) strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Imai et al., 2010</xref>). The transfer of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice cured of PyNL infection into <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> or irradiated recipients, followed by two boosts with PyL, conferred protection against PyL. The major protective mechanism of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is the interferon γ (IFN-γ)-dependent activation of phagocytes, resulting in the enhanced phagocytosis of parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs). The cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also contributes to protecting the host against blood-stage malaria. However, the target cells of this cytotoxicity and how this cytotoxicity acts against blood-stage malaria are as yet unknown. Although recent reports have demonstrated that the human malaria parasites <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> parasitize erythroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ru et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tamez et al., 2009</xref>), the host response and protective immunity against these parasitized erythroblasts are unclear. We have reported that PyNL parasites also infect erythroblasts that express MHC class I molecules on their surfaces and that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells produce IFN-γ in response to parasitized erythroblasts in an antigen-specific manner. These results suggest that parasitized erythroblasts are the targets of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effector mechanism of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells against blood-stage malaria in detail. Splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activated during malaria express Fas ligand (FasL) and interact with Fas-expressing parasitized erythroblasts. As a result, phosphatidylserine (PS) is externalized to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, leading to enhanced phagocytosis of the parasitized cells. Thus, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing FasL contribute to the immune response to blood-stage malaria by making parasitized cells susceptible to phagocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells attenuates protection against blood-stage PyNL infection</title><p>C57BL/6 mice infected with PyNL exhibited peak parasitemia of up to 30% and recovered from the infection. However, those depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells showed significantly greater parasitemia and died from the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). BALB/c mice depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells showed similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells play an essential role in protecting mice against blood-stage malaria. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are known to be important in the protective immune response to blood-stage malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suss et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kumar et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Podoba and Stevenson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Good and Doolan, 1999</xref>), and we confirmed that CD4<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-depleted mice displayed greater parasitemia and a higher mortality rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, the course of infection clearly differed in CD8<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-depleted and CD4<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-depleted mice. Although mice depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells suffered from much greater parasitemia from the early phase to its peak, the survivors eliminated the parasites similar to the control mice, whereas the CD4<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-depleted survivors took longer to recover from infection. This suggests that CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have different effector mechanisms for parasite clearance, and that the protective immunity mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is important in controlling infection during the early phase, within the period of peak parasitemia. Therefore, the following analyses were conducted 7–8 days after infection, when the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells might be activated in response to the parasite, and 16–18 days after infection, when the parasites begin to be eliminated.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04232.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and FasL protect against infection with <italic>P. yoelii</italic> NL (PyNL).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Daily parasitemia and survival rates of C57BL/6 mice depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after infection with PyNL.

To investigate this possibility, FasL-mutant <italic>gld</italic> mice were infected with PyNL. The course of infection in the <italic>gld</italic> mice resembled that in mice depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, insofar as parasitemia was exacerbated before peak parasitemia and the survival rate was lower than in wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, FasL is important in controlling blood-stage malaria. Although we hypothesized that FasL expressed on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is crucial, the FasL expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">el-Khatib et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hahn et al., 1995</xref>) may also play a protective role. However, this is unlikely because infection did not increase the expression of FasL on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, in contrast to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To confirm these inferences, we used cell transfer experiments combined with a prime–boost live vaccination system in which CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from mice that had recovered from PyNL infection after two homologous boosts with PyL transferred protection from an otherwise lethal infection with PyL to the recipient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Imai et al., 2010</xref>). Mice that had received <italic>gld</italic> immune CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited higher parasitemia at an early stage of infection, and some of them failed to control the challenge infection and died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, left panel). In contrast, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from <italic>gld</italic> donors protected the recipients from challenge with PyL, similar to the protection afforded mice by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from WT donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, right panel). Therefore, FasL plays a crucial role in CD8<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-mediated protective immunity against blood-stage malaria.</p><p>To confirm the roles of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responsible for resistance, we excluded the possibility that contaminants in transferred cells play a role using <italic>Rag</italic>2<sup>−/−</sup> mice as recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells obtained from ‘immune’ CD45.1-bearing C57BL/6 mice could transfer protection to <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (CD45.2), although parasitemia was greater compared with when the irradiated mice were used as hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Imai et al., 2010</xref>). In such lymphopenic recipients, a very few cells proliferate intensively and acquire effector capacities. Thus, the homeostatic proliferation of contaminants other than CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was evaluated. The ratio of the contaminated CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in sorted CD8<sup>+</sup> cells used for the transfer was less than 0.1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). That in donor-derived CD45.1<sup>+</sup> cells recovered from the recipients did not exceed 0.8%, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells constantly occupied more than 96% even after infection with PyNL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). To further exclude the possibility, we determined how many CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are required to protect the recipient. The recipients transferred with 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could control the challenge infection, but those with 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Thus, 0.1% contaminated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells corresponding to 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> in transferred 10<sup>7</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells seem to have no protective ability. Based on these findings, we concluded that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are responsible for the transferred protection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Malaria-parasite-infected erythroblasts express Fas</title><p>We next examined the cell types targeted by FasL-dependent immunity. FasL interacts with Fas expressed on target cells, inducing the apoptosis of the Fas-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nagata and Golstein, 1995</xref>). Recently, erythroid cells have been reported to express Fas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Maria et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tsushima et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mandal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). Based on our previous finding that malaria parasites infect erythroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imai et al., 2013</xref>). We postulated that infected erythroid cells are the targets of FasL-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of Fas on infected erythroid cells in the spleens and peripheral blood of mice infected with PyNL–green fluorescent protein (GFP). Very few TER119<sup>+</sup> erythroid cells expressed Fas in the peripheral blood, even among the infected GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, a number of infected GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressing Fas were present in the spleen, and the frequency of those cells among the parasitized cells reached 50% before peak parasitemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). To identify the erythroid cells that express Fas in the spleen, we examined the expression of MHC class I molecules on the infected cells because erythroblasts are distinguished from reticulocytes and mature RBCs by their high-level expression of MHC class I antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imai et al., 2013</xref>). Almost all Fas-expressing cells, both infected and uninfected, were MHC class I<sup>hi</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that the infected Fas<sup>+</sup> cells were erythroblasts. As those cells present antigens in conjunction with MHC class I molecules and are recognized antigen-specifically by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imai et al., 2013</xref>), it is possible that FasL-bearing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells affect infected erythroblasts expressing Fas. Notably, the infection of erythroblasts with PyNL may induce their expression of Fas, because Fas<sup>−</sup> erythroblasts were markedly reduced in the infected cells relative to their numbers in uninfected cells (41% and 14%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, the intensity of Fas expression was much higher on parasitized erythroblasts than in uninfected erythroblasts.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04232.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fas is expressed on erythroid cells infected with PyNL.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spleen cells and peripheral blood cells obtained from mice infected with PyNL–GFP were stained with anti-TER119, anti-Fas, and anti-MHC class I antibodies.

CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells interact with infected erythroblasts and induce them to display PS in a FasL-dependent manner. In turn, PS exposure enhances the susceptibility of infected cells to phagocytosis, which contributes to the elimination of the parasite. Our proposal may resolve the controversial protective roles of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells against infected erythroid cells.</p><p>Vinetz et al. had reported that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are not contributed to protection against blood-stage murine malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vinetz et al., 1990</xref>). They used <italic>P. yoelii</italic> 17X clone 1.1, which results in an obviously different course of infection from ours. The PyNL clone that we used appears more virulent than the 17× clone 1.1 as judged by the higher peak parasitemia (30–40% vs 10%) and prolonged period for parasite elimination (30 days vs 15 days), suggesting that the difference in virulence may cause the different results when mice were depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>It is quite possible that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells target erythroblasts that strongly express MHC class I antigens. However, we previously reported the contribution of macrophages to CD8<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-mediated protection against malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Imai et al., 2010</xref>). Those findings, together with the present study, suggest that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells enhance not only the phagocytotic capacity of macrophages but also the susceptibility of infected erythroblasts to phagocytosis through their display of PS. Thus, this FasL-dependent effect of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells on infected erythroblasts might be essential for the protective immune response to blood-stage malaria by supporting enhanced phagocytosis. Thus, CD8<sup>+</sup> cells collaborate with macrophages to completely eradicate the parasites.</p><p>The CD8<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-mediated protection that targets parasitized erythroblasts may operate in the early phase of infection, as inferred from the course of infection in mice depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We have previously shown that the proportion of infected erythroblasts is constant during the course of infection, unlike the proportion of infected RBCs, which increases dramatically in the later stages of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imai et al., 2013</xref>). This means that there are relatively more infected erythroblasts in the early stage of infection. Therefore, the reduction of infected erythroblasts by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the early phase would efficiently control blood-stage malaria. From this perspective, this protective mechanism might effectively control malaria parasites in humans, in which parasitemia develops to a lower level than that observed in animal models. Indeed, parasitized erythroblasts were found within the bone marrow of patients with vivax malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ru et al., 2009</xref>), and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tamez et al., 2009</xref>) can infect erythroblasts in vitro. Therefore, these cells might be targets of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in humans. It will be very interesting to evaluate whether parasitized erythroblasts are phagocytosed in the human bone marrow or spleen (although this will be difficult to demonstrate experimentally).</p><p>Notably, we have demonstrated the expression of Fas on erythroblasts infected with the malaria parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). There are two possible explanations for the expression of Fas on infected erythroblasts. One is that the infection of Fas<sup>−</sup> erythroblasts with the malaria parasite induces the expression of Fas. Our findings support this because Fas<sup>−</sup> erythroblasts were markedly reduced in infected cells compared with their numbers in uninfected cells, indicating a transition from Fas<sup>−</sup> to Fas<sup>+</sup> cells upon infection. However, the precise mechanism of this induction of Fas remains to be clarified. The other possible explanation is that the malaria parasite infects Fas<sup>+</sup> erythroblasts. Erythroblasts are known to express Fas under physiological conditions, and Fas is considered to be involved in the negative regulation of erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Maria et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, uninfected Fas<sup>+</sup> erythroblasts were found in mice infected with PyNL. Activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing FasL might interact with uninfected erythroblasts expressing Fas and induce bystander cell damage during infection, and this system may underlie the pathogenicity of malarial anemia.</p><p>The Fas/FasL-dependent, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-induced PS externalization by parasitized erythroblasts required cell-to-cell contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Do CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contact their target cells in the spleen? As CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and erythroblasts occur in the splenic white pulp and red pulp, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mebius and Kraal, 2005</xref>), the opportunity for contact between them might be limited. However, infection with the malaria parasite changes the structure of the spleen and makes the white pulp indistinguishable from the red pulp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Del Portillo et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it is possible that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contact erythroblasts in the spleens of mice infected with PyNL. In vivo imaging would be useful in confirming this, because imaging has recently shown that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells accumulate in the liver after sporozoite infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimura et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We did not investigate whether erythroblasts undergo apoptosis after the ligation of Fas, as in normal cells, and whether apoptosis suppresses parasite growth. Unlike viruses, malaria parasites can multiply inside RBCs but may not require any cellular machinery for their replication, suggesting that the apoptosis of the host cells may not influence parasite growth. Indeed, a related protozoan, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, can survive inside damaged host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamashita et al., 1998</xref>). Instead, the elimination of the malaria parasite may require the phagocytosis of the infected cells by the phagocytes of the reticuloendothelial system, and the externalization of PS on parasitized erythroblasts via Fas/FasL plays an important role in this process. PS acts as an ‘eat me’ signal for phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Savill and Gregory, 2007</xref>) and contributes to the rapid removal of infected erythroblasts and apoptotic cells. Erythroblasts are distributed in a specific region called the ‘erythroblastic island’ in the splenic red pulp. Macrophages are located in the center of the erythroblastic island and rapidly phagocytose the nuclei of erythroblasts after their enucleation under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chasis and Mohandas, 2008</xref>). These macrophages may rapidly engulf infected erythroblasts as soon as PS is exposed after their interaction with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>Not only the erythroblasts in the spleen, but also the infected RBCs in the peripheral blood, expose PS in response to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and FasL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although PS exposure on infected RBCs induced by Fas stimulation could not be reproduced in vitro coincident with the absence of Fas<sup>+</sup> cells in the peripheral blood, we observed a substantial number of infected PS<sup>+</sup> RBCs in the peripheral blood. One possible explanation for FasL-dependent PS exposure on infected Fas<sup>−</sup> RBCs is that infected erythroblasts exposing PS develop into RBCs after enucleation, which is associated with the shedding of MHC class I molecules. PS exposure on infected RBCs has been reported in response to several stressors during malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Foller et al., 2009</xref>), and the FasL- and CD8<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-dependent system might be one cause of this PS exposure. PS exposure on infected RBCs might be part of the CD8<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-mediated protective mechanism against blood-stage malaria.</p><p>We proposed that Tim-4 is a novel phagocytic receptor for infected cells. The rate at which an anti-Tim-4 antibody inhibited the phagocytosis of infected RBCs (up to 20%) seems appropriate because 15–20% of the macrophages used here (obtained from uninfected mice) expressed Tim-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). However, infection with PyNL induced the expression of Tim-4 on macrophages, which may play a major role in the phagocytosis of infected cells during malarial infection. Our results also indicate that other molecules that are known PS receptors, such as PS receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoffmann et al., 2001</xref>) and developmental endothelial locus 1 (Del-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanayama et al., 2004</xref>), might be involved in the phagocytosis of infected cells.</p><p>In summary, we have clearly demonstrated the protective mechanisms of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells against blood-stage malaria. Our findings should provide novel strategies for the development of a blood-stage vaccine based on the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, distinct from those strategies based on the induction of antibodies. Antigens recognized by antibodies must be expressed on the parasite's surface. Such molecules are exposed to immune pressure and acquire polymorphisms, allowing them to evade antibody recognition and causing ‘strain-specific immunity’, which hampers the development of effective vaccines. In contrast, antigens recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are not restricted in their locations, and conserved intracellular molecules could be recognized after antigen presentation. Therefore, the development of malaria vaccines that activate protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells against blood-stage malaria might be useful and have wide applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 (B6) mice, C57BL/6JSlc-<italic>gld</italic> (<italic>gld</italic>: generalized lymphoproliferative disease) mice and BALB/c mice were obtained from SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan) or Kyudo (Tosu, Japan). <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were obtained from Central Laboratory of Experimental Animals (Kawasaki, Japan).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) The statistical analysis is inadequate. The authors did not demonstrate that their data follow a normal distribution. Unless they do so, they should use nonparametric tests such as Mann-Whitney test (if two sets of data are shown and compared; Figures 1C and 1D, 2A, 2B, 2D and 2F, 4B and 4C, 6B, 10D and 10E, 12C and 12D, 13C) or Kruskal-Wallis test (if three sets of data are shown and compared; Figures 5C and 5E, 7C, 9B and 9C, 11A and 11B, 13A).</p><p>2) The studies described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref> showing the effect of T cell depletion in mice (CD8 or CD4 depleted) are critical as they provide information about how important are CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells for protection and parasite clearance. Unfortunately they are poorly described: no information on depletion schedule or the amount of antibodies.

One possible reason is environmental influences, as these two experiments were conducted in different animal facilities using mice from different suppliers. In addition, we frequently experienced experimental variations in such infections using mice even under the same conditions (e.g., two or three out of five mice died, giving 40% or 60% mortality, respectively), indicating the limitation of biological experiments. However, it is important that mice depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells unfailingly became more susceptible to PyNL infection.

We already demonstrated that the protective ability of transferred “immune” CD8 T cells depends on IFN-γ responsible for macrophage activation (see Imai et al, Eur. J. Immunol., 2010), which is also described in the Introduction section in the original version of the manuscript. In the present study, however, the remaining CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may also produce IFN-γ after depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In fact, macrophages were activated in response to infection with PyNL even in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-depleted animals as indicated by higher expression of MHC class I and class II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These results support our proposal that the impaired phagocytosis in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-depleted mice is not due to insufficient activation of macrophages but due to the reduction of PS<sup>+</sup> infected erythroid cells.</p><p>It is difficult to analyze whether effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells affect infected erythroid cells directly after recognizing them or indirectly after recognition of dendritic cells cross-presenting parasite antigens in vivo<underline>.</underline> As both erythroid cells and dendritic cells are derived from bone marrow, bone marrow chimeras would not solve these questions. To compensate for the lack of in vivo evidence, in vitro experiments have been performed and revealed that infected TER119<sup>+</sup> cells from the spleen, but not peripheral blood, externalized PS when co-cultured with effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We also reported previously that effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are directly activated by infected erythroid cells in an antigen-specific manner using OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that recognize OVA peptide in conjunction with H-2K<sup>b</sup> and OVA-expressing PyNL parasites (see Imai et al, Sci. Rep., 2013). We therefore believe that direct antigen-specific activation operates, at least partially, during CD8<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-mediated protection.</p></body></sub-article></article>
