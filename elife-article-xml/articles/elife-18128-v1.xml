In non-mammals such as birds and fish, the hair cells responsible for balance die and are replaced (in a process known as turnover) throughout life. However, it is largely assumed that no new balance hair cells are made in adult mammals such as humans and mice. This would mean that injured hair cells are never replaced, which could cause balance problems such as dizziness over time.</p><p>There have been hints in past studies that perhaps some balance hair cells die or are newly made in adult mammals. Using a variety of new cell labeling and tracking methods in different types of mutant mice, Bucks et al. now show that the turnover of balance hair cells happens in adult mice under normal conditions. Both types of balance hair cells – known as type I and type II – are removed by supporting cells that surround the hair cells. In addition, the supporting cells can convert into new type II hair cells, but not type I hair cells, and type II hair cells do not convert into new type I hair cells.</p><p>To compare these results with what happens after hair cell damage, Bucks et al. injected a toxin into mutant mice to kill most hair cells. This revealed that supporting cells make 6 times as many hair cells after severe damage than under normal conditions, but still only make type II hair cells.</p><p>One important issue to study next is whether type I hair cells are ever created in adulthood. Many elderly people develop balance problems that lead to catastrophic falls. Perhaps one reason this occurs is because type I hair cells cannot be replaced in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18128.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18128.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>hair cell</kwd><kwd>supporting cell</kwd><kwd>turnover</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>vestibular</kwd><kwd>utricle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 DC013695</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bucks</surname><given-names>Stephanie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC013771</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stone</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC04661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stone</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id><institution>Office of Naval Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N00014-13-1-0569</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cox</surname><given-names>Brandon C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell fate-mapping with genetically-modified mouse models and cellular markers demonstrates that sensory hair cells in the vestibular portion of the inner ear are a dynamic population in adult mice that undergo cell death and replacement under normal conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the adult mammalian nervous system, production of sensory and neural cells is limited to a few areas, including the hippocampus, the olfactory epithelium, and the olfactory bulb (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beites et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ming and Song, 2005</xref>). When neurons die naturally in these areas, their debris is phagocytosed by microglia (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). Different glial populations then divide and generate replacement neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morshead et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doetsch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Johansson et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In non-mammalian vertebrates, the mechanosensory receptors for balance, called vestibular hair cells (HCs), undergo turnover (cell death and replacement) throughout life. In the avian utricle, a vestibular organ sensing linear head movements, HCs die and are replaced at a slow rate in adulthood, maintaining cell numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jørgensen and Mathiesen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roberson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kil et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goodyear et al., 1999</xref>).

Many tissues capable of regeneration after injury, such as integumentary, olfactory, and intestinal epithelia, also undergo cellular turnover under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ito et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Leung et al., 2007</xref>). Collectively, these studies suggest vestibular HC turnover may occur in adult mammals, but definitive evidence has not been presented.</p><p>Supporting cells (SCs), which surround HCs, are epithelial cells that have properties of glia. Among their many functions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Monzack and Cunningham, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wan et al., 2013</xref>), SCs serve as progenitors to new vestibular HCs during homeostasis in mature birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jørgensen and Mathiesen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roberson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kil et al., 1997</xref>) and after ototoxin-induced death of HCs in mature birds and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tsue et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin et al., 2011</xref>).

The capacity of SCs in adult mammals to phagocytose and renew vestibular HCs under normal conditions has not been explored.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that a small, but significant proportion of HCs in utricles of adult mice are cleared and replaced by SCs in the absence of a damaging stimulus. There are two types of vestibular HCs, type I and type II, both of which are phagocytosed and removed from the sensory epithelium. However, fate-mapping indicates that SCs replace only type II HCs, and type II HCs do not convert into type I HCs, at least over the 8-month period of adulthood we examined. When HCs are killed by a toxin, SCs transdifferentiate into 6 times as many type II HCs compared to normal HC addition within the same 4-week period. This study demonstrates that the utricle is an additional neuroepithelium in mammals capable of generating sensory receptor cells throughout adulthood and defines the lineage of new HC production in this mature tissue under normal conditions and after HC damage <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Type I and II HCs are cleared by phagosomes from adult mouse utricles under normal conditions</title><p>Utricles are otolithic vestibular organs located in the inner ear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The utricular sensory epithelium (macula) is composed of an alternating array of SCs and two types of HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>) and contains the processes of vestibular afferent and efferent nerves (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eatock and Songer, 2011</xref>). Type I HCs have a flask-shaped body and a nucleus located at mid-epithelial depth, and they synapse onto large calyceal afferents. Type II HCs have complex shapes, with thick necks and basal cytoplasmic processes projecting from the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pujol et al., 2014</xref>). Each type II HC nucleus is located near the lumenal surface. Type II HCs synapse onto small (bouton) afferents. SCs span the basal-to-apical extent of the epithelium, and their nuclei reside below HC nuclei, near the basal lamina. The utricle is divided into two zones: a C-shaped central region called the striola, in which specialized type I HCs are enriched, and the extrastriolar region, which surrounds the striola and occupies the remainder of the utricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18128.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phagosomes target type I and type II HCs for clearance in adult mouse utricular maculae under normal conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the inner ear with the utricle highlighted in magenta.

When SCs clear HCs after ototoxin-mediated injury, they first produce an actin cable to constrict the HC and extrude its most apical portion, including the stereocilia bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meiteles and Raphael, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bird et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Monzack et al., 2015</xref>). Then, one or more SCs form actin-rich phagosomes that engulf the remaining HC body. Actin filaments comprising the phagosome are interlaced around each HC as it is consumed, and the phagosome structure appears basket- or ring-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bird et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Monzack et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To determine if utricular SCs consume HCs under normal conditions in adult mice, we labeled utricles from 5- to 10-week-old Swiss Webster mice with phalloidin, which binds filamentous actin (F-actin). In whole-mounted normal utricles, we detected numerous F-actin-rich structures that were basket-like or ring-shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–E”’,G–K”</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), resembling phagosomes described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bird et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Monzack et al., 2015</xref>). The vast majority of these structures was restricted to the basal compartment of the epithelium, amongst SC nuclei. We counted 48.9 ± 14.8 (mean ± standard deviation) phagosomes per utricle (n = 8; Figure 3A; Figure 3—source data 1). Immunolabeling of myosin VIIa, a HC-specific marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hasson et al., 1995</xref>), revealed that 21.7% ± 16.1% of phagosomes per utricle were clearly associated with HCs whose cell bodies had been translocated basally to the SC nuclear layer and were therefore considered ectopic (95% confidence interval: 8.8–34.6%; n = 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–E”’,H–K”</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). There were two primary types of associations between phagosomes and ectopic HCs. In 55.2% (±9.7%; 95% confidence interval: 47.5–63.0%; n = 6) of associations, phagosomes were composed of a ring-like structure that fully encircled a HC body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–E’”</xref>, arrowheads) and were connected to a basket-like structure devoid of HC material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–E’”</xref>, arrows). Most other phagosomes associated with ectopic HCs consisted of a basket-like structure with one or more F-actin-rich processes that extended laterally and either contacted nearby HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) or pierced and entered their cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,J,K”</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

Of 6 such cells we observed in the sectioned utricle, one HC appeared to have condensed chromatin characteristic of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Although we examined hundreds of ectopic HCs in utricles, no other HCs had obvious abnormalities or signs of apoptosis other than their location. Indeed, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) labeling revealed no variation in nuclear size, integrity, or density of chromatin in ectopically located HCs or HCs associated with phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E”</xref>).</p><p>To examine the type of HCs targeted by phagosomes, we labeled utricles with phalloidin and antibodies to other HC markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–K”</xref>). The nuclei of basally translocated cells being engulfed by phagosomes were immunoreactive for antibodies against POU4F3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), a HC-specific transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erkman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xiang et al., 1997</xref>), confirming their identity. We found evidence that both type I and type II HCs were being targeted by phagosomes. SOX2 is a transcription factor that is abundant in SCs and type II HCs, but is not found in type I HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oesterle et al., 2008</xref>). Some phagosomes were associated with a myosin VIIa-positive cell whose nucleus was SOX2-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In other utricles, we found phagosome-associated HCs that were immunoreactive for the calcium-binding protein, calretinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), which is selectively elevated in type II HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Desai et al., 2005</xref>). Some phagosomes engulfed cells that were immunoreactive for tenascin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–K”</xref>), an extracellular matrix protein that lines the space between the type I HC plasma membrane and the afferent calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Swartz and Santi, 1999</xref>). Further, one ectopic HC in transverse plastic sections was wrapped by a calyceal afferent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), identifiable by its electron-lucent appearance except for scattered mitochondria, which is typical of a type I HC.</p><p>To address the mechanism of HC clearance, we examined phalloidin labeling in HCs located in their proper positions. We estimate that 2–10 normal-appearing HCs per utricle contained a long ‘spike’ of F-actin that coursed through the cytoplasm. Typically, the spike extended from the cell’s apex to its base, then exited the cell and descended toward the basal lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–A”</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). It is notable that we detected a similar spike-like structure in the cytoplasm of 5.3 (±4.3; 95% confidence interval: 2.0–8.7; n = 6) basally translocated HCs per utricle that were associated with phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–B”</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,J,K”</xref>).

To determine if this also occurs under normal conditions, we labeled utricles with antibodies to espin and plasma membrane calcium ATPase 2 (PMCA2), which are reported to label stereocilia, but not other structures in the sensory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dumont et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2004</xref>). As anticipated, stereocilia were brightly labeled with both antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref> insets). Occasional ectopic HCs were diffusely labeled by either antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,C”</xref>, espin labeling), but none of them contained brightly labeled foci resembling stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D”</xref>). Thus, our observations suggest that the apical part of the HC is ejected apically prior to translocation or that stereocilia degenerate during translocation. Interestingly, espin antibodies labeled most actin-rich spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–C”</xref>). Initially, we thought this could indicate that spikes are derived from stereocilia. However, spikes were not labeled for antibodies to PMCA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–D”</xref>), suggesting this is not the case. Perhaps espin serves as an actin-bundling protein in phagosome spikes, as it does in stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In 5- to 10-week-old Swiss Webster mice, there were 48.9 (±14.8) phalloidin-labeled phagosomes per utricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), displaying a range of morphologies. To assess if phagosomes are unique to Swiss Webster mice at 5–10 weeks of age, we analyzed Swiss Webster utricles at 3 weeks and 43–46 weeks of age, as well as utricles from two strains of inbred mice (C57Bl/6J and CBA/CaJ) at all 3 ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source 1</xref>). The distribution of phagosomes in the utricular macula was similar across utricles and ages: phagosomes appeared to be concentrated in the peristriolar region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,B’</xref>). The morphologies of phagosomes were also similar in all 3 strains of mice (not shown). However, C57Bl/6J and CBA/CaJ utricles consistently had fewer phagosomes than Swiss Webster utricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

Therefore we reasoned that if HCs are cleared from the macula, they must be replaced. To address this, we looked for evidence of ongoing HC addition by assessing if HCs in normal adult utricles express two markers specific for immature HCs, protocadherin15-CD2 (PCDH15-CD2) and ATOH1.</p><p>PCDH15 is a protein localized to the tip links of HC stereocilia. Two alternatively spliced variants of PCDH15 (CD1 and CD3) are present in mature stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, PCDH15-CD2 is detected along the length of stereocilia during early development, but becomes confined to the kinocilium once HCs mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Webb et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, PCDH15-CD2 is a selective marker of immature stereocilia. As positive controls, we labeled utricles from neonatal (&lt;8 day-old) Swiss Webster mice with antibodies to PCDH15-CD2 and with phalloidin to mark stereocilia. In the periphery of the utricle, where newly formed HCs are differentiating in neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2012</xref>), we detected numerous HCs with PCDH15-CD2 labeling throughout the stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, we examined utricles from 6- to 9-week-old CBA/CaJ and Swiss Webster mice.

Our data show that, in utricles of adult mice, SCs remove type I and type II HCs under normal physiological conditions by phagocytosis and replace type II HCs by transdifferentiation. This study provides definitive evidence that vestibular epithelia are a site of ongoing HC turnover in adult mammals. In this sense, vestibular epithelia resemble other placodally derived neurosensory epithelia, such as taste buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Okubo et al., 2009</xref>) and olfactory epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Leung et al., 2007</xref>), which cull and replace sensory receptors throughout life. However, vestibular epithelia contrast sharply with the organ of Corti, the sensory organ of hearing, which is also derived from the otic placode, but in which no new HCs are formed under normal circumstances or after damage in adult mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bohne et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hawkins et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forge et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oesterle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cox et al., 2014</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Phagocytosis by SCs mediates HC clearance during normal cell turnover in adult mouse utricles</title><p>SCs, which are epithelial cells that resemble glia in several respects, serve many functions in HC epithelia, including maintaining structural integrity, clearing ions and neurotransmitters from extracellular space, and releasing neurotrophins to maintain synapses between HCs and neurons (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Monzack and Cunningham, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wan et al., 2013</xref>). SCs also phagocytose HCs that are injured by ototoxins or intense noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrashkin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bird et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anttonen et al., 2014</xref>). Our results demonstrate an additional, previously unknown role of SCs as phagocytes of type I and II vestibular HCs under normal conditions. While data from both <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> and <italic>Lfng-eGFP</italic> mice support the hypothesis that SCs act as phagocytes to remove HCs, we cannot rule out that other cell types in the organ also play this role. For instance, Schwann cells were also labeled by tdTomato in utricles of <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mice, and they have phagocytic capabilities in the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Band et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reichert et al., 1994</xref>). We attempted to assess Schwann cell contribution to phagosomes, but we were unable to identify antibodies or CreER mouse lines that labeled Schwann cells without also labeling SCs. <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mice also labeled cells in the transitional epithelium. However, these cells are unlikely sources of phagosomes, since the majority of phagosomes we observed were located in the central region of the macula, away from the transitional epithelium.</p><p>Our study did not determine the reason why HC clearance is concentrated centrally. This finding is somewhat counterintuitive, since HC addition appears to be most abundant in the periphery. However, it is possible that HC clearance and HC addition are not spatially coupled. During development, addition of utricular HCs in rodents occurs in a central-to-peripheral gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sans and Chat, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2012</xref>). Since we found HC clearance to be focused centrally, we hypothesize that the oldest HCs are being removed. During adulthood, peripherally added HCs might migrate toward the center over time, where they are eventually cleared. These hypotheses remain to be tested.</p><p>Since our study involved analysis of static images, we were unable to determine the temporal sequence of events, how quickly HCs are removed, how many HCs are cleared by SCs per week, the dynamics of phagosome formation, or the lifespan of phagosomes. However, based on our observations, we generated a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) that should be tested using live-cell imaging and serial immuno-electron microscopy. We propose that the first sign a HC has been ‘selected’ for clearance is the appearance of a large actin spike in its cytoplasm. Actin-rich cables or ‘cytocauds’ are also observed in HC cytoplasm of adult utricles in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sobin et al., 1982</xref>), guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flock et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kanzaki et al., 2002</xref>), and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). We suspect this actin spike is either derived from the HC itself or from a SC that has been signaled to ‘attack’ the HC. We hypothesize that this spike extends and becomes anchored basally, at which point the HC body is translocated to the basal compartment. Once translocated, adjacent SCs create basket-like phagosomes and consume the HC. However, it is also possible that the actin spike does not play a role in HC clearance. Because we did not detect stereocilia in translocated HCs, we presume that the apical portion of each HC is cleaved by SCs and ejected apically before translocation, similar to what occurs after aminoglycoside toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meiteles and Raphael, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bird et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Monzack et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is also possible that stereocilia proteins are degraded in HCs prior to, or during, translocation.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18128.025</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model of HC turnover in adult mouse utricles under normal conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of HC clearance. An actin spike (green) forms to connect SCs (grey) and a HC targeted for clearance (magenta). The apical portion of SCs converges and cleaves off the top of the HC, including the stereocilia.

However in normal utricles, we found that HCs are pierced by a single actin spike and translocated to a basal position, which has not been reported after damage. Although the number of phagosomes increased after DT-mediated HC death, the increase was not proportionate to HC loss, and many apoptotic HCs were not localized near phagosomes. These observations suggest that F-actin-rich phagosomes derived from SCs play a minor role in removing HCs in mouse utricles after DT treatment, which is consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaur et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, F-actin-rich phagosomes derived from SCs actively clear utricular HCs following aminoglycoside treatments in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bird et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Monzack et al., 2015</xref>). Further, we found that naturally occurring HC death does not trigger infiltration of immune-derived macrophages, which is robust after DT treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaur et al., 2015</xref>). Additional studies are needed to understand why different forms of HC degeneration trigger distinct forms of cell clearance.</p><p>It is not clear why certain HCs are removed from the epithelium under normal conditions. Most HCs associated with phagosomes appear normal aside from their unusual basal position. They have a typical nucleus and protein expression and show no nuclear condensation that occurs during apoptosis, nor cell swelling characteristic of necrosis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nikoletopoulou et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, HCs may be phagocytosed because they become damaged due to normal ‘wear and tear’ under physiological conditions. Thus, it is important to define the triggers for HC clearance. These could include degeneration of HCs or changes in innervation, cell membrane integrity, or other HC features. Further, SCs might act as primary phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Neher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Monzack and Cunningham, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>SCs transdifferentiate into type II HCs during normal cell turnover in adult mouse utricles</title><p>We demonstrate that SCs play a second critical role in maintaining vestibular epithelia under normal conditions: they form new HCs, presumably replacing those lost during clearance. Consistent with this, small numbers of immature HCs were detected in normal utricles of adult mice using two markers: PCDH15-CD2 and ATOH1-GFP. Recently, evidence for immature stereocilia bundles was found in utricles of aged humans (&gt;60 years old) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting HC turnover may also occur in adult primates. Two prior studies did not find evidence for ATOH1-immunolabeled cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) or cells with <italic>Atoh1</italic> enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin et al., 2011</xref>) in normal utricles from adult mice. These contrasting results may be due to different sensitivities of the methods used to assess <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression.</p><p>Fate-mapping of SCs in <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mice provided additional evidence for new HC addition. We assume SCs are the sole source of new HCs in our experiments based on a large body of literature showing that SCs are progenitors to vestibular HCs in non-mammalian vertebrates during both regeneration and turnover (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corwin and Oberholtzer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Warchol, 2011</xref>). However, transitional epithelial cells and Schwann cells were also labeled in utricles of <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mice. Therefore, additional CreER lines are needed to fate-map these cell populations and determine if they are unexpected sources of HCs during turnover.</p><p>Our data showed that SCs generate new type II HCs, but not type I HCs, under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B,C</xref>). These findings were surprising, since we detected clearance of both HC types. We hypothesized that type I HCs might be replaced by type II HCs since type II-to-I HC conversion has been suggested to occur after ototoxin-induced HC loss in avian utricles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weisleder and Rubel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zakir and Dickman, 2006</xref>). Additional support for this hypothesis was provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kirkegaard and Jørgensen (2001)</xref>, who detected individual HCs that appeared to be a hybrid with properties of both type I and type II HCs in vestibular organs of adult bats. However, when we fate-mapped type II HCs in mice under normal conditions, there was no evidence of type II-to-I conversion over an 8-month period of early adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). However, the rate of conversion could take longer than 8 months. Further, type I HCs may derive from type II HCs that were not fate-mapped in <italic>Atoh1-CreER<sup>TM</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mice or from SCs that were not fate-mapped in <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mice. It should be noted, however, that only type II HCs are replaced after drug-induced damage in adult guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forge et al., 1998</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kawamoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Golub et al., 2012</xref>), supporting the interpretation that type I HC replacement is attenuated or perhaps impossible in adult mice.</p><p>Regenerated HCs share many features with neighboring mature type II HCs, including myosin VIIa immunoreactivity, properly positioned nuclei, proper relative neck thickness, well defined stereocilia bundles, and basolateral processes. However, since we could not birth-date HCs in this study, we were not able to determine the degree to which new type II HCs are mature. Further, we did not perform any analyses that would inform on the functional status of the new HCs. Therefore, additional work is required to assess if HCs replaced in adult animals under normal conditions or after damage are functionally mature.</p><p>We were unable to distinguish whether HCs added during normal conditions derive from the progeny of SC division or via direct transdifferentiation, during which SCs phenotypically convert into HCs without dividing (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stone and Cotanche, 2007</xref>). Using multiple methods for BrdU administration, we only detected BrdU labeling in rare cells within the utricular macula, and their identity was not established. This finding is consistent with other studies that assessed SC division in normal utricles <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li and Forge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuntz and Oesterle, 1998</xref>). In contrast, dividing SCs are readily detected during HC turnover in mature birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roberson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kil et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stone et al., 1999</xref>). We cannot rule out, however, that SCs divide at a very low rate and our methods were insufficient to record them. Indeed, mammalian utricles that were cultured and treated with aminoglycoside antibiotics generated new HC-like cells and SCs by mitotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Warchol et al., 1993</xref>). One possible interpretation for the discrepancy is that culture conditions promote utricular SC division.</p><p>Prior fate-mapping studies showed that SCs form new vestibular HCs in juvenile and adult mice after HC damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Slowik and Bermingham-McDonogh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, we found that, upon HC destruction, SC transdifferentiation into type II HCs increases by 6-fold over type II HC addition under normal conditions. This demonstrates that adult mammals are able to upregulate vestibular HC addition, relative to normal levels, upon HC injury.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Significance of vestibular HC turnover in adult mice</title><p>We can use several approaches to estimate the rate of HC turnover. SC fate-mapping in mice with a mixed genetic background indicated that ~2 HCs are added to each utricle per week. This rate is likely a slight underestimate, since we only fate-mapped ~90% of extrastriolar and ~70% of striolar SCs in the utricle. Further, there could also be other sources of added HCs that were not fate-mapped, such as cells in the transitional epithelium or even in the stroma. We assessed the rate of HC addition by examining two markers for immature HCs (PCDH15-CD2 and ATOH1-GFP) in mice with a range of backgrounds. These markers labeled ~20 and ~82 HCs per utricle, respectively, which suggests a higher rate of HC addition than fate-mapping. However, we do not know how long each marker is expressed in differentiating cells, so we cannot use these analyses to define the rate of HC addition.</p><p>We can also assess the rate of turnover by estimating how many HCs die in a given period. Swiss Webster mice had ~50 phagosomes per utricle, of which ~12 were associated with HCs, while <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mice on a mixed background had ~28 phagosomes per utricle, of which ~5 were targeting HCs. Only 10–15 phagosomes were detected in CBA/CaJ or C57Bl/6J mice. It is unclear why Swiss Webster mice have significantly more phagosomes than the other tested mouse strains. They may have a higher rate of HC turnover, or their phagosomes may remain in the utricle for a longer period of time than in other strains. Although we cannot deduce the lifespan of a phagosome or the duration of HC clearance in the current study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Monzack et al. (2015)</xref> showed in aminoglycoside-treated mouse utricles that a phagosome engulfed a HC, cleared it, and began retracting within 8 hr. If this time frame is similar in normal utricles, and we use the conservative estimate from <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> (mixed background) mice that 5 HCs at any given time are being targeted by phagosomes generated within an 8 hr period, then we can estimate that one HC is targeted for removal every 1.6 hr, which is equivalent to 15 HCs per day or 105 HCs per week. Since numbers of HCs are maintained in adult mice, this could suggest that as many as 105 HCs are added per week, which is considerably more than indicated by SC fate-mapping with <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mice. Accordingly, live-cell imaging must be performed to define the lifespan of a phagosome in normal utricles, which may differ from the lifespan of phagosomes after HC damage.</p><p>If we make a conservative estimate, based on SC fate-mapping alone, that 2 HCs are turned over per week, and we consider the mouse’s lifespan to be 18 months, with an average of 4.3 weeks/month, then we can estimate that 155 HCs, or 4% of the HC population, are turned over during a mouse’s lifetime. It seems unlikely that such a small degree of HC turnover would have a significant impact on vestibular homeostasis. However, we found evidence that type I HCs are cleared, but no evidence that type I HCs are replaced. A progressive loss of type I HCs over time or disruption in the balance of type II HC clearance and addition, for example during aging, could result in vestibular dysfunction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Park et al. (1987)</xref> measured a ~14% reduction in utricular HCs in old C57Bl/6NNia mice, and this reduction was similar for both type I and II HCs. By contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kirkegaard and Nyengaard (2005)</xref> found no evidence of HC loss in aged outbred mice.

After rinsing thrice in 1X PBS, whole utricles were mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) between two cover slips anchored to a glass slide with putty.</p><p>To detect apoptosis in whole utricles and gut tissue (positive control), we utilized the ApopTag Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit [#S7110, Chemicon (now EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA)] according to the manufacturer’s instructions followed by immunostaining as described above.</p><p>To detect proliferating cells in whole utricles and gut tissue (positive control) from mice treated with BrdU, fixed tissue was first labeled with antibodies for cell specific markers as described above. After secondary antibody incubation, tissue was fixed again in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After rinsing in 1X PBS and a second permeabilization step, the tissue was incubated in 2 N HCl in 0.05% Triton X-100 for 1 hr at room temperature, then rinsed in 1X PBS, and placed in blocking buffer for 30 min. Then the tissue was immunostained with anti-BrdU primary antibodies as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Confocal microscopy and image analysis</title><p>Fluorescent images were obtained with an Olympus FV-1000 microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). In most cases, z-series images were collected with a 60x oil objective through the entire macula, from above stereocilia bundles to the stroma below the basal lamina, at 0.5 or 0.25 µm increments. For qualitative analyses, we generated z-series in 2–3 extrastriolar and striolar regions. For quantitative analysis for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, we generated high-resolution images or montages of the entire utricular macula. Image analysis was performed using Fiji (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/">http://fiji.sc/</ext-link>). Fiji’s Cell Counter plugin was used for quantitative analyses.</p><p>To determine the percentage of SCs labeled in <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mice one week after tamoxifen injection, eight 50 × 50 µm regions of each utricle (3 in the medial extrastriola, 3 in the lateral extrastriola, and two in the striolar area) were sampled. All SCs within the sampled regions were counted and scored as tdTomato-positive or tdTomato-negative. The average percentage of extrastriolar SCs that were tdTomato-labeled was calculated by combining medial and lateral extrastriolar regions.</p><p>To assess whether phalloidin-labeled phagosomes co-localized with IBA1 immunolabeling, 301 phalloidin-labeled phagosomes from 6 Swiss Webster mice at 9 weeks of age were closely examined. To quantify PCDH15-CD2-labeled stereocilia bundles in adult CBA/CaJ and Swiss Webster mice, the 100x oil objective on the Olympus FV-1000 confocal microscope was used. The observer looked over the entire utricle and counted phalloidin-labeled stereocilia bundles co-localized with multiple puncta of PCDH15-CD2 along the length and width of the bundle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Criteria for cell typing</title><p>HCs were distinguished from SCs by the presence of a HC marker and the location of their nuclei, which reside above the clear monolayer of SC nuclei along the basal lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We used several morphological criteria to classify HCs as type I or type II in whole-mounted utricles. These criteria for mice are defined in many publications, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rüsch et al. (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pujol et al. (2014)</xref>, are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, and shown in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">5</xref>. Almost all morphological analyses were performed in whole-mount utricles labeled with antibodies to myosin VIIa, which label the cytoplasm of both type I and type II HCs. We acquired z-series images through the entire sensory epithelium (from the lumen through the basal lamina) in striolar and extrastriolar regions. Images were analyzed thoroughly off-line by scanning up and down through the z-series, examining the entire body of each HC. This approach allowed us to assess all criteria in each image and compare features amongst several cells. Four morphological criteria were used to classify HCs across all regions of the utricle: thickness of the apical cytoplasm, thickness of the perinuclear cytoplasm, size and shape of the nucleus, and presence/absence of basolateral processes. The apical cytoplasm of type I HCs constricts significantly below the cuticular plate, while the apical cytoplasm of type II HCs does not. The perinuclear cytoplasm is very thin in type I HCs and considerably thicker in type II HCs. The nuclei in type I HCs are smaller and round, while the nuclei of type II HCs are larger and oblong. The clearest distinguishing features between type I and II HCs throughout the entire utricle (striola and extrastriola) are basolateral processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pujol et al., 2014</xref>), which are cytoplasmic portions of type II HCs that extend below the nucleus and are fully labeled by anti-myosin VIIa antibodies. In the extrastriola (the largest area in the utricle), there is a fifth powerful criterion for HC typing: the nuclei of type I and II HCs are located in distinct near-monolayers. Type II HC nuclei are consistently located apical to type I HC nuclei (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">5</xref>). In the striola, where type II and type I HC nuclei are less clearly stratified, we used the 4 criteria listed above—thickness of the apical and perinuclear cytoplasm, nuclear size and shape, and presence or absence of a basolateral process. In studies with <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> and <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup>:Pou4f3<sup>DTR</sup></italic> mice, the cytoplasm of most SCs was labeled with tdTomato. As a result, we had another criterion to help us with typing: type II HCs were completely encompassed by the tdTomato-positive SC processes, while type I HCs had an unlabeled gap around them, which was the calyx. Any cells that did not clearly match criteria described above for any analysis were scored as an ‘unknown.’</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Constructing utricle maps</title><p>The Cell Counter plugin in Fiji was used to mark tdTomato-labeled HCs in one utricle from an adult <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Results were imported into Microsoft Powerpoint 2011 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) to assemble the images and reconstruct an entire utricle.

author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Supporting cells remove and replace sensory receptor hair cells in a balance organ of adult mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Tanya Whitfield as the Reviewing Editor and Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Yehoash Raphael (Reviewer #2) and Jonathan Gale (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper demonstrates that a slow endogenous turnover of vestibular hair cells in the utricle of adult mice occurs in the absence of overt hair cell damage, via phagocytosis, apparently by supporting cells. The paper also demonstrates that the mammalian vestibular system can regenerate Type II vestibular hair cells through phenotypic conversion of supporting cells.</p><p>Overall, it was agreed that the study communicated a number of significant and important new findings and would be of general interest. However, there were several concerns that should be addressed before publication. The following numbered points were felt to be the essential changes required; the full reviews are appended below for further information.</p><p>1) Two of the reviewers query whether the rate of hair cell turnover in the Swiss-Webster mice is specific to that strain. Further information and discussion is required here.</p><p>2) Given the known phagocytic activity of Schwann cells, and the position and labelling of Schwann cells in the utricle, please provide further data, if possible, to address the possibility that the phagosomes are Schwann cell-derived (see comments from reviewer 1). As a minimum, further discussion is required to address this point. At present, Schwann cells are discussed as a possible source of hair cells, but not of phagosomes, in the manuscript.</p><p>3) As requested by reviewer 2, please remove the word 'undamaged' when referring to normal turnover of hair cells and discuss the possibility that such turnover may replace cells that are damaged in some way by normal wear and tear.</p><p>4) As requested by reviewer 2, please provide further data and discussion to compare the role of supporting cells in clearing damaged hair cells after diphtheria toxin lesion with their role in normal turnover.</p><p>5) Please review the statistical analysis of the data carefully (see comments from reviewer 2).</p><p>6) It was felt that the last paragraph of the Discussion makes an abrupt end to the manuscript and does not tie the story together well. Please aim to rewrite this, in particular to include a clear discussion of the physiological significance of the findings.</p><p>7) After discussion, it was felt that answering the interesting questions raised by reviewer 1 concerning mechanistic insights would be beyond the scope of this study; therefore, it is not essential to address these with further experimental work. However, if the authors have further discussion to add here, this would help to address these concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Bucks et al. explores important issues, i.e. the ability of the mammalian inner ear to replace hair cells and the mechanisms by which this might occur. The study reports that hair cells in the adult mammalian utricle undergo removal and replacement by their surrounding supporting cells under both normal and damaging condition. The authors performed thorough analysis characterizing three individual mouse strains and using lineage tracing experiments to confirm the cellular origin of replaced hair cells. The manuscript is clear and technically sound. However, there are major issues regarding to the general interest of this study and the physiological significance of the findings.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>Novelty: the paper refers to previous studies that showed the ability of adult rodents to regenerate small numbers of utricular HCs after ototoxin-induced damage. Was the magnitude of the regeneration in those studies much lower than in the current study? Since in this paper the authors show that the degree of cell replacement differs between mouse strains, are the present results more dramatic because the specific strain studies here? The authors need to discuss if the high degree of cell replacement seen in Swiss Webster mice is an anomaly given that replacement occurs at a much lower degree in the other strains.</p><p>The paper also refers to previous studies showing that supporting cells phagocytose hair cells after ototoxic damage in and mammals, and there have been reports of vestibular hair cell loss in the adult ear. Thus, it seems that this study just provides further evidence of the hair cell phagocytic capacity of supporting cells in the normal tissue.</p><p>Biological-physiological relevance: Although this study provides solid evidence of hair cell replacement in adult utricle, primarily by transdifferentiation of supporting cells, it remains unclear if 36.6 cells replaced per utricle at 15 wk post tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), which would translate into about 317 in 2.5 years, the lifespan of a mouse is biologically significant. This number of hair cells, if I'm not mistaken, represents a very small% of total hair cells in the utricle, making me wonder what is the physiological relevance of these findings. Furthermore, the number of cells replaced is much lower in several strains, further questioning the functional impact of such process. Does this percentage increase over a longer period of time?

Understanding these mechanisms is important if we are to fully understand how to regenerate sensory hair cells in humans.</p><p>Firstly, the authors describe finding actin-rich structures that are closely associated with hair-bundle less hair cells underneath the utricular epithelial surface close to the basal lamina. These structures were found in fixed specimens of control mice (of various strains). There are a small number of these in a single sense organ at any one time (ranging from 10 to 60 depending on the strain but independent upon the age of the mouse). They are somewhat regionally restricted, being found predominantly in the peri-striolar region.</p><p>The authors suggest that the structures are similar to the supporting cell based phagosomes that have been described in both chicken and murine utricles after ototoxin-induced hair cell death. If so they would be derived from supporting cells rather than another cell type and the authors use a <italic>Plp-CreERT2:ROSA26<sup>tdTom</sup></italic>mouse to show that the actin -rich structures that they have discovered are derive from a supporting cell. The authors suggest that these structures indicate a homeostatic(?) removal process for hair cells during the &quot;normal&quot; lifespan of a mouse and so predict that there should be immature cells that need to be added in order to maintain cell numbers. They find that adult mouse utricles do have hair cells with &quot;immature&quot; characteristics, as has been suggested by other work, and then use an Atoh1-GFP mouse to provide support for this finding (since we know that with maturation AtoH1 expression is significantly reduced as hair cells mature). Furthermore, they use the PlpCRE reporter mice to determine the number of hair cells that are derived from Plp-expressing cells and find that this number increases over a period of 15 weeks after Cre activation – an addition of ~30 cells over 15 weeks. Detailed analysis revealed that it was almost exclusively the Type II hair cell that was added during this period, and using another mouse model they show that the Type II hair cells do not convert to the other Type I hair cells, at least over the 15 week period monitored. Finally, by crossing their PlP reporter mice with a Pou4f3-Diphtheria Toxin mouse (that they have described previously) the authors showed that the ablation of hair cells resulted in a substantial increase (6x) in the numbers of tdTom-positive hair cells i.e. hair cells derived from SCs</p><p>General Comments:</p><p>The paper is a great example of what can be done using different mouse models and different cellular markers. The work is high quality and is well presented. The paper gives us an important insight into the life and death of hair cells in the mammalian utricle under &quot;normal&quot; conditions and shows the importance of the supporting cells in that life and death.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The data presented suggest during normal ageing a small number of hair cells are removed from the epithelial surface and become associated with the actin-rich phagosomal structures described in the paper. It is not clear to me from the data presented whether the phagocytic process that is suggested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> is any different from the mechanisms that have been described and shown directly through live-imaging in both the avian and mammalian utricle. It seems very possible that the same process that has been described for ototoxically damage cells could be responsible for the removal of the cells described here. Is there any reason not to conclude that a similar process is used? This points warrants further discussion (note – see point 12 below)?</p><p>2) There is a description of &quot;association&quot; between phagosomes and hair cells e.g. subsection “Type I and II HCs are cleared by phagosomes from adult mouse utricles under normal conditions”, third paragraph, fourth and sixth paragraphs. A qualification of what constituted such &quot;associations&quot; and how there were determined by the observer is required. Does this association mean that there was clear evidence of engulfment of a hair cell within a phagosome?</p><p>3) In order to call this structure a phagosome there needs to be better description of how the actin rich structures that are shown are linked to the supporting cells that presumably generated them – this is hard to see this from the images provided. Have the authors for example tried to reconstruct the phagosome structure in 3D from the confocal stacks they have?</p><p>4) Is there something unusual about Swiss Webster mice? They have ~3x as many of the actin rich structures as the other two strains?</p><p>5) The phagosome-like structures are somewhat regionally restricted, being found predominantly in the peri-striolar region. There is little discussion of why this might be the case.</p><p>6) Can the authors estimate the lifetime of the actin-rich phagosomal structures they describe (see note 12 below)?</p><p>7) How much actin is there in these structures compared to the actin-rich hair bundles of the normal hair cells? How about the spikes – the sequence showing the stack (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>) suggests very similar levels?</p><p>8) How are the estimations for the% of Type I and Type II hair cells made (subsection “<italic>Atoh1-CreER<sup>TM</sup></italic>-labeled type II HCs did not convert into type I HCs under normal conditions”, first paragraph)? I estimated 3% and 35% respectively using the numbers of tdTom labelled hair cells shown in the table for 7 weeks of age, a total hair cell number of 3600 and a ratio of 1.17:1.</p><p>9) At the end of the subsection “Diphtheria toxin-induced HC ablation increased SC-to-type II HC transition in adult mouse utricles” – it is stated that the rate of transdifferentiation is significantly increased. The data indicates that this is what happens but no rates are provided per se. Consider revising the sentence?</p><p>10) The finding that only Type II hair cells are replaced in the mammal has implications for the recovery of function since the Type I cells provide/send different information to brain. Does this finding concur with what is known/has been shown for the functional recovery that has been described in other work?</p><p>11) The authors show in fate mapping experiments that ~2 hair cells are added per week. If we assume that the utricle maintains its normal number of cells over this period (which is thought to be the case) then the rate of removal should be the same. Even if the fate-mapping studies are not 100% effective and we assume a 75% efficacy then the simplest estimation is that there would be~3 (or just under) hair cells turned over per week, rather than the 10 suggested at the end of the subsection “Estimates of the rate of HCs turnover in adult mice”. Using this estimate we can see that the phagocytic structures that are described here is a somewhat long lived with lifetimes &gt;1 week, indicating some differences to those phagosomes already described by others.</p><p>Other comments:i) Subsection “Type I and II HCs are cleared by phagosomes from adult mouse utricles under normal conditions”, fourth paragraph: How do the authors know that this is a calyceal afferent from the image shown in Panel 1F? This is quite hard to see and a marker would be required for definitive evidence. The tenascin data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,K' and K'</xref> provide some support for this although it is not entirely clear that the tenascin is within the actin-rich structure. Again – could some 3D reconstruction help?</p><p>ii) Fig1L – it is hard to make out where the epithelial surface is perhaps this can be clarified.</p><p>iii) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> – clarify that this is a projection of the lower planes of the utricle – if it was a max projection of the full stack you would see mostly hair bundles in the image wouldn't you?</p><p>iv) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> – is the edge of the sensory macula in the field of view or is it an oblique optical section in both cases?</p><p>v) I found <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref> hard to see due to the merging of the colours. It is clear that in C' there is a tdTom-positive and Myo7a-positive double labelled cell. Why does this cell have such a strong Myo7a signal – is this typical?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18128.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Overall, it was agreed that the study communicated a number of significant and important new findings and would be of general interest. However, there were several concerns that should be addressed before publication. The following numbered points were felt to be the essential changes required; the full reviews are appended below for further information.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Two of the reviewers query whether the rate of hair cell turnover in the Swiss-Webster mice is specific to that strain. Further information and discussion is required here.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent question. After conducting an extensive literature search, the only notable Swiss Webster phenotype we found was two reports describing Swiss Webster mice exhibiting circling behavior and inflammation in vestibular organs caused by infection with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (Ediger et al., 1971 Lab Anim Sci; Olson and Ediger, 1972 Lab Anim Sci). We have not observed circling behavior in our Swiss Webster mice, and no evidence of vestibular macular inflammation or damage was detected during our analyses of their utricles.</p><p>To date, there is very little known to form a clear hypothesis as to why Swiss Webster mice have seemingly increased HC turnover compared to other strains in our study. It is important to note, however, that while our findings describe significantly more phagosomes in Swiss Webster mouse utricles, there was no significant increase in protocadherin15-CD2 labeled stereocilia bundles compared to other strains. Assuming that there is a balance between HC clearance and HC addition, the actin dynamics and, consequently, kinetics of creating and resolving phagosomes may be longer in Swiss Webster mice. Live-imaging studies of HC turnover in utricles from Swiss Webster and other mouse strains could help clarify this. We have added the several sentences to the Discussion for this point (subsection “Significance of vestibular HC turnover in adult mice”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Given the known phagocytic activity of Schwann cells, and the position and labelling of Schwann cells in the utricle, please provide further data, if possible, to address the possibility that the phagosomes are Schwann cell-derived (see comments from reviewer 1). As a minimum, further discussion is required to address this point. At present, Schwann cells are discussed as a possible source of hair cells, but not of phagosomes, in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>This is an important question. Unfortunately, despite considerable effort, we were not able to find antibodies that label Schwann cells but not SCs or evidence of CreER mouse lines that target Schwann cells specifically. This is also true for cells in the transitional epithelium (TE). Thus, new tools are needed to delineate what, if any, contribution Schwann cells or TE cells make to the production of phagosomes and the addition of HCs in the normal utricle. However, we have included new data to further support the interpretation that many phagosomes derive from SCs. The <italic>Lfng-eGFP</italic> mouse expresses eGFP specifically in SCs in vestibular epithelia, but not in Schwann cells or TE cells (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> and Burns et al., 2015 Nat Comm). In <italic>Lfng-eGFP</italic> mice, eGFP is expressed in the majority of SCs, and we observed co-localization of eGFP with F-actin rich phagosomes. This supports our findings using <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup> </italic>mice that SCs can act as phagosomes. We have included these new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I”</xref> and in Results (subsection “SCs clear HCs from adult mouse utricles under normal conditions”, second paragraph) and Materials and methods (subsection “Mouse models&quot;). In addition, we have expanded the Discussion to include the possibility that Schwann cells could also act as phagocytes and that new tools are needed to investigate this idea (subsection “Phagocytosis by SCs mediates HC clearance in normal mouse utricles”, first paragraph). However, it is unlikely that TE cells are sources of phagosomes, since the majority of phagosomes we observed were located in the central region of the macula, away from the transitional epithelium. This point was also added to the Discussion (see the aforementioned paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) As requested by reviewer 2, please remove the word 'undamaged' when referring to normal turnover of hair cells and discuss the possibility that such turnover may replace cells that are damaged in some way by normal wear and tear.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this suggestion, which clarifies the study design for the reader. We replaced the term “undamaged” with “normal” throughout the text, including section headings and figure legends. For discussion of the <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup>:Pou4f3<sup>DTR</sup></italic> mouse experiments, the term “undamaged” was replaced with “control”. We also added a sentence to the Discussion to acknowledge that normal wear and tear may cause HC damage and induce phagocytosis (subsection “Phagocytosis by SCs mediates HC clearance in normal mouse utricles”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) As requested by reviewer 2, please provide further data and discussion to compare the role of supporting cells in clearing damaged hair cells after diphtheria toxin lesion with their role in normal turnover.</italic> </p><p>We counted phagosomes in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>DTR</sup></italic> mice and created a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), which shows a ~60% increase in the number of phagosomes at 4 and 7 days post DT-induced damage, but not at other time points post DT. Our previous work showed a loss of &gt;2000 HCs over the first week post-DT (Golub et al., 2012), so the increase of phagosomes we observed (~5 per utricle) in this time is much less than the thousands of HCs that need to be cleared. Kaur et al. (2015) described macrophage infiltration in DT-treated mouse utricles to clear HC debris, and these macrophages did not overlap with the F-actin-rich phagosome structures that we attribute to SCs. Thus, it is likely that SCs form phagosomes for normal HC turnover and minimally increase their phagocytic activity after damage. We also found that phagosomes in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>DTR</sup></italic> mice were located in the normal HC layer, which contrasts with the basal location of phagosomes in normal utricles in the SC nuclear layer. In addition, some HCs in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>DTR</sup></italic> mice co-localized with TUNEL or had apoptotic features in their nuclei, but these cells with apoptotic features were not associated with phagosomes. This contrasts with normal utricles, in which HCs associated with phagosomes had normal chromatin and no signs of apoptosis. We added these points to the Results (subsection “SCs play a minor role in the clearance of dying HCs after DT-induced damage”) and created a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. In the Discussion, we compared phagocytosis between normal and HC damaged conditions (subsection “Phagocytosis by SCs mediates HC clearance in normal mouse utricles”, second and third paragraphs).</p><p><italic>5) Please review the statistical analysis of the data carefully (see comments from reviewer 2).</italic> </p><p>We consulted with a statistician and made changes to the statistical analyses in question. A specific response to these comments from reviewer 2 is presented below (see our seventeenth response to review 2).</p><p><italic>6) It was felt that the last paragraph of the Discussion makes an abrupt end to the manuscript and does not tie the story together well. Please aim to rewrite this, in particular to include a clear discussion of the physiological significance of the findings.</italic> </p><p>We have rewritten the last 3 paragraphs of the Discussion to address multiple reviewer comments. In addition to making estimates for how many HCs are turned over in a mouse’s lifetime, we conclude with a discussion for the possible functional significance of our findings. Specifically, we found evidence that type I HC are cleared, but no evidence that type I HCs are replaced. A progressive loss of type I HCs over time or disruption in the balance of type II HC clearance and addition, for example during aging, could result in vestibular dysfunction and balance disorders such as vertigo. Previous studies on HC numbers in aged mouse utricles and vestibular dysfunction during aging were also discussed (subsection “Significance of vestibular HC turnover in adult mice”).</p><p><italic>7) After discussion, it was felt that answering the interesting questions raised by reviewer 1 concerning mechanistic insights would be beyond the scope of this study; therefore, it is not essential to address these with further experimental work. However, if the authors have further discussion to add here, this would help to address these concerns.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the mechanism of HC clearance and addition is very important to understand and are currently designing studies to address these questions. In the Discussion, we expanded the paragraph focused on why HCs are targeted for clearance suggesting damage caused by normal “wear and tear,” changes in innervation or cell membrane integrity, or even that SCs act as primary phagocytes (subsection “Phagocytosis by SCs mediates HC clearance in normal mouse utricles”, last paragraph). We also added a new paragraph to compare the mechanism of phagocytosis in normal versus HC damaged utricles as well as the cell types involved in each circumstance (subsection “Phagocytosis by SCs mediates HC clearance in normal mouse utricles”, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The manuscript by Bucks et al. explores important issues, i.e. the ability of the mammalian inner ear to replace hair cells and the mechanisms by which this might occur. The study reports that hair cells in the adult mammalian utricle undergo removal and replacement by their surrounding supporting cells under both normal and damaging condition. The authors performed thorough analysis characterizing three individual mouse strains and using lineage tracing experiments to confirm the cellular origin of replaced hair cells. The manuscript is clear and technically sound. However, there are major issues regarding to the general interest of this study and the physiological significance of the findings.</italic> </p><p><italic>Major comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>Novelty: the paper refers to previous studies that showed the ability of adult rodents to regenerate small numbers of utricular HCs after ototoxin-induced damage. Was the magnitude of the regeneration in those studies much lower than in the current study? Since in this paper the authors show that the degree of cell replacement differs between mouse strains, are the present results more dramatic because the specific strain studies here? The authors need to discuss if the high degree of cell replacement seen in Swiss Webster mice is an anomaly given that replacement occurs at a much lower degree in the other strains.</italic> </p><p>We believe that there is confusion here between HC regeneration (which occurs after HC damage) and HC addition (which occurs under normal, physiological conditions). Previous studies have quantified HC regeneration in vestibular organs, but our manuscript is the first to definitively demonstrate and quantify HC addition in normal, adult utricles. While comparison of these quantifications is informative, they occur in two distinct environments and are not expected to result in the same number of added HCs. Also in our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, which quantifies the amount of HC regeneration in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>DTR</sup></italic> mice, we only counted the tdTomato-positive HCs fate-mapped by <italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic>mice. This is likely an underestimate of total HC regeneration reported in previous studies since not all SCs are labeled by tdTomato in these mice.</p><p>For Swiss Webster mice, our findings describe significantly more phagosomes for HC clearance, but there was no significant difference in protocadherin15-CD2 labeled stereocilia bundles (labeling immature HCs) compared to another strain. Thus, we do not have evidence that there is an increase in HC addition in Swiss Webster mice. As explained in Essential Comment #1, we expanded the Discussion to address Swiss Webster’s relatively high numbers of phagosomes (subsection “Significance of vestibular HC turnover in adult mice”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>The paper also refers to previous studies showing that supporting cells phagocytose hair cells after ototoxic damage in and mammals, and there have been reports of vestibular hair cell loss in the adult ear. Thus, it seems that this study just provides further evidence of the hair cell phagocytic capacity of supporting cells in the normal tissue.</italic> </p><p>While several studies have demonstrated SCs act as phagocytes after HC are damaged (by noise, ototoxins, etc.), there are no previous studies which demonstrate that SCs phagocytose HCs in normal utricles. In addition, the reports of HC loss are from the aged ear and our study is focused on young adult mice. There are no reports of HC loss in utricles of young normal mice. Therefore, our findings suggest a previously unknown role of SCs as phagocytes of type I and II vestibular HCs under normal conditions.</p><p><italic>Biological-physiological relevance: Although this study provides solid evidence of hair cell replacement in adult utricle, primarily by transdifferentiation of supporting cells, it remains unclear if 36.6 cells replaced per utricle at 15 wk post tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), which would translate into about 317 in 2.5 years, the lifespan of a mouse is biologically significant. This number of hair cells, if I'm not mistaken, represents a very small% of total hair cells in the utricle, making me wonder what is the physiological relevance of these findings. Furthermore, the number of cells replaced is much lower in several strains, further questioning the functional impact of such process. Does this percentage increase over a longer period of time? Are these tdTomato-traced cells functional? The replaced hair cells typically have shorter stereocilia bundles, how does this affect hair cell function? Do the replaced hair cells form ribbon synapses with vestibular ganglion terminals?</italic> </p><p>These are excellent points. We modified the end of the Discussion to address the functional significance of our findings (see Essential Comment #6). In addition, we explain in the Discussion (subsection “Significance of vestibular HC turnover in adult mice”, first paragraph) that our quantification of HC addition is likely an underestimate since not all SCs were fate-mapped and other cells (such as cells in the transitional epithelium) may also convert into HCs in the normal utricle.</p><p>As explained in our first response to reviewer 1, we do not have evidence that there is an increase in HC addition in Swiss Webster mice. Our data only show an increase in the number of phagosomes in Swiss Webster mice, which could be caused by strain-differences in actin dynamics and lifespan of the phagosomes.</p><p>Additionally, new HCs share many features with neighboring mature type II HCs, including myosin VIIA immunoreactivity, properly positioned nuclei, proper relative neck thicknesses, well defined stereocilia bundles, and basolateral processes. However, since we could not birth-date HCs in this study, we were not able to determine the degree to which new type II HCs are mature. Further, we did not perform any analyses that would inform on the functional status of the new HCs. Therefore, additional work is required to assess if HCs replaced in adult animals under normal conditions or after damage are functionally mature. These points were added to the Discussion (subsection “SCs transdifferentiate into type II HCs in normal mouse utricles”, fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>Mechanistic insights: Conversion of supporting cells to hair cells appears to be a critical pathway for hair cell regeneration, however, the mechanistic details are lacking for this study to be sufficiently novel and of general importance. For example, what is the signal that triggers the supporting cell transdifferentiation? How does loss of supporting cells (by conversion to hair cells) affect vestibular function? How are the vestibular ganglion processes remodeled during hair cells loss and replacement?</italic> </p><p>We agree that mechanisms of HC clearance and addition are very important to understand, and we are designing studies to address these questions. However, we agree with Essential Comment #7 that definition of mechanisms is beyond the scope of this initial report.</p><p><italic>Other issues:</italic> </p><p><italic>In the sixth paragraph of the subsection “Type I and II HCs are cleared by phagosomes from adult mouse utricles under normal conditions”: the authors report that in 5-10 week-old Swiss Webster mice, 71.7% of the on average 48 phagosomes per utricle are not hair cells, leaving the reader wondering what is the most intense phagosome activity in the utricle related to?</italic></p><p>This is a great question. We suspect the phagosomes that are not associated with HCs are empty phagosomes that have already finished HC engulfment and HC markers such as myosin VIIa are no longer detectable by immunostaining. These empty phagosomes are likely lingering in the sensory epithelium before they are slowly resorbed as was described in aminoglycoside-treated adult mouse utricles by Monzack et al., 2015. To address your question, future live imaging studies are needed. We revised the Results (subsection “Type I and II HCs are cleared by phagosomes from adult mouse utricles under normal conditions”, fourth paragraph) to address this point.</p><p><italic>The paper shows SCs phagocytose both type I and II HCs, but only generate type II HC. Does the number of type I HCs decrease with age in the undamaged utricle?</italic> </p><p>There are conflicting data on this point. In aged C57Bl/6NNia mice, Park et al. (1987) found a ~14% reduction in both type I and II HCs. However, Kirkegaard and Nyangaard (2005) found no evidence of HC loss in aged outbred mice for either HC type. We included these references and added more information for consequences of the possible loss of type I HCs in the Discussion (subsection “Significance of vestibular HC turnover in adult mice”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>Although several morphological criteria are used to classify HCs as type I or type II in utricle whole-mounts, use of specific antibodies, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–K</xref>, would be necessary to make a compelling case.</italic> </p><p>We opted to employ the 4 criteria that we have found, with considerable experience, to reliably define HC subtype. These criteria are thoroughly outlined in Materials and methods, illustrated in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>, published in our paper Pujol et al. (2014) and, for the case of some criteria, described clearly by several other investigators. The presence/absence of a basolateral process, and nuclear position, are sufficient to classify type I vs II HCs in most cases. In cases where we were not certain, we classified HCs as “unknown.”</p><p>Further, we were concerned that increasing the number of labels per utricle from 3 (DAPI, Myo7a, tdTomato) to 4 or 5 (DAPI, Myo7a, tdTomato, markers of type I and II HCs) would diminish the quality of immunolabeling and the reliability of analysis, while not providing much extra power in cellular identification.</p><p><italic>As shown by the authors, in Plp-CreERT2:ROSA26tdTomato mice, some Schwann cells in the stroma and cells in the region of transitional epithelium are also tdTomato-positive. Since F-actin enriched phagosomes are found in the SC nuclear layer, which is adjacent to the basal lamina and stroma, it could be a possibility that phagosomes are derived from Schwann cells. And phagosomes in the region near the transitional epithelium (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–A'</xref>) may be derived from cells in the transitional epithelium. These possibilities should be considered in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>Please see our response above to Essential Comment #2.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>: it would be helpful is the authors would explain what is the PCDH15-CD12 signal in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</italic> </p><p><italic>Thank you for this suggestion.

Please discuss to explain this.</italic> </p><p><italic>To the best of our knowledge there is no evidence that SCs are ejected from the epithelium. Perhaps this is a typo? After utricular HC damage by aminoglycosides, others have reported that the apical portion of the HC is cleaved and ejected but the cell body degenerates within the epithelium (Li et al., 1995; Bird et al., 2010; Monzack et al., 2015). To determine if the apical portion of HCs are also ejected under normal conditions, we acquired new data where normal utricles were labeled with antibodies to espin and PMCA2, which label stereocilia but not other structures in the sensory epithelium (Dumont et al., 2001; Li et al., 2004). While we detected bright labeling with each antibody in stereocilia, none of the HCs associated with phagosomes contained brightly labeled foci resembling stereocilia. This finding suggests that the apical part of the HC is ejected apically prior to translocation or that stereocilia degenerate during translocation, during normal clearance. Interestingly, espin antibodies did label the actin-rich spikes. Initially, we thought this could indicate the spike is derived from stereocilia. However, spikes were not labeled for antibodies to PMCA2, suggesting that this is not the case. We have added new images to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (panels 2C-D”) and new text in the Results (subsection “Type I and II HCs are cleared by phagosomes from adult mouse utricles under normal conditions”, eighth paragraph) and Discussion (subsection “Phagocytosis by SCs mediates HC clearance in normal mouse utricles”, second paragraph).</italic></p><p><italic>When SCs clear HCs after ototoxin-mediated injury, they first produce an actin cable to constrict the HC.

The suggestion that the actin spike we observed (and compared to cytocauds) is the first sign that a HC is targeted for clearance is just a hypothesis proposed in our model. As stated in this same paragraph, further studies including live imaging are needed to test the model and determine whether the actin spike is a sign of HC degeneration or if it is unrelated. We clarified that this is our hypothesis and also presented the alternative that the actin spike does not play a role in HC clearance.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E'</xref> is the merge?

This would be better support for the comparison to the distribution of atoh1.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, lower magnification images of the PCDH15-CD2 labeling in a utricle are not helpful to show the distribution of HCs with short bundles, since individual bundles are obscured by long type I HC bundles and co-localization of the label with stereocilia is only defined clearly upon examination at high magnification. We addressed this question by constructing a map based of PCDH15-CD2-positive bundles using 100X images of the whole utricle (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>– aren't these addressing the same or at least overlapping questions?

Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) were generated with a different CreER line. Here we used Atoh1-CreER<sup>TM</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup> mice, which labeled ~ 40% of type II HCs, allowing us to address whether type II HCs convert into type I HCs over time. With experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we asked “do SCs give rise to HCs, and if so, which type?”. Experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> were conducted to answer the question “do some type II HCs convert into type I HCs over time?”.</italic> </p><p><italic>In the last paragraph of the subsection “Atoh1-CreER<sup>TM</sup>-labeled type II HCs did not convert into type I HCs under normal conditions”: Statistics on proportion is problematic because proportions are ratios, which are not normally distributed. They also do not address the potential interdependence of the numerator and denominator. A test for correlation between counts would be better – i.e. does slope differ between time points. Also, if the numerator and denominator are not truly dependent and independent, you might consider reduced major axis regression. It also seems like the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> might suffice to answer this.</italic> </p><p>We deeply appreciated this comment and consulted with a statistician on the most appropriate test to analyze these data. After considerable deliberation, we selected an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), since changes in labeled type I HCs is dependent on the number of total number of labeled cells per utricle. (In <italic>Atoh1-CreER<sup>TM</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup> </italic>mice, we observed variability in the total number of tdTomato-positive cells across timepoints.) In addition, we determined that the best way to test our hypothesis (that type II HCs convert into type I HCs) was to determine whether the number of type I tdTomato-labeled HCs increased over time. A decrease in the number of type II tdTomato-labeled HCs does not necessarily mean conversion. These cells could have died or been phagocytosed. Analysis of tdTomato-labeled unknown HC counts is also not informative, since we were not able to determine their HC type. Therefore, we normalized the number of tdTomato-positive type I HCs to total labeled cells at each timepoint. By ANCOVA, there was no statistical difference between any of the timepoints, which suggests that type II HCs do not convert into type I HCs.</p><p>We replaced the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) and changed the relevant text in Results (subsection “<italic>Atoh1-CreER<sup>TM</sup></italic>-labeled type II HCs did not convert into type I HCs under normal conditions”, last paragraph).

It is not clear to me from the data presented whether the phagocytic process that is suggested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> is any different from the mechanisms that have been described and shown directly through live-imaging in both the avian and mammalian utricle. It seems very possible that the same process that has been described for ototoxically damage cells could be responsible for the removal of the cells described here. Is there any reason not to conclude that a similar process is used? This points warrants further discussion (note – see point 12 below)?</italic> </p><p>This is a great point. We added new data for the analysis of phagosomes after HC damage in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>DTR</sup></italic>mice and found some differences from our observations of phagocytosis in normal utricles (see Essential Comment #4). We also obtained new data to assess whether the apical portion of HCs are ejected from the epithelium in normal utricles by labeling with antibodies to the stereocilia proteins, espin and PMCA2 (see response to reviewer 2 comment 3).</p><p><italic>2) There is a description of &quot;association&quot; between phagosomes and hair cells e.g. subsection “Type I and II HCs are cleared by phagosomes from adult mouse utricles under normal conditions”, third paragraph, fourth and sixth paragraphs. A qualification of what constituted such &quot;associations&quot; and how there were determined by the observer is required. Does this association mean that there was clear evidence of engulfment of a hair cell within a phagosome?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for making us aware of this lack in clarity. We added new text to better define the term “association” between phagosomes and HCs as: 1) a F-actin ring-like structure that fully encircled a HC body and was connected to a basket-like structure devoid of HC material or 2) a basket-like structure with one or more F-actin-rich processes that extended laterally and either contacted nearby HCs or pierced and entered their cytoplasm (subsection “Type I and II HCs are cleared by phagosomes from adult mouse utricles under normal conditions”, fourth paragraph). We also added a new video (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), which shows a 3D reconstruction of a phagosome with a F-actin spike associated with a HC. The image can be rotated about the y-axis and shows the lattice structure of the basket-like phagosome.</p><p><italic>3) In order to call this structure a phagosome there needs to be better description of how the actin rich structures that are shown are linked to the supporting cells that presumably generated them – this is hard to see this from the images provided. Have the authors for example tried to reconstruct the phagosome structure in 3D from the confocal stacks they have?</italic> </p><p>We used two mouse lines to label SCs (<italic>Plp1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>:ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic>and <italic>Lfng-eGFP –</italic> new to the revision) and found clear overlap of labeled SCs and F-actin phagosome structures (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As discussed above, we generated a movie of a 3D reconstruction of a basket-like phagosome with a F-actin spike piercing a HC in the SC layer (new <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) to help better visualize the phagosome structure. However, the mechanisms by which SCs produce F-actin phagosomes must be addressed in future experiments, using live imaging experiments or serial immuno-EM, as eluded to in the second paragraph of the subsection “Phagocytosis by SCs mediates HC clearance in normal mouse utricles” and in the second paragraph of the subsection “Significance of vestibular HC turnover in adult mice”.</p><p><italic>4) Is there something unusual about Swiss Webster mice? They have ~3x as many of the actin rich structures as the other two strains?</italic> </p><p>See Essential comment #1 above.</p><p><italic>5) The phagosome-like structures are somewhat regionally restricted, being found predominantly in the peri-striolar region.

The term “rate” has been removed from the text, since the data were not generated with more than two timepoints.</p><p><italic>10) The finding that only Type II hair cells are replaced in the mammal has implications for the recovery of function since the Type I cells provide/send different information to brain. Does this finding concur with what is known/has been shown for the functional recovery that has been described in other work?</italic> </p><p>This is a good discussion point that we missed. We added new text to the Discussion to address the functional consequences that may occur if type I HCs were progressively lost over time (subsection “Significance of vestibular HC turnover in adult mice”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>11) The authors show in fate mapping experiments that ~2 hair cells are added per week. If we assume that the utricle maintains its normal number of cells over this period (which is thought to be the case) then the rate of removal should be the same. Even if the fate-mapping studies are not 100% effective and we assume a 75% efficacy then the simplest estimation is that there would be~3 (or just under) hair cells turned over per week, rather than the 10 suggested at the end of the subsection “Estimates of the rate of HCs turnover in adult mice”. Using this estimate we can see that the phagocytic structures that are described here is a somewhat long lived with lifetimes &gt;1 week, indicating some differences to those phagosomes already described by others.</italic> </p><p>We revised our estimation for the rate of HC turnover in the discussion and made conservative estimates solely based on the fate-mapping data since other analysis (phagosome, PDCH15-CD2, and ATOH1-GFP counts) lack a temporal perspective (subsection “Significance of vestibular HC turnover in adult mice”). In addition, other cells in the organ besides SCs (i.e. cells in the TE or stroma) could provide additional new HCs and were not fate-mapped in this study. We added this point as well.</p><p><italic>Other comments:i) Subsection “Type I and II HCs are cleared by phagosomes from adult mouse utricles under normal conditions”, fourth paragraph: How do the authors know that this is a calyceal afferent from the image shown in Panel 1F?

We added information to the figure legend pointing out that this particular HC happens to have increased staining compared to its neighbors, but is unlikely due to its being tdTomato-positive. We have also added new panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B’” and C””</xref>) showing myosin VIIa as a single channel.</p></body></sub-article></article>
