We investigated neuron-glia signaling in the developing retina, where we demonstrate that retinal waves reliably induce calcium transients in Müller glial cells (MCs). During cholinergic waves, MC calcium transients were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, whereas during glutamatergic waves, MC calcium transients were inhibited by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, indicating that the responsiveness of MCs changes to match the neurotransmitter used to support retinal waves. Using an optical glutamate sensor we show that the decline in MC calcium transients is caused by a reduction in the amount of glutamate reaching MCs. Together, these studies indicate that neurons and MCs exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of retinal maturation that is enabled by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09590.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09590.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09590.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A structure at the back of the eye known as the retina is essential for vision. When light hits the retina, cells called neurons produce electrical signals that lead to the release of chemicals known as neurotransmitters. When these chemicals reach a neighboring neuron, a corresponding electrical signal is produced in this cell. In this way, information about what we can see is ultimately transmitted to the brain.</p><p>The retina also contains cells that are not neurons, such as Müller glial cells. These cells span the thickness of the retina, and appear well placed to interact with all of the different types of neuron in the retina. Other types of glial cells help the neural circuits in the brain to develop, but it is not clear whether Müller cells perform the same role in the developing retina.</p><p>Newborn mice do not open their eyes until around two weeks after they are born, during which time their retina continues to develop. The retinal neurons are already active throughout this period, and spontaneously generate periodic bursts of electrical activity that spreads across the developing retina in waves. Now, Rosa, Bos et al. show that in newborn mice, these waves also trigger brief, or ‘transient’, increases in the concentration of calcium ions inside Müller cells. Exactly how the Müller cells respond depends on which neurotransmitters are released during waves.</p><p>A few days before the mice open their eyes, the number of calcium transients in Müller cells decreases sharply. At the same time, neurons continue to spontaneously release waves of one particular neurotransmitter called glutamate. Rosa, Bos et al. used a sensor that showed where glutamate is found in the developing retina. This revealed that the decrease in calcium transients as the retina matures is due to less glutamate reaching the Müller cells.</p><p>These findings reveal that Müller cells are involved in the spontaneous electrical activity seen in the retina during a critical period of retinal development. The next challenge is to determine how this neuronal-glial cell signaling helps the retina to mature.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is rich research history demonstrating the important role glial cells play in developing and maintaining neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garrido, 2013</xref>). In the mature brain, glial cells provide structural scaffolding and create physical barriers that compartmentalize synapses and limit diffusion of neurotransmitters. In addition, glial cells express a variety of neurotransmitter receptors. Activation of glial receptors causes increases in intracellular calcium that in turn may lead to the secretion of factors that influence circuit function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haydon and Nedergaard, 2015</xref>). In the developing brain, glial cells secrete factors that are important for neuronal differentiation, migration, axonal pathfinding and synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarke and Barres, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garrido, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanisms that are used for neuron-glial signaling in the developing CNS remain poorly defined.</p><p>There are three types of glial cells in the retina: Müller cells (MCs), astrocytes, and microglial cells. MCs, the principal glial cells of the retina, stretch radially across its thickness from the outer limiting membrane to the inner limiting membrane, sending processes throughout the inner and outer plexiform layers. MC processes envelop synapses of every neuron type, placing these cells in an ideal position to receive and respond to neuronal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newman and Reichenbach, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Newman, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reichenbach and Bringmann, 2013</xref>). In adult retina, MCs maintain retinal homeostasis and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrne et al., 2013</xref>), and more recently they have been implicated in delivery of retinol to replenish cone opsin chromophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). In zebrafish, MC ablation does not affect the laminar organization of the inner plexiform layer (IPL, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Randlett et al., 2013</xref>) or the structure or organization of synapses in the outer plexiform layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams et al., 2010</xref>), in sharp contrast to ablation of MCs in developing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubois-Dauphin et al., 2000</xref>) and adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2012</xref>), which leads to dramatic rearrangements retinal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrne et al., 2013</xref>). However, unlike radial glial cells in the cortex and cerebellum, the role of MCs in retinal development has not been fully explored.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"/>MCs are the last retinal cell types to mature, integrating into neuronal circuits during the first two postnatal weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jadhav et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams et al., 2010</xref>) when the inner retina is undergoing robust synaptogenesis. During this developmental period, the retina is spontaneously active, and ganglion cells (the output cells of the retina) exhibit depolarizations that spread laterally across the retina, a phenomenon termed retinal waves. These waves are mediated by circuits that change as the retina matures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blankenship and Feller, 2010</xref>). From postnatal day 1 (P1) to P9, retinal waves are mediated by cholinergic circuits. As bipolar cells integrate into the circuit (P10–P14), the waves become mediated by glutamatergic signaling. At eye opening (P14), light activated signaling begins and retinal waves cease. Both cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ford et al., 2012</xref>) and glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blankenship and Feller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Firl et al., 2013</xref>) retinal waves are associated with volume release of neurotransmitter, where the neurotransmitter is not restricted to the synaptic cleft, but spills out into the extracellular space, allowing activation of receptors on nearby ganglion cells. Hence, these waves provide a robust source of neurotransmitter that could mediate periodic activation of MCs during retinal development.</p><p>Here we investigated if MCs participate in retinal waves as they integrate into neuronal circuits. We simultaneously performed whole-cell recordings of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and two-photon imaging of calcium indicators or glutamate sensors expressed specifically in MCs in order to investigate if neurotransmitters released during retinal waves reliably induce calcium transients in MCs. In addition, we determined which receptors mediate these neuron-glia interactions. Our results indicate that MCs express a complement of receptors that allow detection of neurotransmitters released during retinal waves, resulting in parallel activation of this glial network prior to eye opening.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Developing MCs exhibit calcium transients that correlate with retinal waves</title><p>MCs undergo a dramatic morphological transformation during the second postnatal week, a time when there are robust retinal waves.

Since the stalks and processes of MCs exhibited similar calcium responses, we pooled their results together throughout this study. We detected no wave-evoked calcium transients in other parts of MCs outside the IPL (i.e., in their somata, data not shown). The percentage of regions of interest (ROIs, which correspond to compartments of individual MCs, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) that responded to a wave (termed responsive MCs) was high at P7 (42 ± 10.2%, 1326 ROIs from 11 retinas) and at P9 (48 ± 4.6%, 3027 ROIs from 14 retinas), but significantly lower at P11 (13 ± 2.2%, 872 ROIs from 6 retinas, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

MC calcium transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, top black traces) were correlated with RGC compound excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) that are known to be mediated by the volume release of ACh and the activation of neuronal nicotinic ACh receptors (AChRs) on RGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, bottom grey traces) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ford et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, this ACh is released by cholinergic amacrine cells that also release ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duarte et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, we tested the effect of AChR and ATP receptor blockers on wave-induced MC calcium transients. Although the wave-induced transients were blocked by the muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) antagonist atropine (50 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), they were not blocked by the ATP receptor antagonist suramin (100 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that at P7, MC calcium transients are evoked by volume release of ACh, but not by ATP, and these transients are mediated by mAChRs on MCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MC calcium transients correlated with glutamatergic retinal waves are limited by the extent of glutamate spillover and are mediated by AMPA receptors</title><p>At P9, circuits mediating retinal waves change from cholinergic to glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blankenship and Feller, 2010</xref>), and glutamatergic synapses between bipolar cells and their postsynaptic targets first appear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoon et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, at P9 cholinergic and/or glutamatergic transmission could activate MC calcium transients. To determine the involvement of cholinergic transmission in MC signaling at this stage of development, we examined their response to focal application of ACh. Short applications of ACh induced calcium transients that were blocked by the mAChR blocker atropine at P9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), but bath application of atropine did not change the percentage of wave-induced MC calcium transients (57 ± 12.6% in control and 60.2 ± 7.8% in atropine; p = 0.54, n = 4). These results indicate that cholinergic signaling does not mediate neuron-MC signaling at this age. We then determined the role of glutamate in triggering these responses. Application of exogenous L-glutamate reliably evoked MC calcium transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). These responses were not blocked by atropine, ruling out the possibility that this agonist acted indirectly by stimulating release of ACh from amacrine cells. L-glutamate-evoked MC calcium transients were significantly reduced by a cocktail of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (iGluR: 20 μM AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist DNQX, 50 μM NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), but were only slightly reduced by a mixture of metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (mGluR: 8 μM LY341495, 100 μM MCPG, 100 μM MTEP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Blocking AMPA receptors produced substantial but incomplete inhibition of the L-glutamate-evoked response, whereas blocking NMDA receptors had no significant effect. These results suggest that glutamate elicits MC calcium transients primarily through activation of AMPA receptors, although a modest contribution of mGluRs is also observed. Notably, the reduction of L-glutamate-evoked calcium transients by glutamate receptor blockers occurred at all ages, not just during the period when glutamatergic waves predominate, indicating that MCs express glutamate receptors throughout this period of development.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09590.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Wave-induced glial signaling is limited by extent of glutamate spillover.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of retinal cross-section illustrates focal application of the agonist (green) at the junction between the IPL and the GCL; labeling as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

First, MCs are known to express AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wakakura and Yamamoto, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sullivan and Miller, 2010</xref>). Second, glutamate-induced MC calcium transients depend upon the activation of ionotropic AMPARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Third, the frequencies of glutamate and calcium transients in MCs are indistinguishable, indicating that MC calcium transients are driven by glutamate reaching the MC membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D;</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Establishing that wave-induced MC calcium transients are mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors on MCs requires selective inhibition of these receptors; however, this approach is complicated by the fact that depolarization of RGCs during retinal waves also depends on AMPAR activation. Since the AMPAR antagonist DNQX may have an effect on glutamate release from bipolar cells, we tried to elucidate its effects in this circuit. In the presence of DNQX, we simultaneously monitored EPSCs from RGCs with whole-cell recordings and glutamate release from bipolar cells with neuronal iGluSnFR imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankenship et al., 2009</xref>), DNQX (20 µM) significantly decreased the amplitude of the postsynaptic current in RGCs. However, it did not change the amount of wave-induced glutamate release from bipolar cells monitored using iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). With this knowledge, we used DNQX to determine the role of AMPARs in wave-induced MC calcium transients. These experiments were conducted in the presence of DL-TBOA to maximize the amount of glutamate spillover. We found that DNQX significantly decreased the percentage of responsive MCs during waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), whereas the NMDAR antagonist D-AP5 (50 µM) had no significant effect on MC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>; 703 ROIs in control and 656 ROIs in D-AP5 from 2 retinas). Our results strongly suggest that glutamate acts directly on MC AMPARs to increase intracellular calcium. However, it will be necessary to selectively delete AMPARs from MCs to establish their contribution to MC calcium signaling during this period of development.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09590.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Neuron-glia interaction is mediated by ionotropic AMPA glutamate receptors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left</italic>, Diagram of a retinal cross-section illustrates neuronal expression of iGluSnFR (green) in the IPL and simultaneous voltage-clamp recording of a RGC (grey). <italic>Right</italic>, Simultaneous imaging of AAV9-2YF-hSynapsin1-iGluSnFR signals in neuronal membranes (green traces) and whole-cell voltage-clamp recording of a RGC (grey trace, V<sub>m</sub> = −60 mV) monitored in the same field of view at P9 in control and in the presence of 20 μM DNQX.

To determine the extent that mGluRs are involved in wave-induced MC calcium transients in the retina we performed two experiments. First, we conducted simultaneous whole-cell recordings from RGCs and two-photon calcium imaging of MC activity in the presence of mGluR antagonists (8 μM LY341495, 100 μM MCPG, 100 μM MTEP). In these conditions, there was a small, but not significant, decrease in the percentage of responsive MCs at P9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), consistent with the contribution of mGluRs to MC calcium transients evoked by exogenous L-glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). Second, we imaged the spontaneous activity of MCs in retinas isolated from mice that lack IP<sub>3</sub>R2 (IP<sub>3</sub>R2-KO mice), which has been shown to be required for metabotropic receptor-induced calcium signaling in adult MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lipp et al., 2009</xref>), using a fluorescent calcium dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). The density of MC labeling was not dramatically different between GCaMP3 expressing mice vs MCs loaded with organic dyes, although this was not compared quantitatively. Wave-like calcium transients persisted in IP<sub>3</sub>R2-KO MCs and a similar percentage of MCs participated in these events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>) indicating that IP<sub>3</sub>–dependent calcium signaling contributes minimally to MC calcium transients during retinal waves. Together, these findings suggest that volume release of glutamate during retinal waves evokes MC calcium transients primarily by activating AMPA receptors on MCs.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09590.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>mGluR and mAChRs contribute minimally to wave-induced MC calcium transients at P9.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of mGluR-mediated pathway for increases in intracellular calcium in Müller glial cell.

We found that retinal waves were correlated with calcium transients in a large proportion of MCs, demonstrating that spontaneous activity encompasses both neuronal and glial networks at this age. Our physiological results indicate that MCs express multiple neurotransmitter receptor types throughout this period, allowing neuronal control of MC activity to be sustained as neuronal synchronization shifts from being dependent on cholinergic to glutamatergic signaling. The proportion of MCs that responded to waves with calcium transients decreased significantly from P9 to P11, despite the presence of retinal waves. This age-dependent decline in MC activation during retinal waves was caused by an increase in glutamate transporter expression, which restricted glutamate spillover from nearby synapses limiting activation of MC AMPARs. These data indicate that MCs in the developing retina use multiple signaling pathways to participate in spontaneous, correlated activity with neurons during a crucial period of retinal development.</p><p>Many different signaling mechanisms have been implicated in inducing calcium transients in astroglial cells throughout the peripheral and central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Volterra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haydon and Nedergaard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nimmerjahn and Bergles, 2015</xref>). The robustness and mechanisms of signaling vary tremendously, even at the same synapses, with age, preparation, and state of arousal. Our data indicate that MCs in the retina prior to eye opening are capable of responding to different neurotransmitters with increases in intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2A, 3A</xref>). Neurotransmitter-evoked calcium transients were observed in the stalks and lateral processes of MCs that transverse the IPL during a time when there is robust synaptogenesis. These multiple receptors allow MCs to detect neurotransmitter released during retinal waves whether it is ACh or glutamate, thereby extending the developmental period over which neuron-glia signaling occurs.</p><p>The neuron-glia signaling we observed between neurons and MCs in the retina during glutamatergic waves is similar to signaling that occurs in Bergmann glial cells (BGs), a type of radial astroglial cell found in the cerebellum. BGs express calcium permeable AMPARs that are activated by glutamate released at parallel and climbing fiber synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergles et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark and Barbour, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Piet and Jahr, 2007</xref>), raising the possibility that AMPAR expression may be a conserved properties of radial-type astroglial cells. Although the role of AMPARs in BG activity is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31a">Müller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iino et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nimmerjahn et al., 2009</xref>), in vivo studies indicate that calcium signaling in BGs during locomotion depends on the activation of AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nimmerjahn et al., 2009</xref>) and disruption of this signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iino et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saab et al., 2012</xref>), results in prolonged synaptic events that are associated with altered motor behavior and motor learning. Moreover, the mechanism of interaction between neurons and MCs we observed during cholinergic retinal waves is similar to previous findings in visual cortex and hippocampus, where cholinergic neuron stimulation leads to astrocyte calcium transients via activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and require IP3R2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8a">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31b">Navarrete et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Whether neuronal activity during retinal waves guides the development of MCs is still unclear. MCs exhibit dramatic morphological changes during the period from P7–P11 as their fine processes grow laterally into the IPL and ensheath synapses. Ensheathment of synapses by astrocytes has been shown to promote functional isolation of synaptic signaling by creating a barrier to diffusion of neurotransmitters and by placing neurotransmitter transporters near sites of release. It is possible that ablation of AMPARs in MCs would result in retraction of the lateral processes away from synapses, as observed in BGs after inhibition of calcium permeable AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iino et al., 2001</xref>) or genetic ablation of GluA1 and GluA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saab et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings in the developing retina differ from studies performed in the adult retina, in which glutamate does not evoke calcium transients in MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Newman and Zahs, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Newman, 2005</xref>), suggesting that glutamaterigic signaling through AMPARs in these cells may be limited to the early stages of synapse formation and refinement.</p><p>Astrocytes have also been shown to play critical roles in promoting the refinement and maturation of neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stevens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarke and Barres, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2015</xref>) by secreting synaptogenic factors, such as thrombospondin, hevin, protocadherins, BDNF, and TGF-beta, which are critical for synapse formation between RGCs and their central targets in the brain (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung and Barres, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarke and Barres, 2013</xref>). In addition, astrocytes play an important role in refining nascent circuits in the visual system by engulfing unused or inappropriate synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings indicate that robust signaling occurs between retinal neurons and MCs between the ages P7 and P11, a time period when there is robust synaptogenesis in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoon et al., 2014</xref>). The close lineage relationship and functional similarities between astrocytes and MCs increase the possibility that MCs perform similar roles in the retina, particularly in regions such as the IPL where they are the sole astroglial cell.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that changes in intracellular calcium can trigger the release of so-called gliotransmitters such as ATP, glutamate and D-serine from astrocytes that can influence the activity of surrounding neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newman, 2015</xref>). In the retina, activation of AMPARs promotes the release of D-serine, a co-agonist of NMDA receptors in ganglion cells, that has been shown to play an important role in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stevens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sullivan and Miller, 2010</xref>), raising the possibility that MC activity induced during retinal waves participates in synaptic refinement through release of gliotransmitters and/or synaptogenic factors. Selective manipulation of MC calcium signaling during this period of remarkable refinement will help to further define their roles in the development of distinct retinal circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>GLASTCreER::GCAMP3</italic> mice were generated by cross breeding GLAST<italic>-CreER </italic>BAC transgenic mice [Tg(Slc1a3-cre/ERT)1Nat/J] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14a">de Melo et al., 2012</xref>) to <italic>ROSA26-lsl-GCaMP3</italic> reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paukert et al., 2014</xref>).

In addition, tdTomato confocal images were acquired from retinal slices, while GCaMP3 two-photon images were acquired from whole mount flat retinas, where signal strength was reduced as a function of depth.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Two-photon imaging</title><p>Two-photon imaging of neurons and MCs in the IPL was performed using either a custom-modified two-photon microscope (Fluoview 300, Olympus America, Melville, NY) or a custom-built two-photon microscope. Time series images were acquired using Olympus 60×, 1 NA, LUMPlanFLN objectives, and two-photon excitation of GCAMP3 was evoked with an ultrafast pulsed laser (Chameleon Ultra, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) tuned to 920 nm on both microscopes. For imaging Cal520 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) the laser was tuned to 820 nm. The microscope was controlled by Fluoview Viewer software or ScanImage software (version 3.8, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scanimage.org/">www.scanimage.org</ext-link>). Images (256 × 256 pixels) were acquired at 0.74 or 1.7 Hz at 2 or 4 ms/line. Scan parameters were [pixels/line × lines/frame (frame rate in Hz)]: [256 × 256 (0.74 − 1.7)], at 2–4 ms/line. Line scans were obtained at 300 Hz and down-sampled to 30 Hz for presentation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were made from whole-mount retinas continuously superfused in oxygenated ACSF (32–34°C) at a rate of 2–4 ml/min. Retinas were visualized under infrared illumination (870 nm). Voltage-clamp recordings from somas of ganglion cells (holding potential of −60/−65 mV) were obtained using glass microelectrodes of 4–5 MΩ (PC-10 pipette puller; Narishige, East Meadow, NY) filled with an internal solution containing (in mM): 110 CsMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.8 NaCl, 4 EGTA, 5 TEA-Cl, 4 adenosine 5′-triphosphate (magnesium salt), 0.3 guanosine 5′-triphosphate (trisodium salt), 20 HEPES and 10 phosphocreatine (disodium salt), pH 7.2 and 290 mOsm. The liquid junction potential correction for this solution was −13 mV. Signals were acquired using pCLAMP 9 recording software and a Multiclamp 700 A amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), sampled at 20 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz.</p><p>RGC dendritic stratification was visualized by including 20 μM Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) in the intracellular solution. The dendritic morphology of dye-injected RGCs was reconstructed by two-photon imaging with the laser tuned to 780 nm. Images (RGCs and whole retina) were acquired at z intervals of 0.5 μm using a 60× objective (Olympus 60×, 1 NA, LUMPlanFLN). Images were later reconstructed from image stacks with ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Pharmacology</title><p>For pharmacology experiments, recordings were performed 10 min after perfusion of ACSF with pharmacological agents at the following concentrations into the recording chamber: 25 μM DL-TBOA, 50 μM D-AP5, 20 μM DNQX, 100 μM MCPG, 100 μM MTEP, 8 μM LY341495, 50 μM atropine, and 100 μM suramin hexasodium salt. All compounds were purchased from Tocris Bioscience, Minneapolis, MN and prepared in dH<sub>2</sub>O and diluted to the final concentration in ACSF. DL-TBOA was prepared in 0.1% DMSO.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Focal agonist stimulation</title><p>Direct activation of receptors on MCs was accomplished by repeated short applications (100 ms) of L-glutamate (1 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), acetylcholine (ACh, 1 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), ATP (1 mM, Tocris Bioscience, Minneapolis, MN), or ACSF to the IPL via a pipette that was similar to the recording pipette and a Picospritzer (PV830 Pneumatic PicoPump, World Precisions Instruments, Sarasota, FL) set at 20–30 psi.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Videos were analyzed offline using SARFIA (freely available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.igorexchange.com/project/SARFIA">http://www.igorexchange.com/project/SARFIA</ext-link>), a suite of macros running in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorostkar et al., 2010</xref>) Prior to analysis, images were registered to correct movements in the X and Y directions. Videos were rejected if the plane of focus altered significantly during imaging acquisition. For GLAST<italic>CreER::GCaMP3</italic> and ShH10-CMV-iGluSnFR recordings, ROIs containing both stalks and lateral processes of MCs were chosen using a filtering algorithm based on a Laplace operator and segmented by applying a threshold, as described in detail in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorostkar et al., 2010</xref>). This algorithm defined most or all of the ROIs that an experienced observer would recognize by eye. For AAV9-2YF-hSynapsin1-iGluSnFR recordings, the entire field of view (256 × 256 pixels) was divided into 16 identical squares and each square was considered one ROI. In both cases, individual ROI responses were then normalized as the relative change in fluorescence (∆F/F), smoothed by binomial Gaussian filtering, and analyzed to detect activity using custom-made scripts based on a first derivate detection algorithm. A threshold set at ∼2 times (when imaging at 0.74 Hz) or at ∼4 times (when imaging at 1.7 Hz) the standard deviation of the time derivative trace was used to detect changes in fluorescence within the ROIs. The reliability of this algorithm to detect calcium and glutamate activity was first tested by comparing the results with manual activity detection. For the experiments using focal application of agonists, a threshold set at ∼2–3 times the standard deviation of the derivate trace was used to detect activity. In this paper, the fluorescent intensity of ROIs is reported as the average intensity across all pixels within its area. Fluorescent responses are reported as normalized increases as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mtext>F</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mtext>F</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>F</mml:mtext><mml:mi>−</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mtext>F</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>o</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>F</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>o</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where F is the instantaneous fluorescence induced by a spontaneous activity or by a focal application of the agonist and F<sub>o</sub> is the baseline fluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Group measurements are expressed as mean ±SD.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it is shown that P9 retina from IP<sub>3</sub>R2 KO mice still show wave-induced calcium responses, which is interpreted as meaning release of calcium from intracellular stores is not involved in the calcium response at this age. Are the calcium responses present in P7 retina from IP<sub>3</sub>R2 KO mice when the pharmacology suggests that acetylcholine acts through GPCR muscarinic receptors?</p><p>2) A series of experiments are used to determine if glutamate acts through AMPA receptors on Muller glia to increase intracellular calcium, rather than an indirect effect of glutamate on neuronal AMPA receptors. However, without doing the genetic experiment of removing AMPA receptors specifically from Muller glia, it is hard to make this conclusion. Please include a statement clarifying this in the text.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) The authors only briefly discuss their method for imaging only MC processes. Given the possibilities that Cre could be induced in late progenitors at their early experimental time points, and that their dye loading experiments are nonspecific, could they elaborate on how they can be certain that their optical signals originate solely in MCs?</p><p>2) Similarly to the first point, could the authors comment on the extent of reporter expression? Are most/all MCs hit, or a subset? Also, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> in the GLAST::tdTomato channel, it appears that MC cell bodies are clearly visible in the INL.

These experiments are non-trivial for the members of the Feller lab since it requires them to travel to Johns Hopkins. As suggested by the editor, we have modified the text in the third paragraph of the Discussion to include this comparison to previous studies that have been done in the CNS:</p><p>“Moreover, the mechanism of interaction between neurons and MCs we observed during cholinergic waves is similar to previous findings in visual cortex and hippocampus where cholinergic stimulation leads to astrocyte calcium transients via activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and are abolished in IP<sub>3</sub>R2-KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8a">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31b">Navarrete et al., 2012</xref>).”</p><p><italic>2) A series of experiments are used to determine if glutamate acts through AMPA receptors on Muller glia to increase intracellular calcium, rather than an indirect effect of glutamate on neuronal AMPA receptors. However, without doing the genetic experiment of removing AMPA receptors specifically from Muller glia, it is hard to make this conclusion. Please include a statement clarifying this in the text.</italic></p><p>We have added a sentence qualifying our result in the subsection “MC calcium transients correlated with glutamatergic retinal waves are limited by the extent of glutamate spillover and are mediated by AMPA receptors”:</p><p>“Our results strongly suggest that glutamate acts directly on MC AMPARs to increase intracellular calcium. However, it will be necessary to selectively delete AMPARs from MCs to establish their contribution to MC calcium signaling during this period of development.”</p><p><italic>Minor points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The authors only briefly discuss their method for imaging only MC processes.

We have also added the following text to the Results:</p><p>“There was not a dramatic difference in the density of labeling when we compared genetically labeled versus AM dye loaded MCs, though this was not compared quantitatively.”</p><p>To address the second point regarding the visibility of cell bodies, we have added the following text to the Methods<underline>:</underline></p><p><italic>“</italic>Note, the labeling in the somas for the GLAST<italic>CreER</italic>::tdTomato […] where signal strength was reduced as a function of depth.”</p><p>To address this same issue for ShH10-CMV-iGluSnFR, we have added the following text to Results:</p><p><italic>“</italic>The iGluSnFR signal is proportional to the amount of glutamate reaching the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>); thus, the lack of fluorescence in the INL where MC cell bodies are located indicates that during early development there is little glutamate release outside of the IPL.”</p><p>To clarify this point for reviewers, we transfected GFP in MCs using the same AAV variant (ShH10) to illustrate the uniform expression of GFP along the entire MC, including expression in the soma (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09590.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09590.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09590.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09590-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) The bulk of the Discussion is spent discussing possible connections between MCs, Bergmann glial cells, and astrocytes generally.
