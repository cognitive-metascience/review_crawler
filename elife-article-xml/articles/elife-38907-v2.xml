The cognitive factors underpinning this decline are poorly understood. We predicted that maintaining coherence relies on effective regulation of activated semantic knowledge about the world, and particularly on the selection of currently relevant semantic representations to drive speech production. To test this, we collected 840 speech samples along with measures of executive and semantic ability from 60 young and older adults, using a novel computational method to quantify coherence. Semantic selection ability predicted coherence, as did level of semantic knowledge and a measure of domain-general executive ability. These factors fully accounted for the age-related coherence deficit. Our results indicate that maintaining coherence in speech becomes more challenging as people age because they accumulate more knowledge but are less able to effectively regulate how it is activated and used.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38907.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During a conversation, each person must plan and monitor what they say to make sure it is relevant to the discussion. This is called maintaining coherence during speech. Studies suggest that as people get older they find it harder to remain coherent, and become more likely to produce irrelevant or off-topic information when speaking. This reduces how effectively they communicate and can have negative effects on their social interactions. However, little is known about how thinking skills affect coherence in speech and why this declines in later life.</p><p>To investigate, Hoffman et al. asked two groups of volunteers – a ‘younger’ group made up of people aged between 18 and 30 years old, and an ‘older’ group of people aged over 60 – to perform various speech-related tasks.

Discourse that successfully navigates these challenges is said to be coherent: it consists of a series of well-connected statements all related to a shared topic, making it easy to comprehend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foltz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glosser and Deser, 1992</xref>). The ability to produce coherent speech tends to decline as people grow older. Older adults are more likely to produce tangential, off-topic utterances in conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arbuckle and Gold, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glosser and Deser, 1992</xref>) and to provide irrelevant information when telling a story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Juncos-Rabadán et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marini et al., 2005</xref>) or describing an object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Long et al., 2018</xref>). Such changes reduce the effectiveness of communication and the quality of older people’s verbal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbuckle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pushkar et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, less coherent speech is associated with higher levels of stress and less satisfaction in social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arbuckle and Gold, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gold et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pushkar et al., 2000</xref>). Researchers have often made a distinction between local coherence (LC), the degree to which adjoining utterances relate meaningfully to one another, and global coherence (GC), the degree to which each utterance relates to the topic under discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glosser and Deser, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kintsch and van Dijk, 1978</xref>). Most studies have reported larger declines in GC in later life, though reductions in LC have also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glosser and Deser, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kemper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wright et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Explanations for age-related decline in coherence have typically focused on deterioration in domain-general cognitive control processes, which are assumed to be involved in the monitoring and selection of topics during speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kintz et al., 2016</xref>). This view is supported by a handful of studies reporting that coherence in speech is predicted by performance on non-verbal tasks requiring cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gold et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kintz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">North et al., 1986</xref>). One particular theory holds declines in coherence result from a reduced ability to inhibit irrelevant information, which means that older people are less able to prevent irrelevant or off-topic ideas from intruding into their discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arbuckle and Gold, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marini and Andreetta, 2016</xref>). This view is supported by evidence that performance on cognitive tests requiring inhibition, such as the Stroop test and Trails test, predicts the level of coherence in older adults’ speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arbuckle and Gold, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). However, this factor does not appear to provide a complete explanation for age-related coherence declines. This is likely because previous studies have overlooked the critical role that conceptual knowledge about the world (i.e., semantic knowledge) plays in the generation of meaningful, coherent speech. Here, we propose and test the hypothesis that coherence depends not only on domain-general executive resources, but specifically on the ability to regulate the activation of semantic knowledge, ensuring that only the most relevant concepts are selected for inclusion in speech.</p><p>All propositional speech relies on the retrieval and use of semantic knowledge. This is true at the lexical level, since the selection of words for production is guided by their meaning. But it is also true at the broader conceptual level, as the content of our speech is informed by our general semantic knowledge about the topic under discussion. For example, describing one’s favourite season requires access to stored semantic knowledge about the typical characteristics of each time of year, the events associated with them and so on. Thus, the coherence of an individual’s discourse is likely to be critically determined by (a) the quality of the semantic knowledge they have on the topic under discussion and (b) by their ability to retrieve and select the most appropriate information to talk about. It is important to note that these elements of semantic processing are served by distinct neural systems. Current theories hold that representations of semantic knowledge are centred on the anterior temporal cortices and that a separate ‘semantic control’ system provides top-down regulation of the activation and selection of concepts from this store, based on current situational demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badre and Wagner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoffman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jefferies, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jefferies and Lambon Ralph, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ralph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yee and Thompson-Schill, 2016</xref>). These principal components of semantic cognition – the store of representations and the control system – can be independently impaired following brain damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jefferies, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ralph et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Importantly for the present study, recent evidence suggests some aspects of semantic control are impaired in later life. Hoffman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoffman, 2018</xref>) recently tested the verbal semantic abilities of 100 young and older adults. In common with many previous studies, older people were found to have a broader vocabulary, indicating a richer repository of semantic knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grady, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nilsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nyberg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rönnlund et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Salthouse, 2004</xref>). Unlike previous studies, we also probed semantic control abilities, using two experimental paradigms commonly used in cognitive neuroscience studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badre et al., 2005</xref>); Whitney, Kirk, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whitney et al., 2012</xref>). The first task probed the ability to engage in controlled search of the semantic knowledge store to detect weak associations between concepts. No age differences were found for this ability. The second tested the ability to select among competing semantic associations (hereafter termed <italic>semantic selection</italic>). The semantic selection task required participants to inhibit prepotent but irrelevant semantic information in favour of task-relevant aspects of knowledge. Older adults were less successful than young people, indicating age-related decline in this aspect of semantic control. Evidence for age-related decline in controlled selection of semantic information is consistent with a meta-analysis of 47 functional neuroimaging studies indicating that older adults show reduced activity in the left prefrontal region most strongly linked with this ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoffman and Morcom, 2018</xref>). The ability to select task-relevant semantic representations may be crucial in speech production because it may allow people to select the most relevant aspects of knowledge for use in speech and thus to avoid irrelevant shifts in topic.</p><p>Recent studies therefore suggest that ageing is associated with both positive and negative changes in the function of the semantic system. Here, we tested whether these changes could account for age-related declines in the coherence of speech. Young and older adults were asked to produce samples of speech in response to a series of prompts and the coherence of these samples was estimated using a novel computational approach. We hypothesised in particular that individuals with reduced semantic selection abilities would produce less coherent speech, since they would be less able to prevent irrelevant semantic information from influencing their responses. Importantly, we tested whether semantic abilities had unique effects on coherence, after accounting for the effects of domain-general executive function. We used the Trails test as a measure of domain-general executive function because it is a well-established task which draws on various aspects of executive control including task-switching and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbuthnott and Frank, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Salthouse, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sánchez-Cubillo et al., 2009</xref>) and also because it has previously been linked to poor coherence in speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arbuckle and Gold, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, we also investigated the production of speech under conditions of divided attention, by including a dual-task condition in which participants completed a secondary manual task while speaking. We included this condition because a previous study has shown that people produce less coherent speech when their attention is divided and that this effect interacts with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kemper et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assessments of cognitive and semantic ability</title><p>Mean scores on a series of background cognitive tests are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>. Young people were faster to respond in the Trails test and produced more items in category fluency. Older people produced slightly more words in letter fluency, however. There were no group differences in MMSE scores, with all participants scoring at least 26/30.</p><p>Participants completed a series of semantic tasks that probed semantic selection ability, breadth of semantic knowledge and controlled retrieval of weak semantic associations. The full analysis of these tasks is reported in Appendix 5, with mean scores in each condition presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app5fig1">Appendix 5—figure 1</xref>. The older group scored significantly higher on the vocabulary tests of semantic knowledge, indicating that they had a broader set of verbal semantic information available to them. Controlled retrieval was assessed by manipulating association strength during semantic judgements, since the detection of weak associations requires greater control over the retrieval of information from semantic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Badre and Wagner, 2007</xref>). This manipulation had similar effects in young and older people, suggesting that the ability to retrieve less salient semantic knowledge was equivalent in the two groups. Semantic selection was probed using a task in which participants were asked to match items based on particular semantic features (e.g., colour) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thompson-Schill et al., 1997</xref>). Selection demands were highest when the correct target was incongruent with pre-existing semantic associations (e.g., <italic>salt</italic> goes with <italic>snow</italic>, not <italic>pepper</italic>). Older people showed a larger effect of the congruency manipulation, performing more poorly in the incongruent condition. This indicates that the older group had difficulty in selecting task-relevant semantic knowledge and inhibiting irrelevant associations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Speech rate</title><p>We now turn to analyses of the speech samples produced by participants. We first considered the effect of our experimental manipulations on rate of speech production (number of words produced per minute). The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Mixed effects modelling indicated that speech rate was influenced both by age group (<italic>B</italic> = −7.74, <italic>se</italic> = 3.81, p<italic>=</italic>0.046), with older participants tending to speak more slowly, and by task (<italic>B</italic> = −1.93, <italic>se</italic> = 0.79, p<italic>=</italic>0.016), with fewer words produced under dual-task conditions. We therefore included speech rate as a covariate in subsequent analyses, to ensure that effects on coherence were not attributable to this variable.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Predictors of coherence</title><p>Coherence of speech was assessed using a novel computational approach (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Measures of global coherence (GC) and local coherence (LC) were computed. We began by assessing the internal reliability of the GC and LC measures over the fourteen prompts used to elicit speech samples. Cronbach’s alpha was high for both measures (GC = 0.83; LC = 0.79), indicating that stable individual differences in coherence were present over the various topics about which participants were asked to speak. GC and LC values were also strongly correlated with one another (r = 0.79), suggesting that both are closely linked, as found in previous studies. In the older group, age was negatively correlated with GC (r = −0.64) and LC (r = −0.56).</p><p>Next we investigated the effects of our experimental manipulations on the GC of participants’ speech. The first model included age group and task as predictors, with speech rate as an additional covariate (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for results). Age group was a strong predictor of GC: as predicted, older participants produced markedly less coherent speech than young people (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, the dual-task manipulation had no effect on GC. The interaction between age and task fell just short of statistical significance (p=0.052). This suggests that there may be a weak tendency for the effect of the task manipulation to be larger in older people. Speech rate was a negative predictor of GC, indicating that participants who spoke more quickly showed a greater tendency to deviate from the topic being probed.</p><fig id="fig1"

Principal components analysis was used to reduce the nine properties of speech into four latent factors, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. These were the only factors with eigenvalues greater than one and together they explained 81% of the variance. GC and LC loaded exclusively on Factor 2, confirming that coherence emerged as a discrete characteristic of speech. Factor 1 indexed the use of long, abstract, late-acquired words in speech, so appeared to reflect access to complex vocabulary. High scores on Factor 3 were associated with use of low frequency, concrete nouns that were low in semantic diversity. This factor may reflect the degree to which speech referenced highly specific concepts, so we labelled it semantic specificity. Finally, high scores on Factor 4 were characterised by high type:token ratio and a low proportion of closed-class words, which are indicative of greater lexical diversity.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38907.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal components analysis identifying four latent speech factors.

The results for Factor 2 (coherence) were the same as previously observed for GC and LC separately: lower coherence was associated with poorer Trails and semantic selection performance but with better semantic knowledge. Importantly, no other factor showed the same pattern. The only other significant effects were that semantic knowledge was positively correlated with scores on factors 1 (vocabulary) and 4 (lexical diversity), indicating that participants with broader semantic knowledge used a broader and more complex range of vocabulary when speaking. This analysis therefore confirms that the participants’ executive and semantic selection abilities had a specific effect on their coherence but not on other aspects of their speech production.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Secondary task performance</title><p>Analysis of the secondary manual task is reported in Appendix 5. In brief, older people had slower RTs and both groups were slower when the task was combined with speaking. Importantly, however, there was no interaction between these factors, indicating that the requirement to perform two tasks affected both groups equally (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app5fig2">Appendix 5—figure 2</xref>). Participants’ GC and LC scores did not predict performance on the secondary task, ruling out the possibility of a trade-off between secondary task performance and maintenance of coherence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ability to produce coherent speech is critical for effective communication but tends to decline in later life. Here, we investigated cognitive factors that predict this decline, using computational linguistic techniques to quantify the coherence of speech produced by a large group of young and older adults. We replicated previous findings indicating that individuals with greater domain-general executive ability produce more coherent speech, but this effect did not fully account for age differences in coherence. However, when we included semantic abilities as additional predictors of coherence, the age group difference was eliminated. Semantic selection ability emerged as a positive predictor of coherence while breadth of semantic knowledge was a negative predictor. These effects were specific to coherence and not to other characteristics of speech, and were not attributable to differences in speech rate. Our results indicate that older people produce less coherent speech (a) because they are less skilled at selecting the most relevant aspects of semantic knowledge to include in their speech and (b) because they have a larger set of semantic knowledge to select from.</p><p>First and foremost, our results establish that the monitoring and control of discourse is influenced by the function of the semantic system, in addition to domain-general executive resources. In particular, we found that the ability to select task-relevant semantic information was a strong predictor of coherence in speech. The task we used to assess this ability is well-established as a measure of semantic control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thompson-Schill et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whitney et al., 2012</xref>) and required participants to attend to specific semantic features of objects while inhibiting strong but irrelevant semantic associations. Our data indicate that similar selection and inhibitory demands are present during the production of discourse. A conversational cue, such as ‘what’s your favourite season?', initially causes a wide range of knowledge to become activated in the semantic system. Some of this information will be useful in answering the question and some less so. Coherent communication requires the speaker to select the subset of that information which is directly relevant at the current time, while suppressing aspects of knowledge that are activated but less pertinent. These demands grow as the narrative develops and new associations are activated.</p><p>Of course, the knowledge that drives speech production is not solely semantic in nature – specific episodic memories and more general autobiographical knowledge will often be triggered as well. The prompts used in the present study were designed to elicit general knowledge rather than specific personal experiences. However, episodic and semantic memories are mutually interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binder et al., 2009</xref>), and it was clear that participants drew on both in generating their responses. It is likely that selection mechanisms for these distinct types of memory are shared to some degree. Indeed, the left mid ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), the brain region most closely associated with semantic selection, responds to selection demands in all three domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Badre and Wagner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dobbins and Wagner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">King et al., 2005</xref>). In particular, a large literature has examined brain regions implicated in the selection of task-relevant aspects of retrieved episodic memories. These processes are often referred to as ‘post-retrieval monitoring’. The requirement to selectively recall particular details of an event drives greater activation in left mid VLPFC, suggesting that this area also mediates selection from episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Badre and Wagner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dobbins and Wagner, 2005</xref>). However, the monitoring and selection of retrieved episodic memories is also associated with activation of dorsolateral prefrontal regions that are not implicated in selection from semantic knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fletcher et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rugg et al., 2003</xref>), which may indicate a degree of independence between semantic and episodic selection at the neural level.</p><p>At a behavioural level, recent work indicates that patients with deficits in semantic selection also find it hard to resolve interference in episodic memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stampacchia et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, healthy older people often show increased interference from irrelevant events when retrieving episodic memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campbell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ikier et al., 2008</xref>). Combined with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoffman, 2018</xref>), these findings point to a more general old-age deficit in selecting the most task-relevant aspects of retrieved semantic <italic>and</italic> episodic knowledge. We have demonstrated here that this selection deficit contributes to the loss of coherence in later life. This conclusion is consistent with age-related changes in the structure and function of the VLPFC region most associated with this ability. Lateral prefrontal cortex exhibits the greatest reductions in cortical volume as a function of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fjell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Raz et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, a recent meta-analysis of 47 functional neuroimaging studies found that older adults activated this region less strongly than young people during semantic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoffman and Morcom, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another important question is the extent to which the selection processes involved in regulating semantic knowledge overlap or interact with other, domain-general executive functions. This is an area of active debate, with researchers proposing that some aspects of the regulation of semantic knowledge are performed by domain-general systems for competition resolution while others require more specialised neural resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jefferies, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whitney et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we employed a single measure of non-semantic executive ability, the Trails test. The measure of executive ability derived from this test was not correlated with performance on the semantic selection task (young group: <italic>r</italic> = 0.08; older group: <italic>r</italic> = 0.02) and, although Trails performance was a strong predictor of coherence, we found that semantic selection had an additional, independent effect. This suggests that the relationship between coherence and semantic selection cannot simply be attributed to poorer general executive ability.</p><p>However, it is unlikely that a single test can adequately capture all aspects of executive function. There are many different views on how executive functions are organised, but one common scheme proposes separate shifting, updating and inhibition components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miyake et al., 2000</xref>). The Trails test primarily taps shifting (or task-switching) ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbuthnott and Frank, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hedden and Yoon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sánchez-Cubillo et al., 2009</xref>). In future, it will be important to probe potential contributions of other components of executive function, in particular inhibition. It is currently unclear whether suppression of irrelevant semantic information retrieved from memory involves the same executive resources as inhibition of overt behavioural responses, as measured by paradigms such as the Go/No Go task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Verbruggen and Logan, 2008</xref>). This is an important issue to resolve if we are to understand how semantic selection processes relate to domain-general executive function, particularly as semantic selection deficits in later life may be related to more general declines in inhibitory function, which have been reported across a range of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borella et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hasher and Zacks, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoffman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Salthouse and Meinz, 1995</xref>).</p><p>We also found that the breadth of participants’ semantic knowledge influenced their coherence. Individuals with a wider range of lexical-semantic knowledge tended to be <italic>less</italic> coherent. This effect is consistent with the notion that selecting appropriately from activated knowledge is critical to maintaining coherence. This challenge becomes greater the more information one has in one’s semantic store, simply because more concepts are likely to be activated in response to any given cue. Thus, our data indicate that being more knowledgeable in itself brings greater challenges in identifying the most relevant aspects of knowledge to use in speech. It is very well-established that older people have greater semantic and general world knowledge, as was the case in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rönnlund et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Salthouse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Verhaeghen, 2003</xref>), so this factor may also have contributed to age-related coherence declines. It is also worth noting that breadth of semantic knowledge also predicted the use of more sophisticated vocabulary (i.e., more late-acquired, abstract nouns) and greater lexical diversity (for a similar result, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kemper and Sumner, 2001</xref>). Therefore, it appears that quantity of semantic knowledge has more global effects on the characteristics of speech, unlike semantic selection, which impacts specifically on coherence.</p><p>We found that conditions of divided attention had no overall effect on the coherence of speech, in contrast to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kemper et al., 2010</xref>. However, we note that our secondary task appeared less demanding that that used by Kemper and colleagues. Our secondary task produced a reduction in speech rate of around 5 WPM, compared with 20–40 WPM in Kemper et al. Despite this, we did find a non-significant trend (p=0.056) towards an interaction of dual-task demands with age (for the GC measure). There was a suggestion that the secondary task may have had a small effect on the coherence of older people, while young people appeared unaffected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). There remains a possibility therefore that divided attention has a particular detrimental effect on coherence in older adults. This could have important implications for conversations conducted in everyday situations in which speakers may simultaneously be engaged in other activities (e.g., talking while driving, shopping etc.). Future studies with more demanding concurrent tasks are needed to assess this possibility and its interaction with semantic abilities.</p><p>Previous studies have found varying effects of age on coherence, depending on the speech elicitation task used. Typically, narratives elicited from verbal prompts, as in the present study, reveal the greatest decrements in coherence while tasks that elicit speech using visual stimuli, such as picture descriptions or story-telling from comic strips, produce smaller effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">James et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). These results fit well with our assertion that the ability to select relevant semantic content is a major determinant of coherence. When a pictured stimulus is used to cue speech, it acts as a source of constraint over semantic activation. Upon analysing the image, knowledge related to the objects and events depicted automatically comes to mind and can be used to drive speech production. If any irrelevant concepts become activated during this process, they can easily be eliminated on the basis that they are not present in the image. In contrast, constructing a response to a brief verbal prompt is a trickier proposition, since a wide range of potentially relevant information may be activated and no external cues are available to guide selection. Of course, the monologues elicited in the present study are a rather extreme example of this phenomenon. In everyday conversational speech, environmental cues are often available to guide the selection of speech content. For instance, a look of confusion from the speaker’s interlocutor can indicate when a loss of topic has occurred and a well-timed question could direct the speaker back to the topic in hand. Such cues can only be effective if speakers are sensitive to them, however, and evidence suggests that speakers with poor coherence are also less skilled at interpreting social cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pushkar et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Finally, it is important to consider an underlying assumption often made in the literature on coherence: that greater coherence is always a desirable characteristic for speech. Many situations do require specific information to be communicated quickly and efficiently and in these cases, it is beneficial to be able to provide the most germane information without digression to other topics. For example, there is evidence that individuals who are less coherent in conversation perform poorly at communicating task-related information to a partner in an experimental setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbuckle et al., 2000</xref>). In other situations, however, a less focused approach to speech may have its advantages. When the goal of a conversation is to entertain, rather than to convey specific information, the ability to shift focus away from the original topic may be beneficial. Indeed, older people are generally considered to produce more enjoyable stories than young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ryan et al., 1992</xref>). One notable study collected responses of young and older people to questions about life events and asked judges to rate them on various dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">James et al., 1998</xref>). Older people produced more off-topic speech than young people and their narratives were rated as less focused. However, while less coherent speakers were rated as less clear and focused, they were also considered to be more interesting and to have produced better stories. In summary, the ability to communicate coherently is critical in many but not all everyday conversations. It is possible that the most effective communicators are those who can tailor their selection of content to the current situational demands, focusing tightly on the subject at hand when required to but broadening their focus at other times. Little is known at present about how coherence interacts with these situational demands and this is one area where more research is needed.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty young adults, aged between 18 and 30 (mean = 19.3), were recruited from the undergraduate Psychology course at the University of Edinburgh and participated in the study in exchange for course credit.

As a measure of domain-general executive function, we computed the ratio of completion times for Trails part B to Trails part A. High ratios indicated disproportionately slow performance on part B, indicative of poor executive function. A ratio rather than a difference score was used as this measure minimises the influence of differences in general processing speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbuthnott and Frank, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Salthouse, 2011</xref>). Participants also completed two tasks probed breadth of semantic knowledge: lexical decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baddeley et al., 1992</xref>) and synonym matching (adapted Mill Hill vocabulary scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raven et al., 1989</xref>) (for further details, see Appendix 1). As scores on these tasks were strongly correlated, they were averaged to give a single measure of breadth of semantic knowledge.</p><p>Semantic control was assessed using a 2 × 2 within-subjects experimental design that manipulated the need for semantic control in two different tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoffman, 2018</xref>); following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badre et al., 2005</xref>). In the first task, participants made semantic decisions based on global semantic association. They were presented with a probe word and asked to select its semantic associate from either two or four alternatives (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> for examples). The strength of association between the probe and target was manipulated: the associate was either strongly associated with the probe (e.g., <italic>town-city</italic>) or more weakly associated (e.g., <italic>iron-ring</italic>). The Weak Association condition was assumed to place greater demands on controlled retrieval of semantic information, because automatic spreading of activation in the semantic network would not be sufficient to identify the correct response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Badre and Wagner, 2007</xref>). In the second task, participants were asked to select items that matched on particular features. At the beginning of each block, participants were given a feature to attend to (e.g., Colour). On each trial, they were provided with a probe and were asked to select the item that was most similar on the specified feature. Trials manipulated the semantic congruency of the probe and target. On Congruent trials, the probe and target shared a pre-existing semantic relationship, in addition to matching on the currently relevant feature (e.g., <italic>cloud-snow</italic>). In contrast, on Incongruent trials the probe and target shared no meaningful relationship, other than matching on the specified feature (e.g., <italic>salt-dove</italic>). Furthermore, on these trials one of the foils had a strong semantic relationship with the probe, although it did not match on the currently relevant feature (<italic>salt-pepper</italic>). Incongruent trials placed high demands on semantic selection processes for two reasons: first, because there was no pre-existing semantic relationship between probe and target to boost activation of the target and second, because the strong but irrelevant relationship between the probe and foil had to be ignored.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38907.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Example trials from semantic tasks.</title><p>The correct response is highlighted in each case.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-38907-fig5-v2"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Speech elicitation task</title><p>Samples of speech were elicited under conditions of undivided and divided attention.

Our approach used latent semantic analysis (LSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Landauer and Dumais, 1997</xref>), one of a number of computational techniques in which patterns of word co-occurrence are used to construct a high-dimensional semantic space. The LSA method utilises a large corpus of natural language divided into a number of discrete contexts. The corpus is used to generate a co-occurrence matrix registering how often each word appears in each context. Data reduction techniques are then applied to this matrix, with the result that each word is represented as a high-dimensional vector. Words that are used in similar contexts (and are thus assumed to have related meanings) are assigned similar vectors. Word similarities derived in this way are strong predictors of human judgements of semantic relatedness and human performance on a range of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bullinaria and Levy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Recchia and Jones, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, vectors for individual words can be combined linearly to represent the meanings of whole sentences and passages of speech/text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foltz et al., 1998</xref>). A number of researchers have used this property to generate estimates of coherence for texts or spoken samples based on LSA similarity measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elvevåg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foltz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foltz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Graesser et al., 2004</xref>). The present work builds on this approach. The overall strategy we took was to divide each speech sample into smaller windows (of 20 words each) and to use LSA to generate vector representations of the semantic content of each window. Coherence was assessed by measuring the similarity of the vector for each window with that of the previous window (LC) and with a vector representing the typical semantics of responses to the same prompt (GC). This process is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>First, an LSA representation of each participant’s response was computed by averaging the LSA vectors of all the words they produced in response to the same prompt (for details of the averaging method and vector space used, see Appendix 3). These were averaged to give a composite vector that represented the typical semantic content produced in response to that prompt (this step excluded the target response). Next, the target response was analysed using a moving window approach. The target response was divided into windows of 20 words in length. An LSA vector was computed for each window. Local coherence was defined as the cosine similarity of the semantic vector for the current window with that of the previous window. Therefore, in common with other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elvevåg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foltz, 2007</xref>), we define LC as the degree to which adjoining utterances convey semantically related content. A low LC value would be obtained if a participant switched abruptly between topics during their response.</p><p>Global coherence was defined as similarity of the vector for each window with the composite vector derived from the other participants’ responses. Therefore, GC was a measure of how much the target response matched the typical semantic content of responses to that prompt. A low GC value would be obtained if a participant tended to talk about other topics that were semantically unrelated to the topic being probed. Thus, our measure of GC captured the degree to which participants maintained their focus on the topic under discussion, in line with the definition used by other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glosser and Deser, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wright et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Once GC and LC had been calculated, the window moved one word to the right and the process was repeated, until all windows had been assessed. GC and LC values were averaged across windows to give overall values for each response, which were multiplied by 100 for ease of presentation. Examples of responses with high vs. low coherence values are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table1">Appendix 3-Table 1</xref>. The LSA-based coherence measures were validated by comparing them with judgements of coherence provided by human raters for a subset of speech samples (see Appendix 4 for details). There was a strong correlation between rated GC and LSA-based GC (<italic>r</italic> = 0.68) and a somewhat weaker relationship between LSA-based LC and LC ratings (<italic>r</italic> = 0.37). Test-retest reliability was high (see Appendix 4).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>A series of linear mixed effects models were used to investigate the effects of the experimental manipulations and individual differences in semantic and executive ability on characteristics of speech. The dependent variable in the first analysis was speech rate in words per minute (WPM). This was analysed in a linear mixed model with a 2 × 2 (age group x task) factorial design. We performed this analysis because previous studies have found that older people speak more slowly than young people and that speech rate is reduced under dual-task conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kemper et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kemper et al., 2010</xref>). It was important to investigate this possibility in our data as speech rate might have an impact on coherence. For example, participants who spoke very quickly could cover a wider range of topics in 60 s, increasing the likelihood that their response would lose coherence. Since we found that speech rate was indeed influenced by both age and task, this variable was included as a covariate in later analyses.</p><p>Our main hypotheses were tested with a series of nested models which used GC and LC as dependent variables (in parallel). The first model included age group and task as predictors, as well as speech rate. Next, we added the Trails ratio score as an additional predictor, to test the hypothesis that general executive ability influences coherence. In the final model, we added three semantic task scores as predictors, to test the hypothesis that semantic abilities are an additional important determiner of coherence. The semantic task scores included were:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Semantic knowledge: the mean of accuracy on the lexical decision and synonym matching tasks.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Semantic selection: accuracy on the Incongruent condition of the feature association task, which required participants to select task-relevant aspects of semantic knowledge and inhibit irrelevant associations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Weak association: accuracy on the Weak Association condition of the global association task, which required controlled retrieval of semantic knowledge to identify less salient semantic relationships.</p></list-item></list><p>Next, to establish whether the observed effects were specific to coherence, we investigated whether other characteristics of speech showed similar effects. We computed six measures of the lexical characteristics of the words produced in each speech sample (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and Appendix 3). Principal components analysis was performed on these (along with the coherence measures) and used to extract four underlying factors, which were promax-rotated. Scores on each of these factors were then analysed using the same series of nested mixed models employed in the main analysis of GC and LC.</p><p>Finally, to analyse performance on the concurrent secondary task, we used a linear mixed model with group and task (secondary-only vs. dual-task) as predictors. The dependent variable was RT. We then added GC and LC values to the model as predictors to determine whether coherence was related to secondary task performance. All study data are available online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/8atfn/">https://osf.io/8atfn/</ext-link>).</p><p>Mixed effects models were constructed and tested using the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barr et al. (2013)</xref>. We specified a maximal random effects structure, including random intercepts for participants and prompts as well as random slopes across participants for the effect of task and random slopes across prompts for task and age group. Continuous predictors were standardised prior to entry in the model. The significance of fixed effects was assessed by comparing the full model with a reduced model that was identical in every respect except for the exclusion of the effect of interest. Likelihood-ratio tests were used to determine whether the inclusion of the effect of interest significantly improved the fit of the model.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>PH was supported by The University of Edinburgh Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, part of the cross council Lifelong Health and Wellbeing Initiative (MR/K026992/1).

used as a general cognitive screen. All participants scored 26/30 or above. General executive ability was assessed using the Trail-making task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reitan, 1992</xref>). Finally, three categories of verbal fluency were administered, in which participants were given one minute to produce as many words as possible that fit a specific criterion. The criteria included two semantic categories (animals and household objects) and one letter of the alphabet (words beginning with F). Each group’s scores on these tasks are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s7-2"><title>Tests of breadth of semantic knowledge</title><p>Participants completed two tasks designed to probe the size of their store of semantic representations. These tasks probed knowledge of the meanings and identities of unusual words that were expected to be unknown to some members of the population. They therefore indexed the breadth of semantic knowledge available to each individual. The first task (Lexical Decision) was the Spot-the-Word Test from the Speed and Capacity of Language Processing battery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baddeley et al., 1992</xref>). This was a lexical decision test comprising 60 pairs of letter strings. On each trial, participants were presented with a real word and a nonword and were asked to select the real word. Nonwords were phonologically and orthographically plausible, encouraging participants to rely on semantic knowledge for decision-making. The second task (Synonyms) was based on the Mill Hill vocabulary test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raven et al., 1989</xref>), a multiple-choice test in which participants are asked to select the synonyms of particular words. There are two parallel forms of the test. To increase the difficulty of the task, the hardest 22 trials from each parallel form were combined to make a new 44-item test. The test was presented in a four-alternative choice format.</p></sec><sec id="s7-3"><title>Semantic tasks procedure</title><p>Semantic tasks were presented on a PC running Eprime 2.0 software. Participants first completed the Lexical Decision and Synonym tasks and then the semantic control experiment. Each task was preceded by a series of practice trials.

Twenty naïve raters were recruited from University of Edinburgh’s Psychology department’s volunteer panel. The mean age of the raters was 72 and none had taken part in the main experiment. Thirty-two speech samples from two different prompts were selected for rating; each participant rated 16 of these. To collect the ratings, each sample was divided into separate utterances and participants were asked to rate the GC and LC of each utterance on a four-point scale. They were provided with standard definitions of GC and LC (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wright et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Ratings for individual utterances were averaged (weighted by length of utterance) to give mean GC and LC ratings for each speech sample. Ratings from one participant were discarded because they were weakly correlated with the other participants. Following this exclusion, ratings were highly consistent across participants (Cronbach’s α = 0.90 for GC and 0.85 for LC). We assessed the relationship between the GC and LC ratings for each speech sample and their corresponding automated measures. There were strong positive correlations in each case (<italic>r</italic> = 0.68 for GC and <italic>r</italic> = 0.37 for LC), indicating that the automated measures accurately reflected human coherence judgements. We also tested an alternative method for calculating GC in which a participant’s speech sample was compared with a composite vector derived only from the responses of other participants in their own age group. This variation was tested in case there were large differences in the discourse produced by young and older participants which might make between-group comparisons invalid. However, we found that this change had very little effect on GC values or on their correlation with GC ratings (<italic>r</italic> = 0.71).</p><p>Finally, test-retest reliability was assessed in fourteen older participants from the present study, who subsequently took part in a neuroimaging study in which they were asked to produce speech while undergoing fMRI (manuscript in preparation).

An innovative, automated measure of coherence is used, which is based on latent semantic analysis. The study tests the hypothesis that coherence is in part driven by semantic knowledge and semantic selection abilities, and not simply domain-general executive function (the latter association having already been shown elsewhere). The main finding is that the semantic cognition measures do indeed predict coherence beyond executive function, to the extent that age is no longer a significant predictor of coherence when these other variables are included in the model.</p><p>The paper is exceptionally clear and (appropriately, given the topic) coherent. The logic, design, and analyses are clear, systematic, and well presented. The results are likely to be of interest to researchers in the fields of ageing and language. This study will fit well with the rapidly growing literature on semantic cognition and its interaction with other abilities.</p><p>I have only a few suggestions for how the paper could be improved.</p><p>Given the focus on executive function (vs. semantic selection specifically), and given how nebulous – or at least multifaceted – 'executive function' is, the question arises as to whether the Trails B:A ratio is sufficiently representative of domain-general executive function. This choice of task could use further justification.</p><p>It is noted that speech rate is a confounder of the LSA-based coherence measure, since the production of more words is likely to drive coherence down. The solution employed in the paper is to include speech rate as a covariate. This is a sound approach, but is it optimal? Couldn't speech rate enter into the calculation of coherence itself, e.g. to normalise the measure (average coherence per word)?</p><p>I appreciate the discussion (Discussion, third paragraph) of the potential overlap between semantic selection and other domain-general executive functions. As I read the Results, I couldn't help but wonder whether the Trails ratio measure and semantic selection performance were correlated. I agree that they obviously aren't one and the same, given that they make independent, significant contributions to coherence, but this correlation could inform this discussion and the development of future studies.</p><p>I wonder about the validity of the analogy between the adverse effect of semantic knowledge on speech coherence and the 'fan effect' of lower episodic retrieval when multiple pieces of information are associated with the same stimulus (Discussion, fifth paragraph). The former is about breadth (more information overall), whereas the latter is about depth (more information associated with a specific thing. This (perceived, on my part at least) lack of correspondence isn't necessarily damaging to the overall interpretation of the effect, but it may confuse the issue in some readers' minds.</p><p>This may expose my naivety regarding linear mixed modelling, but is Chi square the best measure of improvement of fit between models? Does it adequately penalise complexity?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors set out to investigate the contributions of semantic cognition to speech coherence in younger and older adults. They employ innovative computational methods to derive measures of global and local coherence. Further, they included a measure of executive functioning (Trails B:A) as well as a dual-task condition to assess the contribution of semantics over and above cognitive control and attentional demand to age differences in speech coherence.</p><p>Overall, this is an impressive investigation, one that makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying an important age-related shift in functional capacity (i.e. coherent speech production). The rationale and relevance of the study aims are convincingly argued and appear to be well-grounded in the relevant literature. The hypotheses reflect, and follow logically from previous findings. Study methods and design are both innovative and appropriate to test the hypotheses as presented, and the procedures are well described and replicable. The presentation of the results is clear and comprehensive and the authors' interpretations and conclusions are fully supported by the data.</p><p>I have only a couple of issues, both of which were in part already identified by the authors, although perhaps more prominence/discussion is warranted. The first is a conceptual issue surrounding the authors' interpretation of their findings as evidence for the contribution of semantic ability (and semantic selection more specifically) in speech coherence. As discussed in the second paragraph of the Discussion, semantic selection closely overlaps (both behaviourally and neurally) post-retrieval monitoring processes, an area with a rich literature in the context of neurocognitive aging (although a quick literature search revealed only tangential references to speech production specifically). While the authors provide a convincing case for semantic selection based on their targeted measures, it is unclear whether the authors would argue that this is distinct from, or possibly a domain-specific instantiation of, post-retrieval monitoring. Some elaboration of this point seems warranted to further contextualize the findings and draw relevant links to the broader monitoring literature. On a related point, neuropsychologically, repetition errors on the fluency tasks are often used to assess monitoring. While likely an insensitive metric in a typically aging cohort, presenting these data may provide some insight with respect to age differences in monitoring more broadly defined.</p><p>The second concern involves the narrow definition of executive control processes, operationalized here by a single measure. While the authors do acknowledge this limitation, it again would seem to warrant further discussion with respect to the potential implications of untested interactions between other executive control processes (e.g. working memory capacity) and semantic processes. It seems at least plausible that a more comprehensive measure/index of executive control might be a stronger predictor of speech coherence than the semantic/Trails model tested here. It is certainly not incumbent on the authors to test every alternative hypothesis. However, the central argument of the paper (as indicated in the title) is that <italic>both</italic> executive control and semantic processes contribute to reduced coherent speech production in older adults, yet the executive control side of that argument has not been comprehensively assayed here. Further, it is possible that semantic abilities may come to play a larger role in the context of declining control processes in later life, something that we've demonstrated both behaviorally and neurally in the context of autobiographical memory in recent work (Spreng et al., Neuropsychologia, 2018). As with the first point above, a discussion of these possibilities would help to enhance the scope/impact of findings beyond speech coherence with implications for neurocognitive aging more broadly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38907.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers' evaluations are in broad agreement, as you will see from their individual reviews.</p><p>1) Both reviewers felt that the assessment of executive functions was rather limited.

Unfortunately, we were unable to run a more extensive battery of tests within the time available to test each participant. We selected the Trails test as our executive measure because previous studies have found correlations between this test and coherence in speech (Arbuckle and Gold, 1993 and Wright et al., 2014 – as noted in the Introduction) and because it did not require lexical processing (unlike, say, the Stroop task). We used the ratio of B to A completion times as our dependent measure because previous studies have indicated that this measure is largely independent of general processing speed, which shows steep declines with age (Arbuthnott and Frank, 2000; Salthouse, 2011 – as noted in the Materials and methods).</p><p>We have added the following text to the Discussion to consider the implications of our choice of executive function task:</p><p>“In this study we employed a single measure of non-semantic executive ability, the Trails test. […] This is an important issue to resolve if we are to understand how semantic selection processes relate to domain-general executive function, particularly as semantic selection deficits in later life may be related to more general declines in inhibitory function, which have been reported across a range of tasks (Borella, Carretti, and De Beni, 2008; Hasher and Zacks, 1988; Hoffman, 2018; Salthouse and Meinz, 1995).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript should discuss the importance of other cognitive processes which are potentially related behaviourally and neurally to semantic selection. In particular, reviewer 2 points to the large literatures on post-retrieval and working memory. It might not be possible to comprehensively test every alternative account, but discussing these possibilities might increase the relevance of the study to a broader audience whilst also ensuring that the interpretation doesn't extend beyond the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we should have provided a more detailed consideration of how semantic selection links with other related cognitive processes, and in particular with the literature on post-retrieval processing of episodic memories. We have added the following passage to the Discussion:</p><p>“A large literature has examined brain regions implicated in the selection of task-relevant aspects of retrieved episodic memories. These processes are often referred to as “post-retrieval monitoring”. […] We have demonstrated here that this selection deficit contributes to the loss of coherence in later life.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I have only a few suggestions for how the paper could be improved.</p><p>Given the focus on executive function (vs. semantic selection specifically), and given how nebulous – or at least multifaceted – 'executive function' is, the question arises as to whether the Trails B:A ratio is sufficiently representative of domain-general executive function. This choice of task could use further justification.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to Essential revisions 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is noted that speech rate is a confounder of the LSA-based coherence measure, since the production of more words is likely to drive coherence down. The solution employed in the paper is to include speech rate as a covariate. This is a sound approach, but is it optimal? Couldn't speech rate enter into the calculation of coherence itself, e.g. to normalise the measure (average coherence per word)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is certainly a possibility. We did not take this approach in the study because we did not know a priori whether speech rate would be related to coherence. Rather than make this assumption, we decided to include speech rate as a covariate in the model so that the effect on coherence would be tested empirically. Another reason for preferring this approach is that our two coherence measures have different relationships with speech rate: speech rate predicted global coherence but not local coherence, so it is not clear whether one should “correct” one measure but not the other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I appreciate the discussion (Discussion, third paragraph) of the potential overlap between semantic selection and other domain-general executive functions. As I read the Results, I couldn't help but wonder whether the Trails ratio measure and semantic selection performance were correlated. I agree that they obviously aren't one and the same, given that they make independent, significant contributions to coherence, but this correlation could inform this discussion and the development of future studies.</p><p>I wonder about the validity of the analogy between the adverse effect of semantic knowledge on speech coherence and the 'fan effect' of lower episodic retrieval when multiple pieces of information are associated with the same stimulus (Discussion, fifth paragraph). The former is about breadth (more information overall), whereas the latter is about depth (more information associated with a specific thing. This (perceived, on my part at least) lack of correspondence isn't necessarily damaging to the overall interpretation of the effect, but it may confuse the issue in some readers' minds.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the reference to this effect to avoid any confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This may expose my naivety regarding linear mixed modelling, but is Chi square the best measure of improvement of fit between models? Does it adequately penalise complexity?</p></disp-quote><p>The likelihood ratio test (with a chi-square statistic) is widely used for assessing change in model fit when an effect is added to a linear mixed effects model. Although other approaches are available, simulation data indicate that this method is most effective for minimising Type I errors (Barr et al., 2008). As stated in the Materials and methods, we followed Barr et al.’s recommendations for constructing our mixed effects models, including the use of the likelihood ratio tests to assess the significance of fixed effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I have only a couple of issues, both of which were in part already identified by the authors, although perhaps more prominence/discussion is warranted. The first is a conceptual issue surrounding the authors' interpretation of their findings as evidence for the contribution of semantic ability (and semantic selection more specifically) in speech coherence. As discussed in the second paragraph of the Discussion, semantic selection closely overlaps (both behaviourally and neurally) post-retrieval monitoring processes, an area with a rich literature in the context of neurocognitive aging (although a quick literature search revealed only tangential references to speech production specifically). While the authors provide a convincing case for semantic selection based on their targeted measures, it is unclear whether the authors would argue that this is distinct from, or possibly a domain-specific instantiation of, post-retrieval monitoring. Some elaboration of this point seems warranted to further contextualize the findings and draw relevant links to the broader monitoring literature. On a related point, neuropsychologically, repetition errors on the fluency tasks are often used to assess monitoring. While likely an insensitive metric in a typically aging cohort, presenting these data may provide some insight with respect to age differences in monitoring more broadly defined.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to Essential revisions 2.</p><p><italic>The second concern involves the narrow definition of executive control processes, operationalized here by a single measure. While the authors do acknowledge this limitation, it again would seem to warrant further discussion with respect to the potential implications of untested interactions between other executive control processes (e.g. working memory capacity) and semantic processes. It seems at least plausible that a more comprehensive measure/index of executive control might be a stronger predictor of speech coherence than the semantic/Trails model tested here. It is certainly not incumbent on the authors to test every alternative hypothesis. However, the central argument of the paper (as indicated in the title) is that</italic> both <italic>executive control and semantic processes contribute to reduced coherent speech production in older adults, yet the executive control side of that argument has not been comprehensively assayed here. Further, it is possible that semantic abilities may come to play a larger role in the context of declining control processes in later life, something that we've demonstrated both behaviorally and neurally in the context of autobiographical memory in recent work (Spreng et al., Neuropsychologia, 2018). As with the first point above, a discussion of these possibilities would help to enhance the scope/impact of findings beyond speech coherence with implications for neurocognitive aging more broadly.</italic> </p><p>Please see response to Essential revisions 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
