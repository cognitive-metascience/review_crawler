However, the mechanism how chemical energy of ATP facilitates translocation of chemically diverse compounds across membranes is poorly understood. Here, we advance the quantitative mechanistic understanding of the heterodimeric ABC transporter TmrAB, a functional homolog of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) by single-turnover analyses at single-liposome resolution. We reveal that a single conformational switch by ATP binding drives unidirectional substrate translocation. After this power stroke, ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release launch the return to the resting state, which facilitates nucleotide exchange and a new round of substrate binding and translocation. In contrast to hitherto existing steady-state assays, our single-turnover approach uncovers the power stroke in substrate translocation and the tight chemomechanical coupling in these molecular machines.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>conformational transition</kwd><kwd>membrane proteins</kwd><kwd>molecular machines</kwd><kwd>peptide transport</kwd><kwd>transporter associated with antigen processing</kwd><kwd>TAP</kwd><kwd>single-turnover analysis</kwd><kwd>ABC transporter</kwd><kwd>multidrug resistence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ta157/12-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tampé</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC_Ad 789121</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tampé</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tampé</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-turnover studies reveal quantitative insights into the inner mechanics and unfold hidden facets in the conformational coupling of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and substrate translocation by ABC transporters.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ubiquitous in all phyla of life, ABC transporters shuttle chemically diverse compounds across cell membranes, ranging from peptides and proteins to lipids, metabolites, antibiotics, and drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dean et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rees et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas and Tampé, 2018</xref>). Substrate transport is facilitated by large conformational changes, which are chemomechanically coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abele and Tampé, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Higgins and Linton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Senior and Gadsby, 1997</xref>). ABC exporters are composed of two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and two transmembrane domains (TMDs) forming the substrate translocation pathway. ABC exporters are involved in multifold physiological pathways and human diseases, ranging from cystic fibrosis to acquired multidrug resistance in cancer chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Csanády et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Robey et al., 2018</xref>). The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) plays a critical role in the adaptive immune response against intracellular pathogens and tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Trowitzsch and Tampé, 2020</xref>). Notably, more than half of all human ABC transporters have two functionally asymmetric ATP-binding sites (canonical <italic>vs</italic>. non-canonical). The <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> multidrug resistance transport complex TmrAB represents a structural and functional homolog of the TAP complex with an overlapping peptide specificity and can restore antigen presentation in human TAP-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nöll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zutz et al., 2011</xref>). In recent years, the molecular understanding of the conformational space of ABC transporters has been expanded. In particular, eight high-resolution cryo-EM structures of TmrAB in different states and conformations were determined, comprising two inward-facing (IF), four outward-facing (OF), and two asymmetric post-hydrolysis states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>). Based on this detailed insight, two major transitions from IF-to-OF and OF-to-IF conformation can be defined. However, the functional roles of ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis in the substrate translocation cycle are poorly defined. Owing to the fast ATP turnover in ABC transporters paired with the hydrophobicity of most substrates, it has been intrinsically difficult to tackle these indispensable questions.</p><p>Notably, exporters to our knowledge ABC have not been analyzed by single-turnover assays, which would require full transport activity of all correctly reconstituted ABC transporters in liposomes paired with sensitive detection of the translocated substrate. Thus, it remained largely elusive until now whether a single-substrate translocation event is mediated by ATP binding or ATP hydrolysis and how substrate and nucleotide binding affect the major conformational changes. Furthermore, some ABC exporters have been described as uncoupled molecular machines that undergo multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis per translocated substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bock et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eytan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nöll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zehnpfennig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zollmann et al., 2015</xref>). The significance of these futile cycles, however, is largely unclear.</p><p>Here, we address these questions by establishing single-turnover assays. The translocation complex TmrAB was reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs or liposomes providing an optimal lipid environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bechara et al., 2015</xref>) for full activity and conformational freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>). We delineate that a single conformational switch from the IF-to-OF conformation, triggered by ATP binding, drives unidirectional substrate translocation across the membrane. After ATP hydrolysis in and phosphate release from the canonical site, the OF-to-IF transition is launched, which allows for nucleotide exchange and a new round of substrate processing. Our single-turnover analyses provide quantitative insights into the inner mechanics and coupling of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and substrate translocation of ABC transporters.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The IF-to-OF switch induced by ATP binding precludes substrate binding</title><p>ABC transporters pass through very transient pre- and post-hydrolysis states. In order to kinetically separate the events of ATP binding and hydrolysis, we substituted the catalytic glutamate by glutamine at the canonical ATP site (TmrA<sup>E523Q</sup>B, TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B) to slowdown the ATP turnover. The transporter was reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McLean et al., 2018</xref>), maintaining its optimal membrane environment for function and conformational dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>). By scintillation proximity assays (SPA), we confirmed that wildtype TmrAB and TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B are equivalent in equilibrium peptide- and nucleotide-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore utilized TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B with a slowdown in ATP hydrolysis for single-turnover studies to probe the roles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, and both subsequent conformational transitions (IF-to-OF and return) for substrate translocation. When comparing our high-resolution cryo-EM structures of IF and OF conformers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>), we found that key residues involved in peptide binding are rearranged upon the IF-to-OF transition. Transmembrane helices TM2, TM3, and TM4, framing the substrate-binding site in the IF conformation, get closely packed together in the OF state to form a tightly sealed intracellular gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To monitor this conformational switch, we analyzed the equilibrium peptide binding to IF and OF TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B. After the IF-to-OF transition induced by ATP binding, the association of radiolabeled peptides to TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B was precluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The impairment of substrate binding was also shown by fluorescence anisotropy using the fluorescent C4F peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Loss of peptide binding correlates with the concentration of ATP added to induce the IF-to-OF transition, which is monitored by fluorescence anisotropy using fluorescent peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and by SPA utilizing radiolabeled peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The EC<sub>50</sub> of 30 µM is consistent with the equilibrium dissociation constant of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). It is worth mentioning that we observed a similar loss of substrate binding after nucleotide trapping in the OF conformation by ATPγS, a slowly hydrolyzing ATP analog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using the same experimental conditions, binding of radiolabeled and fluorescent peptides was not affected by Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), although Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP display similar affinities for TmrAB in the IF conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In conclusion, only ATP and not ADP can drive the IF-to-OF transition, which in turn abrogates high-affinity substrate binding to the ABC transporter.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The IF-to-OF transition by ATP binding precludes substrate binding.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Scheme of the IF-to-OF transition by comparing the IF<sup>wide</sup> and OF<sup>open</sup> conformation of TmrAB.

We then monitored the OF-to-IF transition by (i) the release of the occluded radiolabeled nucleotides, (ii) the restoration of peptide binding, as well as (iii) the ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). By scintillation proximity assays, we observed a mono-exponential decay of the nucleotides occluded in TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B and an underlying decline of binding signal over time typical of SPA. The half-life of the nucleotide-occluded state at 20 °C was 24 min, which is in accordance with the ATP turnover of 29 ± 1 min at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). The half-life of the nucleotide-occluded state was slightly affected by temperature. At 4 °C, the half-life was prolonged to 34 min and reduced to 19 min at 45 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, only 50% of bound nucleotides were released at 4 °C suggesting an asymmetric opening of both ATP sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next sought to trace the OF-to-IF return by a time-dependent recovery of peptide binding. In the absence of Mg-ATP, IF TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B displayed fast peptide binding, which was linearly increasing over time, typical of SPA-based peptide-binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). As detailed above, substrate binding to OF TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B was abolished after the IF-to-OF switch. However, we observed a mono-exponential recovery of peptide binding with a half-life of 24 min, reaching the level determined before nucleotide trapping after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). This demonstrates the full reversibility of the conformational cycle, which we can dissect into two single-turnover events. We also examined the time-dependent release of γ-phosphate upon the OF-to-IF transition. Strikingly, only one of the two occluded ATP molecules is hydrolyzed within the single OF-to-IF transition, approaching a final ATP-to-ADP ratio of 1:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). This illustrates the non-equivalence of the two ATP sites in ATP turnover as shown by the two asymmetric unlocked-return states captured by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>). The rate of phosphate release complies with the overall ATP hydrolysis rate as well as the rates of nucleotide release and peptide re-binding. Taken together, a single ATP turnover and phosphate release at the consensus site launch the OF-to-IF return, restoring the peptide-binding site and allowing nucleotide exchange.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A single ATP turnover and phosphate release launches the OF-to-IF return.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Experimental scheme monitoring the OF-to-IF transition.

We addressed this pressing question by establishing a sensitive single-turnover translocation assay. We uncovered that ATP binding drives the single-translocation event of different substrates along the IF-to-OF transition. By analyzing sequential steps in the translocation cycle, we revealed that substrate transport by TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B is unidirectional, which was previously shown for human TAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grossmann et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In ABC transporters, the coupling ratio between conformational transitions and substrate translocation remain largely elusive.

In the future, single-turnover approaches will be an indispensable method to unfold hidden facets of conformational coupling, energy transduction, and mechanistic details of substrate translocation by ABC transporters but also other membrane translocation machineries.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Monoclonal α-His</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>SAB1305538</td><td>Mouse origin; 1:2000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Polyclonal α-mouse-HRP conjugate</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>AP130P</td><td>Goat origin; 1:20,000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>β-n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM)</td><td>Carl Roth</td><td>CN26.5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Bovine brain lipid extract</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>B1502</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td><italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipids</td><td>Avanti</td><td>100600</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine (DOPC)</td><td>Anatrace</td><td>D518</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>[2,5’,8-<sup>3</sup>H(N)]-ATP (<sup>3</sup>H-ATP)</td><td>PerkinElmer</td><td>NET118900</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>[2,8-<sup>3</sup>H]-ADP <break/>(<sup>3</sup>H-ADP)</td><td>Biotrend</td><td>ART-0386</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>[α<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP</td><td>Hartmann Analytic</td><td>FP-207</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>[γ<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP</td><td>Hartmann Analytic</td><td>FP-201</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Copper-chelated PVT SPA beads</td><td>PerkinElmer</td><td>RPNQ0095</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>)</td><td>TmrA</td><td>Q72J05</td><td>TTC0976</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>)</td><td>TmrB</td><td>Q72J04</td><td>TTC0977</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>RRY-[<sup>3</sup>H]L-KSTEL</td><td>Hartmann Analytic</td><td>Custom synthesis</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>RRY-C*-KSTEL</td><td>This study (Peptide labeling and purification)</td><td/><td>C* denotes fluorescein labeled Cys</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>RRY-C*-KSTEL</td><td>This study (Peptide labeling and purification)</td><td/><td>C* denotes Alexa Fluor 647 labeled Cys</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pET-22b</td><td>Merck Millipore</td><td>69744</td><td>Vector for protein expression in <italic>E. coli</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Software, Algorithm</td><td>Prism 5</td><td>GraphPad</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, Algorithm</td><td>PyMOL</td><td>Schrödinger</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21(DE3)</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>C600003</td><td>Chemically competent cells</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification of TmrAB </title><p>Expression and purification of TmrAB was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zutz et al., 2011</xref>).

the mechanisms of substrate binding and translocation have been studied for several decades.

Using a catalytically reduced variant in combination with Mg-ATP appeared as an effective strategy to populate the OF conformation as reported for TmrAB but also for other ABC exporters (Hofmann et al., 2019; Manolaridis et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018; Dastvan et al., 2019; Barth et al., 2018). In order to investigate the events of ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis with their respective effects on substrate translocation, we utilized the TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B variant with a drastic slowdown in ATP turnover. This allowed us to kinetically outline the IF-to-OF switch and the returning OF-to-IF transition to correlate these conversions with substrate translocation. Considering wildtype TmrAB, single-turnover transport studies are technically challenging and would require conformation-selective inhibitors that arrest TmrAB at various stages of the translocation cycle which to our knowledge are presently not available. We observed an effective coupling ratio of consumed ATP per translocated substrate for TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B in contrast to TmrAB which acts largely uncoupled (Bock et al., 2019). As the speed of conformational transitions is slowed down for TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B compared to TmrAB, the allosteric coupling might be favored. For explanation, we extended the main text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In subsection “The IF-to-OF transition triggered by ATP binding is coupled to substrate translocation” the authors suggests that ATP binding and not hydrolysis drives transport, based on their observation that after 5 minutes incubation they see “a substantially higher number of peptides” transported and their observation that ATP binding is much faster than ATP hydrolysis.

Proteoliposomes were characterized by nanoparticle tracking to calculate the average diameter. TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B was randomly oriented (50/50%) in proteoliposomes determined by TEV-protease cleavage of the His-tag fused to TmrA. Incorporation efficiency of TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B in proteoliposomes was analyzed by carbonate crush and sucrose density gradient floatation. Here, 95% of TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B were reconstituted. These three parameters were used to calculate the average number of correctly-inserted TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B complexes per proteoliposome. We added further information in the main text for clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2B could benefit by having a darker contrast.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment.

We have corrected the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 2D and related supplement figure: The decay does not look monoexponential. I suspect that there are 2 different koff values: One for the dissociation of nucleotide from the canonical site (after hydrolysis) and the other for dissociation from the degenerate site. In that respect, it is surprising that in Figure 2F the nucleotide from the degenerate site does not seem to come off. Why does more than 80% of bound nucleotide dissociate in the experiment shown in 2D (this number indicates that dissociation from both sites takes place), but only 50% in 2F (this number suggests that ATP in the degenerate site does not come off).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. In scintillation proximity assays (SPA), ATP binding signals are slightly declining over time. This linear decrease is underlying the exponential decay of nucleotide dissociation. In principle, the signals could be corrected by the linear decrease. However, we decided to present the original raw data without further background subtraction. Regarding Figure2F, we analyzed the identity of nucleotides that were occluded by TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B along the IF-to-OF switch after the removal of free ATP. After the hydrolysis event, hydrolysis products (ATP, ADP, and P<sub>i</sub>) are released from TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B. Therefore, over time the ATP to ADP ratio is approaching 1/1. In the main text, we have clarified these differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 2E: In the &quot;No nucleotide&quot; control there is a clear increase in bound peptide over the time course of the experiment. This must be explained. My guess is that ATP co-purifies with the protein.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. When measuring peptide binding by SPA, we observe a slight increase of binding over longer time periods. Since TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B is immobilized on SPA beads, we suggest that peptide equilibration takes longer. We have changed the main text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 2—figure supplement 1 panel B: At 4 degrees, only 50% of bound nucleotide is released. Explain. It may be that the dissociation from the degenerate site is much slower at 4 degrees than at higher temp, or that the dissociation from the canonical site is much slower. To tell these two events apart would really give new insight.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. It is an interesting observation that the <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> rate is decreased at 4°C while the amount of released nucleotide is reduced to 50%. We assume an asymmetric opening of both nucleotide-binding sites (NBSs) which is in line with previous reports (Barth et al., 2018, J Am Chem Soc). However, we can only speculate about the asymmetric contributions of both NBSs along the OF-to-IF transition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Subsection “A single ATP turnover and phosphate release trigger the OF-to-IF return”: The difference in half-life at the different temperatures is very small. Given the large conformational change needed for the dissociation to occur, I find the marginal temperature dependence surprising. Explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Since the OF-to-IF transition is initiated by a single turnover of ATP, we expected a large temperature dependency between 4°C, 20°C and 45°C. However, the physiological temperature of TmrAB is 68°C (Zutz et al., 2011), making it impossible to monitor nucleotide dissociation by SPA. For lower temperatures, the OF-to-IF return appears to show marginal temperature dependency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 panel B: It is unclear whether these experiments are identical or not. If yes: why show it twice? If not: explain the difference better.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comment. We utilized two different substrate peptides and two distinct methods to confirm the ATP-induced abrogation of substrate binding. We have changed the main text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 panel C: why are the absolute values (cpm) so different?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comment. In SPA, radiolabeled ligands are added in trace amounts to reduce background signals. In Figure1—figure supplement1C, the raw data is shown, while in Figure1B the signals are multiplied by the dilution factor of radiolabeled compound, resulting in much larger values. This is now explained more clearly in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Subsection “ATP binding drives substrate translocation monitored by single-liposome assays”: it is not clear what &quot;untreated&quot; refers to.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment.

Please show proper quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. The α-His immunoblot was used to determine the fraction of cleaved TmrA calculating the orientation of TmrAB in proteoliposomes. Equal loading of proteoliposomes was controlled by instant blue staining. We have explained this approach more clearly in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Figure 5C. I do not see biphasic behavior, and do not see the offset at 35 per liposome. I guess the wrong figure is shown?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comment. We observed an initial burst phase followed by a linear increase of the number of transported peptides per liposome for longer time periods. The offset of ~30 transported peptides per liposome resembles the y-intercept of the linear term of the regression function. We have explained this evaluation more clearly in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) In general, the authors should not oversell their nice work by using words like &quot;ultrasensitive&quot;, unscientific qualifications like &quot;almost unlimited&quot;.
