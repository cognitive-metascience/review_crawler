uptake. Despite this, little is known about the genes setting up this endodermal barrier. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a strong barrier mutant, <italic>schengen3</italic> (<italic>sgn3</italic>). We observe a surprising ability of the mutant to maintain nutrient homeostasis, but demonstrate a major defect in maintaining sufficient levels of the macronutrient potassium. We show that <italic>SGN3/GASSHO1</italic> is a receptor-like kinase that is necessary for localizing CASPARIAN STRIP DOMAIN PROTEINS (CASPs)—major players of endodermal differentiation—into an uninterrupted, ring-like domain. SGN3 appears to localize into a broader band, embedding growing CASP microdomains. The discovery of <italic>SGN3</italic> strongly advances our ability to interrogate mechanisms of plant nutrient homeostasis and provides a novel actor for localized microdomain formation at the endodermal plasma membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03115.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03115.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03115.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plant roots forage in the soil for minerals and water, but they must also provide a barrier that stops these nutrients leaking back out of the plant and stops microbes invading and causing disease. The endodermis—an inner layer of cells that surrounds the veins that run along the middle of a root—acts as such a barrier in young roots.</p><p>Polymers that repel water are deposited between the cells in the roots of almost all vascular plants—which include ferns, conifers, and flowering plants—to form a band around the endodermis called the ‘Casparian strip’. This strip seals off the young roots and stops water moving through the gaps between plant cells, but still allows minerals, nutrients, and water to be transported through the root cells and into the plant. However, the importance of this structure has yet to be tested due to the lack of mutant plants without a Casparian strip.</p><p>Pfister et al. now report that deleting the gene that encodes a protein called SCHENGEN3 in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> causes the Casparian strip to be interrupted by irregularly sized holes. This protein is normally found at high levels in the root endodermis, where it is embedded into the cell membranes. Pfister et al. also showed that without the SCHENGEN3 protein, other proteins called CASPs—that normally mark out a stripe around the root cells where the Casparian strip will form—only accumulated in discontinuous patches. Further experiments revealed that deleting the gene for SCHENGEN3 does not cause general problems in delivering the CASP proteins to the cell membrane; instead, it specifically stops the CASP proteins from forming a single, uninterrupted stripe.</p><p>Unexpectedly, disrupting the Casparian strip did not appear to hinder many of the functions of a root. The mutant plants could still take up water and nutrients, and the leaves of mutant plants had normal levels of many essential minerals—with the exception of potassium. The level of this mineral was much lower in mutant plants without the SCHENGEN3 protein. Pfister et al. suggest that in plants that lack an intact Casparian strip, potassium is continuously leaked from the root into the soil.</p><p>These findings reveal that in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, at least, the Casparian strip might not be as important as once thought for helping the plant to take up and accumulate water and nutrients. Further work is now needed to uncover the as yet unknown backup systems that might be able to compensate for the loss of this structure.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03115.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03115.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>root biology</kwd><kwd>polarity</kwd><kwd>plant nutrition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfister</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name><name><surname>Barberon</surname><given-names>Marie</given-names></name><name><surname>Alassimone</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name><name><surname>Kalmbach</surname><given-names>Lothar</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Yuree</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfister</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name><name><surname>Barberon</surname><given-names>Marie</given-names></name><name><surname>Alassimone</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name><name><surname>Kalmbach</surname><given-names>Lothar</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Yuree</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The SCHENGEN3 protein is needed for the progression of isolated microdomains into a continuous band, which is necessary for the establishment of the major extracellular diffusion barrier in plant roots: the Casparian strip.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The plant root is a highly selective filter that forages the soil environment for nutrients and water. Its function has been likened to that of an ‘inverted gut’, displaying a very similar dual role in uptake and protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Waisel et al., 2002</xref>). Selectivity of roots is thought to crucially depend on the endodermis, an inner cell layer that surrounds the central vascular strand of the root and represents the main paracellular (apoplastic) transport barrier in young roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geldner, 2013</xref>). This apoplastic diffusion barrier is set up by the ‘Casparian strips’, lignin-like, hydrophobic impregnations of the primary cell wall that form a supracellular net-like structure around the central vasculature. In analogy to the tight junction of gut epithelia, this net-like arrangement provides a seal of the extracellular space, while still allowing for nutrient and water transport across outer and inner plasma membrane surfaces. The Casparian strip-bearing endodermis therefore represents an independent development of a polarized epithelium, evolved in the context of multi-cellular organisms with wall-bearing cells.</p><p>Later during endodermal development, hydrophobic (cork-like) suberin lamellae form all around the endodermal surface. This protective suberization should eventually abolish direct transport across the endodermal plasma membrane, forcing symplastic passage through plasmodesmata from outer cell layers. Despite being a central, conserved feature of higher plants, nothing was known until recently about the factors that build and position the Casparian strip. This led to the frustrating situation of not being able to test the many supposed roles of the endodermis and its Casparian strip, because of an absence of specific mutants. Recent papers established that a family of previously undescribed four-transmembrane-span proteins, called CASPs, forms a central, ring-like membrane domain in the endodermis, called the Casparian strip membrane domain (CSD). This domain acts as a lateral diffusion barrier and separates the endodermal plasma membrane into two distinct polar domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Roppolo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alassimone et al., 2010</xref>). Upon localization, the CASPs show extreme stability and a lack of endocytosis or lateral diffusion. Moreover, CASPs show extensive pair-wise interactions and associate strongly with cell walls. Multiple knock-outs of <italic>CASP</italic> family members display strongly disorganized formation of Casparian strips, demonstrating their functional importance. It is thought that the CASPs act as scaffolds that spatially organize cell wall biosynthetic enzymes. <italic>CASP1</italic> was shown to determine the subcellular localization of a secreted peroxidase, <italic>PER64</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). In current models, the role of CASPs is to assemble a specific NADPH oxidase with peroxidases, leading to oxidation of mono-lignols and local polymerization of lignin. Lignin formation in vivo must implicate numerous other cell wall proteins and ENHANCED SUBERIN 1 (ESB1), a dirigent-like protein is a cell wall protein that has also been demonstrated to be crucial for the correct formation of Casparian strips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosmani et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>These recent breakthroughs held the promise that we might finally be able to investigate the functional relevance of the Casparian strip through analysis of the different mutants obtained. This however, turned out to be more difficult than expected. Multiple mutants of the <italic>CASP</italic> family display interrupted Casparian strips in the beginning, but rather quickly deposit more cell wall material in a delocalized fashion, eventually sealing the apoplast. A very similar phenotype occurs in the <italic>esb1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosmani et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, both mutants display an earlier and stronger production of suberin lamellae (<italic>esb1</italic> was named based on this phenomenon). This makes it difficult to use these mutants for assessing the importance of Casparian strips, since the partial defect on Casparian strip formation will always be confounded with the effect of ectopic/enhanced production of suberin in the same cells. In the <italic>rbohf</italic> mutant, the Casparian strip defect is only partial and restricted to the young part of the root. Moreover, <italic>RBOHF</italic> has roles in many different aspects of plant development and it would be hard to distinguish what phenotype is directly caused by defects in Casparian strip formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the discovery of a novel Casparian strip mutant, <italic>schengen3</italic> (<italic>sgn3</italic>). <italic>SGN3</italic> encodes a receptor-like kinase with strong expression in the root endodermis. The SGN3 protein accumulates in the plasma membrane in a broad band within which the CSD forms. In its absence, only discontinuous patches of CASPs are observed. <italic>SGN3</italic> loss-of-function leads to the strongest defects in Casparian strips known to date, with no indication of a compensatory upregulation of suberin, as seen for other mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosmani et al., 2013</xref>). Our analysis reveals a surprising capacity of the mutant to maintain homeostatic control in the absence of the major root diffusion barrier and challenges views according to which the root should lose its ability for selective nutrient uptake, because of a generalized, non-selective bypass of nutrients into the vasculature.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An endodermis-enriched receptor-like kinase is necessary for Casparian strip formation</title><p>In a forward genetic, GUS-based screen for endodermal barrier mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2013</xref>) (Alassimone et al., <italic>unpublished</italic>), we discovered one mutant, <italic>sgn3</italic> that displayed a dramatic defect in endodermal barrier formation, as visualized by penetration of the apoplastic tracer propidium iodide (PI) into the stele along the entire length of the root. This resembled a phenotype of T-DNA insertion lines in an endodermis-enriched gene that we had analyzed in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birnbaum et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brady et al., 2007</xref>). Complementation analysis and sequencing confirmed that the causal mutation in <italic>sgn3-2</italic> was an early stop codon in the open reading frame of <italic>At4g20140</italic>. <italic>SGN3</italic> encodes for a leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) of subfamily XI that had previously been described as <italic>GASSHO1</italic> (<italic>GSO1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tsuwamoto et al., 2008</xref>). In the previous publication, this LRR-RLK was investigated because of embryonic expression of a putative ortholog in <italic>Brassica napus</italic>, but no single mutant phenotype was found. A phenotype was only observed when <italic>gso1</italic> (<italic>sgn3</italic>) was combined with a mutant of its closest homolog, <italic>At5g44700</italic> (named <italic>GSO2</italic>). This <italic>gso1 gso2</italic> double mutant displayed a protodermal phenotype, characterized by a defective cuticle and fusion of cotyledons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tsuwamoto et al., 2008</xref>). True leaves did not differ from wild type. In contrast to <italic>SGN3/GSO1</italic>, <italic>GSO2</italic> was shown to be expressed only in shoots, but not in roots, explaining the exclusive root phenotype in the <italic>sgn3</italic> single mutant that we report here and that had escaped detection earlier on. In order to investigate the cause of this phenotype, we investigated formation of the Casparian strip and found that it is still formed and correctly positioned, but that it is repeatedly interrupted, forming irregularly-sized ‘holes’ of several micrometer in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Suberin lamellae formation, by contrast, appeared at a position and in a manner very similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03115.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>SGN3</italic> receptor-like kinase is important to establish a functional endodermal barrier.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lack of endodermal diffusion barrier in <italic>sgn3-3</italic> visualized by presence of propidium iodide (PI) in stele.

In the <italic>sgn3</italic> background, CASP1-GFP showed a pattern of interrupted patches that was strikingly similar to that of the Casparian strip itself. This suggests that it is the incorrect localization of the CASPs that causes the Casparian strip defects of the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, in a novel forward genetic screen in which we scored directly for mutants with altered CASP1-GFP localization (Kalmbach et al., <italic>unpublished</italic>), we found 14 novel alleles of <italic>sgn3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). This suggests that <italic>SGN3</italic> is one of the major non-redundant genes necessary for CASP localization in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. We could show that not only CASP1-GFP, but all four other CASPs (CASP2-5) display identical defects in <italic>sgn3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>An interrupted CSD should abolish the lateral diffusion barrier in the plasma membrane of endodermal cells that we had previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alassimone et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, a generic plasma membrane protein that is excluded from the CSD in wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alassimone et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) shows a pattern of exclusion in the mutant that represents a perfect negative image to the CASP1-GFP islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This illustrates that the lateral diffusion barrier between inner and outer plasma membrane domain is absent in <italic>sgn3</italic> mutants, but that the remaining CSD islands are still able to exclude other proteins. To our surprise, this defect did not affect the polar localization of PDR6, a transporter that localizes to the outer polar domain in the endodermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This indicates that a strict polarity in the endodermis can be maintained in the absence of a diffusion barrier, further supporting the notion that polarity of transmembrane proteins in plants might simply be maintained by generally low lateral diffusion, high rates of endocytosis, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geldner, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CASP stability and cell wall attachment remain intact in the <italic>sgn3</italic> mutant</title><p>We had shown previously that during endodermal differentiation, CASP1-GFP changes from a protein that displays endocytic cycling and lateral diffusion to one that is highly stable and immobile in the CSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Roppolo et al., 2011</xref>). In this process, CASP1-GFP localization passes through a ‘string of pearls’ stage, in which individual islands or ‘patches’ of CASP1-GFP are aligned in a band before eventually fusing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Comparison of 3D-time-lapse observations of endodermal differentiation revealed that <italic>sgn3</italic> is not able to progress from this ‘string of pearls’ stage, but only undergoes partial fusion of individual islands, leading to CASP1-GFP patches of heterogenous size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We further found by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) that these CASP1-GFP islands have similar stability and turnover as wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Another feature of the CSD is its very strong adherence to the cell wall, leading to the long-described phenomenon of ‘band plasmolysis’ in endodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krömer, 1903</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrisch, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alassimone et al., 2010</xref>). The inability of the CASP1-GFP ring to retract from the Casparian strip upon plasmolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) allow for easy visualization of this phenomenon. This adhesion leads to greatly flattened, often fenestrated protoplasts, that looked very unlike the usual, rounded protoplasts of epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alassimone et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>sgn3</italic> showed the very same inability of CASP1-GFP to retract from the strips, demonstrating that plasma membrane-to-cell wall attachment remains intact in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conclude that <italic>sgn3</italic> does not cause a general defect in CASP1-GFP trafficking, polymerization or cell wall attachment, but rather a specific defect in the progression of already stable CASP islands towards a contiguous band.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03115.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SGN3 localizes on both sides of the Casparian strip domain and is important for the CASP1-GFP patches to fuse into a contiguous band.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 3D-confocal time lapse imaging of <italic>CASP1::CASP1-GFP</italic> in Col-0 and <italic>sgn3-3</italic> background reveals problems with progression of CASP1-GFP localization in <italic>sgn3-3</italic>.

Only a C-terminal mVenus fusion with a 9.4-kb genomic fragment containing intron, 5′UTR, and the upstream neighboring gene, provided full complementation of the mutant phenotype, indicating functionality of the protein fusion and of its regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). In transgenic lines of this construct, expression of SGN3 could be observed in endodermal cells shortly after the onset of elongation, preceding the onset of <italic>CASP1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is consistent with a function of SGN3 in establishing correct CASP1 localization. Initially, SGN3 could be found on all cell sides, but it then quickly accumulated in the transversal and anticlinal sides of the plasma membrane, yet became excluded from the CSD itself—a hitherto unknown subcellular localization pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). In 3D-reconstructions this leads to the appearance of a broader ring-like domain that flanks the more restricted, median CSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). During the critical phase of CASP domain progression from isolated islands towards a fused ring—at which the <italic>sgn3</italic> phenotype becomes apparent–SGN3 is seen to surround individual CASP islands on all sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Such localization would fit with a role of SGN3 in promoting fusion of growing CASP islands, such that an uninterrupted band can be formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title><italic>SGN3</italic> is required for the enhanced suberin production of other Casparian strip-defective mutants</title><p>In order to establish the functional relationships between <italic>SGN3</italic> and other previously characterized genes, we combined <italic>sgn3</italic> with <italic>casp1 casp3</italic> double and <italic>esb1</italic> single mutants. ESB1 is an extracellular protein that localizes to the site of Casparian strip formation and whose absence causes a phenotype resembling that of <italic>sgn3</italic> insofar as both the Casparian strip itself and CASP1-GFP are localized in interrupted bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosmani et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to <italic>sgn3</italic>, however, <italic>esb1</italic> mutants additionally display increased, delocalized deposition of additional autofluorescent cell wall material as well as enhanced and earlier deposition of suberin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosmani et al., 2013</xref>). We found ESB1-mCherry in <italic>sgn3</italic> to be both present and correctly localized, that is, specifically accumulating at the remaining CASP1-GFP islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, ESB1 does not require SGN3 for its accumulation and localization and the Casparian strip discontinuities in <italic>esb1</italic> and <italic>sgn3</italic> might be caused by independent mechanisms. Consistently, we found that <italic>sgn3 esb1</italic> double mutant formed less and/or smaller Casparian strip patches than each single mutant, indicating additivity of the two mutations in this common aspect of their phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Intriguingly however, <italic>sgn3 esb1</italic> double mutants neither display an increased or delocalized deposition of autofluorescent cell wall material, nor an enhanced and earlier formation of suberin.

The enhanced and ectopic formation of autofluorescence and suberin is thought to be due to a feedback and crosstalk between cell wall components, connecting correct Casparian strip formation to the further deposition of lignin and suberin lamellae formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosmani et al., 2013</xref>).

Especially under conditions of high transpiration, this would be expected to lead to a strong, uncontrolled and possibly detrimental influx of elements into the transpiration stream. We observed that transpiration rate per surface area in <italic>sgn3</italic> mutants are very similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) revealing that there is no compensatory downregulation of transpiration. Another predicted consequence of interrupted Casparian strips is an inability to build up root pressure, a process necessary for vascular transport of nutrients and water in the absence of transpiration and for transport into non-transpiring organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wegner, 2014</xref>). Root pressure build-up in the dead xylem vessels is thought to involve an osmotic gradient, generated by living neighbors, that draws water into the vessels. Pressure build-up, however, is thought to crucially depend on the presence of the Casparian strips as an apoplastic diffusion barrier, without which xylem pressure should quickly dissipate into the cortex. We indeed found that root pressure, as estimated by xylem sap exudation from hypocotyls after decapitation, was lower in the <italic>sgn3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). <italic>sgn3</italic> also showed a decreased rate of leaf guttation, a process more indirectly dependent on root pressure, but that can be observed less invasively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Our findings are the first genetic evidence that Casparian strips can be relevant for root pressure buildup and impose a hydraulic resistance; the magnitude of the observed effects nevertheless indicates that an intact Casparian strip is not an absolute requirement and that unmodified walls and/or suberized cells can generate a sufficiently high resistance to radial waterflow so that the positive root pressure can be maintained. <italic>sgn3</italic> might be very useful to dissect the mechanisms of root pressure formation and its role in nutrient transport in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Transcriptional profiles suggest a latent potassium deficiency in <italic>sgn3</italic> mutants</title><p>In order to identify some potential stress and/or compensatory responses in the <italic>sgn3</italic> mutant, we generated a general transcriptional profile of <italic>sgn3</italic> mutant rosettes, grown under conditions in which wild type and <italic>sgn3</italic> were indistinguishable.

Surprisingly, concentrations of most elements remained essentially unaltered in <italic>sgn3</italic>. Despite the dramatic apoplastic bypass in <italic>sgn3</italic> roots, the mutants managed to maintain wild type levels of sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), or boron (B), for example. Among the measured transition elements (Mo, Co, Mn, Zn, Fe, Cu, Zn) only zinc showed a significant decrease in some measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). However, matching the transcriptional profiling results, we invariably found lower levels of potassium (K) in the mutant (ranging from 1.4–3.0 fold reduction). Inversely, levels of magnesium (Mg) and cesium (Cs) accumulated to higher levels than in wild type, ranging from 1.5–2.1 and 1.3- to 1.4-fold increase, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>).

How this localized deposition is achieved is only rarely understood in any mechanistic detail, with the notable exception of wall deposition in metaxylem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Oda and Fukuda, 2012</xref>). Localized wall deposition should implicate the formation of microdomains in the plasma membrane that localize cell wall biosynthetic activity. Walls, in turn, signal back to the cell, and this process informs about mechanical stresses, wall polymer breakdown or for regulated expansion growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung and Wu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lindner et al., 2012</xref>). The precisely localized, ring-like Casparian strip can be used as a model for studying localized wall deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). The <italic>SGN3</italic> LRR-RLK appears to be involved in both the formation of the CSD and the signaling of defective Casparian strips. Lack of <italic>SGN3</italic> causes an inability of CASP1-GFP patches to fuse into a contiguous band, without affecting the positioning of the patches along a median ring, nor the stability or functionality of the already established patches. SGN3 localization to the transversal and anticlinal, but not the periclinal membrane domains further increases the complexity of subdomains present at the endodermal plasma membrane. It embeds the forming CASP domain into a larger subdomain within which the narrower CSD is formed. Direct interaction of CASPs and SGN3 could take place early during CASP accumulation at the membrane and occur at the rims of forming CASP patches, possibly promoting patch growth and fusion. This can now be tested in future experiments. A second, currently unrelated role for <italic>SGN3</italic> is the induction of increased lignin and suberin formation in other Casparian strip mutants, such as <italic>esb1</italic> or <italic>casp1 casp3</italic>. We speculate that SGN3 acts as a kinase that reports CSD integrity, signaling an upregulation of lignin, and suberin production. A surveillance of Casparian strip integrity could be of great importance for unimpeded root function and would parallel the surveillance of tight junctions that has been reported for animal epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balda and Matter, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>SGN3 has redundant activities outside the endodermis</title><p>We could demonstrate that exclusive expression of SGN3 in the differentiating root endodermis is sufficient to rescue the overall growth defect of <italic>sgn3</italic>. This indicates that the endodermal function that we describe here is the only specific, non-redundant activity of this receptor in the plant. The earlier described function of <italic>SGN3/GSO1</italic> in the formation of an embryonic cuticle by contrast is fully redundant with that of its homolog <italic>GSO2</italic>. The dramatic cotyledonary phenotype of the double mutant is bound to have secondary consequences on seedling growth, making it very difficult to dissect primary from secondary effects. A recent investigation of root meristem defects of the double mutants, for example, could entirely be explained as secondary consequences of the primary defect in embryonic cuticle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Racolta et al., 2014</xref>). It is nevertheless important to speculate how the two functions of endodermal Casparian strip formation and protodermal cuticle formation could be explained by a common molecular activity. By genetic analysis, the <italic>GSO1 GSO2</italic> pair has been assigned to a signaling pathway that depends on an endosperm-expressed subtilase (ABNORMAL LEAF-SHAPE1, ALE1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xing et al., 2013</xref>). In a currently speculative scenario, subtilases might be involved in processing of peptide hormones that could act as ligands for SGN3/GSO1, promoting formation of a functional cuticle. Yet, the endodermal, lignified Casparian strip and the protodermal, cutin-based embryonic cuticle are two chemically different cell wall modifications that also show distinct modes and sites of deposition within the primary cell wall. These differences make it difficult to perceive a common denominator for SGN3 action in these two cell types. Moreover, our data suggest that a primary function of SGN3/GSO1 is the formation of a continuous band of CASP membrane proteins. No CASP homologs have been implicated in cuticle formation up-to-now, nor are there any indications for the presence of a highly scaffolded membrane protein domain in the epidermis/protodermis that would resemble the CSD. Another <italic>SGN3/GSO1</italic> function that we could establish is the promotion of suberin formation in response to a defective Casparian strip. Enhanced suberin formation in <italic>esb1</italic> appears to be entirely dependent on SGN3 activity, although the normal developmental progression of suberin formation is not affected in the mutant. Suberin and cutin are chemically closely related polymers whose monomers are formed by sets of homologous enzymes. A common role of <italic>SGN3</italic> might be to mediate a cross-talk between cell wall components, possibly regulating suberin production in endodermis and cutin production in epidermis/protodermis. Identification of the SGN3 ligands and downstream kinase substrates will be crucial for an understanding of the common mechanism that might underlie these apparently divergent functions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title><italic>sgn3</italic> is the strongest and most specific Casparian strip mutant known to date</title><p>Regardless of the fact that <italic>SGN3</italic> has other roles in the plant, the <italic>sgn3</italic> single mutant defect reported here remains exquisitely specific to the endodermis. This is supported by the fact that it is only in the endodermis where <italic>SGN3</italic> expression is non-overlapping with its close homolog, <italic>GSO2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tsuwamoto et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, exclusive expression of <italic>SGN3</italic> in the endodermis is able to rescue the overall growth defects observed in aerial parts (this study). In addition to its specificity, the <italic>sgn3</italic> phenotype turns out to be strong and robust, that is, it displays penetration of tracer along the whole length of a seedling root and the phenotype is stable in the different growth conditions that we tested. Finally, <italic>sgn3</italic> does not show any of the enhanced suberin formation that has been observed in other mutants and which confounds interpretation of phenotypes. We therefore propose that the <italic>sgn3</italic> mutant is uniquely suited to obtain insights into the specific role of Casparian strips in plants. This mutant might be very useful for investigating not only root nutrient and water uptake, but also for addressing the role of the endodermal barrier in pathogen resistance, hormonal transport, stress, or general growth responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title><italic>sgn3</italic> nutrient homeostatic defects are surprisingly specific</title><p>Our first analysis of the <italic>sgn3</italic> mutant has revealed an unexpected robustness of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> growth towards a complete lack of its main root diffusion barrier. While still able to grow and complete its life cycle, the mutant nevertheless displays greatly exacerbated growth reductions to non-stressful changes in environmental conditions. This indicates the presence of homeostatic backup systems in the plant that are incompletely compensating for the absence of Casparian strips. Homeostasis of many elements is kept in the <italic>sgn3</italic> mutant, and it is intriguing that it is specifically potassium that shows a reproducibly strong decrease in concentration. Potassium (K) is the only macronutrient (N,P,K,S) that is not integrated into polymers and that remains highly mobile within the plants. It is being used as a counter ion in many transport process and is recycled back to the root along with the phloem sap. At the same time, concentrations of potassium required for plant growth are high and potassium often needs to be concentrated 10–100 fold over the concentration found in the soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marschner and Marschner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang and Wu, 2013</xref>). It therefore makes a lot of sense that potassium is an element that cannot be kept at sufficiently high levels in Casparian strip defective plants. We propose that potassium located in the stelar apoplast is continuously lost to the outer cell layers and the soil in the absence of functional Casparian strips. Upregulation of potassium influx carriers in cortex/epidermis, as we have observed in <italic>sgn3</italic> roots, would certainly be able to recuperate large parts of the potassium being lost. However, a chronic condition of very low external potassium would lead to a breakdown in this transporter-mediated ‘potassium recycling’ and eventually cause the deficiency phenotypes that we observe. From this scenario, it follows that there should be a higher rate of potassium flux out-of and into the root stele in a <italic>sgn3</italic> mutant and that potassium homeostasis in the mutant is extremely dependent on increased activity of potassium transporters. We are currently working on substantiating this ‘potassium recycling’ model by specific interference with and visualization of potassium transporters in the mutant. Further analysis of <italic>sgn3</italic> will be instructive for a better understanding of root potassium transport in general and this analysis should also be extended to other macronutrients in the future.</p><p>What could be the reasons for the lack of effects on many other elements? It can be expected that similar compensatory responses as seen for potassium exist for other elements. If these elements need to be less concentrated over their external concentration—or if they are less mobile within the plant—the compensatory responses might be sufficient for maintaining homeostasis in the mutant. Interestingly, we found an increase in the levels of the divalent cation magnesium, while concentrations of the divalent calcium, for example, were not affected in <italic>sgn3</italic> mutants. This could be explained by a lower concentration gradient between the xylem sap and the external environment and a lower mobility of Calcium within the cell wall space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarkson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">White and Broadley, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, calcium concentration within the symplast is kept extremely low for cellular signaling purposes. Therefore, calcium delivery to aerial tissues is thought to occur either entirely through the apoplast–using the few apoplastic ‘bypasses’ of the endodermis at the root tip or at lateral root emergence sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">White, 2001</xref>)—or to employ a very short symplastic route passing exclusively through endodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarkson, 1984</xref>). In both scenarios, it is surprising that the opening of a massive apoplastic bypass in the <italic>sgn3</italic> mutant has no effect on calcium homeostasis, while it did affect levels of magnesium. Possibly, magnesium is more mobile in the apoplast than Calcium and undergoes increased apoplastic transport into the transpiration stream in <italic>sgn3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Thibault and Rinaudo, 1985</xref>). Identifying conditions in which calcium homeostasis also breaks down in <italic>sgn3</italic> would greatly advance our understanding of the calcium uptake mechanisms in plants.</p><p>The <italic>sgn3</italic> mutant represents a powerful new tool to better understand root uptake and transport mechanism of most other plant nutrients as well. Our initial analysis of the <italic>sgn3</italic> mutant challenges the current notions of the role of the Casparian strip as a required barrier for most or all elements. The ability to selectively disrupt this strict endodermal barrier will allow for direct investigations of other mechanisms that maintain and buffer ion homeostasis. Unmodified cell walls, by their properties as ion exchange matrices, in conjunction with vacuolar storage of elements, can play pivotal roles in maintaining homeostasis of many elements. Cytoplasmic magnesium levels, for example, might well remain unaltered in <italic>sgn3</italic>, the increased magnesium levels being entirely absorbed by the vacuole. Having taken away the ‘first lock’ of the Casparian strip now puts the focus on the existence of ‘second locks’ that can be studied using the <italic>sgn3</italic> mutant as a sensitized background.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ecotype Columbia was used for all experiments.

Through a series of elegant cell biology and genetics experiment they demonstrate that SGN3 is an upstream signaling component that plays a role in the progression of stable CASP islands during Casparian strip formation. <italic>sgn3</italic> is the first mutant with a permanently discontinuous Casparian strip and this enabled the authors to demonstrate the functional significance of the Casparian strip in controlling root pressure, hydroponic conductivity and mineral nutrient homeostasis. The reviewers' main concerns relate to the claims about mineral nutrient phenotypes and the following revisions are required.</p><p>1) The authors place tremendous emphasis on potassium (K) and conclude that this is the only macronutrient that is greatly affected in the mutant. However, data for nitrogen (N) or sulfur (S) are not included while limited phosphorus (P) data suggest an approximately 60% reduction in P accumulation when plants are grown in soil. Thus, it is possible that both macro-nutrients K and P are affected. This requires further evaluation and additional data for K and P levels in soil grown plants should be included. In addition, the lack of evaluation of N and S should be acknowledged and the claims about the specificity of the K phenotype should be removed.</p><p>2) The low and high K experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 E/F</xref>) shows a difference in plant growth which is attributed to differences in K levels. In order to support this, the leaf K levels of these plants should be presented. (The yellow leaf phenotype could arise from differences in nitrate, which appear to differ in the low and high K treatment as KNO3 was omitted from the low K treatment.)</p><p>3) The iron levels are higher than potassium levels in the hydroponics experiments (Figure 5–figure supplement 2). It would be helpful to readers to add a comment on this observation.</p><p>4) The authors' statements, that the lack of effects on most nutrients counters the present (“text book”) understanding of plant nutrition, do not appear to be up-to-date, especially for micronutrients. It is known that high-affinity (secondary) active transporters and endodermal exporters are important for micronutrient uptake and ultimate transfer to the xylem (and phloem) and a somewhat leaky Casparian strip should have either little or perhaps only small secondary effects on nutrient accumulation, especially for those using (secondary) active transport. It is likely that out-of-date text books can be found, but the old model referenced by the authors does not conform to the present understanding of the electrical and energetic properties of many nutrient transporters. These over-statements should be removed.</p><p>5) The nutrient content of the media and fertilizers used are important for the conclusions and should be provided fully for all experiments in the Methods section.</p><p>6) The text of the manuscript should be edited to make it more concise.</p><p>7) As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, the <italic>sgn3</italic> transcript data are similar to drought and salt responses. The latter could be further evaluated by running a salt stress experiment and assessing plant growth and ion content of roots and leaves. As salt stress occurs at high millimolar NaCl concentrations, by-pass transport is likely to be more relevant in the <italic>sgn3</italic> mutant, similar to NaCl transfer in natural rice variants. This experiment is not essential but the reviewers felt that this would strengthen the case for ion-related phenotypes in <italic>sgn3</italic>. The experiment is not difficult and could be run in parallel with the experiment that further evaluates K and P levels in soil/gravel grown plants as requested in point 1.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “A receptor-like kinase mutant with absent endodermal diffusion barrier displays selective nutrient homeostasis defects” for further consideration at <italic>eLife.</italic> The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) You elected to focus on changes in potassium in <italic>sgn3</italic>.

We have reformulated the sentence in the Discussion. We also agree that it would be worthwhile to investigate also N, P, and S. However, we were very careful in this first paper to only present robust changes that reproducibly occurred in all measurements, from us and in the labs of our collaborators. Therefore, we would not like to present possible changes in other macronutrients that have only be found in one experimental set in our laboratory, which is, however, the only thing we would be able to deliver in a reasonable time-scale for this revision. We would therefore prefer not to add and discuss other macronutrient data in this work. As suggested, we have added a sentence in the discussion that acknowledges the lack of macronutrient data.</p><p><italic>2) The low and high K experiment (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5 E/F</italic></xref><italic>) shows a difference in plant growth which is attributed to differences in K levels.

We actually incorrectly described this in our Methods. We are sorry about this. We did not simply omit KNO3, but replaced it with NH4NO3, which excludes the possibility that the yellowing arises from deficiency in Nitrate.</p><p><italic>3) The iron levels are higher than potassium levels in the hydroponics experiments (Figure 5–figure supplement 2). It would be helpful to readers to add a comment on this observation</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We had a unit problem in our data, caused by formatting problems (microgram to milligram). This has been corrected now. We are sorry for this confusion.</p><p><italic>4) The authors' statements, that the lack of effects on most nutrients counters the present (“text book”) understanding of plant nutrition, do not appear to be up-to-date, especially for micronutrients. It is known that high-affinity (secondary) active transporters and endodermal exporters are important for micronutrient uptake and ultimate transfer to the xylem (and phloem) and a somewhat leaky Casparian strip should have either little or perhaps only small secondary effects on nutrient accumulation, especially for those using (secondary) active transport.

These over-statements should be removed</italic>.</p><p>We have removed the “textbook” mention in the Discussion and elsewhere, which we agree might be seen as an overstatement. We maintain, however, that our current understanding of the Casparian strip is that of a fundamental diffusion barrier in the apoplast of the root, whose absence should either cause excessive influx of elements into the xylem or a loss of accumulated elements from it. To our knowledge there is no data or predictive model at present that would allow us to understand why a given element is increased, decreased or unaltered in the absence of an endodermal barrier. If the editor or reviewers know of a current textbook, review or original paper that addresses this question, we would be very grateful for a reference. We are also very much aware of the manifold ways that plant cells use to actively transport nutrients into or out-of the cell. Yet, we fail to see how any transporter, channel or pump, driven by ATP, using proton or other gradients, in symport or antiport, electrogenic or not, would be able to control diffusion of ions from the apoplastic space of the cortex/soil to the apoplastic space of the xylem if there is no diffusion barrier. Transport proteins can only control what goes into and out-of the symplast. What the <italic>sgn3</italic> mutations do is to create an <italic>apoplastic bypass</italic> that will allow gradients to dissipate between the stelar and cortical apoplast generated by the activity of transporters. The importance of transport into and out-of the symplast has been heavily investigated in recent decades through the identification and characterization of a plethora of transport proteins. During this period, not much attention has been paid to the relevance of the Casparian strip, because of a lack of tools and the models about its function have essentially remained unaltered for decades because of this.</p><p><italic>5) The nutrient content of the media and fertilizers used are important for the conclusions and should be provided fully for all experiments in the Methods section</italic>.</p><p>We have provided this information.</p><p><italic>6) The text of the manuscript should be edited to make it more concise</italic>.</p><p>We agree. We have been able to shorten the main text considerably. In order to focus the story, we also eliminated the part that described CASP4 as a downstream target, which is of unclear functional relevance and really doesn’t contribute to the story.</p><p><italic>7) As shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>, the</italic> sgn3 <italic>transcript data are similar to drought and salt responses.

Nevertheless, we have tested repeatedly for salt and drought stress, with variable results. In the end we concluded that there certainly is no strong, reproducible drought or salt sensitivity of <italic>sgn3</italic> in our hands, although colleagues of ours might have found some degree of salt sensitivity of <italic>sgn3</italic>. In this context, we would prefer not to present data on drought or salt sensitivity. We would like to point out that this paper is the result of years of screening of many different nutrient stress conditions and that we only present in this work the data that we feel is the most instructive, robust, and reproducible.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “A receptor-like kinase mutant with absent endodermal diffusion barrier displays selective nutrient homeostasis defects” for further consideration at</italic> eLife<italic>.
