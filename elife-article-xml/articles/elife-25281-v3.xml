pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25281.001</object-id><p>Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive brain tumor. Current standard-of-care results in a marginal therapeutic outcome, partly due to acquirement of resistance and insufficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration of chemotherapeutics. To circumvent these limitations, we conjugated the chemotherapy paclitaxel (PTX) to a dendritic polyglycerol sulfate (dPGS) nanocarrier. dPGS is able to cross the BBB, bind to P/L-selectins and accumulate selectively in intracranial tumors. We show that dPGS has dual targeting properties, as we found that P-selectin is not only expressed on tumor endothelium but also on glioblastoma cells. We delivered dPGS-PTX in combination with a peptidomimetic of the anti-angiogenic protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1 PM). This combination resulted in a remarkable synergistic anticancer effect on intracranial human and murine glioblastoma via induction of Fas and Fas-L, with no side effects compared to free PTX or temozolomide. This study shows that our unique therapeutic approach offers a viable alternative for the treatment of glioblastoma.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>P/L-selectins</kwd><kwd>glioblastoma</kwd><kwd>targeted delivery</kwd><kwd>polymeric nanomedicine</kwd><kwd>polyglycerol</kwd><kwd>thrombospondin-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>617445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Satchi-Fainaro</surname><given-names>Ronit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>918/14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Satchi-Fainaro</surname><given-names>Ronit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003975</institution-id><institution>Israel Cancer Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20150909</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Satchi-Fainaro</surname><given-names>Ronit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13N11536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haag</surname><given-names>Rainer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13N12561</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calderón</surname><given-names>Marcelo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Treatment with precision nanomedicine in combination with an anti-angiogenic peptide enhance anti-tumor efficacy while minimizing toxicities in a pre-clinical glioblastoma model, making this approach a promising and important therapeutic alternative for patients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glioblastoma is the most common form of primary brain tumor and is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wen and Kesari, 2008</xref>). Without treatment, the median survival is approximately 3 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schapira, 2007</xref>). The current standard of treatment involves maximal surgical resection followed by concurrent radiation therapy and chemotherapy with the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stupp et al., 2005</xref>). With this regimen, the median survival is increased to approximately 14 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stupp et al., 2005</xref>). Glioblastoma’s diffusive and invasive nature makes complete removal of the tumor by conventional surgery nearly impossible. Therefore, tumor recurrence is inevitable and only 1.8% of patients survive more than three years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scott et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wen and Kesari, 2008</xref>). Management options for recurrent glioblastoma include a second cycle of surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy, for which the majority of treatment options remain palliative. In some patients, surgery is accompanied by an implantation of biodegradable wafers carrying the chemotherapeutic agent carmustine (GLIADEL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brem and Gabikian, 2001</xref>). Various other treatments using cytotoxic chemotherapy have shown disappointing results with an average overall survival (OS) of 3–9 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lamborn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yung et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody, was FDA-approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kreisl et al., 2009</xref>). Although progression-free survival was slightly prolonged and an overall lowering of glucocorticoid requirements to control tumor-related edema was shown in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>), treatment with bevacizumab among patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma did not exhibit improvement in OS of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chinot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>). As most patients develop resistance to current therapy, poor patient outcomes with minimally effective treatment options necessitate the development of novel agents that target relevant therapeutic pathways.</p><p>The high prevalence of resistance to conventional therapy in glioblastoma (30–60% of patients)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weller et al., 2010</xref>) and poor outcome have led to several studies screening for new potential drugs that typically target other vital cellular functions. Mitotic inhibitors, such as paclitaxel (PTX), were found to be among the most potent drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). This class of drug binds to polymerized tubulin and inhibits the dissociation rate, leading to M phase cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schiff et al., 1979</xref>). PTX was shown to be highly potent against glioblastoma cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahan et al., 1994</xref>), but systemic delivery was associated with poor pharmacokinetics and neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, hypersensitivity was an additional toxicity which was not attributed to the drug itself, but rather to its polyoxyethylated castor oil solubilizing vehicle, Cremophor EL (CrEL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mielke et al., 2005</xref>). Clinically significant neurotoxicity appears after administration of a cumulative dose of around 1,500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briasoulis et al., 2002</xref>). This suggests that a smart delivery system, that will facilitate its selective transport to the cancerous tissue, might reduce or even eliminate these adverse effects and improve its pharmacokinetics and tumor accumulation.</p><p>A well-designed polymeric drug delivery system (DDS) improves the therapeutic index of anticancer agents. An ideal DDS can increase the half-life of low-molecular-weight drugs, improve water-solubility (<italic>i.e.,</italic> CrEL-free formulations) and cause selective tumor tissue accumulation, all while enhancing anticancer efficacy, reducing toxicity and limiting drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Markovsky et al., 2012</xref>). These delivery systems exploit the natural (blood circulation and extravasation-dependent targeting – ‘passive’) distribution pattern of a drug-carrier in vivo, which is based upon the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsumura and Maeda, 1986</xref>). Despite the fact that excessive angiogenesis and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are hallmarks of glioblastoma, restricted permeability of the BBB to systemic therapy is still a persistent challenge. Previous studies have shown that blood circulation and extravasation-dependent targeting of DDS to brain tumors does not lead to sufficient drug penetration to the tumor, and thus results in very little improvement in therapeutic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Muldoon et al., 2007</xref>). The drawbacks of passive targeting have led to the investigation of active ligand directed-targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kang et al., 2015</xref>) or local delivery to the resected tumor cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brem and Gabikian, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ranganath et al., 2009</xref>) for PTX delivery. Most targeted DDS that are currently in preclinical or phase I trials are designed to target BBB-related moieties (<italic>e.g.</italic> systems conjugated to ligands or antibodies to transferrin receptor, insulin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and LDL receptor-related protein-1 and −2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pardridge, 2010</xref>). While crossing the BBB is of significant importance, drug efficacy in brain tumors requires diffusion in the brain extracellular space (ECS) in addition to the ability to cross the cancer cells membrane for internalization. Diffusion across the ECS in the brain is greatly limited by high cerebrospinal fluid turnover rate and efflux system, which results in drug elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huynh et al., 2006</xref>). Even with technological advances in surgical techniques, malignant glioma often recur within 1–2 cm of the original tumor site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hochberg and Pruitt, 1980</xref>). Therefore, local delivery of drugs to the resected tumor cavity has emerged as a promising therapeutic alternative to treat residual disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hou et al., 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, diffusion of drugs is restricted to up to 3 mm from the injection site in case of local delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fleming and Saltzman, 2002</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that in order to achieve efficient targeting that will result in significant therapeutic efficacy, a DDS should be targeted to both the tumor microenvironment and the cancer cells, preferably internalizing via receptor-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate the delivery of PTX with dendritic polyglycerol sulfate (dPGS), targeting glioblastoma microenvironment as well as the cancer cells themselves. We have previously shown that dPGS nanocarriers, depending on size and degree of sulfation of the polymer core, bind and inhibit both L-selectin and P-selectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dernedde et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Khandare et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sousa-Herves et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weinhart et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weinhart et al., 2011b</xref>). Selectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that are physiologically expressed on the surface of endothelial cells (P-selectin and E-selectin), activated platelets (P-selectin) and leukocytes (L-selectin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Läubli and Borsig, 2010</xref>). Selectins are also involved in tumor cell binding and promote their invasion by supporting a permissive metastatic microenvironment and protecting them from recognition by immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Preusser et al., 2012</xref>). To target glioblastoma, we have chosen dPGS with the highest affinity to selectins, which consists of 90% sulfate groups and a 5 KDa molecular weight core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dernedde et al., 2010</xref>). Sulfate groups mimic the naturally occurring ligand of P/L-selectin and, as opposed to endogenous ligands, significantly increase binding affinity owing to their high number of functional groups. Here we show that dPGS can target not only the tumor microenvironment, but also the cancer cells, via binding to P-selectin expressed on glioblastoma cells. To the best of our knowledge, expression of P-selectin by glioblastoma cells was not previously reported. Utilizing a dendritic polyglycerol (dPG)-based structure as the DDS allows us to take advantage of its unique architecture. dPG forms three-dimensional hyperbranched nanostructures that have been shown before to efficiently extravasate through the compromised BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ofek et al., 2016</xref>). They are also water-soluble, easily tuned in size and functional groups, and synthesized on a kilogram scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calderón et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calderón et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hussain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weinhart et al., 2011b</xref>).</p><p>The benefits of combination therapy for cancer have been widely reported and reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eldar-Boock et al., 2013</xref>). We postulated that combining PTX with another therapeutic agent can potentially result in a synergistic anti-tumor effect while using a moderate PTX dosing regimen, thereby reducing its dose-limiting toxicities. Given the highly angiogenic nature of glioblastoma, our approach was to combine dPGS-PTX with a potent anti-angiogenic agent. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a key endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, and its expression is often lost or decreased throughout malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sargiannidou et al., 2001</xref>). In gliomas, TSP-1 downregulation results in accelerated disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsu et al., 1996</xref>) and loss of TSP-1 correlates with transition from low-grade astrocytoma to glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almog et al., 2009</xref>). The interactions of TSP-1 with multiple cell surface proteins determine its diverse functions. The anti-angiogenic activity of TSP-1 is predominantly attributed to type one thrombospondin repeats (TSRs) that interact with a fatty acid translocase receptor on the endothelial cell membrane, CD36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simantov and Silverstein, 2003</xref>). TSRs mimetic peptides have been successfully used to block angiogenesis and tumor growth in preclinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campbell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rusk et al., 2006</xref>). ABT-510 (Abbott Laboratories) is a nonapeptide with a single D-isoleucine replacement that resulted in a 1,000-fold increase of its anti-angiogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haviv et al., 2005</xref>). ABT-510-dependent apoptosis of tumor endothelial cells was shown to be induced by their upregulation of Fas ligand, and was amplified by low doses of chemotherapeutic agents since the latter increased endothelial cells presentation of CD95 death receptor, an effect seen with docetaxel (DTX) above 1 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yap et al., 2005</xref>). The peptide was also shown to normalize tumor vasculature, and thereby enhance the delivery and efficacy of both cisplatin and PTX in a syngeneic model of ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campbell et al., 2010</xref>). Preclinically active as monotherapy, it was evaluated in phase I and II clinical trials. ABT-510 mitigated orthotopic glioma growth in a mouse model by increasing apoptosis in tumor microvascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campbell et al., 2010</xref>). In a phase I clinical trial for the treatment of newly-diagnosed glioblastoma in combination with the standard of care (<italic>i.e.,</italic> TMZ and radiation), ABT-510 exhibited a favorable safety profile at a dose of up to 200 mg daily for 6 days and additional 4 weeks as monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nabors et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, improved clinical outcome was associated with downregulation of the pro-angiogenic factors fibroblasts growth factor-1 (FGF-1) and tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains-1 (TIE1). However, another phase I clinical trial showed a poor pharmacokinetic profile of the peptide, demonstrating only a one hour clearance half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoekstra et al., 2005</xref>). The short half-life of ABT-510 and the difficulty to achieve effective plasma concentrations may explain failures in phase II clinical trials both as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ebbinghaus et al., 2007</xref>). A second-generation octapeptide was developed (ABT-898) with improved potency and slower clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henkin and Volpert, 2011</xref>). Thus far, ABT-898 has been evaluated in preclinical models of epithelial ovarian cancer and of uveal melanoma in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campbell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) and in treatment of spontaneously-occurring soft tissue sarcoma in dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sahora et al., 2012</xref>). It was efficacious in all these settings. Here, we show that ABT-898 has a therapeutic potential for glioblastoma as well, by stabilizing blood vessels and reducing the angiogenic potential of established tumors.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that combination therapy of PTX and TSP-1 peptidomimetic (TSP-1 PM), ABT-898, in conjunction with improved selective targeting to the desired cancer tissue by dPGS, remarkably prolongs OS of mice bearing human and murine orthotopic glioblastoma. TSP-1 PM was delivered at a high dose of 100 mg/kg. PTX was delivered at a reduced accumulated dose of 90 mg/kg. This correlates to 270 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, which is considerably lower than the maximal tolerated cumulative dose reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briasoulis et al., 2002</xref>). This combination therapy was well tolerated by treated mice, with no neurological or systemic toxicities demonstrated.

These size differences might be attributed to a supramolecular arrangement of dPGS, resulting from the high affinity of the negatively-charged sulfate groups and positively-charged amine groups, as opposed to the dPG structure that contains neutral hydroxyl groups instead of sulfates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

SEM imaging of dPG-PTX particles was impossible, due to their small size compared with the instrument’s resolution relating to our organic nanoparticles.

The peripheral amine groups displayed on these dendritic structures allowed the simultaneous incorporation of PTX and indodicarbocyanine (IDCC) dyes, which was exploited to monitor the in vitro and in vivo behavior of the conjugates.

Flow cytometry analysis evaluating the uptake of IDCC-labeled dendritic conjugates demonstrated that they exhibit different internalization kinetics. dPGS-PTX-IDCC rapidly internalized into the cells within minutes, whereas the non-targeted conjugate, dPG-PTX-IDCC, internalized after more than 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To evaluate whether the internalization of dPGS-PTX is P-selectin-dependent, we used a low molecular weight P-selectin inhibitor (KF 38789, Tocris).

This demonstrated that dPGS-PTX internalizes into the cells via P-selectin. To further show the advantage of dPGS-PTX compared to its non-targeted control, we treated patient-derived glioblastoma tumor spheroids with IDCC-labeled dendritic conjugates.

PTX can then bind and stabilize the tubulin, arresting cells in mitosis. To investigate the intracellular trafficking mechanisms of the dendritic conjugates, cells treated with IDCC-labeled dPGS-PTX and dPG-PTX were stained for tubulin and their lysosomes were labeled using lysotracker. As demonstrated previously by flow cytometry, following 5 min incubation, the targeted sulfated dendritic conjugate was already detected at the cells cytoplasm and gradually accumulated for 4 hr. Tubulin damage was observed with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Co-localization analysis between dPGS-PTX-IDCC and tubulin supported these results. Increased localization of the targeted dendritic conjugate in the lysosome at the first 30 min, followed by reduction at the 2 hr time point, indicated that PTX was released into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, the non-targeted dendritic conjugate (dPG-PTX-IDCC), was observed inside the cells only after 4 hr and gradually accumulated following 8 hr.

The rapid internalization of dPGS-PTX (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 5 min) suggested an internalization mechanism other than fluid-phase pinocytosis via simple endocytosis. Therefore, P-Selectin expression was evaluated in U-87 MG cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, U-87 MG expressed high P-Selectin levels on their surface. In order to evaluate whether P-Selectin overexpression is a single cell line phenomenon, fresh glioblastoma tissues were collected and two new patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines were isolated. These two new cells lines and an additional murine glioblastoma cell line, GL261, were evaluated for their P-selectin expression by FACS. Surprisingly, P-Selectin overexpression was observed in all tested human and murine samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, in all cell lines tested, the shift in fluorescence signal observed by FACS analysis of a single peak indicates a single population expressing P-Selectin, rather than overexpression of a sub-population. Thus, suggesting that these major differences in internalization between the sulfated and non-sulfated conjugate might be a result of receptor-mediated endocytosis by dPGS-PTX. We therefore postulated that dPGS-PTX would not only target the tumor microenvironment, by binding P/E-Selectin on endothelial cells and activated platelets, but also the cancer cells population, thus resulting in improved selective targeting, enhanced cellular internalization by receptor-mediated endocytosis and better therapeutic outcome. To validate the therapeutic potential of our targeted nanoconjugate in vivo, we evaluated P-selectin expression in xenogeneic and syngeneic mouse models of human and murine glioblastoma.

However, as the expression of a gene in a given cancer should be compared to its levels in the relevant healthy reference tissue, such a comparison across different tumor types is less relevant. Indeed, when looking at SELP expression in different healthy tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) collection, we found that its levels are lowest in the brain (data not shown). We hence compared the expression levels of SELP gene in brain tissues obtained from three studies: healthy brain tissue from GTEx data (1259 samples) and lower grade glioma and glioblastoma from TCGA obtained from cBioPortal (530 and 578 samples, respectively). The expression levels of P-selectin were found to be markedly increased in gliomas compared to healthy brain tissue and further increased in glioblastomas. The resulting medians are 3.3234e-05, 1.8100e-04 and 9.4268e-04 for healthy tissue, lower grade glioma and glioblastoma, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data suggest that even though P-selectin expression in glioblastoma is low compared to other tumor types, it represents a suitable target for glioblastoma therapy due to its potential for achieving effective tumor targeting, while minimizing side effects. This finding is of great significance in glioblastoma, a disease which represents an urgent unmet clinical need.

With the aim of targeting both cancer cells and tumor vasculature, human glioblastoma cells, U-87 MG and U251, as well as endothelial cells were incubated in the presence of dPGS-PTX, dPG-PTX or free PTX at equivalent PTX dose for a prolonged period of time, allowing complete release of the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sousa-Herves et al., 2015</xref>). Seventy-two hours following incubation, both dendritic conjugates induced cell death at a similar extent as the free drug in all cell types tested; U-87 MG and U251 glioblastoma cells and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). Thus, we concluded that PTX conjugation to dPGS provides targeting to glioblastoma cells and results in efficient internalization into P-Selectin expressing cells, while maintaining PTX anti-tumorigenic and anti-angiogenic properties.</p><p>To note, these results were received when the cells were bathed for 72 hr with medium containing both compounds. Within 72 hr, most nanomedicines will internalize via endocytosis, whether it is fluid-phase pinocytosis (for the non-targeted conjugate) or receptor-mediated endocytosis (for the P-selectin-targeted conjugate). Therefore, we do not expect to see any differences in activity between the targeted and non-targeted dendritic conjugates in a standard cytotoxicity assay. To that end, we ran a pulse and chase assay where we treated U-87 MG glioblastoma cells with free PTX (which diffuses the fastest into the cells), with dPGS-PTX (which internalizes rapidly by receptor-mediated endocytosis) or by dPG-PTX (which passively internalizes via fluid-phase pinocytosis) leaving the cells for 72 hr and reading their viability thereafter. It can be seen that, as expected from these three compounds, there was a difference in IC<sub>50</sub> exhibiting the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> for free PTX (100 nM), intermediate for dPGS-PTX (400 nM) and the highest for the non-targeted dPG-PTX (N/A). This explains that even in vitro, we can detect differences in activity due to differences in internalization kinetics. The phenomenon is expected to be greatly enhanced in real in vivo settings when the compounds are flowing in the bloodstream and extravasating through the tumor leaky vessels, binding to cells expressing P-selectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>In vivo intracranial tumor targeting of dPGS-PTX</title><p>Therapeutic effect of glioma in general, and glioblastoma in particular, is often limited by low permeability of delivery systems across the BBB and poor penetration into the tumor tissue. dPGS conjugates have been shown previously to target P/L-selectin expressed at inflamed tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dernedde et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sousa-Herves et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weinhart et al., 2011b</xref>). Having shown preferable internalization of dPGS into glioblastoma cells compared to dPG in vitro, we proceeded with evaluating the ability of dPGS-PTX to overcome these two barriers in vivo as it is known that one of the cancer hallmarks is inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). The distribution and targeting capability of dye-labeled dPGS-PTX-IDCC was studied by intravital fluorescence imaging of mice bearing intracranial mCherry-labeled U-87 MG tumors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, one hour following systemic administration, dPGS-PTX-IDCC evidently accumulated at the mCherry-labeled tumor. Even with a higher exposure time, no IDCC signal was observed elsewhere in the body and the surrounding CNS tissue (IDCC signal was validated by spectral unmixing). Twenty-four hours later, substantial amount of the conjugate was still located at the intracranial tumor, as exhibited by a strong fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, only a faint signal was detected at the tumor core. This can be explained by the presence of a necrotic core within the tumor mass, which is a characteristic of high-grade gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gudinaviciene et al., 2004</xref>), that prevents the conjugate from penetrating. Another explanation is that dPGS-PTX has limited infiltration throughout the tumor tissue and therefore localize mainly at outer tumor areas. It is important to note that all glioblastoma patients are treated following tumor resection for residual tumor cells. Consequently, limited tumor penetration by dPGS-PTX may not be an impediment. Preferable accumulation at the tumor site was not observed following systemic delivery of dPG-PTX, which relies upon passive extravasation-dependent targeting alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Though, intracranial localization was observed to some extent. In fact, the strongest fluorescence signal was observed at what seems to be the liver location (according to fluorescence location), similar to many other DDS. Twenty-four hours following systemic administration, our control dPG-PTX is still observed in the brain, but at other organs at similar extent. These results suggest that when administered systemically, our sulfated conjugate will cross the BBB, selectively accumulate at the intracranial tumor site, and release the active drug.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25281.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>dPGS-PTX preferably accumulates in intracranial tumors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative non-invasive fluorescence images of mice bearing mCherry-labeled U-87 MG tumors (red) 1 hr and 24 hr following intravenous injection of IDCC-labeled dendritic conjugates (cyan) (n = 2).

One hour following injection, dPGS-PTX-IDCC was clearly visualized within the tumor tissue but not in the normal brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). At 24 hr following administration, dPGS-PTX-IDCC was still evident, though to a lesser extent, inside the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Conversely, the localization of dPG-PTX-IDCC in the tumor was negligent at both time points, with a slight increase of IDCC signal in the normal brain compared to dPGS-PTX-IDCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To understand where dPGS-PTX-IDCC acts within the tumor, we stained U-87 MG and GL261 tumor sections for P-selectin and CD31. As expected, P-selectin was highly expressed in both tumor types. However, although the IDCC dye highly colocalized with P-selectin in the GL261 tumors, its presence was less evident in all P-selectin positive cells in U-87 MG tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Conversely, a clear co-localization between dPGS-PTX-IDCC and the tumor endothelium was shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This suggests that P-selectin-targeted dPGS-PTX works primarily on P-selectin-expressing tumor vasculature and only then penetrates the tumor and affects P-selectin-expressing glioblastoma cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Thrombospondin-1 mimetic peptide (TSP-1 PM) has an anti-angiogenic effect in glioblastoma</title><p>As PTX-related toxicity is dose-dependent, we proposed to exploit combination therapy to investigate the possibility of an additive therapeutic effect while aiming to reduce the total required dose of PTX.</p><p>Therefore, we next aimed to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of dPGS-PTX in combination with a potent angiogenesis inhibitor. To do so, we utilized TSP-1 PM that induces anti-angiogenic activity by binding to TSR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henkin and Volpert, 2011</xref>). This TSP-1 PM is an octapeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), with high potency and low toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haviv et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Volpert et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, the ability of TSP-1 PM to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels from an ex vivo aortic ring was evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). An aortic ring was resected from mice, placed in matrigel and incubated in media from confluent U-87 MG cells. Extensive proliferation, sprouting and formation of tubular structures of endothelial cells were observed 8 days following incubation in media containing the pool of factors secreted by U-87 MG cells. However, low levels of TSP-1 PM (1 ng/mL) were sufficient for complete inhibition of endothelial cells sprouting. TSP-1 PM also inhibited VEGF-induced hyperpermeability in vivo in a miles assay following 2 days of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). Furthermore, basal vessels permeability was found to be significantly decreased in treated mice. This is in accordance with previous publications that showed inhibition of VEGF-induced hyperpemeability of tumor vasculature and the formation of new blood vessels in vivo by TSP-1 PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nakamura et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that TSP-1 PM is a promising candidate for our combination therapy approach, as it efficiently induces TSP-1 antiangiogenic downstream signaling pathways. To evaluate the anti-angiogenic potency of TSP-1 PM in vivo, mice bearing U-87 MG glioblastoma tumors were treated with the peptide and tumors were analyzed immunohistochemically for expression of angiogenic markers. Tumors treated with TSP-1 PM were significantly less vascularized, expressed lower levels of VEGF, and existing blood vessels were stabilized, as shown by positive staining for α smooth muscle actin (αSMA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25281.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>TSP-1 PM reduces the angiogenic potential of glioblastoma.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structure of ABT-898, a TSP-1 mimetic peptide.

Previous studies have shown great similarities between orthotopic murine GL261 model and human glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doblas et al., 2010</xref>). Morphological and biochemical differences between models (<italic>i.e</italic>, genes involved in tumor progression, aggressiveness, infiltration to the surrounding normal brain, and angiogenic ability) could potentially result in different therapeutic outcome. Therefore, GL261 was chosen as a reliable glioblastoma model to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of the following combination therapy. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated intracranially into the striatum with GL261 cells and were allowed to establish tumors for 7 days. Mice were then randomized into groups containing 5 to 8 mice per group and administered systemically with PTX, dPG-PTX or dPGS-PTX (15 mg/kg equivalent PTX; QOD) and/or TSP-1 PM (100 mg/kg; QD IP) for 2 weeks. An additional group was treated with TMZ, the current standard of care for glioblastoma patients. Animal survival after treatment with dPGS-PTX in combination with TSP-1 PM was significantly longer compared to the untreated control group or TMZ-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Combining dPGS-PTX with TSP-1 PM was also found to provide survival benefits compared to all the groups treated with the non-targeted dPG-PTX conjugate, with or without TSP-1 PM. The benefit of our targeted conjugate and the combination therapy is nicely exhibited by a ‘dose-response’ in mice survival following treatment. Mice treated with combination of dPGS-PTX and TSP-1 PM exhibited a remarkable 100% survival rate, with all mice surviving more than 120 days. This was followed by 40% of mice surviving more than 120 days in the group treated with dPGS-PTX alone, 25% of mice treated with dPG-PTX and TSP-1 PM, and 10% of mice treated with dPG-PTX alone. All DDS-administered groups exhibited survival benefit over free PTX and TMZ. Interestingly, TSP-1 PM as monotherapy did not result in any survival benefit. Due to the positive interaction between dPGS-PTX and TSP-1 PM, the improvement in survival observed is highly indicative of a synergistic effect in vivo, and has a potential to serve as an alternative to the existing oral TMZ. Several studies have shown correlation between dPGS binding to selectins and inhibition of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dernedde et al., 2010</xref>). In order to evaluate whether dPGS has an inhibitory effect on the immune system in a cancer model as well, and if that translates to survival benefit or impairment, mice were treated with non-PTX bearing conjugates. Both dPGS and dPG did not significantly affect mice survival compared to non-treated controls, suggesting that dPGS does not have an inhibitory effect on inflammation in a glioblastoma model to an extent that influences the therapeutic outcome.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25281.019</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Combination therapy of dPGS-PTX with TSP-1 PM inhibits tumor growth and prolongs the survival of mice bearing intracranial glioblastoma.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kaplan-Meier curve for survival of mice bearing murine GL261 intracranial tumors following systemic injection of treatments (n = 4–8).

Additionally, blood was extracted from mice for total blood count and biochemistry analysis. Body weight measurements showed that no significant weight loss was observed following any of the treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Blood test results indicated that mice treated with dPGS-PTX plus TSP-1 PM did not exhibit any systemic toxicity and generally seemed healthier compared with non-treated control mice or any other treatment. In contrast, myelosuppression that is associated with TMZ treatment was observed by decreased white blood cells count in TMZ treated mice. High total bilirubin together with elevated liver enzymes (SGOT and SGPT), an indication for liver dysfunction, was shown in mice treated with free PTX and TMZ. Surprisingly, mice administered with dPG and dPGS without PTX as well as dPG-PTX in combination with TSP-1 PM, were found to have elevated creatinine levels, which might indicate kidney damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>).

In both skills set, mice administered with the targeted sulfated dPGS-PTX conjugate exhibited the best performance with no motor deficit. The non-targeted dPG-PTX conjugate, though exhibited improved therapeutic outcome, caused neurotoxicity in treated mice similarly to the free drug. This suggests that by targeting PTX to the tumor microenvironment and the cancer cells, we were able to abrogate PTX-related neurotoxicity.</p><p>Having shown improved survival of C57BL/6 mice bearing GL261 tumors following treatment with our combination therapy, we set to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of synergy in an additional in vivo tumor model. As we wanted to mimic the clinical setting, we designed a short intervention study initiated at a large tumor size that allows for the observation of our treatment's effect on clinically-relevant rapidly-growing glioblastoma. SCID mice were inoculated intracranially into the striatum with mCherry labeled U-87 MG cells and tumor growth was monitored using an intravital non-invasive fluorescence imaging system (CRI Maestro). Once a sufficient fluorescence signal was visualized, mice were randomized into groups and administered systemically with dPG-PTX or dPGS-PTX (15 mg/kg equivalent PTX; QOD) and/or TSP-1 PM (100 mg/kg; QD). The experiment ended when mice from the control group were moribund and/or had a high fluorescent signal (&gt;500 scaled counts/sec). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, all treatment groups were able to inhibit U-87 MG tumor growth. However, only combination treatment of dPGS-PTX with TSP-1 PM resulted in a marked tumor growth inhibition compared to the control group. In contrast to the previous experiment with GL261, in which tumors were treated at a very early stage following tumor cells inoculation, U-87 MG tumors were treated at a relatively late stage. Therefore, it is not surprising that differences were seen in the treatment outcome between these experiments. To understand by which mechanism dPGS-PTX and TSP-1 PM synergize in vivo, the effect of the treatments on the Fas/Fas-ligand (Fas-L) apoptosis pathway was analyzed immunohistochemically. Results demonstrate that expression of Fas in the tumor tissue was enhanced following combination of TSP-1 PM with either dPG-PTX or dPGS-PTX. Fas-L expression was evident in all treatment groups. This is supported by a previous report, which showed high Fas-L expression in aggressive intracranial malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, a marked increase in Fas-L expression was demonstrated following treatment with combination of TSP-1 PM and dPGS-PTX. Furthermore, decreased CD31 staining was demonstrated in tumors treated with our dendritic conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors and typically widely disseminate within the normal brain. Glioma cells can be found several centimeters away from the main tumor mass and give rise to tumor recurrence after resection or radiation. The main goal of glioblastoma treatment is maximal resection with preservation of neurological function. This is facilitated by several pre- and intra-operative evaluations of functional neuro-anatomy using advanced imaging modalities and imaging with fluorescent tumor markers (<italic>e.g.,</italic> ALA, 5-aminolevulinic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Widhalm, 2014</xref>). Patients are then treated for residual disease with a combination of radiotherapy and the alkylating agent TMZ. One major factor that contributes to poor treatment outcomes of glioblastoma is a high degree of resistance to DNA alkylation-based chemotherapy. The resistant phenotype is triggered by the activity of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) DNA-repair enzyme that blunts the therapeutic effect of alkylating agents. The identification of MGMT as the key player in the resistance to chemotherapy in glioblastoma, and the fact that it serves not only as prognostic but also as predictive factor, have made this enzyme a potential target for personalized therapy and facilitated the development of several inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008</xref>). Unfortunately, clinical trials have shown disappointing results with severe systemic toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quinn et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quinn et al., 2009b</xref>). This is presumably due to low MGMT activity in the normal brain and hematopoietic tissues. To date, there is no useful therapeutic alternative for alkylating agents in glioblastoma patients with high MGMT activity.</p><p>The mitotic inhibitor PTX represents a potential alternative chemotherapeutic agent for glioblastoma, as its potency does not depend on the cells’ MGMT status. However, its clinical use is impeded due to its poor brain tumor delivery and to its high toxicity, mainly neurological. Several delivery systems bearing PTX have been developed and studied in order to reduce PTX-related toxicity. One approach exploits nanocarriers to safely deliver PTX via the circulation. In the study presented here, we synthesized dPGS loaded with PTX for glioblastoma therapy. dPGS was conjugated to PTX via a pH-sensitive EMCH linker. We have previously conjugated dPGS to PTX through a labile ester linker that can be cleaved by esterases and/or by low pH found in the lysosome. Although this conjugate was successfully taken-up by cancer cells and had a cytotoxic effect on cancer cells growth, it demonstrated poor stability in plasma and at physiological pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sousa-Herves et al., 2015</xref>). The hydrazone linker used here improves the therapeutic properties of dPGS-PTX conjugate, as it is more stable in physiological pH and easily hydrolyzed at lower pH levels found in the tumor microenvironment or in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). This linker enabled the successful systemic delivery of dPGS-PTX to glioblastoma. Systemic administration of our dendritic conjugate significantly inhibited tumor growth of intracranial glioblastoma, circumventing the side effects related with PTX. Similar approaches for PTX delivery were recently reported using various delivery systems. PTX-loaded PEGylated poly(ɛ-caprolactone) nanoparticles were demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth in mice bearing intracranial glioblastoma and prolong their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xin et al., 2010</xref>). Another approach concerns local delivery of PTX loaded nanoparticles, similarly to carmustine implants. A hydrogel matrix entrapping PLGA-PTX microspheres were synthesized by Ranganath and colleagues. This formulation demonstrated a sustained drug release and an enhanced anti-tumor efficacy when implanted into subcutaneous glioblastoma tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ranganath et al., 2009</xref>). Chlorotoxin-targeted iron oxide nanoparticles, carrying PTX, have been shown to deliver PTX to glioma cells in vitro but no safe, effective in vivo targeting has yet been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mu et al., 2015</xref>). Although these studies did not demonstrate reduced cytotoxicity of PTX when loaded into nanocarriers, they suggest that novel strategies for PTX delivery can be promising candidates for glioblastoma therapy.</p><p>One of the major obstacles in delivering drugs to brain tumors is restricted ability to cross the BBB. We demonstrate here that penetration of both the BBB and the blood-tumor barrier is achieved by extravasation-dependent ‘passive’ and ligand-targeted ‘active’ targeting through binding of sulfate groups on the dendritic conjugate to P-/L-selectin. This barrier crossing is attributed to the expression of P-selectin on activated tumor endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barthel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Läubli and Borsig, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shamay et al., 2016a</xref>), as binding of the dendritic conjugate to the endothelium facilitates its extravasation via blood vessels to the target site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ofek et al., 2016</xref>). Realizing the importance of selectins in cancer development and their potential for therapeutic targeting, several selectin-directed delivery systems were recently synthesized. Shamay and colleagues demonstrated an anti-tumor activity of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer conjugated to an E-selectin binding peptide and loaded with different anti-cancer agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shamay et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shamay et al., 2015</xref>). Another P-selectin targeted drug delivery system was designed by encapsulating chemotherapies with fucoidan (Fi), an algae-derived polysaccharide with an affinity to P-selectin. They found increased expression of P-selectin in multiple cancer types including lung, ovarian, lymphoma and breast, both on tumor cells and in tumor endothelium. They further demonstrated anti-tumor efficacious activity of their nanoparticles in melanoma, breast cancer and colon cancer mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shamay et al., 2016a</xref>). Here we report that P-selectin is also expressed on human glioblastoma cells and show that its expression is increased in gliomas compared to healthy brain tissues, enabling additional active targeting of human glioblastoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating increased expression of P-selectins in glioblastoma cells, rather than on glioblastoma tumors' endothelium (being increased after radiation). This emphasized the potential value of P-selectin-directed delivery of chemotherapeutics in glioblastoma, since it allows targeting the tumor and its microenvironment. It is also reported that radiation rapidly increases endothelial cell display of P-selectin on vascular lumen surfaces in a microtubule-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hallahan and Virudachalam, 1999</xref>), thus sensitivity to dPGS-PTX may be further enhanced following local radiation treatment of glioma. Surprisingly, a TCGA data analysis shown here has further demonstrated that high expression of P-selectin correlates with poor patient survival. This suggests that targeting P-selectin in glioblastoma may potentially have an additional therapeutic benefit. Nevertheless, the precise cellular target of our P-selectin-targeted dPGS-PTX remains unclear and warrants further investigation. Future studies using P-selectin knockout tumor and endothelial cells may resolve this issue and uncover which of these cellular compartments is targeted by dPGS-PTX.</p><p>Another way for reducing PTX-induced toxicity is by exploiting the combinational therapy approach. PTX-associated neurotoxicity is avoided here by achieving a synergistic therapeutic effect in vivo by co-delivery with TSP-1 peptidomimetic, decreasing the necessary dose of PTX, thus allowing its accumulation at levels considerably lower than the toxic dose. TSP-1 is a potent endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, whose expression is often lost during glioma malignant transformation. We have previously shown a correlation between loss of TSP-1 expression and escape from dormancy in human glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Satchi-Fainaro et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, glioma stimulation of local endothelium should be mitigated by restoration of TSP-1 function. TSP-1 PM used here is a second generation peptide of ABT-510, which was shown to enhance the efficacy of both PTX and of cisplatin in an orthotopic syngeneic model of ovarian cancer through normalization of tumor vasculature, as documented by increased pericytes coating tumor vessels, leading to increased concentration of these agents in the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campbell et al., 2010</xref>). Partial decrease of lesions was changed to full remission of lesions by combining ABT-510, shown to enhance delivery. A similar mechanism of synergy was also reported when administering the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab prior to PTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tolaney et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the intra-tumoral delivery of dPGS-PTX may be impeded owing to collapsed vasculature, with microcirculatory delivery similarly improved by TSP-1 PM, possibly explaining its synergistic effect. This is supported by our finding of vessel stabilization in glioblastoma and enhanced accumulation of IDCC-labeled dendritic conjugates at the tumor site following treatment with TSP-1 PM. Thus, enhanced tumor growth inhibition and long-term survival may be mainly due to vascular normalization. Alternatively, increased in vitro endothelial cell presentation of Fas (CD95) was observed with &gt;1 nM concentrations of docetaxel, and ABT-510-dependent apoptosis of tumor endothelial cells was shown to be induced by their upregulation of Fas ligand (CD178) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yap et al., 2005</xref>). We postulated that dPGS-PTX may similarly synergize TSP-1 PM by inducing the Fas/Fas-L apoptosis pathway. IHC analysis supported this hypothesis, suggesting an additional mechanism which contributes to the enhanced anti-tumor effect observed in our in vivo studies. Both of the putative mechanisms may operate and be mutually amplifying.</p><p>In conclusion, the work described here demonstrates the tremendous potential of our novel combination of TSP-1 PM and dPGS-PTX in replacing the conventional therapy for those patients who will not benefit from alkylating agents (i.e., high MGMT activity), with decreased toxicity and increased safety profile.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>DMEM, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin were purchased from Biological Industries Ltd.

Your article has been favorably reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Charles Sawyers as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to crystallize our concerns going forward. We feel the work is important and interesting but key issues remain unresolved that must be addressed satisfactorily to produce an acceptable manuscript.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Co-targeting the tumor endothelium and P-selectin-expressing glioblastoma cells leads to complete tumor eradication&quot; is the study of a drug delivery strategy employing a P-selectin-targeted dendrimer-based nanomaterial for the localization of therapy to tumors in an orthotopic glioblastoma model. The manuscript details targeting and efficacy studies, as well as a synergistic combination of P-selectin-targeted paclitaxel with an angiogenesis inhibiting peptide.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The revised manuscript must address the following three points:</p><p>1) The mechanism for synergy with ABT-898.</p><p>The mechanism of the drug synergy was not explored, except via discussion, where the author deemed it &quot;out of the scope&quot; of the manuscript. Given that the combination of dPGS-PTX and the TSP-1 peptide confers a much enhanced efficacy as compared to dPGS-PTX alone, this therapeutic result, which is the most striking in the paper, demands some degree of mechanistic understanding. Some experimentation should be provided to rule in or rule out at least one or two of the mechanistic possibilities.</p><p>The drug combination of dPGS-PTX with ABT-898, while interesting and apparently effective, is only examined at a very descriptive level and many questions remain why this combination was chosen and how the combination results in greater antitumor activity at a molecular and histopathological level.</p><p>2) Provide more data on where dPGS-PTX is acting (tumor vs. vasculature and the role of P-selectin expression in tumor cells).</p><p>A conspicuous absence is an understanding of where the dPGS-PTX localizes and acts in and around the tumor with respect to vasculature and/or tumor cells. The author noted a relatively limited infiltration of the construct within the tumor. Immunofluorescence staining of P-selectin and/or vasculature within the tumors harboring the fluorescent dPGS-PTX-IDCC may impart some understanding of whether the nanocarriers localize in at the vasculature and whether P-selectin expression in that vasculature may aid localization and/or penetration of the nanocarriers through the vasculature. Staining for apoptosis in the brain tissue may aid in the understanding of whether the efficacy of the nanocarrier is due to action on vasculature or tumor cells.</p><p>One of the surprising findings of the study is that glioma cells apparently express/overexpress P-selectin. This could provide rationale to further pursue dendritic polyglycerol sulfate (dPGS) as particularly relevant drug delivery strategy in glioma/GBM, but should be corroborated by additional evaluation of P-selectin expression in a larger panel of glioma cell lines, other cancer cell lines, and human glioma tumor samples compared to other cancer types (TCGA datasets). The authors should also modulate P-selectin expression levels in tumor cells (knockdown/knockout/overexpression) and document how P-selectin levels affect the in-vivo response to dPGS-PTX and dPG-PTX. At least in-vitro, both PGS-PTX and dPG-PTX conjugates appear to induce cell cycle arrest and cell death to a similar degree, even though the kinetics of internalization into tumor cells appear to be vastly different.</p><p>3) Show evidence of benefit in another model.</p><p>The in-vivo findings appear to be based on experiments with a single experimental model (C57BL/6 mice inoculated intracranially with murine GL261 glioma cells) and treatment started within seven days of injection of the tumor cells. Documentation of tumor formation in all mice prior to treatment, examination of tumors/brains at the end of the treatment period, and inclusion of additional, patient-derived GBM tumor sphere xenografts models would strengthen the current conclusions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Co-targeting the tumor endothelium and P-selectin-expressing glioblastoma cells leads to a remarkable therapeutic outcome&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have generated new data to address several key concerns. Specifically, they have: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) provided in-vivo and in-vitro data in a second experimental GBM model (U87 human GBM cells), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) identified several potential explanations for the synergy between PTX and TSP-1 PM (ABT-898), and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) conducted experiments with a P-selectin inhibitor to strengthen their previous data regarding drug specificity. The new data considerably strengthens the manuscript. But the remaining question whether tumor cells or endothelial cells/blood vessels are the primary target of the PTX/TSP-1 PM combination is not completely resolved by the immunofluorescence experiment staining of GL261 and U87 tumors with dPGS-PTX-I DCC showing more consistent colocalization with CD31.</p><p>We suggest the authors make the following modifications to the text:</p><p>1) Modify the Discussion to acknowledge that the precise cellular target of P-selectin-targeted dPDGS-PTX (tumor versus vasculature) is not known and would likely require experiments in P-selectin knockout tumor cells.</p><p>2) Comment on the decision to focus on GBM given that GBMs express lower levels of P-selectin than just about any other human cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>3) Provide further experimental details and/or literature references in the Materials and methods section on the tumor spheroid model, to avoid confusion with the more widely used models (e.g., tumor sphere culture, IPS-derived organoids)</p><p>4) Provide further details regarding the P-selectin inhibitor (beyond the chemistry publication introducing a series of compounds).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25281.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The revised manuscript must address the following three points:</p><p>1) The mechanism for synergy with ABT-898.</p><p>The mechanism of the drug synergy was not explored, except via discussion, where the author deemed it &quot;out of the scope&quot; of the manuscript.

We demonstrate that combination treatment enhanced apoptosis of endothelial cells and inhibited sprouting of patient-derived glioblastoma spheroids to a greater extent compared to each treatment alone.</p><p>The following text was added to the Results section:</p><p>“To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of TSP-1 PM and PTX combination, we performed an annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis assay on HUVEC. […] Combination of TSP-1 PM and PTX inhibited both endothelial and glioblastoma cells' sprouting to a greater extent compared to the other treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).”</p><p>Second, we hypothesized that TSP-1 PM can improve the efficacy of dPGS-PTX by “normalizing&quot; local vasculature to allow improved delivery of chemotherapy.

The author noted a relatively limited infiltration of the construct within the tumor. Immunofluorescence staining of P-selectin and/or vasculature within the tumors harboring the fluorescent dPGS-PTX-IDCC may impart some understanding of whether the nanocarriers localize in at the vasculature and whether P-selectin expression in that vasculature may aid localization and/or penetration of the nanocarriers through the vasculature. Staining for apoptosis in the brain tissue may aid in the understanding of whether the efficacy of the nanocarrier is due to action on vasculature or tumor cells.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this interesting point, we stained sections of mCherry-labeled U-87 MG and GL261 tumors treated with dPGS-PTX-IDCC with CD31 and P-selectin.</p><p>We added the following text to the Results section:</p><p>“To understand where dPGS-PTX-IDCC acts within the tumor, we stained U-87 MG and GL261 tumor sections for P-selectin and CD31.

This could provide rationale to further pursue dendritic polyglycerol sulfate (dPGS) as particularly relevant drug delivery strategy in glioma/GBM, but should be corroborated by additional evaluation of P-selectin expression in a larger panel of glioma cell lines, other cancer cell lines, and human glioma tumor samples compared to other cancer types (TCGA datasets).</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address the reviewers' questions regarding the &quot;additional evaluation of P-selectin expression in a larger panel of glioma cell lines, other cancer cell lines, and human glioma tumor samples compared to other cancer types (TCGA datasets)&quot;, we first analyzed by FACS the expression of P-selectin on several glioblastomas (5 in the upper line including human, murine, and 3 patient-derived cells); melanoma cells (5 cell lines in the second line), and mammary adenocarcinoma (4TI, DA3), PDAC (KPC), and osteosarcoma (K7M2) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).

We have added him and Noam Auslander to the authors' list of this current paper. A TCGA and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data search demonstrated that P-selectin is highly expressed in glioblastoma tumors, compared to its expression in the normal brain. Interestingly, when we were looking into the role of P-selectin in glioblastoma, we found that its expression correlated with survival of glioblastoma patients as seen in the Kaplan-Meier curves obtained from cBioPortal.</p><p>The following text was added to the Results section:</p><p>“To validate these findings, we looked at The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data analyzing the expression of P-selectin (SELP) in glioblastoma as well as other cancer types.

At least in-vitro, both PGS-PTX and dPG-PTX conjugates appear to induce cell cycle arrest and cell death to a similar degree, even though the kinetics of internalization into tumor cells appear to be vastly different.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point commonly discussed in the field of drug delivery. It is well known that differences in the activity of targeted versus not-targeted nanomedicines (P-selectin-targeted vs non-targeted polymer-drug conjugates in our case) cannot be demonstrated in vitro as in a standard cytotoxicity assay, the cells are bathed for 72 hours with medium containing both compounds. Within 72 hours, most nanomedicines will internalize via endocytosis, whether it is fluid-phase pinocytosis (for the non-targeted conjugate) or receptor-mediated endocytosis (for the P-selectin-targeted conjugate). To that end, we ran a pulse and chase assay where we treated U-87 MG glioblastoma cells with free PTX (which diffuses the fastest into the cells), with dPGS-PTX (which internalizes rapidly by receptor-mediated endocytosis) or by dPG-PTX (which passively internalizes via fluid-phase pinocytosis) and washed the wells after 30 minutes, leaving the cells for 72 hours and reading their viability thereafter. It can be seen that, as expected from these three compounds, there was a difference in IC<sub>50</sub> exhibiting the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> for free PTX (100 nM), intermediate for dPGS-PTX (400 nM) and the highest for the non-targeted dPG-PTX (N/A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This explains that even in vitro, we can detect differences in activity due to differences in internalization kinetics. The phenomenon is expected to be greatly enhance in real in vivo settings when the compounds are flowing in the bloodstream and extravasating through the tumor leaky vessels binding to cells expressing P-selectin (or not).</p><p>This data was added to the Results subsection “In vitro anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects of dPGS-PTX”.</p><p>As for the modulation of P-selectin, we used a P-selectin inhibitor to evaluate the differences in internalization of IDCC-labeled dendritic conjugates by FACS. First, we added new flow cytometry data demonstrating the different internalization kinetics of the conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Then, we demonstrated that cellular uptake of dPGS-PTX was inhibited following treatment with a P-selectin inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These studies, in addition to the studies we showed in the paper using our synthesized control dPG-PTX which does not bind to P-selectin, give a more comprehensive picture showing the dependence of the targeted conjugat's enhanced activity on its selective and rapid internalization.</p><p>The following text was added to the Results section:</p><p>“In order to evaluate the cellular uptake of the dendritic conjugates into glioblastoma cells, patient-derived hGB1 cells were incubated with IDCC-labeled dPGS-PTX and dPG-PTX for different periods of time.

Documentation of tumor formation in all mice prior to treatment, examination of tumors/brains at the end of the treatment period, and inclusion of additional, patient-derived GBM tumor sphere xenografts models would strengthen the current conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to note that the in vitro studies were performed on several glioblastoma cell lines: murine GL261, human U-87 MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), human U-251 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), several patient-derived cells and tissues, including FFPEs from several patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and HUVEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As for in vivo studies: the body distribution and tumor accumulation was performed on human U-87 MG tumor-bearing mice, and the antitumor efficacy was performed on murine GL261. Therefore, we were encouraged by the fact that both in vitro and in vivo, the dPGS-PTX was active on several glioblastoma and stromal cells. As for documentation of tumor formation, we have vast experience with intracranial injection of GL261 glioblastoma cells into C57BL/6 mice. Tumor take for the GL261 murine glioblastoma model is approximately 90%.</p><p>Nevertheless, to address the request of the reviewers, we performed two additional in vivo studies with mCherry-labeled GL261 and U-87 MG glioblastoma cells. The in vivo study with GL261 cells was performed to demonstrate body distribution and tumor accumulation of IDCC-labeled conjugates in another tumor model, in addition to U-87 MG. The results supported the findings obtained from U-87 MG tumors, demonstrating that the targeted sulfated dendrimer preferably accumulates in intracranial tumors. This data was added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which now contains results of both tumor models.</p><p>An additional efficacy study with U-87 MG cells was performed, to show benefit of the combination treatment in another tumor model. Mice bearing intracranial U-87 MG-mCherry tumors were administered systemically with the different treatments and tumor growth was monitored using an intravital fluorescence imaging system (CRI Maestro). In contrast to the previous in vivo survival study with GL261 cells, this study was designed as an “endpoint” study, which enabled to evaluate both the efficacy and the mechanism of synergy of the combination treatment by IHC analysis. The results of this study demonstrate that combination treatment with TSP-1 PM and dPGS-PTX inhibits U-87 MG tumor growth in SCID mice. We show that this inhibition was mediated by induction of the Fas/Fas-L apoptosis pathway.</p><p>The following text was added to the Results section:</p><p>“Having shown improved survival of C57BL/6 mice bearing GL261 tumors following treatment with our combination therapy, we set to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of synergy in an additional in vivo tumor model.

This model was used to demonstrate the different internalization kinetics of the dendritic conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and the in vitro anti-tumor effect of TSP-1 PM and PTX combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; full data can be found in the answer to question no. 1).</p><p>The following text was added to the Results section:</p><p>“To further show the advantage of dPGS-PTX compared to its non-targeted control, we treated patient-derived glioblastoma tumor spheroids with IDCC-labeled dendritic conjugates.

Survival rates of glioblastoma patients did not improve drastically over the past decades, despite great investigative efforts. Therefore, there is an unmet need for efficacious targeted therapy for glioblastoma that we aimed to address. As one of the major obstacles in glioblastoma therapy is crossing the blood-brain-barrier, we exploited a dendritic polyglycerol (dPG)-based conjugate, which we have previously shown to efficiently extravasate through the compromised BBB. The sulfated dPG (dPGS) was primarily used to target P-selectin expressed on activated endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment of highly angiogenic glioblastomas. Surprisingly, we revealed that glioblastoma cells express P-selectin as well. We therefore performed a TCGA data analysis of P-selectin expression in glioblastoma compared to other cancer types. While the expression of P-selectin was indeed the lowest across various cancer types, it should be noted that P-selectin was markedly and significantly increased in glioma and glioblastoma compared to healthy brain tissue. Therefore, P-selectin-targeted therapy in glioblastoma may potentially result in effective tumor targeting, while minimizing side effects. Despite having shown this data in a glioblastoma model, this therapeutic approach can be exploited for any type of cancer with high P-selectin expression, of particular interest are pancreatic cancer and ccRCC which seem like an attractive target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The paragraph describing the results of TCGA data analysis was revised accordingly:</p><p>“These data suggest that even though P-selectin expression in glioblastoma is low compared to other tumor types, it represents a suitable target for glioblastoma therapy due to its potential for achieving effective tumor targeting, while minimizing side effects. […] Of particular interest were pancreatic cancer (PAAD) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which also seem like attractive targets for P-selectin-targeted therapies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Provide further experimental details and/or literature references in the Materials and methods section on the tumor spheroid model, to avoid confusion with the more widely used models (e.g., tumor sphere culture, IPS-derived organoids).</p></disp-quote><p>The following text was revised in the Materials and methods section:</p><p><bold>“</bold>Multicellular tumor spheroids were prepared using the hanging-drop method, in which drops of cells suspension are held hanging from the bottom of an inverted tissue-culture plate until cells agglomerate spontaneously at the lower part of the drop due to gravity (Timmins and Nielsen, 2007).
