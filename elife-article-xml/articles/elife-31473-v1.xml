Heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) inappropriately activate assembly of hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein (Cp), suppressing formation of virions. We examined a fluorophore-labeled HAP, HAP-TAMRA. HAP-TAMRA induced Cp assembly and also bound pre-assembled capsids. Kinetic and spectroscopic studies imply that HAP-binding sites are usually not available but are bound cooperatively. Using cryo-EM, we observed that HAP-TAMRA asymmetrically deformed capsids, creating a heterogeneous array of sharp angles, flat regions, and outright breaks. To achieve high resolution reconstruction (&lt;4 Å), we introduced a disulfide crosslink that rescued particle symmetry. We deduced that HAP-TAMRA caused quasi-sixfold vertices to become flatter and fivefold more angular. This transition led to asymmetric faceting. That a disordered crosslink could rescue symmetry implies that capsids have tensegrity properties. Capsid distortion and disruption is a new mechanism by which molecules like the HAPs can block HBV infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31473.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses are simple structures formed of genetic information wrapped inside a shell. For the hepatitis B virus, this casing looks like a soccer ball. It is composed of 240 copies of the same protein, arranged in a pattern of pentagons and hexagons.

New shell proteins are produced and assemble within the cell. A type of potential antiviral drug called a CpAM disrupts this process: it causes the shell to assemble too early and inaccurately, which impairs the life cycle of the virus. However, a CpAM can bind to the shell even after it has already assembled. How this binding affects the virus is still unclear.</p><p>Here, Schlicksup et al. attach a fluorescent molecule to a CpAM, and use a cutting-edge microscopy method to look at the structures at the atomic level. This makes it possible to examine in detail how the CpAM attaches to a correctly formed virus shell.

Over time, chronic HBV can lead to liver disease including liver failure, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, contributing to more than 700,000 deaths each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gish et al., 2015</xref>). A vaccine directed against surface protein is preventative but not therapeutic. Entry inhibitors prevent new infection but are unlikely to affect maintenance of a chronic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Volz et al., 2013</xref>). Reverse transcriptase inhibitors directed against the viral polymerase suppress viremia and improve liver health, but even after years of treatment are rarely curative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gish et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). Interferon α and derivatives can stimulate HBV clearance in a small subset of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gish et al., 2015</xref>). The viral core protein (Cp) has become an important target for developing direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zlotnick et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The HBV Cp is present at virtually every step of the virus lifecycle in an infected cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zlotnick et al., 2015</xref>). In the nucleus, Cp is associated with viral nucleic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bock et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In cytoplasm, Cp assembly packages viral polymerase complexed with an RNA copy of the viral genome and has an active role in reverse transcription of the relaxed circular mature genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Cp also has signals that direct core intracellular trafficking and secretion of enveloped cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kann et al., 2007</xref>). When transported to the nucleus, for new infection and to maintain infection, the core disassembles to release its contents. Curiously, approximately 90% of the capsids from enveloped particles are empty and the rest contain the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ning et al., 2011</xref>). This leads to the hypothesis that assembly can be nucleated by a polymerase-viral RNA complex for virions or spontaneously by Cp. This bifurcation of paths suggests that assembly is susceptible to disruption. The oligomeric nature of Cp function makes it a particularly attractive antiviral target because even when DAA-resistant mutants arise, residual wildtype protein co-assembled into a complex retains DAA sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The HBV Cp is a 183-residue, homodimeric protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Venkatakrishnan and Zlotnick, 2016</xref>). The first 149 residues form the assembly domain. Each monomer contributes two helices to a four-helix bundle that forms the intradimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Venkatakrishnan and Zlotnick, 2016</xref>). The final 34 residues of the full length Cp form the disordered nucleic acid-binding C-terminal domain. This domain is optional for capsid assembly but required for nucleic acid packaging; this region also carries putative nuclear localization and nuclear export signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kann et al., 2007</xref>). Cp assembles into icosahedral 90-dimer T = 3 capsids and 120-dimer T = 4 capsids. In capsids, dimers are arranged in a pattern of fivefold vertices and quasi-sixfold vertices. Thus, owing to quasi-equivalence, a T = 3 capsid is comprised of 60 AB dimers and 30 CC dimers (with true twofold symmetry) and a T = 4 capsid is comprised of 60 AB and 60 CD dimers. In vitro assembly of the assembly domain or full-length Cp yields about 90% T = 4 capsids; a similar ratio is observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Venkatakrishnan and Zlotnick, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stannard and Hodgkiss, 1979</xref>).</p><p>Studies of in vitro assembly of Cp have provided insights into the biology of HBV, the general problem of capsid assembly and the mechanism of assembly-directed antivirals. It is hypothesized that assembly is initiated by a conformational transition of Cp to an active state, suggesting a basis for regulated assembly in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Packianathan et al., 2010</xref>). The net association energy is weak, but since each of the many Cp dimers forming a capsid are tetravalent, the result is a globally stable structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zlotnick, 2003</xref>). In vitro assembly of HBV Cp is sensitive to ions and temperature, supporting the hypothesis that assembly can be allosterically regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ceres et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, there is a close relationship between the familiar phenomenon of allostery and the structural principle of tensegrity in virus capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Domitrovic et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><p>Putative Cp allosteric effectors (e.g. heteraryldihydropyrmidines or HAPs) have been discovered that have antiviral effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deres et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stray and Zlotnick, 2006a</xref>). These small molecules ostensibly act by inducing an assembly-active state and by stabilizing Cp-Cp interactions by filling a pocket at the interdimer interface between dimers of the quasi-sixfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Venkatakrishnan and Zlotnick, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourne et al., 2006</xref>). We refer to this class of molecules, which now includes a diverse set of chemistries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pei et al., 2017</xref>), as Core protein Allosteric Modulators (CpAMs). The well-characterized mechanism for CpAM action is to over-initiate assembly, forming empty capsids and large aberrant structures. Both products act to sequester Cp from its biological functions. We suggest that CpAMs likely have additional effects on the HBV lifecycle and are developing fluorescent CpAMs as tools to better probe their effects both in vitro and in cells.</p><p>Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) as a means to look at capsids in complex with the fluorescent CpAM HAP-TAMRA. The fluorescent CpAM provides a useful signal for binding, and we hoped that the extra mass would assist identifying the molecule in structural studies. Cryo-EM provides advantages compared to previous studies using crystalized forms of Cp, in that capsid-wide deformations can be observed, including asymmetric deformations. This establishes a basis for further antiviral development focused on disruption of capsid structure that is distinct from the previously established mechanisms of CpAM activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HAP-TAMRA is a probe of core protein and CpAM interaction</title><p>To better understand the relationship between CpAMs and core protein, we synthesized a fluorescent CpAM, HAP-TAMRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). HAP-TAMRA’s HAP13 core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourne et al., 2008</xref>) was extended with a three-carbon linker appended with a tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) dye. As the HAP13 core used in this synthesis was a racemic mixture, only half the compound is expected to be active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deres et al., 2003</xref>). We anticipated the TAMRA moiety to extend into the capsid lumen from the HAP-binding pocket and cause minimal disruption to interactions between the HAP and protein. To verify the activity of HAP-TAMRA, we examined its effect on purified dimeric assembly domain, Cp149. We observed that assembly reactions of purified core protein in the presence of HAP-TAMRA produced large aberrant products that are characteristic of HAP-induced assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). For reference, assembly reactions without CpAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) led to particles morphologically consistent with an icosahedral shell.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31473.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Synthesis of HAP-TAMRA.</title><p>HAP-TAMRA is a derivative of HAP13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourne et al., 2008</xref>) with a tetramethylrodamine (TAMRA) moiety.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31473-fig1-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31473.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>HAP-TAMRA drives core protein assembly.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A negative stain micrograph of a typical assembly reaction using purified core protein.

(inset) Spectra of the capsid-bound HAP-TAMRA (blue) and free forms show an unusual chromatic shift, suggestive of π-stacking of TAMRA moieties in the capsid. (<bold>d</bold>) Using the absorbance shift as an indicator (either the value at 520 nm or the ratio of 520/555 nm), we find that preformed capsids saturate at a stoichiometry of about one small molecule per dimer.

We first evaluated formation of the capsid HAP-TAMRA complex using size exclusion chromatography with a diode array absorbance detector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). Capsids co-eluted with bound HAP-TAMRA in the capsid fraction. Free HAP-TAMRA eluted at the end of the column volume, as expected for a small molecule. TAMRA absorbance spectra associated with the capsid and free probe were distinctly different. The free probe exhibited the familiar absorbance profile of TAMRA, with a major peak near 555 nm, and a shoulder at 520 nm. The absorbance spectrum for capsid-bound HAP-TAMRA was shifted, with a major peak near 520 nm and a shoulder around 550 nm that resembled examples of spectra from π-stacked TAMRA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2014</xref>). Using the change in signal at 520 nm, we monitored the amount of capsid- bound HAP-TAMRA. We also examined the utility of the ratio of 520/555 nm absorbance as a measure of binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). For both the absorbance at 520 nm and the 520/555 ratio, the signal associated with capsid peaked at about one HAP-TAMRA per dimer. These data also suggest that HAP-TAMRA binds capsid with high affinity compared to the 8 µM Cp dimer used in these experiments. The appearance of the 520 nm peak under these conditions was restricted to the capsid fraction as shown by the absence of a ratiometric change in the free fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p>This absorbance signal change is also visible in samples that are not purified by size exclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We chose to use the increase in absorbance at 520 nm to study the kinetics of binding, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–f</xref>). Using 2.5 to 40 µM HAP-TAMRA, we observed that binding was surprisingly slow, reaching half-saturation in approximately 10 min at all concentrations. When the different kinetic trajectories were normalized to the same maximum and minimum values, zero and one, it was evident that they were identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), indicating that the rate of binding under these conditions was independent of HAP-TAMRA concentration. Therefore, we examined binding kinetics in terms of a first order reaction. Slow kinetics can indicate that the binding pocket is not usually accessible to the ligand, but that a conformational transition of the protein allows the pocket to open transiently. Curve fits using a single exponential did not fit the observed binding kinetics but an association model with two phases of equal magnitude matched the kinetic trajectories. The average for the fast half-life was 0.6 ± 0.1 min and for the slow half-life was 7.1 ± 1.4 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This HAP-TAMRA concentration independence and the slow binding rate strongly suggest that the primary barrier for HAP binding is a conformational transition at the site of the binding pocket. Because the signal for binding is an absorbance shift consistent with stacking of two or more TAMRA moieties, examination of the absorbance when the reaction was complete should also give an indication of the mechanism of binding. We observed that the change in absorbance increased linearly until capsids were saturated at one HAP-TAMRA per dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The change in absorbance per bound HAP-TAMRA was also evaluated (i.e. the change in extinction coefficient) and found to be 11200 ± 4% M<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). This result indicates that there is the same degree of TAMRA–TAMRA interaction in saturated capsids and in capsids where there was on average only one HAP-TAMRA per capsid. The change in absorbance spectrum suggested TAMRA-TAMRA interaction that would be expected to cause static quenching; this prediction was confirmed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref> where the residual fluorescence is largely due to unbound probe.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31473.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>HAP-TAMRA absorbance and fluorescence change in response to binding capsid.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) HAP-TAMRA in solution for a matched pair of samples with 8 µM capsid (colored lines) and without (black lines). In the presence of capsid, the absorbance spectrum shifts towards one that resembles a π-stacked TAMRA dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2014</xref>). The change is not as dramatic as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, due to the presence of free dye in sample that have not been purified by SEC. (<bold>b</bold>) The change in absorbance at 520 nm can be used to observe kinetics of binding different HAP-TAMRA concentrations to 8 µM capsid, showing the time dependence of forming the samples in panel a.

Thus, when we looked at cryo-EM 2D class averages of HAP-TAMRA-saturated capsids we anticipated a field of isometric particles similar to apo-capsids (drug free) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4b</xref>). However, in both raw micrographs and 2D class averages, the heterogeneity of particle shapes with bound HAP was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,c</xref>): many particles had sharp corners, facets, and irregular outlines. To distinguish ‘distorted’ from the normal capsids, we performed 2-D class averaging to compare particles from Cp149-apo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) and Cp149+HAP TAMRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) datasets.

A T = 4 quasi-sixfold has two repeats (B, C, D, B’, C’, and D’) subunits and in T = 3 there are three repeats (B, C, B’, C’, B’', and C’') (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In T = 4 capsids, quasi-sixfold hexamers have four HAP-TAMRA molecules, while the T = 3 quasi-sixfold hexamers accommodate three HAP-TAMRA molecules. The HAP13 portion of the probe is nestled in the pocket between two adjacent dimers with the linker extending from the pocket, positioning the TAMRA near the center of the quasi-sixfold pore. In the T = 4 quasi-sixfold, the HAPs are in B, C, B’, and C’ pockets, which are respectively capped by C, D, C’ and D’ subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In the T = 3 particles, HAPs are in B pockets capped by C subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). These results place the HAP moiety of HAP-TAMRA in the same pocket associated with other CpAMs HAP1, AT130, HAP18, and sulfamoyl benzamides.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Venkatakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>) No small molecule density was observed at the corresponding A (fivefold) and D sites, which are occluded by A and B subunits, respectively. The pocket of the T = 3 C subunit is occluded by the neighboring B subunit, resembling the interaction of the T = 4 D subunit with its neighboring B subunit.</p><p>Despite the quaternary differences between T = 3 and T = 4 capsids, the local environment of the HAP-TAMRA in the HAP pocket was remarkably similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The HAP13 had extremely well-ordered density in the pocket as do most protein side chains in the region (visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref> at a contour of 3.6 σ, where σ is the number of standard deviations from the mean). The quality of HAP-TAMRA density gradually decays in the TAMRA region, which is visible as a loss of density in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and was also seen as a decay in local resolution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. This observation is consistent with fewer positional constraints in the exposed TAMRA moiety, and higher molecular motion. In particular, the T = 4 C subunit the TAMRA density is only contiguous at 2.6 σ. For the T = 4C subunit, the loss of linker density makes precise fitting the connection from the HAP to the TAMRA ambiguous. However, linker density clearly points towards a planar mass that is parallel to and ‘stacked’ on the TAMRA from the B’ subunit. By symmetry, there is an equivalent interaction between TAMRAs from C’ and B. This resulting best fit into the available density should not be considered an exclusive model. However, as 80–90% of the capsids have T = 4 symmetry, we suggest that these TAMRA-TAMRA interactions are the cause of the observed change in the optical signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31473.010</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>HAP-TAMRA has a very similar structure in three different quasi-equivalent environments.</title><p>The HAP site consists of a pocket in one subunit that is capped by a neighboring subunit.

The next subunit around the quasi-sixfold, the D subunit (T = 4) or C subunit (T = 3), show pronounced differences while the dimer on the far side of quasi-sixfold is completely misaligned. The dramatic effect arises because the small angular differences are amplified by distance. Another relevant example is the assembly-inactive core protein mutant Y132A.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Packianathan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klumpp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>) The Y132A mutation disrupts normal interdimer interaction allowing crystal contacts that form hexagonal layers reminiscent of but distinct from subunit interactions in capsids.

It is immediately clear that the HAP-bound particle has expanded, particularly at the fivefold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Venkatakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). The pairwise Cα separation between the HAP-TAMRA capsid and an apo-capsid (1QGT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wynne et al., 1999a</xref>]) shows large-scale changes and regions of constraint that were not obvious when focusing on a single asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).

In comparison to the apo capsid, the displacement maximum is almost 6 Å around the 5-fold axis, and the displacement minimum is 1.7 Å around the 3-fold axis. The two-dimer asymmetric unit is rotated along the long axis of the CD dimer, near the 3-fold, leading the AB dimer to pivot upward, raising at the 5-fold. We suggest that the basis of this quaternary change is a flattening of the quasi-sixfold hexamers. Flattening quasi-sixfold and concomitantly making the 5-fold vertices protrude is likely a subdued version of what we observed for Cp149 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31473.013</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Structural defects induced by HAP-TAMRA are concentrated at icosahedral fivefold.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Differences between the HAP-TAMRA capsid and an apo capsid (1QGT) were calculated by overlaying the two capsids based on a common center.

The local resolution is systematically better around the 2-fold symmetry axis, and worse around the 5-fold. This result suggests a greater positional variation of A subunits, equivalent to a crystallographic B factor. In both AB and CD dimers, the highest resolution is observed in the core of the protein, the chassis subdomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Packianathan et al., 2010</xref>), and the lowest resolution, falling to about 5 Å, is at the spike tips. Protein–protein interactions around the quasi-sixfold were extremely well-ordered as were the HAP moieties of HAP-TAMRA, about 3.6 Å in the overall 4 Å resolution T = 4 structure. The resolution of the TAMRA density was poorer, about 5 Å. This same pattern was also observed in the T = 3 capsid structure.</p><p>Studies with crosslinked Cp150 suggest the hypothesis that CpAM-induced structural changes and fluctuations would be concentrated at fivefold vertices and substantially greater without the constraint of the interdimer C150 disulfide.

This second hypothesis is consistent with the heterogeneity of the class averages in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>.

HAP-TAMRA with crosslinked Cp150 dimers yielded capsids that retained icosahedral symmetry and were suitable for relatively high-resolution reconstruction. HAP-TAMRA with the uncrosslinked capsids of Cp149 led to asymmetric faceting, severe distortions, and broken capsids. There are advantages to examining both Cp150 and Cp149 CpAM complexes, one for structural detail and the other for biological relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In HBV infections, core protein exerts many of its functions while in the capsid form. Defects in the capsid structure due to CpAMs may alter exposure of signals for cellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>) or dysregulate capsid dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rabe et al., 2009</xref>).

Core protein mutations that fill the HAP site lead to defects in both RNA packaging and transcription of the DNA plus-sense strand suggesting that CpAMs can have similar action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Though there have been reports of HAPs causing capsids to dissociate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stray and Zlotnick, 2006b</xref>), the structural basis for this paradoxical effect of stabilizing Cp-Cp interaction but inducing capsid failure have, with this report, only now begun to be explored.</p><p>The T = 4 Cp150+HAP TAMRA cryo-EM structure has a larger diameter than crystallographic structures of the apo capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wynne et al., 1999a</xref>) and CpAM-bound capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Venkatakrishnan and Zlotnick, 2016</xref>).

This indicates that CpAM is affecting structure primarily by modulating the protein-protein interactions of the capping subunit. In addition, CpAMs can subtly modify the tertiary and quaternary structure of an individual dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Venkatakrishnan and Zlotnick, 2016</xref>). In broad terms, CpAMs flatten sixfold; during assembly this can result in non-capsid structures with extended regions of hexagonal sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stray et al., 2005</xref>). or cylinders with a hexagonal repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The flattening of quasi-sixfold, observed in molecular detail in the crosslinked Cp150 capsid, is also evident in uncrosslinked Cp149 capsids as flat regions and sharp angles. The sharp angles are likely to arise at fivefold. This is analogous to phage P22 which is assembled as a rounded procapsids that matures to have flattened sixfold and sharply angled fivefold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teschke and Parent, 2010</xref>). In the 22 Å resolution image reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c</xref>), the absence of density at fivefold could be due to highly dynamic A subunits, or to relatively static structures where the A subunits have multiple orientations. In the 2D class averages of Cp149+HAP TAMRA capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) most classes are asymmetrically elliptical and/or have a periphery punctuated by sharp angles, suggestive of faceting. Consider the effect of flattening a quasi-sixfold in a T = 4 HBV capsid: the A subunit in the adjacent fivefold would protrude and the C and D subunits in adjacent quasi-sixfold would be flattened. The effect on the adjacent quasi-sixfold could lead to a large flat area, resulting in a faceted or elliptical particle, or a discontinuity where the adjacent quasi-sixfold was folded. In the extreme case, such flattening could rupture a particle as observed in micrographs of Cp149+HAP TAMRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p>This study also has implications for the study of the physics of nanoscale materials. For a flattened quasi-sixfold to disrupt a complete capsid, retaining the flattened region must be energetically more favored than maintaining the global capsid structure. CpAMs are known to strengthen protein-protein interaction energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zlotnick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Venkatakrishnan and Zlotnick, 2016</xref>). Making the capsid surface stiffer is predicted from condensed matter theory to promote buckling transitions that lead to faceting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lidmar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klug et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore suggest that crosslinking Cp150 preserved capsid symmetry by allowing a compromise where CpAMs partially flattened surfaces but the stress was distributed globally, consistent with the mechanical principles of tensegrity structures. Tensegrity structures can also be designed to undergo structural transitions in response to relatively small stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Domitrovic et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Skelton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuller, 1975</xref>) in the same way that HBV responds to CpAM binding. Indeed, a reoccurring point in literature on the mechanical properties of icosahedral virus capsids, is that their stability is fundamentally related to their symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klug et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zandi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zandi and Reguera, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The motivation to construct a fluorescent CpAM was that it would expand our ability to evaluate CpAM-Cp interaction in vitro and in vivo. We used changes in the absorbance profile, as well as fluorescent quenching, to observe CpAM binding to capsid. The photochemical effects we describe has been well-documented for TAMRA and other rhodamine dyes. It is a consequence of changes in electronic excitation due to proximity and dipole alignment of two or more aromatic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogawa et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Taking advantage of HAP-TAMRA optical properties, we observed that HAP-TAMRA bound capsid tightly and slowly. Slow binding suggests that sites are only rarely open to CpAMs. The slow rate of binding is reminiscent of a proteolytic analysis of HBV capsid stability where it was observed that Cp149 capsids would undergo a slow partial unfolding transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilmer et al., 2008</xref>). The half-life of the unfolding transition for cleavage was on the order of 100 min. In contrast, intact capsids can persist in solution for months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Uetrecht et al., 2010</xref>). All-atom molecular simulations of capsids indicate that HBV capsid structure is highly dynamic and is capable of departure from icosahedral symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perilla et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The multidimensional nature of a continuously deforming virus capsid (composed of 120 interconnected dimers) frustrates a rigorous treatment of binding. However, we have identified some important constraints by relating HAP-TAMRA conformation to binding cooperativity. The ∆A520 signal we observe depends on formation of a π -stacked dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2014</xref>). The absorbance shift we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) indicates that all of the bound HAP-TAMRA is involved in π-stacked dimers, even when there is on average approximately a single HAP-TAMRA per quasi-sixfold vertex. This would not occur if HAP-TAMRA were randomly distributed over a capsid. In a random distribution at the lowest concentration we tested only about 1/3 of the probe would be in quasi-sixfold vertices with two or more bound molecules. Furthermore, the structure of the T = 4 capsid suggests interaction only between probes in the B and C’ or C and B’ sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Of the six possible pairwise interactions for a T = 4 hexamer with two sites filled (BB’, BC’, BC, CB’, CC, B’C’), only one third is expected to yield a ∆A520 signal. Thus, at the lowest HAP-TAMRA:dimer ratio tested, random binding predicts 1/3*1/3 = 1/9 or 11% of the maximum possible ∆A520. Nonetheless, we observe approximately 100% of the possible signal. This indicates a high degree of cooperativity of binding, at least at a local level.</p><p>Binding kinetics also suggests some degree of cooperativity. We would expect to see sigmoidal kinetics if sites filled randomly. Thus, once a B site is filled there must be a preference for filing an adjacent C’ with a much faster rate constant (or for a C site a preference for an adjacent B’). In a slightly more complicated model, B and C may have different rate constants for the initial binding event. This second model could fit to our data with two first order curves of equal amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). However, this local structural change model does not account for the global structural change we observe. Furthermore, contrary to Occam’s razor, a simple fit may obscure complex, multi-phase kinetics. If we consider that flattening one quasi-sixfold will affect the structure of the neighboring quasi-sixfold, we can see how capsid asymmetry is induced. Asymmetric distortion of quasi-sixfold will affect binding site structures and therefore their kinetics of binding and affinities. There may be a continuum of binding sites from flattened quasi-sixfold, as might be found in a large aberrant structure or the flat areas of an oblate ellipse (i.e. large radius of curvature), to bent quasi-sixfold that might be found where there is a small radius of curvature. The result of this continuum of sites will not fit a single first order rate law, but may be approximated by as the sum of two or more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zlotnick et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>In a broad sense, our results reaffirm the view that virus capsids are not inert containers. It is likely that some of the most important biological functions of icosahedral capsids may occur when they become non-icosahedral. We have demonstrated that non-icosahedral states of HBV capsids can be induced using CpAMs. Indeed, CpAMs can deform and even disrupt intact capsids, which suggest modes of action beyond the established mechanisms of assembly activation and misdirection. A molecule which simultaneously affects two or more stages of the lifecycle would reduce the impact of escape mutations, and increases the likelihood of clearing an infection.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-31473-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31473.015</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>A tour of a T=4 capsid (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</title><p>Intact surface-shaded capsids, contoured at 3.6 sigma, are shown with the AB dimers surrounding fivefold vertices shaded in dark grey, quasi-sixfold are alternating dark and light gray.

Size exclusion chromatography assays were performed using a superose 6 30/10 column plumbed into a Shimadzu HPLC equipped with a diode array detector. The HAP-TAMRA absorbance eluting in the capsid fractions was attributed to the capsid bound population. All HAP-TAMRA absorbance eluting later was attributed to free ligand. It is important to note that because the HAP-TAMRA probe is synthesized as a racemic mixture, and because only a single enantiomer is known to bind the HAP pocket, we expected to see at least half of the input HAP-TAMRA eluting as free ligand. When plotting the increase in 520 nm signal in the capsid fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), the A520 at 7.5 ml was used, corresponding to the pre-established center of the capsid elution volume.</p><p>Absorbance and fluorescence was measured in a 96-well plate using a 200 µl sample volume by a Biotek Synergy H1 plate reader. Measurements based on fluorescence used an excitation wavelength of 520 nm and monitored emission at 580 nm. For plotting the change in 520/555 nm absorbance ratio, we used the maximum value of the capsid peak at each wavelength. Kinetic assays based on absorbance were sampled in 1 min intervals, where each data point is the value of 520 nm absorbance. To account for the varying presence of excess free probe in the titration time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), the signal is presented as Δ520 nm absorbance compared to a probe-only reference. We defined this as ΔA520 = A520<sub>raw</sub> - A520<sub>inert</sub> – A520<sub>binding(t=0)</sub> where A520<sub>inert</sub> accounts for the absorbance of dye that does not participate in binding (because it was either the inactive enantiomer or present in superstoichiometric quantities), and A520<sub>binding(t=0)</sub> is the initial absorbance of the fraction of HAP-TAMRA that will participate in binding. This analysis assumes linear binding until saturation, based on the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, but could underestimate the signal if binding were weaker.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge critical discussions with Dr. Shefah Qazi regarding TAMRA photophysics.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Detailed comments are below.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes the effect of molecules that have previously been shown to hyperstabilze assemblages of hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsids. A fluorescent version was synthesized and used to show binding to a truncated version of assembled capsid protein by both co-purification and fluorescence quenching. Distortions were observed in cryo-EM that were sufficiently great that the authors reconfigured the capsid protein used for assembly to stabilize mobile residues at the C terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Now, the distortions could be better visualized, and the structures of particle sets solved, by cryoEM. This is a very important piece of work that shows distorting of an highly complex oligomer with a small inhibitor molecule. The structural comparisons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref> are great, and show that the distortions are at the five-fold axis.</p><p>In this manuscript Schlicksup et al. examine the effect of the binding of a fluorescent derivative of HAP (HAP-TAMRA) on preformed hepatitis B virus capsids. The main findings are that binding of the molecule distorts the capsid and that the binding of HAP-TAMRA is slow.</p><p>In this manuscript by Schlicksup et al., the authors used cryo-EM and absorbance-based binding assays to determine the structural impact of fluorophore-labeled heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAP) binding to the Hepatitis B Virus core protein. The major findings illustrate: (1) the capacity of these molecules to distort capsid shape with non-crosslinked material, (2) the high-resolution cryo-EM structures of cross-linked complexes associated with the HAP-TAMRA to define the locations and influence on capsid structure, and (3) to illustrate the inherent flexibility that correlates to functionality of virus capsids and their assembly process.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Major comments on Figures</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>:</p><p>a) Should be <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

It pertains to a sentence on the first line of the Results, and to the hyper-stabilization of capsid structures in what is currently <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Therefore, the synthesis should no doubt be <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, perhaps combined with the EM stabilization figure.b) Does &quot;chart 2&quot; in the Materials and methods refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>?c) The X-axis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> is labeled on the right rather than the left.

It would be good to see a micrograph of unbound capsids in addition to the distorted ones so that the non-specialist can appreciate the distortion observed. The authors assert that HAP-TAMRA accelerates assembly, stabilizes the assembled products, and result in the formation of aberrant particles. For example, the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> say &quot;HAP-TAMRA binding drives core protein assembly &quot; and yet two of the four panels show binding to preformed cores. It would be ideal to show data for all three claims but a minimal approach would be that the experiments (assembly kinetics and stability) be described in the Materials and methods.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is described in terms of (A), (B) and (C) but these are not marked. Several other comments include:a) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> should be mentioned in the text.b) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the legend &quot;the weighted sum of free and bound TAMRA&quot; is difficult to understand. Of absorbance at 550? Wouldn't that require knowing the extinction coefficient for both species? At what time point were the samples taken?c) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, what is the inset and what were the conditions used for the time course?d) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is very nice and follows directly on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (which determined the conditions), probably should follow <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> in the presentation.e) The analysis of the binding kinetics needs improvement. A trace is shown with a half-time of approximately 10 min and the statement is made that the kinetics are complex. A better analysis would require following the binding kinetics at multiple HAP-TAMRA concentration, perhaps showing a change in rate-determining step when the putative open motion became rate limiting. The claim that the kinetics are &quot;complex&quot; is not meaningful without an explanation for the claim. Were fits attempted? What sort of fits, and with what results?</p><p>4a) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, it would be better to see images of the T=3 structures as well, as we are going to see their structures in the next figures.b) The conclusion in the Abstract that the data demonstrate that capsid are tensegrity structures (as originally suggested by Caspar) is not discussed in the manuscript.c) A scale bar is needed.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, (A) and (C) should be (A) and (B) and similarly for (B) and (D) should be (C) and (D). In (A) the colors are not described accurately. The nomenclature &quot;AB dimer&quot; and &quot;CD dimer&quot; should be better explained for non-specialized readers. In (A) it would help if the quasi-sixfold axis were named as such before directing our attention to the five-fold axis.</p><p>6) The table of reconstruction metrics is presented as a Figure instead of a Table,</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> legend, the TAMRA density is ambiguous in the C subunit of the T=4 structure, it is modeled like in the B subunits. Then it is concluded that the overlays are similar.. What happened to the C subunit of the T=3 structure? The quasi-symmetry is very interesting and should be better discussed for the non-specialist.</p><p>8) The cryo-EM reconstructions and the supplemental movies are very nice.</p><p>Major Comments on Text</p><p>The main criticism is that the text does not track well with the figures, some of the figures are mis-labeled and the text is terse, making what is an elegant paper surprisingly hard to read. Careful editing is needed, tracking the text to the figures and tightening the logical flow.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31473.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this manuscript Schlicksup et al. examine the effect of the binding of a fluorescent derivative of HAP (HAP-TAMRA) on preformed hepatitis B virus capsids.

This is an important point for two reasons. First it provides a biophysical mechanism for transducing binding of the small molecule to distortion of the capsid; binding events induce local structural changes that lead to stronger subsequent binding. Secondly, we show that the rate of binding is independent of HAP-TAMRA concentration indicating that the rate limiting step of binding depends on “opening” binding sites. A reaction that we suggest depends on capsid conformational change. Taken together, these data suggest a basis for progressive distortion of capsids. Most of these results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Major comments on Figures</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>:</p><p>a) Should be <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Panel (A) still shows the shift I the TAMRA absorbance spectrum as a function of association with capsid. In panel (B) we show the kinetics of binding at multiple HAP-TAMRA concentrations. In panel (C) we show that binding kinetics are independent of HAP-TAMRA concentration. The data in panels (B) and (C) suggest a simple binding model that is described in text. In panel (D) we examine the endpoint binding signal which indicate that binding is high affinity relative to the concentrations used in the experiment and the stoichiometry of HAP-TAM for core protein is one drug per dimer, a result consistent with the structure shown in the following studies. In panel (E) we observe that bound drug always has the absorbance shift related to stacked TAMRA moieties, even where the ratio of HAP-TAMRA to core protein is less than one HAP-TAMRA per sixfold vertex. In discussion, we point out that this indicates that HAP-TAMRA must bind with a high degree of cooperativity so that molecules are in adjacent positions. This cooperativity of binding especially in light of the distorted particles observed in cryo-EM class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) implies a cooperative and progressive structural transition. Such a progressive transition is consistent with tensegrity, where stress is distributed across a structure. The progressive structural transition model also suggests a Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer model of cooperativity.</p><p>These extensive changes work in the more specific comments, below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several other comments include:a) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> should be mentioned in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the legend &quot;the weighted sum of free and bound TAMRA&quot; is difficult to understand.

A better analysis would require following the binding kinetics at multiple HAP-TAMRA concentration, perhaps showing a change in rate-determining step when the putative open motion became rate limiting. The claim that the kinetics are &quot;complex&quot; is not meaningful without an explanation for the claim. Were fits attempted? What sort of fits, and with what results?</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined above, the kinetics have been described much more thoroughly with more data and a more complete analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4a) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, it would be better to see images of the T=3 structures as well, as we are going to see their structures in the next figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Class averages for T=3 and T=4 particles, both from the same micrographs used in the high resolution image reconstructions, are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The conclusion in the Abstract that the data demonstrate that capsid are tensegrity structures (as originally suggested by Caspar) is not discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>A brief tensegrity discussion is now included in text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) A scale bar is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, (A) and (C) should be (A) and (B) and similarly for (B) and (D) should be (C) and (D). In (A) the colors are not described accurately. The nomenclature &quot;AB dimer&quot; and &quot;CD dimer&quot; should be better explained for non-specialized readers. In (A) it would help if the quasi-sixfold axis were named as such before directing our attention to the five-fold axis.</p></disp-quote><p>Terminology is now better illustrated and described in figures and in text.

Then it is concluded that the overlays are similar.. What happened to the C subunit of the T=3 structure? The quasi-symmetry is very interesting and should be better discussed for the non-specialist.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the figure for clarity. In the T=4 C subunit, density for the HAP component of HAP-TAMRA is well-defined. Density for the linker and TAMRA moieties is ambiguous. However, it is clear that the linker and TAMRA moieties from the T=4 C site follow a different trajectory than those of the T=4 B site and the T=3 B site. The overlays display this difference, which is now also specified in text.</p><p>In the T=3 capsid, HAP-TAMRA is clear seen in the B subunit but is absent in the C-subunit. We now specify that the HAP pocket of the T=3 C subunit resembles the similarly empty pocket in the T=4 D subunit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The cryo-EM reconstructions and the supplemental movies are very nice.</p><p>Major Comments on Text</p><p>The main criticism is that the text does not track well with the figures, some of the figures are mis-labeled and the text is terse, making what is an elegant paper surprisingly hard to read. Careful editing is needed, tracking the text to the figures and tightening the logical flow.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text and re-ordered figures to correct this disruption.</p></body></sub-article></article>
