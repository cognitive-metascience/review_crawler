Defective KIF19A leads to hydrocephalus and female infertility because of abnormally elongated cilia. Uniquely among kinesins, KIF19A possesses the dual functions of motility along ciliary microtubules and depolymerization of microtubules. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of these functions we solved the crystal structure of its motor domain and determined its cryo-electron microscopy structure complexed with a microtubule. The features of KIF19A that enable its dual function are clustered on its microtubule-binding side. Unexpectedly, a destabilized switch II coordinates with a destabilized L8 to enable KIF19A to adjust to both straight and curved microtubule protofilaments. The basic clusters of L2 and L12 tether the microtubule. The long L2 with a characteristic acidic-hydrophobic-basic sequence effectively stabilizes the curved conformation of microtubule ends. Hence, KIF19A utilizes multiple strategies to accomplish the dual functions of motility and microtubule depolymerization by ATP hydrolysis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18101.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18101.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18101.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells that line the airways and other passages in the body have hair-like structures called cilia on their surface. Maintaining the cilia at an appropriate length is key to allowing fluid to flow efficiently in these passages. A protein called tubulin forms scaffolds known as microtubules that give each cilium its shape and allow it to change length.</p><p>Motor proteins are also found in cilia, and travel along the microtubules to transport substances. One of these microtubule-based motors, referred to as KIF19A, accumulates at the tip of cilia and controls their length. It does so by combining two actions: it moves along the microtubule to the tip of the cilium, and then removes tubulin molecules from the end. Microtubules are straight along their length and curved at the end, and it is thought that kinesin recognizes both of these shapes in order to carry out these roles. A single region of the KIF19A protein appears to be able to accomplish both roles, but the molecular changes that the protein undergoes to do so are not known.</p><p>Wang et al. have now investigated these changes by determining the structure of the motor domain of KIF19A from mice using two experimental approaches: X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. These structures showed that the specific structural features responsible for the protein's dual roles are indeed clustered on the side of the protein that binds to the microtubule. Wang et al. also identified the regions that make KIF19A flexible enough to fit this interface with both straight and curved microtubules.</p><p>Next, Wang et al. found that other regions of KIF19A stop it detaching from the microtubule and allow it to stabilize the curved shape of microtubule ends; this stimulates the microtubule to disassemble, or “depolymerize”. The findings show that KIF19A uses multiple strategies to enable it to carry out its roles. To understand better how KIF19A depolymerizes the microtubule, a more detailed structure of KIF19A together with tubulin will be needed. Structural studies of KIF19A in cilia will also be useful to understand how the protein controls the length of microtubules.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18101.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18101.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>microtubule dynamic</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23000013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirokawa</surname><given-names>Nobutaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H06372</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirokawa</surname><given-names>Nobutaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15K08168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nitta</surname><given-names>Ryo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nitta</surname><given-names>Ryo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kikkawa</surname><given-names>Masahide</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structural and functional analysis demonstrates the mechanism of dual functional, motility and microtubule depolymerization in a unique motor, KIF19A.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) are microtubule-based molecular motors that hydrolyze ATP to provide energy to support various cellular functions, such as intracellular transport and the regulation of microtubule (MT) dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miki et al., 2005</xref>). Most KIFs, including kinesin-1–kinesin-12 and kinesin-14 subfamily members, actively move along the MT toward either the plus or minus end to transport cellular cargoes, such as protein complexes, vesicles and mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, kinesin-13 proteins, such as KIF2A and KIF2C, are not actively motile along MTs but depolymerize MTs from both ends to control MT dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Homma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogawa et al., 2004</xref>). Kinesin-13 proteins reach the ends of MTs by a passive one-dimensional random diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>) or with the assistance of a MT plus end-tracking protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>). KIF19A, a kinesin-8 sub-family member, is unique in that it possesses both functions, MT-based active motility toward the plus-end and MT depolymerizing activity.</p><p>Most kinesin-8 motor proteins play critical roles during the cell division process, for example in spindle length regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weaver et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Su et al., 2013</xref>) or in the control of mitotic chromosome alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kline-Smith and Walczak, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stumpff et al., 2008</xref>). The most extensively studied kinesin-8, Kip3p (budding yeast kinesin-8; a homologue of mammalian KIF18), requires its C-terminal tail for MT-binding to prevent its detachment from the MT lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mayr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stumpff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Su et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weaver et al., 2011</xref>). Kip3p is highly processive (&gt;5 μm) and multiple Kip3ps act cooperatively to mediate length-dependent MT depolymerization. One possible model for a length-dependent action is proposed to involve the incoming Kip3p bumping off the paused motor at the MT plus-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gupta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varga et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2009</xref>). Structural studies of the motor domain of the human kinesin-8, KIF18A, showed a bent conformation of the α4 relay helix and important loops, indicating the structural basis of the multi-tasking kinesin-8 motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peters et al., 2010</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of the dual-functions of kinesin-8 proteins remain to be determined.</p><p>We recently reported that KIF19A functions as a MT-depolymerizing kinesin in the control of cilium length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niwa et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Kif19a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice displayed hydrocephalus and female infertility phenotypes due to abnormally elongated cilia that cannot generate proper fluid flow. We also reported that, unlike KIF18A, a KIF19A dimer without the tail domain depolymerizes MTs mainly from the plus-end. Therefore, KIF19A possesses the key structural elements for the dual functions of the catalytic motor domain. Thus, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the dual KIF19A functions, we performed crystal structure analysis of the mouse KIF19A motor domain as well as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of the KIF19A motor domain complexed with a MT. In combination with a structure-based mutagenesis analysis, the functional anatomy of KIF19A is reported. In the catalytic core of KIF19A, the KIF19A-specific feature of adopting two different interfaces for MTs and tubulins is utilized to achieve the dual functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KIF19A monomer is a dual function motor</title><p>We previously reported that dimeric KIF19A-379 has dual activities: MT-based motility toward the plus-end and MT-depolymerizing activity mainly from the plus-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niwa et al., 2012</xref>). To clarify which region is responsible for these dual functions, we made the monomeric construct KIF19A-353 (353WT) and assessed its motility and MT-depolymerizing activities. 353WT includes the motor domain followed by the neck-linker, but does not include the neck coiled coil, which is required for the dimerization of KIF19A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We first performed the <italic>in vitro</italic> MT gliding assay, in which tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled and polarity-marked MTs were used to show the tracking direction. The strongly-labeled MT minus-ends lead the MT gliding, suggesting that the monomeric 353WT moves toward the plus-end (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). MT gliding velocity was 5.3 ± 1.2 nm/s (n = 105 MTs from three independent preparations, mean ± SD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), which was slower than that of dimeric KIF19A-379 (21 ± 3 nm/s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niwa et al., 2012</xref>). An <italic>in vitro</italic> MT depolymerizing assay was also performed for KIF19A-353 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desai et al., 1999</xref>). GMPCPP-MTs were dose-dependently depolymerized by 353WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The half-maximal effective concentration for MT depolymerization (EC<sub>50</sub>) was 142 ± 2 nM, which was approximately half that of KIF19A-379 (253 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Considering that one of two motor domains will reach the plus-end of the MT, EC<sub>50</sub> values of one catalytic unit for depolymerizing MTs might be similar between monomeric 353WT and dimeric KIF19A-379. Either way, these <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments collectively indicate that the KIF19A monomer construct, 353WT, is a dual function motor that moves along and depolymerizes MTs.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18101.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the dual function mouse KIF19A motor domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of mouse KIF19A motor domain constructs.

At the initial stage of the 353WT structure determination process, the residues of the switch II helix α4 could not be determined because there was no corresponding density at the site where α4 is usually located at the center of the MT-binding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Instead, we found an unmodeled helical-like density, which was more distant from the KIF19A catalytic core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Long wavelength X-ray diffraction experiment was thus performed to investigate the property of this density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hendrickson and Teeter, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dauter et al., 1999</xref>), because in the switch II helix α4, one cysteine residue exists. It successfully depicted the anomalous diffractions of sulfur or phosphorus atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Among them, one strong anomalous signal was detected close to the center of the corresponding helical density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). When the Cys283 residue was assigned to this anomalous signal, all the residues in α4 and the following loop L12 were reasonably determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In this way, the complete tertiary structure of 353WT was finally determined with a reasonable decrease of the R-factor to 22.2% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The overall structure of the KIF19A 353WT motor domain shared a similar triangle-shape with other kinesins, which consists of a central β-sheet of eight strands, sandwiched between six α-helices, three on either side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sack et al., 1999</xref>). In the 353WT atomic structure, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP was found embedded in the nucleotide-binding pocket. In comparison with previously solved motor domains of various KIFs, the remarkable features of the KIF19A motor domain are concentrated on its MT-binding side and include the long and wide L2 loop, the flexible L8 loop, the disordered α4 helix, and the short α6 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Loop L2 is located at the minus-end side (rear side) of the MT-binding surface and is atypically long. Loop L8, which is the major MT-binding region at the plus-end side, is more retracted toward the catalytic core compared with that of kinesin-13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The switch II helix α4, which is considered the main contributor to MT-based kinesin motility, is more distant from the motor domain than those of other kinesins including kinesin-8 KIF18A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). In comparison to the other kinesins, the first portion of helix α5 is more destabilized in KIF19A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>); therefore, the loop region between α4 and α5 (L12) is longer. This might allow the invasion of a neighboring molecule into the space between α4 and the motor domain in the crystal packing environment, resulting in the distant position of α4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Helix α6 serves as a base for the neck-linker element, which is important for both the regulation of ATPase activity and MT-based kinesin motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Case et al., 2000</xref>). Its reduced length by more than one turn might be caused by the atypical glycine mutation in helix α6, which is not seen in other typical plus end motors (G341, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Glycine has high conformational flexibility and often tends to disrupt the α-helix, which might affect the conformation of the following neck-linker by terminating α6 prematurely.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18101.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of the dual function mouse KIF19A motor domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) Crystal structure of the KIF19A motor domain in the ADP-state seen from the MT binding side (<bold>A</bold>) and 90 degree rotation around the ordinate axis (<bold>B</bold>).

PC2A, L55A and IL2A markedly impaired depolymerization, while I54A had little effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Different concentrations of 353WT and the L2 mutants that showed an effect (PC2A and L55A) were then incubated with GMPCPP-stabilized MTs to obtain EC<sub>50</sub> values for MT depolymerization. The mean EC<sub>50</sub> values of 353WT, PC2A and L55A in three independent experiments were 142 ± 2 nM, 4936 ± 15 nM and 409 ± 4 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The dose-reaction curve of L55A was shifted to the right of 353WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). For PC2A, even at the highest enzyme concentration used (5000 nM), approximately 50% of the wild-type depolymerization activity was achieved. We also observed MT depolymerization in the presence of 5 mM Mg-ATP by TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The depolymerization was mainly observed at the MT plus-ends and the speeds were 10.9 ± 2.0 nm/s for 353WT, 2.5 ± 0.5 nm/s for L55A, and 0.7 ± 0.2 nm/s for PC2A. The depolymerization speed of PC2A was the lowest among them, and only a little higher than that achieved by the negative control (0.2 ± 0.02 nm/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>We then tested the effect of introducing KIF19A L2 into KIF18A (another kinesin-8 member) and KIF5C (a typical plus-end directed motor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Consistent with a previous report, the KIF18A monomer had little MT depolymerization activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weaver et al., 2011</xref>). The substitution of KIF19A L2 mildly increased the depolymerization activity of KIF18A. Note that a fraction of KIF18A moved to the soluble fraction via interaction with depolymerized tubulin-dimers. In contrast, the L2 of KIF19A did not make KIF5C a MT depolymerase. These data collectively suggested that the basic cluster of L2, as well as the Leu 55 at the tip of L2, play crucial roles in depolymerization from MT ends, although the simple swapping of L2 is not sufficient for transport motors such as KIF5C to attain MT depolymerization function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Characterization of KIF19A ATPase stimulated by MTs and tubulins</title><p>As described above, KIF19A not only depolymerizes MTs mainly from their plus-ends, but can also move slowly along MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niwa et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is expected that KIF19A ATPase will be activated by both MTs and tubulins. To confirm this idea, we first examined the steady-state ATPase activity of the wild-type construct in the absence/presence of MTs or tubulins. The basal ATPase activities of 353WT, L55A, and PC2A in the absence of MTs or tubulins were all comparable to that of another kinesin-8 motor, Kip3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gupta et al., 2006</xref>). Activation of 353WT by MTs caused the ATPase to be activated ~300 times to reach a maximum rate of 1.43 ± 0.07 s<sup>−1</sup>, while free tubulin-dimers caused the ATPase to be activated ~200 times to reach a maximum rate of 0.80 ± 0.06 s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the KIF19A ATPase is similarly activated by both MTs and tubulins. This characteristic is conserved among kinesin-8 proteins, including KIF18A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peters et al., 2010</xref>). However, the ratio of KIF19A ATPase activation by tubulins/MTs is much higher than that of KIF18A, suggesting that KIF19A is more adapted to tubulins to increase MT depolymerization activity.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18101.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>L2 also affects KIF19A kinetics and motility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Steady state ATPase kinetics of 100 nM 353WT and its L2 mutants.

The affinities for MTs and tubulins were slightly affected by the L55A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). This indicates that the role of L55 in MT depolymerization is independent from that of the KIF19A catalytic cycle stimulated by MTs or tubulins. This L55 property seems similar to that of the valine residue of the KVD finger in kinesin-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogawa et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, PC2A significantly decreased the MT/tubulin stimulation of the KIF19A ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The PC2A mutation also decreased the ATPase stimulation by tubulin without affecting the <italic>K</italic><sub>M, tubulin</sub>. Hence, the KIF19A-specific basic residues of L2 might be involved in the tubulin-activated ATPase pathway, as described later.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Loop L2 tethers KIF19A to MTs and might slow down motility</title><p>The alanine mutation in the basic L2 cluster in KIF19A weakens the affinity for MTs. This was confirmed by a MT co-sedimentation assay using KIF19A and a non-hydrolysable ATP-analogue, adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). We found that L55A slightly decreased MT affinity (353WT, <italic>K</italic><sub>d, MT</sub> 0.6 ± 0.1 μM; L55A, <italic>K</italic><sub>d, MT</sub> 1.6 ± 0.3 μM), whereas PC2A severely decreased MT affinity (PC2A, <italic>K</italic><sub>d,MT</sub> 5.8 ± 2.1 μM), consistent with the kinetics data above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We also observed the MT gliding motility of KIF19A. The speed of the L55A mutant was a little higher than that of 353WT described above (L55A, 7.5 ± 0.6 nm/s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). However, bound MTs were rarely detected when the PC2A mutant, at the same concentration as L55A, was fixed on the coverslip. We thus checked the number of bound MTs to PC2A in the presence of AMP-PNP. Different concentrations of MTs were incubated with 353WT or PC2A in the presence of 5 mM AMP-PNP. Although PC2A bound fewer MTs than 353WT, increasing the concentration of PC2A (1 mg/ml) enabled sufficient microtubules to fix to the glass surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Even in these conditions, however, bound MTs glided distances that were too short to reliably calculate the gliding speed on the PC2A-coated coverslip. Thus, the PC2A mutation severely increased the dissociation constant for MTs so that few MTs were observed on PC2A attached to the coverslip. The KIF18A and KIF5C L2 substitution mutations were also introduced into KIF19A to check MT gliding motilities. Again, bound MTs were not detectable with KIF5C L2 and very few MTs were detected with KIF18A L2, indicating that the L2 of KIF19A, especially its basic cluster, is necessary for 353WT to stay attached to MTs.</p><p>We further investigated the role of loop L2 for MT-based motility by the reverse swapping of KIF19A L2 into other kinesin motors. The L2 of KIF19A was swapped into the kinesin-8 member, KIF18A, and the kinesin-1 member, KIF5C, to clarify its effect on motility. As a consequence, MTs glided much more slowly with the swap mutants compared with the wild-type motors (KIF18A WT, 34.4 ± 0.3 nm/s; KIF18A swap, 10.2 ± 0.1 nm/s; KIF5C WT, 179.9 ± 2.5 nm/s; KIF5C swap, 68.9 ± 0.2 nm/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>). The intensive ionic interactions between the L2 of KIF19A and MTs might reduce motility speed. KIF19A L2 is thus likely to interact electrostatically with the MT to tether the KIF19A motor domain on the MT, which in turn reduces motility speed on the MT.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Basic residues in loop L12 increase the affinity for both tubulins and MTs to enable effective depolymerization of MTs</title><p>The most remarkable structural difference between KIF19A and other kinesins was found in the switch II region, α4-L12-α5, which is destabilized and distant from the motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>).

Thus we first constructed two KIF19A swap mutants, in which L12 was replaced with the counterpart of KIF18A or KIF5C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In comparison to 353WT, soluble tubulin was decreased in the presence of KIF5C L12, but was slightly increased in the presence of KIF18A L12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Within the KIF18A L12 sequence, three continuous basic residues (K299, R300 and R301) are present. Only one basic residue, K274, was found in the L12 of KIF5C, whereas two basic residues, K290 and K294, were found in the L12 of KIF19A. Therefore, to test the relationship between the number of basic residues in L12 and MT depolymerization ability, we made two more constructs: GS2R, in which both G291 and S292 were mutated to arginine, such that L12 had four basic residues, and K2A in which both K290 and K294 were replaced with alanine, such that L12 had no basic residues. As expected, GS2R exhibited a slight increase in MT depolymerization activity, similar to the KIF18A L2 swap mutant, whereas K2A without basic residues in L12 showed lower MT depolymerization ability, similar to the KIF5C L2 swap mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–G</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the ATPase of L12 mutants, GS2R and K2A. The basal ATPase activities of L12 mutants in the absence of MTs or tubulins were all comparable to the 353WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The GS2R mutant showed only a small increase in MT- and tubulin-activated turnover rate, though it exhibited a four-times lower Michaelis-Menten constant for both MTs and tubulins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). In contrast, K2A showed a lower MT- and tubulin-activated turnover rate and a higher Michaelis-Menten constant for both MTs and tubulins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Therefore, the change in the number of basic residues in L12 might alter the electrostatic affinities to the MT lattice or tubulins. To further confirm this idea, a MT co-sedimentation assay with Taxol-stabilized MTs was performed. The GS2R mutation did not significantly alter the affinity for MTs (353WT, <italic>K</italic><sub>d, MT</sub> 0.6 ± 0.1 μM; GS2R, <italic>K</italic><sub>d, MT</sub> 0.6 ± 0.06 μM). The K2A mutation, however, significantly weakened the affinity for MTs (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> 3.0 ± 0.6 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Thus, two basic residues of L12 contribute to the depolymerization ability of KIF19A through electrostatic interaction. Further addition of basic residues did not effectively increase MT affinity.</p><p>This contribution of basic residues in loop L12 resembles that of the KIF1A K-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okada and Hirokawa, 2000</xref>). Thus, the binding partner of KIF19A L12 was expected to be the E-hook, the C-terminal tail of tubulin that has an acidic cluster. To address whether the E-hook is responsible for the electrostatic interaction with the KIF19A motor domain, we incubated KIF19A with two kinds of MTs, normal tubulin polymers and tubulin-S polymers, in the presence of AMP-PNP. Tubulin-S, which was obtained by limited subtilisin proteolysis of tubulin dimer, lacks the cluster of negatively charged residues found in the E-hook of α- and β-tubulins. Whether the binding ratio was 1:1 or 1:2.5, a greatly reduced quantity of KIF19A was seen in the tubulin S assembled MT pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Thus, the E-hook of tubulin is confirmed to be responsible for the KIF19A-MT interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Asparagine 297 contributes to interface flexibility by destabilizing switch II helices to enable both MT and tubulin binding</title><p>We also investigated the asparagine in KIF19A at the junction of loop L12 and helix α5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). At this position, a proline residue is highly conserved among kinesin superfamily proteins except for KIF19A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). It has been proposed that this proline serves as a 'helix starter' of α5 because of its restricted dihedral angles. Thus, a lack of proline at the starting position of α5 might destabilize helix α5, further destabilizing the preceding L12 and α4, as is observed in the crystal structure of 353WT in the absence of a MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). To test this hypothesis, Asn297 was mutated to proline to clarify its effect on depolymerization and motility along MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–G</xref>). The resulting EC<sub>50</sub> value of N297P for MT depolymerization (EC<sub>50</sub> 201 ± 2 μM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) was slightly increased compared to the wild type, with the slight decrease in the depolymerization speed (7.7 ± 1.3 nm/s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). In contrast, the MT-gliding velocity (6.5 ± 0.2 nm/s) was slightly increased compared to the wild type in three independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>). Therefore, Asn297 in α5 has a slight advantage for the MT depolymerization but has a slight disadvantage for the motility over Pro297.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18101.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Contribution of KIF19A-Specific Asn297.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignment of KIF19A and other typical kinesins for the α4-L12-α5 region.

Even though no significant difference was shown, the N297P mutation tended to increase the basal ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The destabilized conformation of switch II might be less favorable for the basal ATPase activity. The MT-stimulated ATPase rate did not alter significantly, although the Michaelis-Menten constant was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, the tubulin-stimulated ATPase rate of N297P was markedly reduced to approximately half that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Hence, the KIF19A-specific asparagine residue, Asn297, contributes to the increase of tubulin-stimulated ATPase activity but has minimal effect on MT-stimulated ATPase activity. Thus, Asn297 of KIF19A might be advantageous to adopting both the straight tubulin-dimer in the MT-lattice and the curved tubulin-dimer at the MT-ends. Asn297-induced destabilization of switch II helices might contribute to this adaptation to achieve the dual functions of KIF19A.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Cryo-EM reconstruction of 353WT complexed with GDP-taxol MTs reveals the functional anatomy of KIF19A</title><p>Finally, we performed cryo-EM analysis of KIF19A in the nucleotide-free state complexed with a GDP-taxol MT. Cryo-EM reconstruction at a 7.0 Å resolution clarified the interactions between KIF19A specific structures and a straight MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). It should be noted that, presumably because of the weak or unstable interaction between KIF19A and a straight MT, stable and full decoration of KIF19A on the GDP-taxol MT was uncommon; the occupancy of KIF19A is thus lower than that of a tubulin-dimer in our reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). However, almost all helices, β-sheets and important loops that contact a MT are reliably visualized in our reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To clarify the conformation of the nucleotide-free KIF19A on a MT, two crystal structures, the KIF19A-ADP structure solved here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>) and the nucleotide-free KIF5 structure (PDB: 4LNU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2014</xref>), were rigidly fitted into our reconstruction. The KIF5-free structure represented better fitting than the KIF19A-ADP structure, as indicated by the higher cross correlation values (KIF19A-ADP, 0.83; KIF5-free, 0.89). Most of the regions in the catalytic core of both KIF19A-ADP and KIF5-free are nicely fitted into the cryo-EM map of KIF19A-free on a MT (gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). However, marked differences were observed between the two structures at the MT-binding interfaces, loop L8 at the plus-end side, switch II α4-L12-α5, and loop L2 at the minus-end side (green or red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). The first two of these regions of the cryo-EM map take very similar conformations to those of KIF5-free on a MT (red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), whereas the L2 of KIF19A-ADP was nicely fitted into the extra-density observed at the minus-end side (black arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Thus, we finally created an atomic model of KIF19A-free on a MT that has the similar L8 and switch II conformations as KIF5-free and the similar L2 conformation as KIF19A-ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

The length, the location, and the angle of α4 in KIF5-free fit perfectly to the corresponding cryo-EM density of KIF19A-free (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This means that KIF19A is able to adjust the switch II conformation to fit the straight tubulin interface on the MT-lattice. It is also notable that a clear density was found at the right side of α4, corresponding to the E-hook of β-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). As expected by the biochemical assays described above, the acidic residues in the E-hook ionically interact with the basic cluster of L12 in KIF19A, thus stabilizing the E-hook. In comparison with the E-hook of α-tubulin, that of β-tubulin is remarkably stabilized by interaction with L12 of KIF19A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>Loop L2 extends toward the minus-end of the MT. No marked difference was observed between KIF19A-ADP and KIF19A-free on a MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). The corresponding density of L2 almost reaches the inter-tubulin-dimer groove close to the H11’-helix of β-tubulin at the minus-end side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Because L2 has the characteristic sequence in which the hydrophobic residues at the tip of L2 are sandwiched by an acidic cluster on the left side and a basic cluster on the right side, the possible interactions of these residues were estimated from the fitted atomic models of KIF19A and tubulin-dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). The acidic cluster faces the H11’ helix of the neighboring β-tubulin, where basic H406 and K402 residues are located (red region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). However, the Cα distance between L2 and H11’ is around 11 Å, which is slightly longer than a stable interacting distance. Hydrophobic residues presumably interact with the hydrophobic residues of the H8-S7 loop and the H12 helix in α-tubulin (yellow region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Consistent with the mutational studies, the L55 of L2 serves as the main interface of the hydrophobic contacts. The basic cluster then faces acidic clusters on the H12 helix of α-tubulin (blue region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Its Cα distances are within 9 Å, thus salt-bridges might be formed between them even on the straight MT lattice. When KIF19A is on the MT-lattice, therefore, loop L2 interacts with α-tubulin through the hydrophobic tip and basic cluster, though the acidic cluster will not contribute to the interaction with the MT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>As a unique subfamily of the kinesin superfamily, kinesin-8 members possess both MT-based plus-end directed motility and MT depolymerizing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gupta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varga et al., 2006</xref>). KIF18A and kip3p are the most extensively studied kinesin-8 members; however, KIF19A may provide a simpler model because a single motor domain of KIF19A intrinsically possesses the dual activities of MT-based motility and MT-depolymerizing activity. In this study, we clarified the functional anatomy of the KIF19A motor domain and propose a structural model for its dual functions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Two requirements for the dual functions of KIF19A</title><p>To achieve the dual functions, KIF19A should meet the following two requirements: (1) the ability to adopt two different interfaces for straight MTs and curved tubulins to enable KIF19A ATPase activation, and (2) the ability to stabilize the curved conformation of MT-ends to destabilize the MT protofilaments, as observed for kinesin-13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shipley et al., 2004</xref>). To accomplish these requirements, KIF19A-specific characteristics are concentrated on the MT-binding surface. As detailed in the following sections, for the 1st requirement, the location of the destabilized, retractable loop L8 and switch II (α4-L12-α5) enable adjustment to both the straight tubulin interface on the MT-lattice [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C(i)</xref>] and the curved tubulin interface at the MT-ends [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C(iv)</xref>]. For the second requirement, the long and fan-shaped L2 is located at the minus-end side. It plays a central role in depolymerizing MTs from the ends through stabilization of the curved conformation of MT-ends. Helix α6 is atypically shorter than those of the other previously solved kinesins. Its functional meaning is still uncertain mainly because structural information for the neck-linker that follows α6 is still lacking. The short conformation of α6 is expected to affect the neck-linker conformation and further structural study of KIF19A in the ATP state is needed to address the role of the short helix α6.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18101.024</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of KIF19A motor domain function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the dual functions of KIF19A.

Most kinesins choose between the two, although kinesin-8 members are able to bind both. To investigate which structural alterations are needed to achieve this, in silico docking of KIF19A with a curved tubulin-dimer (PDB: 3RYC) was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nawrotek et al., 2011</xref>). The α-tubulin of the curved tubulin-dimer was aligned with that of the straight MT-lattice.</p><p>On the MT-lattice, the interface of the KIF19A-free model is nicely fitted to the tubulin-dimer interface [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C(i)</xref>]. L8, switch II, and L2 serve as main interfaces for the straight tubulin-dimer. The KIF19A-free model on the MT-curved end comes into collision with the β-tubulin surface at two regions, L8 and switch II L12-α5 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C(ii)</xref>]. L8 in the KIF19A-ADP model, however, made better contact with the curved tubulin-dimer at the MT ends [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C(iii)</xref>]. Hence, the retractable L8 by the rotational movement of the L8-α3-L9 cluster is the first key feature to enable fitting to both the straight and curved interfaces of MTs.</p><p>However, switch II still collides with curved β-tubulin at the junction of L12 and the first turn of helix α5 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C(iii)</xref>]. At that point, the highly conserved proline residue is replaced in KIF19A with a unique asparagine residue (Asn297). A proline residue is often found at the start or end points of a helix to stabilize it. Thus, replacement of proline for an asparagine residue might destabilize α5 allowing it to melt into the flexible long L12 loop. In fact, the first turn of helix α5 melted in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Therefore, we expected that the flexible feature of the L12 and initial α5 might be caused by the KIF19A-specific Asn297. This idea was supported by our biochemical experiment. The N297P mutant had a more than 40% decrease in tubulin-stimulated ATPase activity compared with the wild type, indicating that this mutation limits adjustment of the KIF19A interface to the curved tubulin-dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Thus, the destabilized conformation of switch II is the second key feature to avoid collision when binding to the curved MT end [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C(iv)</xref>]. To confirm this idea, a high resolution structure of KIF19A complexed with tubulin is required.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>KIF19A compensates for decreased MT affinity by flexible ionic interactions through L2 and L12</title><p>The arrangements of the KIF19A MT-binding interface described above enable it to achieve dual functions. On the flip side, however, they result in decreased affinity of KIF19A for the MT-lattice or the MT-curved end. KIF19A has overcome this difficulty by introducing basic clusters into the L2 and L12 loops.</p><p>The basic cluster at the right side of L2 tethers MTs by ionic interactions between L2 and the MT. The alanine mutant, PC2A, severely decreases the MT-binding affinity of KIF19A so that MTs were rarely found on the PC2A-bound coverslip. It should be noted here that the PC2A mutation only decreases the affinity for MTs but not for soluble tubulin-dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As described below, the additional salt bridges through the acidic cluster on the left side of L2 are only formed when interacting with a tubulin-dimer. This could possibly minimize the effect of the PC2A mutation on the affinity for tubulins, but not on the affinity for MTs. In contrast, when the basic cluster was introduced into the L2 of KIF5C or KIF18A, the motility speed decreased to nearly one third of wild type. The additional strong interaction between the basic cluster and MTs might slow down the detachment of KIF19A from the MT. Hence introducing the basic cluster of L2 to increase affinity for MTs has the consequence of reducing the speed of KIF19A motility.</p><p>Similar to the basic cluster of L2, the basic residues of L12 contribute to tethering KIF19A to the E-hook of a MT, in a similar fashion to the K-loop of KIF1A, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okada and Hirokawa, 2000</xref>). Our data showed that more than two of the basic residues in L12 were required to show wild-type KIF19A MT-binding ability and MT-depolymerization activity. In kinesin-13, alanine substitutions of charged residues in the switch II cluster showed lower depolymerization activity due to weak MT binding ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shipley et al., 2004</xref>). We presume that the positively charged residues support both straight and curved MT binding, providing minor assistance to L2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The structural mechanism of KIF19A MT depolymerization</title><p>The shapes of the fan-like L2 of KIF19A and the slender L2 of kinesin-13 were different, while the length of loop L2 is comparable between KIF19A and kinesin-13 and the locations of the hydrophobic residues at the tip are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Alanine mutation of Leu 55, which caused a MT depolymerization deficiency with a small effect on MT-based motility, suggested its central role for depolymerizing MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The comparison of KIF19A binding to the MT-lattice and the MT-curved end indicates a further role for L2 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C(i) and (iv)</xref>]. The interactions between L2 of KIF19A and α-tubulin through the hydrophobic tip of L2 and the basic cluster of L2 are similarly observed for both straight and curved tubulins. For curved tubulins, however, interactions between L2 and the neighboring β-tubulin at the minus-end side would also be formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The H11’ helix of β-tubulin gets closer to L2 by ~2Å compared with that in the straight conformation (Cα distance is around 9 Å) so that the acidic cluster could make salt bridges with the basic residues in the H11’ helix of β-tubulin. Therefore, the combination of acidic-hydrophobic-basic residues of L2 stabilizes the curved conformation of inter-tubulin-dimer interface. This could be the structural basis for MT depolymerization by KIF19A.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Model of KIF19A motor domain function</title><p>Based on the structural properties of the KIF19A motor domain and substantial mutant analysis, we present a functional anatomy for the dual function of KIF19A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). The destabilized switch II helices contribute to the adaptation to the two distinct interfaces of straight and curved MTs with a concomitant sacrifice of slightly decreased motility speed along the MT. The rotatable L8-α3-L9 cluster also supports adaptation to the two interfaces. The basic cluster of L2, as well as the basic residues of L12, enable KIF19A to tether to both straight and curved MTs via flexible ionic interactions with the acidic residues of H12 or the E-hook of tubulins. This assures its motility along the MT, although motility speed may be decreased. The hydrophobic tip of L2, as well as the surrounding basic and acidic clusters, play critical roles in MT depolymerization. These residues stabilize the inter-tubulin-dimer interface of the curved MT protofilament. Thus, the curved conformation of MT ends is stabilized by L2, resulting in the depolymerization of the MTs. In this way, KIF19A has acquired dual functions by introducing multiple strategies. The resulting KIF19A is a slow plus-end directed motor combined with mild MT-depolymerizing activity. The KIF19A motility speed and the MT depolymerization activity might be different on ciliary doublet MTs. Further studies are required to reveal how KIF19A is involved in length control of ciliary MTs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs and protein preparation</title><p>The coding sequence of the mouse KIF19A motor domain (1–353) and its related mutants were cloned into pET21b(+) (Novagen, Germany) with a 7×His-tag at the C terminal of the motor domain.

To assess the effective resolutions and possible over-fitting, the phases of high-resolution components (&gt;10 Å) of individual images were randomized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) and the 3D structures were reconstructed and analyzed by Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Van Heel, 1987</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to N.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. One of the four reviewers has agreed to reveal his identity: Robert Anthony Cross (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports structure-function studies on mouse kinesin-8 KIF19A. Kinesins-8 combine the ability to move along microtubules with the ability to depolymerise the GTP caps of microtubules. Kif19A is a kinesin-8 that has been shown by the authors to be required for ciliary microtubule length-control. The structures reported here reveal novel features of the tubulin / microtubule binding surface of Kif19A. Wang et al. hypothesize that the various features of this surface allow Kif19A to bind to both 'straight' tubulin in microtubules and 'curved' tubulin in solution and at the depolymerising plus ends of dynamic microtubules. They test the roles of the various features of this interface by mutagenesis of KIF19A and by transplant experiments where these features are moved to related kinesins. The properties of these mutants are explored using depolymerisation assays done with GMPCPP microtubules, and in ATPase assays using both microtubules and tubulin. The depolymerisation mechanism(s) of kinesin-8 are poorly understood at the protein-chemistry level and KIF19A is particularly important, given its role in ciliogenesis. There is a previous structural study of a different kinesin-8 Kif18a, which reported some of the unusual features described here, but there is sufficient novel information that advances our understanding of the kinesin-8 mechanism.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most notable aspect of the KIF19A structural findings is the extended helix a4 and its apparent retraction in the no NT cryoEM structure. However, the cryoEM data are at relatively low resolution, perhaps due to the fact that the occupancy by KIF19A is not saturated. Furthermore, interpretations in the Discussion of the differences between microtubule lattice and tip binding by KIF19A are neither clear nor convincing, given the poorly presented cryoEM data and absence of structural data for motor binding to curved microtubules. Density for KIF19A bound to microtubules without nucleotide is fit with KIF19A-ADP and nucleotide-free kinesin-1 crystal structures without clearly explaining this. The interpretation is that KIF19A helix a4 differs from the motor-ADP in the NT-free state and is similar to kinesin-1. However, the cryoEM density is not shown clearly enough in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> images for the reader to evaluate this or other statements regarding KIF19A interactions with microtubules. This is one of the major findings of this paper and its presentation and description should be significantly improved.</p><p>2) Motility data for the truncated and mutant motors require further documentation. It should be indicated whether the leading or lagging microtubule ends were tracked and whether microscope drift was controlled for. Please also indicate the duration of assay/tracking times, the average microtubule length and whether microtubules were polarity marked. Please include kymographs of motility and explain whether the truncated monomer motor moves directionally.</p><p>3) For the PC2A mutant, please indicate whether microtubules were bound and not gliding, or not bound.

However, the cryoEM data are at relatively low resolution, perhaps due to the fact that the occupancy by KIF19A is not saturated. Furthermore, interpretations in the Discussion of the differences between microtubule lattice and tip binding by KIF19A are neither clear nor convincing, given the poorly presented cryoEM data and absence of structural data for motor binding to curved microtubules. Density for KIF19A bound to microtubules without nucleotide is fit with KIF19A-ADP and nucleotide-free kinesin-1 crystal structures without clearly explaining this. The interpretation is that KIF19A helix a4 differs from the motor-ADP in the NT-free state and is similar to kinesin-1. However, the cryoEM density is not shown clearly enough in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> images for the reader to evaluate this or other statements regarding KIF19A interactions with microtubules. This is one of the major findings of this paper and its presentation and description should be significantly improved.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive comment. We have comprehensively revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> as well as the corresponding sections in the main text (subsection “Cryo-EM Reconstruction of 353WT Complexed with GDP-taxol MTs Reveals the Functional Anatomy of KIF19A” and the Discussion section). In the new figures, the atomic model of nucleotide-free KIF19A on a MT, produced using the rigid body fitted model of KIF19A-ADP and KIF5-free, is presented (in the second paragraph of the aforementioned subsection). This has enabled us to more clearly present the conformational changes from the KIF19A-ADP without MT to the KIF19A-free on an MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In the Discussion section, in silico fitting of the KIF19A structures with a curved tubulin-dimer is described to clarify which regions are responsible for the dual functions of KIF19A (subsection “L8 and switch II of KIF19A requires flexibility to fit the tubulin interfaces in both the MT-lattice and MT-curved end”, first paragraph). This clearly illustrates that the KIF19A-specific conformations of the long L2, the retractable L8, and the disordered switch II, play central roles in its dual functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–E</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Motility data for the truncated and mutant motors require further documentation. It should be indicated whether the leading or lagging microtubule ends were tracked and whether microscope drift was controlled for. Please also indicate the duration of assay/tracking times, the average microtubule length and whether microtubules were polarity marked. Please include kymographs of motility and explain whether the truncated monomer motor moves directionally.</italic> </p><p>We have revised the text and figures as the reviewer suggests. Kymographs of motility tracking both the leading and lagging ends are presented in the revised manuscript. They clearly indicate the plus-end directed movement of the truncated monomer motor. A representative motility video of a truncated KIF19A monomer is also attached showing that most MTs move in a same direction but aggregate-like dots do not move directionally. This means that microscope drift is negligibly small.</p><p><italic>3) For the PC2A mutant, please indicate whether microtubules were bound and not gliding, or not bound. If no microtubules were bound, were assays done with AMP.PNP to show sufficient motor attached to the surface to bind microtubules? Conclusions regarding the mutant should be formulated more carefully, based on the actual observations.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the confusing presentation. In the revised manuscript, we have added the assay performed with PC2A in the presence of AMP-PNP. Although fewer MTs were observed compared with the WT motor, an increased concentration of PC2A (1 mg/ml) enabled sufficient microtubules to be bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Even in these conditions, however, MTs were bound to the coverslip for too short a time to reliably calculate the gliding speed on the PC2A-coated coverslip. Thus, the PC2A mutation severely increased the dissociation constant for MTs so that few MTs were observed on PC2A attached to the coverslip. We have added this discussion in the first paragraph of the subsection “Loop L2 Tethers KIF19A to MTs and Might Slow Down Motility”.</p><p><italic>4) To determine which of the detected differences are significant, please use appropriate statistical tests throughout the paper.</italic> </p><p>We have added appropriate statistical tests to determine significant differences.</p><p><italic>5) The microtubule disassembly assays require better documentation and presentation: please state if assay is a disassembly assay, state that AMP.PNP is a control, provide time of incubation, state concentration of microtubule ends, define EC50 and state why this is used rather than Michaelis-Menten constant, state on plot axis that data are normalized, add error bars and indicate n=# to plots.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful for this constructive comment. We have revised the Methods (subsection “Microtubule Depolymerization Assay”), Figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>), and their legends as the reviewer suggests. In previous studies of KIF19A, as well as studies on MCAK/KIF2C, EC50 was used to characterize depolymerization ability (Hertzer et al., 2006; Niwa et al., 2012; Noda et al., 2012). To make a valid comparison with these previous reports, we used the EC50 value rather than the Michaelis-Menten constant.</p><p><italic>6) For the ATPase assays throughout, the authors' statements regarding effects are frequently not consistent with the data, e.g., they state no significant effects where data actually show significant but small effects, then follow with inaccurate conclusions regarding effects; they state no (or slight) effects where the data, in fact, show significant (or large) effects – these statements should be corrected. Number of independent assays (n=#) should be given in tables throughout.</italic> </p><p>We have carefully checked and revised the manuscript to provide consistent interpretation for the ATPase assays. We have added the appropriate statistical tests to determine significant differences. We also added the statement of the number of independent assays in the figure legends.</p><p><italic>7) Statements and interpretations throughout the manuscript frequently lack evidence or are inaccurate: e.g., processivity is not examined in this (or previous) studies – there is no evidence for the statements regarding KIF19A processivity in the subsections “Cryo-EM Reconstruction of 353WT Complexed with GDP-taxol MTs Revealed the Functional Anatomy of KIF19A”, “KIF19A Tethers Straight and Curved MTs Using Flexible Ionic Interactions” and”Model for KIF19A Motor Domain Function”. In the subsection “Asparagine 297 Contributes to the Adoption of MT and Tubulin Interfaces by Destabilizing Switch II Helices”, the proline is</italic> highly <italic>conserved, but not perfectly conserved among the kinesins. Please make the statements more accurate.</italic></p><p>We have carefully revised the manuscript to make these statements more accurate.</p><p><italic>8) KIF19A is presumed to move on ciliary microtubules, which differ from the single microtubules used in the in vitro motility and kinetic assays reported here.

As the reviewer suggests, however, the velocities of KIF19A movement and depolymerization might be different on ciliary doublet microtubules. Thus we have carefully revised the manuscript to avoid over interpretation. We have also added a related statement at the end of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>9) The coordinates, structure factors and EM electron density maps must be made available upon publication. Authors should provide statements regarding deposition of X-ray and cryoEM coordinates into public databases.</italic> </p><p>We have deposited all the structures solved here in PDB and EMDB.
