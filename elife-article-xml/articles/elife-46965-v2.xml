However, less is known about the effects of mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss (MMHL) during development. Here, we used a longitudinal design to examine late auditory evoked responses and mismatch responses to nonspeech and speech sounds for children with MMHL. At Time 1, younger children with MMHL (8–12 years; n = 23) showed age-appropriate mismatch negativities (MMNs) to sounds, but older children (12–16 years; n = 23) did not. Six years later, we re-tested a subset of the younger (now older) children with MMHL (n = 13). Children who had shown significant MMNs at Time 1 showed MMNs that were reduced and, for nonspeech, absent at Time 2. Our findings demonstrate that even a mild-to-moderate hearing loss during early-to-mid childhood can lead to changes in the neural processing of sounds in late childhood/adolescence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>hearing loss</kwd><kwd>LAER</kwd><kwd>MMN</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-607139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Halliday</surname><given-names>Lorna F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000269</institution-id><institution>ESRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RES-061-25-0440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Halliday</surname><given-names>Lorna F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss causes changes in the neurophysiological functioning that emerge during adolescence, as suggested by both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The structure and function of the adult auditory system is dependent upon stimulation received during maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kral and Sharma, 2012</xref>). Animal studies have shown marked differences in the anatomy, physiology, and functionality of the central auditory pathway following cochlear ablation, pharmacological neonatal deafening, and congenital deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shepherd and Hardie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2017</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butler and Lomber, 2013</xref>, for a review). Deafness-induced changes have also been identified in humans, namely, degeneration of spiral ganglion cells in the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nadol et al., 1989</xref>), a reduction of volume of neurons in the cochlear nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seldon and Clark, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chao et al., 2002</xref>) and a functional reorganisation of cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neville et al., 1998</xref>) following congenital profound (&gt;95 dB HL) sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). However, in contrast to the literature on deafness, much less is known about the effects of mild- (21–40 dB HL) to-moderate (41–70 dB HL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">British Society of Audiology, 2011</xref>) SNHL (MMHL) on the developing auditory pathway. Nonetheless, there is evidence to suggest that even transient or mild levels of hearing loss during a critical period can lead to lasting effects in the central and peripheral auditory system (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gravel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rosen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takesian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liberman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mowery et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we examine the effects of MMHL on the development of auditory cortical functioning in children.</p><p>Cortical event-related potentials (ERPs) have been used extensively to investigate the functional integrity of the auditory pathway in both normally hearing (NH) and hearing-impaired individuals (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alain and Tremblay, 2007</xref>). Of particular interest are the late auditory evoked responses (LAERs), comprising the P1, N1, P2, and N2 components, and the mismatch responses (MMRs), comprising the mismatch negativity (MMN) and late discriminatory negativity (LDN). The LAERs are thought to mark the initial detection (P1, N1, and P2), classification and discrimination (P2 and N2) of an auditory stimulus (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eggermont and Ponton, 2002</xref>). Typically, these components are elicited passively, in response to a stream of repeated standard sounds. In contrast, the MMRs are thought to reflect the discrimination of one or more different sounds, and are typically evoked by the detection of comparatively rare deviant auditory stimuli from a stream of repeated, comparatively frequent, standards (i.e. an oddball paradigm; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patel and Azzam, 2005</xref>). Both the LAERs and the MMRs show distinct postnatal maturational time courses (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gomot et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ponton et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, these responses have been identified as useful candidates to assess the effects of SNHL on the development of the auditory pathway in children.</p><p>There is now an abundance of evidence to suggest that auditory cortical responses may be delayed and/or deviant in children with severe or profound SNHL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ponton et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ponton et al., 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ponton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ponton et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ponton and Eggermont, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sharma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharma et al., 2005</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Näätänen et al., 2017</xref>, for a review of the MMN). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ponton et al. (1996b)</xref> used a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal design to examine the development of the P1-N1-P2 complex in a group of six, 6–16 year-old children with early-onset profound SNHL who had been fitted with unilateral cochlear implants (CIs) following an average period of deafness of 4.5 years (range: 1.5 to 6 years). Note that this study was conducted prior to the introduction of newborn hearing screening programmes, and before changes in recommendations regarding the age and type (unilateral vs. bilateral) of cochlear implantation in children with profound SNHL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Waltzman and Roland, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Papsin and Gordon, 2007</xref>). ERPs were elicited via electric pulse trains, and were compared to those of a group of NH control children, the ERPs of whom were evoked by acoustic pulse trains. For the youngest children (aged 5–7 years), the ERPs of the CI group were very similar to those of controls, being dominated by a large P1 around 140 ms after stimulus onset, followed by a prolonged negativity (N2). However, for the older children (8–16 years), marked morphological differences between groups emerged: Whereas older NH controls developed an N1 response, children with CIs generally did not. Instead, the ERPs of older children with CIs more closely resembled those of younger NH controls. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ponton et al. (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ponton et al. (2000b)</xref> examined a more extensive set of longitudinal ERP data recorded from CI users (N = 118) into their adolescence. P1 was found to emerge following implantation, albeit with a latency delay proportional to the period of deafness. Moreover, the MMN was robustly present in children with CIs who showed good spoken language perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ponton et al., 2000b</xref>). However, particularly striking was the absence of an N1 from almost all of the profoundly deaf children Ponton and colleagues had tested. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ponton and Eggermont (2001)</xref> argued that this provided evidence for a persistent immaturity in layer II of primary auditory cortex for children with congenital profound SNHL who were fitted (albeit often late) with CIs. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Singh et al. (2004)</xref> measured the P1-N2 and MMN responses to /ba/-/da/ of 35, 7- to 17-year-old children with bilateral profound SNHL who had been fitted with CIs between 1 and 10 years. Following implantation, participants’ hearing sensitivity was between 30–40 dB HL (i.e. equivalent to a mild SNHL) and, unlike in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ponton et al. (2000b)</xref>, stimuli were presented free-field at 75 dB SPL. As is typical for children with a hearing age of ≤10 years, ERP responses were dominated by a large positivity (P1) around 100 ms post-stimulus onset, followed by a large negativity (N2) peaking at around 240 ms. However, none of the children with CIs showed a significant N1, and only 10 (29%) showed an MMN.</p><p>Like children with severe-to-profound SNHL, those with MMHL also experience reduced and degraded auditory input. However, the few studies that have assessed LAERs and MMRs for children with MMHL have yielded inconsistent results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rance et al. (2002)</xref> measured unaided P1-N1-P2 responses to speech (synthesised /dæd/) and nonspeech (440 Hz pure tone) sounds in 18, 3-to-9-year-old children with SNHL, of which five had MMHL. All the children with MMHL showed ERP responses to both stimulus types, the amplitude and latency of which did not differ from those of NH controls. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martinez et al. (2013)</xref> recorded the acoustic change complex (ACC) to changes in vowel height and place contrasts in five 2–6 year-old children with MMHL. Robust and age-appropriate P1-N2 responses were observed in all but one of the children with MMHL whilst they were wearing their hearing aids. Of the two children who were also tested with their hearing aids turned off, one showed an ACC response that was markedly reduced, while the other failed to show a response at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martinez et al., 2013</xref>). To our knowledge, only one study has examined the effects of congenital MMHL on both the LAER and the MMN in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koravand et al., 2013</xref>). The unaided ERPs of 12, 9–12 year-old children with MMHL were compared to those of 16 NH, age-matched controls. Stimuli were speech (synthesized /ba/ and /da/), simple nonspeech (1- and 2-kHz pure tones), and speech-like complex nonspeech sounds (acoustic transformations of /ba/ and /da/), presented between 80–100 dB HL for children with MMHL. Whereas all children showed P1 and N2 components, N1 and P2 responses were absent in almost half of the children with MMHL, compared to only a quarter of NH controls. The amplitude and latency of P1 and the MMN did not differ between children with MMHL and NH controls. However, across all stimuli, the N2 was significantly smaller (but not later) in children with MMHL. The authors concluded that reduced N2 amplitude may be a neurophysiological marker of central auditory processing deficits in children, including those with MMHL.</p><p>It is not immediately apparent why some studies have observed age-appropriate LAERs in children with MMHL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rance et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martinez et al., 2013</xref>), while others have not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koravand et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is notable that where differences have been reported, these have been confined to older (9–12 year-old; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koravand et al., 2013</xref>) rather than younger (2–9 year-old; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rance et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martinez et al., 2013</xref>) children. Interestingly, delayed and diminished N1, N2, and MMN responses to speech sounds have also been observed in adults with MMHL, particularly at lower stimulus intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oates et al., 2002</xref>). One possible interpretation of these findings therefore is that, as for severe-to-profound SNHL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ponton et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ponton et al., 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ponton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ponton et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ponton and Eggermont, 2001</xref>), the effects of MMHL on the neural processing of sounds may only become apparent as children grow older.</p><p>The present study used a cross-sectional followed by longitudinal design to investigate the effects of MMHL on the development of LAERs and MMRs across mid-childhood and adolescence. At Time 1, we measured the LAERs and MMRs evoked by simple nonspeech, complex speech-like nonspeech, and speech stimuli for 46, 8–16 year-old children with MMHL (MM group) and 44 NH age-matched controls (NH group). Stimuli were presented at a constant intensity of 70 dB SPL, and children with MMHL were tested without their hearing aids in order to avoid stimulus alterations being introduced by the different hearing aid processors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billings et al., 2007</xref>). In order to evaluate developmental effects, children were divided into younger (Y; 8–11 years) and older (O; 12–16 years) age bands (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), consistent with reports of step-function changes in the LAER in NH children between those ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop et al., 2007</xref>). There were no differences in audiometric thresholds between the Y and O children with MMHL (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, whereas younger children with MMHL exhibited age-appropriate MMNs to all three stimulus conditions, the MMN was absent in older children with MMHL. At Time 2 (+ 6 years), we re-tested a subgroup (n = 13) of children from the MM-Y group from Time 1. Owing to the time-lag between experiments, these children were now aged 13–17 years (i.e., they would now qualify for the MM-O group from Time 1). Despite showing age-appropriate MMNs at the group level when they were younger, these children showed no MMN to nonspeech or speech-like sounds six years later. Our findings therefore suggest that MMHL in early-to-mid childhood leads to functional changes in auditory cortex that are predominantly reflected in the MMN, and that only emerge during adolescence.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46965.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pure-tone air-conduction audiometric thresholds (cross-sectional study).</title><p>Audiometric thresholds are shown across octave frequencies from 0.25 to 8 kHz for the MM (orange) and NH (blue and white) groups, Y (top row) and O (bottom row) age bands, and left (left column) and right (right column) ears.

For instance, the MM-O subgroup may have (a) been individually less likely to demonstrate MMNs to deviant sounds, (b) shown MMNs that were later or more variable in latency, or (c) shown MMNs that were reduced in amplitude, relative to their NH peers. To determine whether children in the MM-O subgroup were less likely to show an MMN to large deviants than NH children, presence or absence of a significant MMN or LDN was identified for each participant, for each condition (see Methods). Because MMRs are less reliable at the individual level, an adjusted value of p&lt;0.05 (one-tailed) for &gt;20 ms at adjacent time-points was used. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> also shows the percentage of children for each group, age band, and condition that showed a significant MMN or LDN to large deviants.

First, it is possible that the MM-O subgroup at Time 1 was disadvantaged relative to the MM-Y subgroup, perhaps reflecting a difference in the quality of, or access to, intervention between children born at an earlier time and those born later. Indeed, while the MM-Y and MM-O subgroups did not differ in severity of SNHL, age of detection, or age of aiding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), children in the MM-O subgroup were less likely to have or wear hearing aids than those in the MM-Y subgroup (see Methods and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, a higher proportion of those in the younger age band were born after the introduction of universal newborn hearing screening in the UK. Second, it is possible that MMHL in children leads to progressive degeneration in the structure and/or function of the auditory pathway.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, a subset of children from the initial MM-Y subgroup at Time 1 was re-tested 6 years later (Time 2). Owing to the time-lag between experiments, these children were all aged 14–17 years at Time 2 (i.e. they would now qualify for the MM-O subgroup of the cross-sectional study). Consequently, at Time 2, these children were referred to as the <italic>MM-YO</italic> subgroup. Crucially, the MM-YO subgroup were part of a larger group (MM-Y group from the cross-sectional study) that showed significant MMNs to large deviants at Time 1. Moreover, children in the MM-YO subgroup all wore hearing aids, and their audiometric thresholds did not deteriorate between test and re-test (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Children with MMHL were less likely to show LAER components than their NH peers (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koravand et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, when LAER components were present, P1 and P2 were slightly later, and N2 was smaller than those of NH controls (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koravand et al., 2013</xref>, for similar results regarding N2). Importantly, whereas younger (8–12 year-old) children with MMHL showed age-appropriate MMNs and LDNs to auditory oddball (large deviant) sounds, older (12–16 year-old) children with MMHL did not show MMNs, and only showed an LDN to speech. Longitudinal follow-up of a subset of children with MMHL partially replicated these findings; For nonspeech and speech-like stimuli, MMNs that were present at Time 1 (when children were 8–12 years old) were reduced or absent six years later (when children were 14–17 years old). However, older children with MMHL continued to show both an MMN and LDN to speech. Our results therefore demonstrate, for the first time in humans, that mild-to-moderate degradation of the auditory input during early-to-mid childhood can lead to changes in the neural processing of sounds in late childhood/adolescence.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Four interpretations of the ‘disappearing MMN’</title><p>The apparent absence of the MMN for older children with MMHL was somewhat surprising to us, hence our endeavour to replicate these findings in the form of the longitudinal follow-up. The fact that we partially did so, combined with consistent findings in the literature of reduced and delayed auditory MMNs in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oates et al., 2002</xref>), but not in 2–12 year-old children with MMHL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rance et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koravand et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martinez et al., 2013</xref>), leads us to consider four alternative explanations for our findings. First, it is possible that developmental changes to the MMN constitute neurophysiological markers for the auditory discrimination difficulties experienced by children with MMHL. The MMN is thought to reflect automatic, pre-attentive perceptual and short-term memory processes that underlie the detection of change in auditory patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Näätänen, 1990</xref>). The children with MMHL who participated in the cross-sectional study also performed more poorly than controls on a number of psychophysical auditory discrimination tasks, including those that involved stimuli almost identical to those used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halliday et al., 2019</xref>). It is therefore possible that the reduced/disappearing MMN reflected these difficulties. However, the behavioural discrimination abilities of these children did not generally worsen with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halliday et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the large deviants used in this study were readily discriminable at the behavioural level by all children with MMHL except one. Finally, the perseverance of the LDN (cross-sectional study) and MMN and LDN (longitudinal study) to speech in older children with MMHL suggests that some degree of neural discrimination remained present in this group. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the absent or reduced MMN in older children with MMHL reflects the auditory discrimination difficulties of this group.</p><p>Second, it is possible that the MMN results reflected differences in the LAER components elicited by the standards. The MMN is a differential wave, and therefore its presence is dependent upon the relative morphology of the two contributing waveforms. A possibility, therefore, is that the reduction in MMN amplitude resulted from a reduction in <italic>adaptation</italic> in response to an ongoing stimulus (the standard), for older children with MMHL. This argument has been put forward previously, notably for N1 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Picton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jääskeläinen et al., 2004</xref>; c.f. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garrido et al., 2009</xref>). However, we consider it unlikely that differences in the N1 differential waveform contributed to the present results, since N1 was not present in a high proportion of children, and the time window for the MMN in this study was more consistent with the latency of the N2. Nevertheless, contrary to the adaptation hypothesis, the N2 to standards was actually <italic>reduced</italic> in amplitude in children with MMHL. Moreover, older children with MMHL at Time 2 were less likely to show an N2 response than their younger selves. Therefore, it seems unlikely that reduced adaptation to standards could account for the reductions in MMN amplitude seen in older children with MMHL.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Effects of (in)audibility</title><p>A third possibility is that our results could be explained by the reduced sensation level at which children with MMHL received stimuli in the current study. LAER components and the MMN were less likely to be present in children with greater degrees of hearing loss and, where they were present, worse hearing thresholds were associated with smaller P1s and MMNs, and later N1s. Lack of audibility has been shown to result in significant changes to LAERs and MMN responses in both adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oates et al., 2002</xref>) and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharma et al., 2005</xref>) with SNHL, as well as in NH adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Whiting et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billings et al., 2007</xref>). However, in the present study, group differences in MMN amplitude were observed only for the older children with MMHL. Despite this, there were no differences in the audiometric thresholds of younger and older children with MMHL for the cross-sectional study, or between older children with MMHL and their younger selves for the longitudinal study. Unless the effects of audibility on the MMN change with age, it seems unlikely that a reduced sensation level for children with MMHL can account for our results.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional changes following mild-to-moderate hearing loss</title><p>Finally, it is possible that our findings reflect developmental changes in the function and/or structure of auditory cortex that emerge during adolescence following a period of permanent, MMHL during childhood. The EEG is thought to comprise an aggregate measure of post-synaptic potentials of pyramidal cells that are oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface, forming current dipoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006</xref>). These potentials oscillate rhythmically and synchronously within a given population of neurons in response to a stimulus, giving rise to measurable cortical ERPs. The auditory MMN has been shown to arise from the enhanced phase-synchronisation of neural oscillations in the theta (4–7 Hz) range to deviants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bishop and Hardiman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>), and is thought to have several generators, including bilateral temporal cortex, right inferior frontal gyrus, and bilateral frontal and centro-parietal regions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alho, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rinne et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Reductions in the MMN in older children with MMHL may therefore reflect either the reduced synchronisation of a given assembly of neurons responding to the detection of a deviant stimulus or, the same degree of synchronisation but in a smaller number of coherently activated neurons. However, these changes appear to relate to deviant stimuli only, and emerge with age; Normal cortical phase-synchrony to speech standards (/ba/) has been reported for young (Median age ~2.7 years) children with MMHL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nash-Kille and Sharma, 2014</xref>). The fact that reductions in the MMN are seen only for older children with MMHL likely reflects the prolonged maturational time-course of this response, which has been shown to extend into adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bishop et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>This explanation gains support from recent studies in gerbils that have shown that mild or moderate levels of hearing loss during early life can induce lasting changes to auditory cortical development (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sanes, 2016</xref> for a review). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takesian et al. (2012)</xref> found that early-induced bilateral mild-to-moderate conductive hearing loss led to a reduction in inhibitory synaptic strength in thalamo-cortical brain regions that persisted into adulthood, along with delays in the maturation of synaptic decay time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mowery et al. (2015)</xref> showed that even brief periods of mild, bilateral conductive hearing loss led to lasting changes in the membrane, firing properties, and inhibitory synaptic currents of auditory cortical pyramidal neurons. However, these changes only persisted if the auditory deprivation occurred during a discrete critical period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mowery et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mowery et al. (2017)</xref> reported that transient hearing loss caused an immediate imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory gain and reduced firing rate in auditory cortical neurons. Although these changes were reversed by the restoration of hearing in early life, adult gerbils continued to show such changes to neurons within the dorsal striatum, even after hearing was restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mowery et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>With regards to the present study, it is not clear whether the changes observed were attributable to the fact that the children with MMHL received intervention that was late (i.e., after the critical period), inconsistent, or inadequate. In humans with MMHL, a period of auditory deprivation is likely, especially for those with mild SNHL, who are currently not routinely detected by newborn hearing screening programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bamford et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carew et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, for the present study, age of detection ranged from 2 months to 14 years (M ~ 4.5 years), and age of hearing aid fitting from 3 months to 15 years (M ~ 5.4 years). Nevertheless, age of hearing aid fitting did not correlate with MMN amplitude in children with MMHL after controlling for severity of hearing loss (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is also possible that children with MMHL did not use their hearing aids consistently, leading to suboptimal outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scherer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Walker et al., 2013</xref>). Although we did not measure daily hearing aid use in the current study, we observed that for the cross-sectional study, three of the older children with MMHL had not been prescribed with hearing aids, and two were refusing to wear their hearing aids (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scherer, 1996</xref>). All of the children in the longitudinal study had been prescribed with hearing aids; However, we do not know how consistently they used them. Finally, even when children with MMHL do receive early and consistent remediation, hearing aids are unable to redress many of the perceptual consequences of SNHL, such as the broadening of auditory filters and changes in sensitivity to temporal fine structure and envelope cues (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halliday et al., 2019</xref>). This differs from the transient conductive hearing loss induced in animal studies, where hearing sensation is restored following earplug removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takesian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mowery et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mowery et al., 2017</xref>). Further research is needed to determine whether children with MMHL would benefit from earlier detection and intervention (in the form of hearing aids c.f. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carew et al., 2018</xref>), more consistent use of hearing aids, and/or improvements in signal quality, via enhancements to hearing aid processors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Speech as ‘special’?</title><p>A final finding of our study was that of a preserved LDN for the cross-sectional study, and both MMN and LDN for the longitudinal study, to speech stimuli for older children with MMHL. It is possible that these findings were due to differences in the spectral composition between the different stimuli (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For the nonspeech condition, discrimination between the standard and the large deviant depended on information contained within a very narrow region (of about 200 Hz) around 1 kHz. For the speech-like condition the relevant region was wider (between around 1–2 kHz). For the speech condition differences between the /ba/ standard and /da/ large deviant occurred across 0.5–4 kHz, although discrimination was likely to depend upon differences in the properties of the initial burst, along with the subsequent formant transitions. Better performance in the speech condition may therefore be explained in terms of the broader frequency range over which changes could be detected. An alternative possibility is that these findings reflect an increasing specialisation of auditory cortex to speech with age for children with MMHL. Consistent with this, the MM group from the cross-sectional study showed improvements in their behavioural speech discrimination thresholds with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halliday et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, a third possibility is that these findings were also a consequence of decreases in neural oscillatory synchronisation with age for children with MMHL. Contrary to the MMN, the LDN has been shown to reflect increased <italic>desynchronization</italic> of neural oscillations to deviants across delta, theta and alpha bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>). The LDN is more likely to be present for speech than nonspeech stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Korpilahti et al., 2001</xref>), and is more prominent for children than adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kraus et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheour et al., 2001</xref>). It has been argued that increases in cortical desynchronization reflect either a decrease in neural synchrony amongst underlying neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999</xref>), or the same synchrony but over a more focal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>). Reductions in neural inhibition have been shown to lead to increases in the variability of timings of neural oscillations, and a consequent loss of neural synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>). If the neurons of children with MMHL show reduced inhibition (as do those of gerbils with conductive hearing loss; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takesian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mowery et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mowery et al., 2017</xref>), this would be expected to lead to reductions in neural synchronisation (i.e., the MMN) following exposure to deviant stimuli. However, neural desynchronization (i.e., the LDN) may be expected to remain intact. Further research is needed to examine changes to the neural oscillations of children with MMHL in mid-to-late childhood.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our results provide evidence for functional changes in the neural processing of auditory stimuli during adolescence following early, childhood mild-to-moderate SNHL. These changes appear to manifest as a reduction in the MMN, a neural signature for change detection in auditory signals. It is possible that these changes may impede the extraction of regularities in the speech signal that are important for language-learning, perhaps accounting for the higher-than-expected presence of language difficulties in children with MMHL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halliday et al., 2017a</xref>). Earlier detection and treatment of MMHL may go some way towards mitigating the effects of MMHL on the developing auditory system in children.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cross-sectional study (Time 1)</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited as part of a larger study, which entailed psychophysical and electrophysiological measures of auditory processing, as well as psychometric assessments of language and cognitive functioning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halliday et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halliday et al., 2017b</xref>).

During this session, air-conduction BEPTA thresholds across octave frequencies from 0.25 to 8 kHz were verified using an Interacoustics AC33 audiometer according to recommended procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">British Society of Audiology, 2011</xref>). Information regarding children’s medical and audiological histories was collected via an in-house parent questionnaire. In addition, nonverbal IQ was assessed using the Block Design subtest of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wechsler, 1999</xref>). Children who failed to obtain an air-conduction BEPTA threshold equivalent to a MMHL, or a nonverbal IQ T-score of at least 40 (i.e. equivalent to an IQ standard score of 85), were excluded (n = 5). Moreover, those who failed to participate in all conditions of the study (n = 6) were also excluded. This left a final sample size of 46 children (19 mild, 27 moderate) for the MM group. A total of 43 had been prescribed with bilateral hearing aids, which were worn only during the psychometric assessments and some of the psychophysical assessments (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halliday et al., 2019</xref>), although two participants were refusing to use their aids. Age of confirmation of SNHL ranged from 2 months to 14 years (Median (Mdn) = 57 months, M = 54 months, SD = 36), and age of hearing aid fitting from 3 months to 15.6 years (Mdn = 64.5 months, M = 63.1 months, SD = 39.6). Audiograms are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Children in the MM group were individually matched in age (±6 months) to NH children from schools in the same geographical location (NH group; n = 44). In two instances, children from the MM group were matched to a single child from the NH group. No child in the NH group had a known history of hearing loss (including otitis media with effusion), educational difficulties, or speech and language problems (based on parent/guardian report). All achieved mean pure-tone-average (PTA) air-conduction thresholds of ≤20 dB HL, across octave frequencies 0.25–4 kHz in both ears, and obtained thresholds ≤ 25 dB HL at all octave frequencies from 0.25 to 8 kHz (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). All achieved a nonverbal IQ T-score (Block Design) of ≥40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wechsler, 1999</xref>).</p><p>In order to examine the developmental effects of MMHL on the LAER, MMN and LDN, both groups were further divided into two age bands based on a median split for the MM group (12.0 years), and roughly corresponding to known changes in the morphology of the LAER in children of this age range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Younger</italic> (Y) children were aged 8–11 years, and <italic>Older</italic> (O) children were aged 12–16 years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Participant characteristics of the two groups (MM vs NH) as a function of age band (Y vs O) are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. A series of univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) was conducted with group and age band as the two between-subjects variables and the group ×age band interaction included in the initial models, the latter being subsequently removed in instances where it was non-significant (this was true in all instances). Significance values were adjusted for multiple comparisons (α = 0.016). As expected, the MM group did not differ from the NH group in age [<italic>F</italic>(1, 85)=3.02, p=0.086, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.03] but had poorer BEPTA thresholds [<italic>F</italic>(1, 85)=341.35, p&lt;0.001, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.80]. However, the age at which children’s mothers’ left full-time education (<italic>maternal education</italic>; a measure of socio-economic status) just missed significance [<italic>F</italic>(1, 81)=3.45, p=0.066, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.04]. Unexpectedly, the MM group also had marginally lower nonverbal IQ relative to NH controls [<italic>F</italic>(1, 85)=9.68, p=0.003, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.10]. However, this was driven by the higher-than-expected nonverbal IQ of the NH group; The nonverbal IQ scores of the MM group were all within the normal range, and the mean T-score for this group (M = 55.6, SD = 8.7) was higher than the normative mean (M = 50; SD = 10; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Across groups, children in the Y and O age bands did not differ in maternal education [<italic>F</italic>(1, 81)=0.21, p=0.870, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.00], nonverbal IQ [<italic>F</italic>(1, 85)=2.41, p=0.124, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.03], or BEPTA thresholds [<italic>F</italic>(1, 85)=0.31, p=0.579, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> &lt;0.01].</p><p>Because we found differences in the neural responses of our MM-Y and MM-O subgroups, we also examined whether these subgroups differed in their audiological, cognitive, or demographic profiles. Children in the MM-Y and MM-O subgroups did not differ from each other in their BEPTA thresholds, [<italic>F</italic>(1, 44)=0.18, p=0.672, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.00], worse-ear pure-tone-average (WEPTA) thresholds [<italic>F</italic>(1, 44)=1.27, p=0.264, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.04], or mean (both ears) PTA (MePTA) audiometric thresholds [<italic>F</italic>(1, 44)=0.49, p=0.486, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.01]. Likewise, they did not differ in their age of detection of SNHL [<italic>t</italic>(43)=−0.85, p=0.400, <italic>d</italic> = 0.25] or age at which hearing aids were first prescribed [<italic>t</italic>(12.6)=0.56, p=0.582, <italic>d</italic> = 0.25]. However, a larger proportion of older than younger children did not have (n = 3 for MM-O subgroup) or did not wear (n = 2 for MM-O subgroup) hearing aids [Fisher’s Exact test, two-sided p=0.049]. Finally, children in the MM-Y subgroup had marginally but not significantly higher nonverbal IQ than those in the MM-O subgroup [<italic>F</italic>(1, 40)=3.90, p=0.055, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.09], but maternal education levels did not differ between groups [<italic>F</italic>(1, 40)=0.00, p&gt;0.10, <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.00].</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Procedure</title><p>A passive, two-deviant oddball paradigm (standard probability: 70%; small and large deviant probability: 15% each) was used. There were three conditions (nonspeech, speech-like, and speech), each divided into two sessions lasting approximately 5 min with a short break in between, leading to a total recording time of around 30 min (without breaks). Each of the conditions consisted of 660 stimuli presented with a stimulus-onset-asynchrony of 1 s. The order of conditions was counter-balanced across groups and age bands. During the recording, participants were comfortably seated in an electrically shielded, sound-attenuated booth. Stimuli were presented using Presentation software (Neurobehavioural systems, version 14.8.1) at a constant intensity of 70 dB SPL via insert earphones (Etymotic ER-2). Stimuli were presented to all children at the same level, and without any of the MM group using hearing aids. Participants watched a silent DVD during the recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Stimuli</title><p>Stimuli were taken from three continua, constructed for the psychophysical tests that were undertaken as part of the wider study (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halliday et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halliday et al., 2019</xref>). Stimuli are available on GitHub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calcus, 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/MMHL">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/MMHL</ext-link>). Stimuli were (a) sinusoidally frequency-modulated pure tones (nonspeech), (b) complex periodic tones with a vowel-like formant structure whose second formant was sinusoidally frequency-modulated (speech-like), and (c) consonant-vowel (CV) speech syllables (speech; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). All stimuli were 175 ms in duration, and both nonspeech and speech-like stimuli had a 15 ms linear on-off ramp. For all conditions, the difference between both the large deviant and the standard and the small deviant and the standard was clearly detectable during pilot testing (NH child listeners, n = 4). In addition, the difference between the large deviant and the standard was detectable during psychophysical testing by all but one child with MMHL in the cross-sectional study (the one with the highest BEPTA threshold; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halliday et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>For the nonspeech condition, one end of the continuum (the standard) was a 1-kHz pure tone, and the other was a sinusoid frequency-modulated at a rate of 40 Hz and a modulation depth of 10% (the large deviant; corresponding to a modulation index of 1). A continuum of 98 frequency-modulated stimuli was created between these two endpoints, all at a rate of 40 Hz, and ranging from a modulation index of 0.02 in 0.01 steps. The small deviant was chosen from these 98 stimuli, and had with a modulation depth of 1% (corresponding to a modulation index of 0.1). The initial phases of both the standard (non-modulated) and deviant (modulated) stimuli were 0°.</p><p>For the speech-like condition, stimuli were complex harmonic sounds, containing 50 equal-amplitude harmonics passed through three simple resonators. These resonators all had a bandwidth of 100 Hz, and centre frequencies of 500, 1500 and 2500 Hz, leading to an overall spectrum with three formants, characteristic of a neutral vowel (/ə/). The second formant (F2) was unmodulated for the standard. For the deviant stimuli, a continuum of 100 stimuli was created, with F2 modulated at a rate of 5.714 Hz, and the frequency deviation ranging from ±1 Hz to - ±200 Hz (the large deviant), spaced logarithmically. The small deviant had a frequency deviation of 20 Hz.</p><p>For the speech condition, the standard was a digitised /ba/ syllable and the large deviant was a digitised /da/ syllable. Both were spoken by a female speaker and identical to those used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop et al. (2010)</xref>. Consonant burst-time differences for these stimuli were minimised, with the intonation contours being equated using Praat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boersma and Weering, 2005</xref>) and the final stimuli being RMS equalised with Gold-Wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Craig, 2008</xref>). Thus, consonant change detection was primarily based on formant transitions into the vowel. A continuum of 98 stimuli was created in between the two endpoints, using the morphing capabilities of the programme STRAIGHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawahara et al., 1999</xref>). This programme uses pitch-adaptive spectral analysis including fundamental frequency extraction, combined with a surface reconstruction method to generate a smooth trajectory of high-quality stimuli. The small deviant was stimulus # 50 on the continuum (i.e. in the middle) and was perceived by the authors as sounding /ga/-like.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Data recording and analysis</title><p>EEG activity during audio presentation was recorded using a NuAmps 40-channel monopolar digital amplifier and NeuroScan 4.4 Acquire software system (Neuromedical Supplies) at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. The EEG was recorded from 28 scalp electrodes, positioned in the standard 10/20 configuration. Additional electrodes were placed on the mastoids, and above and below the left eye (Vertical EOG) and on the outer canthi of both eyes (Horizontal EOG) to monitor eye movements. Skin-to-electrode impedances were below 5 kΩ at the start of the recording and monitored to ensure they remained below 5 kΩ. The EEG signal was amplified with a gain of 20000 and band-pass filtered at 0.1–70 Hz.</p><p>EEG data were analysed offline using the EEGLAB toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delorme and Makeig, 2004</xref>) and custom Matlab software. The EEG was filtered using an FIR band-pass filter at 0.5–35 Hz, and re-referenced to the averaged mastoids. Data were epoched relative to stimulus onset using a −200 to 800 ms window and baseline corrected from −200 to 0 ms. Epochs containing artefacts were rejected (mean number rejected epochs across groups, age bands and conditions: 8.9 standards, 3.5 small deviants, 3.6 large deviants) from the final averages on the basis of a ± 100 µV criterion for all channels. Individual epochs were averaged separately for each of the three conditions, and for standards and deviants. Standards directly following a deviant were excluded from the average.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Identification of LAER components</title><p>For each participant, the LAER components P1, N1, P2, and N2 at Cz that were evoked by the standards for each condition were identified by two independent judges (including author OT). A third judge (author AC) made the final decision where there was disagreement between judges. All judges were experienced with clinical and research developmental EEG data. Cz was selected because it was where responses were largest overall, as is typical for this sort of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ponton et al., 2000a</xref>). Anonymized individual waveforms for each condition were presented to the judges, together with the grand-average NH waveform observed for the same condition for both the Y and O subgroups as a comparison point. Judges were blind to the participant group, age band, and stimulus condition for each waveform. Judges were required to indicate the presence/absence of each peak and, if present, their latency. For a response to be considered present, at least two out of the three judges had to agree on the peak latency of each component in the individual waveform. Consistency across the three judges reached 82% in the nonspeech condition, 74% in the speech-like condition, and 81% in the speech condition (consistency in line with those observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oates and Stapells, 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-6"><title>Identification of the MMN and LDN</title><p>Voltage maps confirmed that the MMN was strongest in the fronto-central region (at around 200 ms post-stimulus onset, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), as is typical for this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Näätänen et al., 2007</xref>). Statistical analyses for the MMN and LDN were therefore conducted on data recorded at electrode Fz. To calculate the MMN/LDN, the responses evoked by standards were subtracted from responses evoked by deviants for each participant for each condition. Differential waves were obtained separately for the small and large deviants.</p><p>The presence of a significant MMN or LDN was assessed in two ways. First, for each group and age band, point-to-point comparison of the differential wave amplitudes was performed in order to determine the latency period over which the waveforms were significantly different from zero, if any. One-sided <italic>t</italic>-tests were computed within the 100–400 ms post-stimulus-onset time window - identified as the region most likely to contain the MMN by visual inspection of the individual waveforms - with a sampling rate of 500 Hz. The 400–600 ms time window was selected for the LDN. Because adjacent points in the waveform are highly correlated potentially leading to spurious significant values in short intervals, an MMN/LDN was considered present when p&lt;0.01 (one-tailed) for &gt;20 ms at adjacent time-points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kraus et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGee et al., 1997</xref>). Next, this process was repeated at the individual level using the grand average waveforms obtained for each group, age band, and condition, with an <italic>ɑ</italic> level &lt;0.05 (one-tailed) for &gt;20 ms at adjacent time-points.</p><p>Amplitude of the MMN/LDN was calculated from the differential waveforms for each participant, condition, and deviant type. Amplitude of the MMN was defined as the mean amplitude (in μV) in a 50-ms window centred around the NH-group grand-average peak latency for the appropriate age band, condition, and deviant type (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table9">Appendix 1—table 9</xref>). Unlike the MMN, there was no clear overlap in the periods of significant LDN between groups of corresponding age bands (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>). Therefore, amplitude of the LDN was defined as the mean amplitude (in μV) in a 50-ms window centred around each group’s own grand-average peak latency in the given age band, condition and deviant type.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>A series of mixed-effects regression models was applied using the lme4 package of R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2014</xref>). Two sorts of analyses were conducted. Logistic mixed-effects regressions were conducted to determine whether group (NH vs. MM), age band (Y vs. O), condition (nonspeech, speech-like, and speech), component (P1, N1, P2, N2) or response (MMN or LDN) predicted the presence of a component/response. Linear mixed-effects regressions were conducted to determine whether those same independent variables predicted the amplitude (P1-N2, MMN, and LDN) or latency (P1-N2 only) of these components/responses. Starting from saturated models with listener as random intercepts, group, age band, condition, and component as main effects, and all two-, three- and four-way interactions included (which were treated as fixed-effect terms), predictors were removed iteratively if their removal did not significantly worsen the fit of each model. The most parsimonious models were selected using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Final models included only significant main effects and/or interactions, and Pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> (Nagelkerke) was used as an index of goodness-of-fit. Post-hoc analyses were <italic>t</italic>-tests, and results were reported after correction for multiple comparisons whenever necessary.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Longitudinal study (Time 2)</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Six years later (Time 2), we attempted to re-contact all of the 23 children who initially constituted the MM-Y group from the cross-sectional study (at Time 1) and who had given their permission to be re-contacted at a future point in time. Fourteen of these children were successfully re-contacted, and all were re-tested 6 years after their initial participation (Time 2). These children therefore constituted a relatively random sample from the original MM-Y subgroup of the cross-sectional study. Results from one child could not be included as their hearing had significantly deteriorated since Time 1. The remaining children (n = 13) comprised the MM-YO group for the longitudinal study.</p><p>Results from the MM-YO group were compared to those of three subgroups taken from the cross-sectional study: the MM-Y subgroup (i.e. themselves, 6 years previously), the MM-O subgroup (i.e. a different group of children with MMHL of a similar age), and the NH-O group (i.e. NH controls of a similar age). Note that the MM-Y group at Time 2 was created by selecting the subset of 13 children from Time 1 who also took part at Time 2. The complete sample from the original MM-O (n = 23) and NH-O (n = 18) subgroups were included as comparisons to maximise power.</p><p>Participant characteristics of the four subgroups (MM-Y, MM-YO, NH-O, MM-O) are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. Univariate ANOVA showed a main effect of subgroup on age [<italic>F</italic>(2, 85)=7.93, p&lt;0.001, <italic>η<sup>2</sup> = </italic>.23]; Owing to the time lag, the MM-YO subgroup was slightly older than both the MM-O and NH-O subgroups (on average by 1.4 years) [<italic>t</italic>(34)=3.92, p&lt;0.001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.31, CI (.78, 2.45), and <italic>t</italic>(29) = 2.65, p=0.013, <italic>d</italic> = 0.92, CI (0.29, 2.22), respectively]. Age was therefore used as a covariate in the analyses for the longitudinal study. The MM-YO subgroup did not differ from the MM-O or NH-O subgroups in nonverbal IQ [<italic>t</italic>(19.4)=−2.05, p=0.054, <italic>d</italic> = −0.77, and <italic>t</italic>(17.6) = −0.44, p=0.664, <italic>d</italic> = −0.17, respectively], or maternal education [<italic>t</italic>(24.8)=0.18, p=0.855, <italic>d</italic> = 0.06, and <italic>t</italic>(27.9) = −1.21, p=0.233, <italic>d</italic> = −0.43, respectively]. The MM-YO subgroup also did not differ in their BEPTA, WEPTA, or MePTA audiometric thresholds relative to the MM-Y subgroup at Time 1 [<italic>F</italic>(3, 22)=0.675, p=0.576], but did differ from the MM-O subgroup [<italic>F</italic>(3, 32)=3.22, p=0.035] (MANOVAs, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This was due to the MM-YO subgroup having marginally but non-significantly better BEPTA thresholds than the MM-O subgroup from Time 1 [t(32.7)=1.83, p=0.076, <italic>d</italic> = 0.572]. The MM-YO subgroup did not differ from the MM-O subgroup in age of detection [<italic>F</italic>(1, 19)=0.01, p=0.975] age of hearing aid fitting [<italic>F</italic>(1, 19)=0.09, p=0.756], or in the proportion of children wearing hearing aids [Fisher’s Exact test, two-sided p=0.136].</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Data recording and analysis</title><p>The experimental setup for stimulus presentation and EEG recording was identical to that used at Time 1, with two main differences. First, as the system was older, technical difficulties led to us to discard EEG activity recorded on the left mastoids. Therefore, data from the MM-YO subgroup was only re-referenced to the right mastoids. Second, some scalp channels appeared consistently faulty, hence increasing the noise floor at Time 2. Because the MMN typically displayed a fronto-central distribution for the cross-sectional study, we thus limited the artefact rejection to a threshold of ±100 µV criterion in either Cz or Fz. Data from the three other subgroups (MM-Y, MM-O, NH-O) were thus reprocessed using the same re-referencing and artefact rejection criterion as those applied to the MM-YO subgroup.</p><p>The numbers of rejected standard trials in each condition were compared between the MM-Y and MM-YO subgroups (i.e. within-subject) as an index of noise floor in the two studies. There was no significant difference in noise floor between studies in any of the three conditions [nonspeech: χ<sup>2</sup>(12)=13.3, p=0.420; speech-like: χ<sup>2</sup>(12)=7.73, p=0.800; speech: χ<sup>2</sup>(12)=20.3, p=0.120].</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all the children who participated in this study and their parents.

Starting from a saturated model with Listener as a random intercept, Group, Age band, Condition, and Component as main effects, and all two-, three- and four-way interactions included (which were treated as fixed-effect terms), predictors were removed iteratively if their removal did not significantly worsen the fit of the model.

Children from the MM group were less likely to have present components than children from the NH group [odds ratio (OR): 0.24, p&lt;1e<sup>−15</sup>]. The main effects of Age band and Component have to be considered in light of their interaction. Post-hoc logistic regressions conducted separately on each component revealed that for P1, N1 and N2, there was no significant effect of Age band on presence/absence, OR: 0.73, p=0.282, OR: 1.38, p=0.202, and OR: 0.66, p=0.174, respectively. However, P2, Age band was a significant predictor of component presence, OR: 1.71, p=0.038. Regardless of Group, P2 were more likely to occur in the O than the Y Age bands.</p><table-wrap id="app1table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46965.021</object-id><label>Appendix 1—table 1.</label><caption><title>Results of the logistic regression analyses for presence of LAER and MMRs components (cross-sectional study).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Component</th><th valign="top">Effects</th><th><italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic></th><th><italic>Df</italic></th><th><italic>p</italic></th><th valign="top"><italic>R<sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub></italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">LAERs</td><td valign="top">Age band</td><td valign="top">2.60</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">.106</td><td valign="top">.014</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><bold>Group</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>96.6</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>1</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>&lt; .001</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>.125</bold></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><bold>Component</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>225.8</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>3</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>&lt; .001</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>.250</bold></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><bold>Age band × Component</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>9.58</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>3</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>.022</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>.011</bold></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">MMN</td><td valign="top"><bold>Group</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>7.39</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>1</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>.007</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>.033</bold></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">LDN</td><td valign="top">Group</td><td valign="top">1.33</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">.247</td><td valign="top">.007</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><italic>Note.</italic> The best fitting models for LAERs and MMRs presence were all an acceptable fit (LAERs [AIC = 1181, <italic>R<sup>2</sup><sub>c=</sub></italic>0.335]; MMN [AIC = 369.4, <italic>R<sup>2</sup><sub>c=</sub></italic>0.033]; LDN [AIC = 243.2, <italic>R<sup>2</sup><sub>c=</sub></italic>0.009]).

The best fitting model included only Age band as a main effect [χ<sup>2</sup>(1)=4.29, p=0.039, AIC = 107.1, R<sup>2</sup><sub>c</sub> = .061], thus confirming our hypothesis that children in the MM-YO group were less likely to show an MMN than their younger selves (MM-Y), OR = 0.38, p=0.039.</p><p>Second, to determine whether the amplitude of the MMN decreased with age in children with MMHL, a series of within-subjects linear mixed models was run with Age band (MM-Y vs. MM-YO), Condition, and their interaction as predictors for MMN amplitude (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table8">Appendix 1—table 8</xref>). The final model contained a significant main effect of Age band only [χ<sup>2</sup>(1)=4.80, R<sup>2</sup><sub>c</sub> = .000]. MMN amplitude was significantly smaller in the MM-YO subgroup than in the MM-Y subgroup (p=0.028).</p><p>Third, to assess whether children in the MM-YO subgroup were less likely to show an MMN compared to those from Time 1, a between-subject logistic regression was performed across the three older groups of children (MM-YO, MM-O, NH-O) as a function of Condition (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table8">Appendix 1—table 8</xref>). The best fitting model included only Group as a significant predictor [<italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic>(2)=16.98, p&lt;0.001, <italic>AIC</italic> = 212.9, <italic>R<sup>2</sup><sub>c</sub></italic>=0.112]. Children in the NH-O were more likely (OR = 5.71, <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic>(1)=15.65, p&lt;0.001) to show an MMN than children in the MM-YO group, whereas children in the MM-YO and MM-O subgroups did not differ (OR = 1.83, <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic>(1)=0.22, p=0.141).</p><p>Finally, to assess whether children in the MM-YO subgroup showed an MMN that was reduced in amplitude relative to the two other older groups of children, a series of linear mixed-effect analyses was run comparing the amplitude of the MMN evoked in the MM-YO, MM-O, and NH-O subgroups as a function of Condition (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table8">Appendix 1—table 8</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Barbara Shinn-Cunningham as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dan H Sanes (Reviewer #2); David Moore (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The purpose of this project was to investigate the neural processing of sounds across development in children with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss using EEG. This is particularly important because much of our knowledge to-date is based on either more severe forms of hearing deprivation and/or cross-sectional studies, so examining auditory responses longitudinally in children with mild-to-moderate hearing loss is an important feature. The results suggest children with mild-to-moderate hearing loss show changes in amplitude and latency in MMN components.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The potential influence of audiometric thresholds on the measures was not adequately addressed (this covers both the stimulus level and degree of hearing loss). Stimuli were delivered at the same level to all children, regardless of hearing loss, and participants who had hearing aids did not wear them. It is true that (putting aside the hearing aid issue for a moment) a constant level to all listeners reflects &quot;real world&quot; listening conditions. At the same time, it substantially weakens the claim about &quot;brain alterations&quot; if the brains are getting stimulated differently. That is, would the brains of older MMHL children produce control-like amplitudes if stimulated at a sufficient SPL? Or, perhaps easier to look at, would listeners with normal hearing produce smaller amplitudes if stimulated at a lower SPL? The critical question is whether the results represent a shift due to simply being at a different place along a stimulation curve, or a fundamental change in brain processing due to hearing impairment.</p><p>2) Age is an important factor that was not adequately addressed. For example, if there were hearing changes with age (as might be expected in children with early onset mild-moderate hearing loss) these hearing changes could explain your findings. A clearer examining of how BEPTA shifts with age would be useful, but more helpful would be (a) plotting audiograms for each group and (b) considering information not contained in the BEPTA. Relatedly, what looks like rather parallel performance for the MMHL and NH groups in Figure 3 seems to contradict the idea that effects might be age-dependent. These are some specific examples of a broader need for more clarity on age effects and how these can be accounted for in the results and interpretation.</p><p>3) The role of hearing aids needs to be better addressed in interpretation of the results, above the potential contribution to presentation level (point 1). For example, what was the duration of hearing aid use? And how consistently did they use their hearing aids? There is evidence that adolescents tend not to use their hearing aids (e.g., Scherer, 1996), while in children up to age 7, increasing age predicts more consistent hearing aid use (Walker et al., 2013). It is therefore possible that the consistency of treatment that is being received for their hearing loss is also a defining difference between the two age bands in both the cross-sectional and the longitudinal components of this study.</p><p>4) In some instances, the descriptions of results in the text did not clearly line up with the data displayed in the figures. For example, a sentence at the end of the Introduction &quot;Despite showing age-appropriate MMNs at the time of Experiment 1, these children showed MMNs that were reduced or absent by Experiment 2.&quot; is not in accord with a sentence in the description of the results of Experiment 2 &quot;In the Speech condition, a significant MMN remained in the MM-YO group.&quot; Perhaps some of the confusion comes from referring to different conditions in different contexts; however, there was an overall sense of a lack of clarity in the presentation of the results (along with sympathy that there are a lot of variables to look at here). Please clarify the results presentation and make sure the text descriptions clearly line up with results figures as presented.</p><p>5) Duration of the analysis window. The analyses focus on the waveforms within the first 400 ms after stimulus onset, but there also appear to be potentially interesting group differences between the waveforms 400-600 ms post-stimulus-onset, particularly for the speech stimuli. Clearer justification for this choice (or better still, an analysis of other time windows) would be useful here.</p><p>6) Data and stimuli availability. Even in the absence of ethics approval for sharing personally identifiable information, summary measures should be shareable, as should stimuli used in the experiment. For example, age group, hearing status, and BEPTA figure prominently in the analyses. Similarly the latency and amplitude measures extracted from the raw data don't pose any risk of personal identification.

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) affects not only the absolute hearing thresholds of affected individuals, but also their dynamic range. That is, many individuals with SNHL experience loudness recruitment for high intensity stimuli, meaning that listeners may not tolerate stimuli at intensities that are matched for sensation level (SL) with those of normally hearing (NH) listeners. Moreover, since the participants tested here were children, we were particularly keen to avoid causing further damage to the residual hearing they had. The result of this is that, in practice, it is very difficult to match the SL of stimuli experienced by children with MMHL to that experienced by NH controls.</p><p>One potential way round this would have been to present NH children with lower-intensity stimuli that were matched for SL to those experienced by the MMHL group. However, this again is not straightforward, for three reasons. First, because BEPTA thresholds for children with MMHL range from 21-70 dB HL, there was no consistent SL for participants in the MMHL group. Second, because audiometric thresholds varied between ears for some children with MMHL, there was no consistent between-ear SL for participants in the MMHL group. Third, because audiometric thresholds varied across frequencies for participants in the MMHL, there was no consistent across-frequency SL for this group. The consequence of this was that in order to control for SL, we would have needed to match each individual child with MMHL to a NH child of the same age, and present the latter with stimuli that were shaped in intensity across frequencies and ears. It remains our view that this would have introduced too many moving parts to what was already a complex study.</p><p>That said, in a more recent (as yet unpublished) study we have examined the effects of amplification on the MMN in children with MMHL. In this study, 18, 8-to-16 year-old children with MMHL, and 15 NH age-matched controls were tested. Electrophysiological measures were recorded in response to the same standard (probability: 90%) and large (but not small) deviant speech stimuli that were used in the current study. There were however a few methodological differences to the present study, the main one being that for children with MMHL, stimuli were presented both unamplified (70 dB SPL) and with a simulated, personalised amplification (NAL-R formula, limited at 85 dB SPL). NH children were only presented with the unamplified condition. Importantly, preliminary results from this study provide important insights regarding the interpretation of the study reported here. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> represents the differential wave (i.e., standards minus deviants) for the MMN observed in NH children presented with unamplified stimuli (left panel), children with MMHL presented with unamplified stimuli (middle panel), and children with MMHL presented with amplified stimuli (right panel). Whereas an MMN was found to be present in a large portion of the response for NH controls, this was not the case for children with MMHL, regardless of whether the stimuli were presented unamplified or amplified. The lack of an MMN in the amplified condition strengthens our claim that MMHL leads to fundamental changes in neural processing and that these findings are not simply the result of differences in the amount of stimulation being received.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46965.031</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46965-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Age is an important factor that was not adequately addressed.

Regarding the cross-sectional study, Figure 1 now shows audiometric thresholds (0.25-8 kHz for left and right ears) for children with MMHL compared to NH controls, plotted separately for the younger and older age bands. This illustrates that there were no differences in audiometric thresholds between younger and older children, whatever their group. We now also include statistics to that effect (see Table 1 and subsection “Cross-sectional study (Time 1): Participants”, last paragraph) which report that the MM-O subgroup did not differ from the MM-Y subgroup in BEPTA thresholds, worse ear (WEPTA) thresholds, or mean PTA (MePTA) thresholds. Regarding the longitudinal study, audiometric thresholds for the MM-YO group at Time 1 and Time 2 are now reported in Figure 10—figure supplement 1 and Table 2, and statistical analyses in the last paragraph of the subsection “Longitudinal study (Time 2): Participants”. The MM-YO group did not differ in their BEPTA, WEPTA, or MePTA thresholds between Time 1 and Time 2.</p><p>Upon performing these analyses, we also decided to see if the groups also differed on any other audiological measures that we had taken. For the cross-sectional study, the MM-Y and MM-O subgroups did not differ in their age of detection of SNHL, nor in the age at which they were first fitted with hearing aids (see Table 1 and the aforementioned paragraph). However, children in the MM-O subgroup were less likely to have or wear hearing aids (78%) than children in the MM-Y subgroup (100%). Note though that this difference does not apply in the case of the longitudinal study where children in the MM-YO group (all of whom wore hearing aids) were compared to themselves.</p><p>Regarding what was Figure 3 in the original submission (now Figure 4—figure supplement 3), as we report in the manuscript, we did not find an interaction between group and age on the latency or amplitude of any of the LAER components (i.e., on P1, N1, P2, N2), where present (see “LAERs and MMNs, but not LDNs, are smaller or later for children with MMHL, when present” and Appendix—table 4). Nor did we see an interaction between group and age regarding the presence/absence of any of the LAER components (see “Children with MMHL show reduced presence of LAER components to sounds”). Rather, our findings suggest that any group × age interaction may be specific to the MMN; namely, that the MMN is (a) less likely to be present at the group level, and (b) where present, is likely to be smaller, in older children with MMHL compared to age-matched NH controls (see Figure 5). Efforts have been taken to improve the clarity of the manuscript for this revision, particularly with regard to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The role of hearing aids needs to be better addressed in interpretation of the results, above the potential contribution to presentation level (point 1).

Regarding the consistency of hearing aid use in the MM groups, unfortunately we do not have much data on this as we were not able to access hearing aid logs, and parent report measures of hearing aid use have been shown to be unreliable (Munoz, Preston, and Hicken, 2014, Journal of the American Academy of Audiology 25(4):380-7). Nonetheless, there was some evidence for lower uptake of hearing aids in the MM-O subgroup at Time 1, in that three children in this group had not been prescribed with hearing aids, and two were refusing to wear their hearing aids. However, this may reflect a historical point in time; children in this subgroup were born before the UK national roll-out of the Universal Newborn Hearing Screening Programme. All of the children in the MM-Y subgroup at Time 1 had been prescribed with hearing aids, and all were wearing them at Time 2, although again, we do not know how consistently. We now include some discussion about this in the Discussion section (subsection “Functional changes following mild to moderate hearing loss”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In some instances, the descriptions of results in the text did not clearly line up with the data displayed in the figures.
