all living cells, including amino acids, co-factors and vitamins. However, current understanding of the cellular delivery of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> at the molecular level is limited. CysZ has been described as a SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> permease, but its sequence family is without known structural precedent. Based on crystallographic structure information, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> binding and flux experiments, we provide insight into the molecular mechanism of CysZ-mediated translocation of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> across membranes. CysZ structures from three different bacterial species display a hitherto unknown fold and have subunits organized with inverted transmembrane topology. CysZ from <italic>Pseudomonas denitrificans</italic> assembles as a trimer of antiparallel dimers and the CysZ structures from two other species recapitulate dimers from this assembly.

It is a vital component of several essential compounds, including the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine, in prosthetic groups such as the Fe-S clusters, as well as vitamins and micronutrients such as biotin (vitamin H), thiamine (vitamin B1) and lipoic acid, and in coenzymes A and M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barton, 2005</xref>). Whilst mammals obtain the majority of the necessary sulfur-containing metabolites directly from the diet, plants, fungi, and bacteria are able to assimilate and utilize sulfur from organic and inorganic sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barton, 2005</xref>). Sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) is the most abundant source of sulfur in the environment and its utilization is contingent upon its entry into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kertesz, 2000</xref>). In certain fungi, and prokaryotes, once internalized, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is first reduced to sulfite (SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>), and then further to sulfide (S<sup>2-</sup>), a form that can be used by the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kredich et al., 1979</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and other gram-negative bacteria, the culmination of the aforementioned sulfate assimilatory (also known as reductive) pathway is the formation of cysteine by the addition of S<sup>2-</sup> to O-acetylserine by cysteine synthase, followed by the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kredich, 1971</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In prokaryotes, the entry of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> into the cell is mediated by four known families of dedicated transport systems: the ABC sulfate transporter complexes SulT or CysTWA, the SulP family of putative SLC13 sodium:sulfate or proton:sulfate symporters or SLC26 solute:sulfate exchangers, the phosphate transporter-like CysP/PitA family, and the CysZ family classified as SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> permeases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilar-Barajas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hryniewicz et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kertesz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loughlin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mansilla and de Mendoza, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sirko et al., 1995</xref>). CysZ family members are 28‚Äì30 kDa bacterial inner-membrane proteins found exclusively in prokaryotes with no apparent homology to any of the established channel or transporter folds, and are scarcely studied in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The <italic>cysZ</italic> gene owes its name to its presence in the cysteine biosynthesis regulon. In two reports from thirty years ago, an <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain with a <italic>cysZ</italic> deletion showed a severe impairment in its ability to accumulate SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and was not viable in sulfate-free media without an alternate sulfur source such as thiosulfate (S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Britton et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parra et al., 1983</xref>). More¬†recently, a third report studying the functional properties of CysZ, concluded that the protein from <italic>E. coli</italic> functions as a high affinity, highly specific pH-dependent SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> transporter, directly regulated by the toxic, assimilatory pathway intermediate, SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the role of CysZ in cellular sulfate uptake at a molecular level, we have undertaken an approach that combines structural and functional studies. To this end, we determined the crystal structures of CysZ from three species, <italic>Idiomarina loihiensis (Il; IlCysZ)</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas fragi (Pf; PfCysZ),</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas denitrificans (Pd; PdCysZ)</italic>, and characterized CysZ function in purified form, predominantly in reconstituted proteoliposomes, but also in cells, and to a lesser extent, in planar lipid bilayers. Combining the structural information from the three orthologs reveals that CysZ features a novel protein fold that assembles as oligomers with an inverted transmembrane topology. This arrangement can be understood as being derived from trimers of dimers akin to the hexameric assembly captured in one of the structures. Interpreting the functional data in a structural context has allowed us to formulate a mechanistic model for CysZ-mediated SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> translocation across the bacterial cytoplasm membrane.</p><p>Both the structures and the functional properties of CysZ proteins are distinct from those of any known membrane transporter or ion channel. Besides not resembling other transporter structures, CysZ mediates sulfate flux into cells or proteoliposomes without coupling to ion gradients, partner proteins, or exogenous energy sources such as ATP. These distinctive properties make CysZ appealing as a model system for studies of biophysical principles of membrane protein biogenesis and transmembrane ion passage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure determination of CysZ</title><p>Following a structural genomics approach aimed at crystallization for structural analysis, we cloned and screened a total of 63 different bacterial homologs of CysZ for high-level expression and stability in detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Love et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mancia and Love, 2011</xref>). Crystal structures were determined for CysZ from three organisms. Chronologically, the structure of <italic>Il</italic>CysZ was the first solved, to 2.3 √Ö resolution in space group <italic>C2</italic> by SAD, initially based on a single selenate ion bound to the protein and subsequently also by selenomethione derivatization (SeMet) SAD, and multi-crystal native SAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). The structure of <italic>Pf</italic>CysZ was solved second, to 3.5 √Ö resolution, with crystals also belonging to space group <italic>C2.</italic> Although <italic>Pf</italic>CysZ and <italic>Il</italic>CysZ share 42% sequence identity, molecular replacement failed to find a convincing solution, and we instead used SeMet-derivatized <italic>Pf</italic>CysZ to obtain phase information by multi-crystal SeMet SAD. Third, we determined the structure of <italic>Pd</italic>CysZ, which crystallized in multiple forms belonging to space groups <italic>P6<sub>3</sub>, P4<sub>1</sub>22</italic> and <italic>P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub></italic>, revealing the same architecture and oligomeric assembly each time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 2b</xref>). <italic>Pd</italic>CysZ structures in the <italic>P6<sub>3</sub></italic> and <italic>P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub></italic> lattices each contain an entire hexamer in their asymmetric units, whereas a molecular diad coincides with a crystallographic axis in the <italic>P4<sub>1</sub>22</italic> lattice. We focused our analysis on the best of these (3.4 √Ö resolution in <italic>P6<sub>3</sub></italic>). The location of the selenium sites was obtained from a SeMet SAD data set, and the structure was solved by combining the resulting SAD phases with those from a molecular replacement solution obtained by positioning the <italic>Pf</italic>CysZ model (75% sequence identity) onto SeMet fiducials in the initial electron density map (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref

In fact, calculations of the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> accumulation in the <italic>Pd</italic>CysZ-containing proteoliposomes at the peak of the uptake (at 15 s) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> reveal that the internal concentration of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is only¬†~5 fold higher than that of the externally added SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, whereas it is¬†~3 fold elevated at the plateau (120 s), revealing non-concentrative SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> flux by CysZ that is representative for a channel-like mode of action (see Materials¬†and¬†methods for details).

Potassium flux-generated membrane potentials of different polarity were imposed by adding the potassium ionophore valinomycin, revealing that hyperpolarization of the proteoliposomes (inside-negative membrane potentials) did not markedly increase CysZ-mediated SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> flux into the proteoliposomes. However, depolarization (inside positive) caused about a 40 % increase in the uptake activity of all three CysZ isoforms at a K<sub>in</sub>/K<sub>out</sub> distribution of 1:100 (producing a theoretical Nernst membrane potential of +118 mV [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>]).</p><p>To further characterize the interaction of CysZ with both SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, we performed binding experiments with detergent-solubilized and purified CysZ using the scintillation proximity assay (SPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quick and Javitch, 2007</xref>) as well as micro-scale thermophoresis (MST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seidel et al., 2013</xref>).

Competing binding of [<sup>35</sup>S]O<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> with increasing concentrations of SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> revealed that CysZ binds SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> with about 4-fold greater apparent affinity as reflected by a half-maximum inhibition constant (<italic>IC<sub>50</sub></italic>) of 0.74¬†¬±¬†0.23 mM for <italic>Pd</italic>CysZ, 0.60¬†¬±¬†0.21 mM for <italic>Pf</italic>CysZ, and 0.56¬†¬±¬†0.20 mM for <italic>Il</italic>CysZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>).

This SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-binding site is in the loop between helices H1 and H2, with the motif GLR(R) being well conserved among the CysZ family.

The sequence of CysZ, coding for an integral membrane protein with four predicted TM segments, shows no resemblance to any other known protein. This, and the quest to set the basis for a mechanistic understanding of function, prompted us to investigate the structure of CysZ.</p><p>We present here three structures of CysZ from different species, all determined by x-ray crystallography. These structures are all similar, showing a novel fold comprising two extended TM helices and two hemi-penetrating helical hairpins, giving rise to a tripod-like shape within the membrane, and a hydrophilic head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3c</xref>). Two of the structures (<italic>Il</italic>CysZ and <italic>Pf</italic>CysZ) show dimers in the crystals, albeit with different interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>), and the third structure (<italic>Pd</italic>CysZ) displays a hexameric assembly in multiple crystal forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p>All three structures have a dimeric component, each of which is present in the hexameric arrangement present in all the crystal forms of <italic>Pd</italic>CysZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>), showing how they are all related. Furthermore, <italic>Il</italic>CysZ can be crosslinked in membranes to the alternative <italic>Pf</italic>CysZ dimer by engineering of disulfide cysteine mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>), which suggests that <italic>Il</italic>CysZ can adopt both of the dimer assemblies observed in the <italic>Pd</italic>CysZ hexamer. Thus, we hypothesize that CysZ is a hexamer in nature, as observed in <italic>Pd</italic>CysZ, consistent with the fact that all CysZs studied here exhibit essentially the same functional properties. In the case of <italic>Il</italic>CysZ and <italic>Pf</italic>CysZ, this assembly may have come apart into the subsequently crystallized dimeric components during the process of detergent extraction from the membrane and purification. This could be explained by the unusually labile, and conformationally-flexible, nature of the H4b-H5a helical hairpin of CysZ, with only one pair of stabilizing TM helices per protomer (H2-H3). We presume that the hexamer is maintained with the support and scaffolding of the lipid bilayer.</p><p>CysZ shows an inverted transmembrane arrangement, which we confirmed with cross-linking experiments on membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>). Antiparallel insertion is fairly uncommon in membrane proteins; however, reported cases include the well-documented EmrE, a multi-drug resistant export protein that inserts into the membrane as an anti-parallel dimer, and the more recently discovered and studied family of double-barreled ‚ÄòFluc‚Äô fluoride channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amadi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Korkhov and Tate, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rapp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Functional characterizations of the three CysZs for which we have obtained structural information show that all three mediate SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> flux and that this flux is inhibited by SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, thus supporting previously reported data on <italic>E. coli</italic> CysZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). However, in contrast to what was observed for <italic>E. coli</italic> CysZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), our data indicate that SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> flux by <italic>Pd</italic>CysZ, <italic>Pf</italic>CysZ and <italic>Il</italic>CysZ is not thermodynamically coupled to the proton gradient (i.e., H<sup>+</sup>/SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> symport) or the Na<sup>+</sup> gradient (i.e., Na<sup>+</sup>/SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> symport) but rather reflect the non-concentrative flux of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> characteristic of a passive, channel-like translocation mechanism. However, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> flux in CysZ-containing proteoliposomes differed from the ohmic <italic>I-V</italic> relationship indicative of a single ion-selective channel in that it was not affected by hyperpolarization (inside negative), but depolarization of the proteoliposomes (inside positive) led to an increased inward flux of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Thus, we contemplate that CysZ SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> flux activity may involve co-permeation of other ions with Na<sup>+</sup> being the most likely for our experimental conditions. Our electrophysiological measurements of purified CysZ incorporated into a lipid bilayer did not aim to assess permeability ratios of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and other ions, i.e., for Na<sup>+</sup>, symmetric Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solutions were used in the experiments.</p><p>Building on our functional and structural discoveries, our results suggest a fascinating hypothesis for mechanisms of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> transfer and regulation. There is a conserved central core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), which is likely to have a structural role. Close to this lies a sulfate-binding site, with functional implications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), and the entrance to a putative pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). The entrance of this putative pore is delineated by a hydrophilic network of conserved residues that form a tight constriction in our observed conformation. Following this hypothetical route, sulfate ions that might enter through the three separate pores, one per CysZ dimer pair, would converge into a central hydrophobic cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7‚Äîfigure supplement 1c,d</xref>). Once sulfate ions enter this central cavity, due to the unfavorable environment, these are likely to exit it rather rapidly through one of the three available exit pores on the cytoplasmic side of the hexamer. Hydrophobic cavities and pores are seen commonly in ion channels, with examples ranging from the well documented hydrophobic inner pores of the various potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>) to the SLAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) and bestrophin anion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), and the MscS and MscL mechanosensitive channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anishkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bass et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Birkner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>), facilitating the rapid passage of ions due to the unfavorable environment, as well as potentially providing a means of ‚Äòhydrophobic gating‚Äô (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aryal et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The surface electrostatics of CysZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6c,d</xref>) draw attention to the negative potential of the conserved core of each protomer, which is then surrounded by a more neutral annulus. While this feature seems contradictory to admission of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions at the extracellular side, it could be advantageous for expulsion into the cytoplasm on the opposite side. In any case, the structures that we have determined are evidently in a closed state, implying that a conformational change would have to occur to allow passage of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, likely modifying the surface electrostatics of the protein. It is tempting to speculate that the regulation of the opening of the pore could be modulated by the binding of sulfate ions to the identified sulfate-binding site, as it is near the entrance of the putative pore. L22 lies in proximity of the entrance of the putative pore, and its backbone amide (along with G21) coordinates the sulfate ion in the GLR motif of the sulfate-binding site. Thus, the binding of sulfate to the GLR motif could trigger a conformational change needed to displace L22, allowing for a wider opening for the sulfate ions to enter the pore. Sulfite could hypothetically exert its inhibitory effect on CysZ function by binding to this site.</p><p>There is an overall electropositive region in the center of the hexameric molecule, when viewed from the top (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6c,d</xref>). This central region is lined by conserved residues along helices H4b-H5a, namely, R129, R133 and K137. The hydrophobic tips of helices H4b-H5a of the three protomers on each side of the membrane then converge in the center of the hexamer. A pore through the three-fold axis of the hexamer could provide an alternative passageway for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions through this assembly.</p><p>We observe, in agreement with previous data, that SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> inhibits CysZ-mediated SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1a,f</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The antiparallel nature of CysZ could provide a means for internal as well as external regulation. However, experiments in solutions ‚Äì such as crystallizations ‚Äì where all molecules are exposed to the same chemical environment, makes capturing such a state in an open or SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> blocked conformation challenging. Despite this limitation, our CysZ structures and associated functional experiments have allowed us to make substantial progress in the understanding SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> uptake by these membrane permeases.

Selenate substructure determination was performed with the SHELXD program through HKL2MAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pape and Schneider, 2004</xref>). A resolution cut-off at 2.6 √Ö was used for finding Se sites by SHELXD. A strong peak found by SHELXD was used to calculate initial SAD phases, which were improved by density modification by SHELXE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sheldrick, 2010</xref>). With a solvent content of 65% corresponding to two molecules in the asymmetric unit, 50 cycles of density modification resulted in an electron density map of sufficient quality for model building. The initial polypeptide chain was built by Arp/Warp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langer et al., 2008</xref>), at 2.1 √Ö by using experimental phases. Further cycles of model building were performed manually using COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) and all rounds of refinements were performed with PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). The native structure of CysZ with bound sulfate was determined both by multi-crystal native SAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) (final resolution of 2.3 √Ö) and by molecular replacement with the selenate bound model (final resolution of 2.1 √Ö). In addition, phase information obtained from Se-Met derivatized protein with 9 Se sites per CysZ molecule, verified our model obtained from the selenate data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title><italic>Pf</italic>CysZ</title><p>Multi-crystal SeMet-SAD data sets were collected at APS beamline 24-IDC with a Pilatus 6M pixel array detector under a cryogenic temperature of 100 K. To enhance anomalous signals from Se atoms for phasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), the X-ray wavelength was tuned to the Se-K edge (Œª¬†=¬†0.9789 √Ö). The orientation of crystals was random without special consideration of crystal alignment, and beam size was adjusted to match the crystal size. A total of 22 data sets were collected, each from a single crystal. An oscillation angle of 1¬∞ was used for data collection with a total of 360 frames for each data set. The beam size was adjusted to match the crystal size. The 22 single-crystal data sets were processed individually by using XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kabsch, 2010</xref>) and CCP4 packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Winn et al., 2011</xref>). For phasing purposes, the low-resolution anomalous signals were enhanced by increased multiplicity. By rejection of 7 outlier crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), anomalous diffraction data from 15 statistically-compatible crystals were scaled and merged for phasing. For outlier rejection, a unit-cell variation of 1.0œÉ was used. CCP4 program POINTLESS and SCALA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Evans, 2006</xref>) were used for data combining; and Bijvoet pairs were kept separately throughout the data flow. For refinement purposes, keeping the high angle data was important, and done by limiting radiation damage as well as by increasing multiplicity. Although most <italic>Pf</italic>CysZ crystals diffracted to only about 3.5 √Ö spacings or poorer, we intentionally set the detector distance to include higher spacings. Higher resolution data were retained through a data merging procedure that is described as follows: (1) The 22 individually processed data sets were analyzed by diffraction dissimilarity analysis by using only high angle data between 3.5¬†and¬†3.0 √Ö, resulting in three subsets. (2) The data statistics of members in each subset were checked manually and the subset that contained the highest angle data set, e.g. data set 6, was selected for further analyses and data combination. (3) Each data set within the selected subset was compared with data set six by high-angle intensity correlation. Six of the highest resolution data sets were statistically comparable and therefore were selected for merging. For phasing, substructure solutions were found by SHELXD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sheldrick, 2010</xref>) and were further refined and completed by PHASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>) and then used to compute initial SAD phases at the data limit by SAD phasing with PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). Phases were density modified with solvent flattening and histogram matching as implemented in CCP4 program DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cowtan and Zhang, 1999</xref>) to improve phases and also to break phase ambiguity. The estimated solvent contents of 71% were used for density modification. The model was initially built into the experimental electron density map by COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>), followed by iterative refinement by PHENIX and model building in COOT.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Ming Zhou (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers have expressed shared enthusiasm for the series of crystal structures showing novel and unusual assembly of sulfate transporters/channels. However, several shared concerns have been raised in regard to the biochemical examination of the oligomerization assembly and functional studies. The key points are summarized below, and individual reviewers' comments are included.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The channel nature of the proteins is not convincingly demonstrated. The electrophysiology experiments are of insufficient quality. They should either be removed or improved. Specifically, the currents at higher protein concentrations, originating from multiple channels in bilayer should be shown and should have properties consistent with observed single channels. Additionally, the fact that 5¬µM concentrations of sulfite inhibit flux in the presence of 150 mM sulfate seems incompatible with comparable affinities determined in binding experiments. It should be demonstrated that sulfite inhibits sulfate currents in a dose-dependent and reversible manner.</p><p>2) The liposome uptake raises a question: How can uptake occur against the buildup of electrical potential? Furthermore, the apparent uptake rate seems too slow to be compatible with observed single channel activity. The authors should examine whether the process is electrogenic (as would be suggested by electrophysiology) by, for example, using K<sup>+</sup>/valinomycin system. Finally, reviewers were alarmed by very different sulfate uptake levels (including in liposome controls) shown in Figure 4D and Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1A.</p><p>3) Based on comments in (1) and (2), the reviewers are not convinced that the channel nature of these proteins has been convincingly demonstrated. This doubt is also increased because it seems unclear how sulfate would overcome the generally negative-inside potential of the bacterial cells that would be expected to oppose significant sulfate influx.</p><p>4) The uptake experiments in bacteria need to be controlled for protein expression.</p><p>5) The reviewers would also like to see whether all three proteins are able to bind sulfate and/or sulfite in ITC experiments.</p><p>6) The shown biochemical support for hexameric assembly is not sufficient. Cross-linking in all proteins across the second proposed interface would be required or perhaps cross-linking of the complete hexamer by, for example, glutaraldehyde.</p><p>7) In the absence of convincing functional data showing channel properties, proposal of a permeation mechanism might be premature.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) Overall, the discovery and validation that CysZ is a dual topology membrane protein are solid and novel. However, the proposed sulfate permeation pathway seems only compatible in PdCysZ. It is not clear whether there is a protein-enclosed central cavity in the middle of the membrane in IlCysZ and PfCysZ. Another way of looking at it is to ask whether the minimal functional unit of CysZs, is a dimer or hexamer. The authors went so far as to say that the two forms of dimers could be derived from the hexamers but stayed short of saying whether IlCysZ and PfCysZ were hexamers to begin with. Are there any data on whether a dimer is sufficient for the transport function?</p><p>2) On the functional side, the cell-based assays confirmed and advanced the previous notion of CysZ functions, and the binding and transport assays on the purified proteins added more precision to our understanding of the protein. For the transport assay shown in Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1, there are about 20 turnovers in 60 seconds if one assumes a hexameric basic functional unit, and about 8 turnovers if a dimer is a basic functional unit (Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1A). Although there is nothing wrong with the relatively slow rate of transport, the slow rate is not compatible with the high turnover rate required for observing single channel activities in patch clamp experiments shown in Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 2.</p><p>3) Finally, reading through the manuscript, it seems that a transmembrane pore overlapping with the three-fold axis of the hexamer would not be out of the question? The authors mentioned this possibility but seem to dismiss it right away mainly because the tip of the H4b-H5a is not highly conserved. However, since the structures already showed that this unit is mobile, the tip may not end up coordinating the incoming sulfate after all.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) Biochemical experiments do not independently support dual topology, contrary to the authors' argument. Independent biochemical support for dual topology assembly is overstated (subsection ‚ÄúDual-topology assembly of CysZ‚Äù). The crosslinking experiments support the dimerization arrangement seen in the structure, but I am not convinced that they rule out other assemblies. The cysteines are located at a position thought to be right in the middle of the membrane. Thus, the cysteines in a parallel subunit would be positioned at a similar depth and might also crosslink.</p><p>The authors argue that the cysteine accessibility experiments shown in Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 2 support a dual-topology model (subsection ‚ÄúDual-topology assembly of CysZ‚Äù).

I think &quot;antiparallel&quot; is a slightly more precise term, since &quot;dual topology&quot; refers to stable subunit insertion in membranes. It's hard to imagine these monomers existing happily without a partner in the membrane.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structure-based analysis of CysZ-mediated cellular uptake of sulfate&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, several shared concerns have been raised in regard to the biochemical examination of the oligomerization assembly and functional studies. The key points are summarized below, and individual reviewers' comments are included.</p><p>We appreciate the enthusiasm shared by the reviewers, and the criticisms made to our work, which we interpreted in the most positive of ways. We respond to each point in detail, below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The channel nature of the proteins is not convincingly demonstrated. The electrophysiology experiments are of insufficient quality. They should either be removed or improved. Specifically, the currents at higher protein concentrations, originating from multiple channels in bilayer should be shown and should have properties consistent with observed single channels. Additionally, the fact that 5¬µM concentrations of sulfite inhibit flux in the presence of 150 mM sulfate seems incompatible with comparable affinities determined in binding experiments. It should be demonstrated that sulfite inhibits sulfate currents in a dose-dependent and reversible manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this inconsistency. First, we recognize that the reported electrophysiology experiments were not of high quality. Since we were unable to perform new electrophysiology experiments, we removed most of this description; however, we have retained representative current traces (Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1D), including a trace showing multiple levels of single-channel currents as suggested. We have also collected an entirely new set of proteoliposome-based radiolabeled sulfate flux measurements (see below), including extensive tests with ionophores that can disrupt transmembrane gradients, whereby we exclude likely transport partners such as protons or sodium ions. Thus, together with testing the effect of the membrane potential on sulfate flux (see below), the new proteoliposome results provide further support for our originally proposed channel-like behavior of CysZ. Superficially, however, currents from CysZ electrophysiology recordings seem at odds with much lower rates of sulfate flux measured in proteoliposomes. On the other hand, this apparent inconsistency was also reported for the well-studied KcsA where a comparison between concentrative radiotracer (<sup>86</sup>Rb<sup>+</sup>) fluxes into liposomes and electrophysiological bilayer measurements revealed similar rate constants (Heginbotham, Kolmakova-Partenskh and Miller, 1998). We have performed the same type of analysis and found that the situation here is qualitatively like that for KcsA; however, we decided to refrain from presenting these data in the manuscript as the calculations rely in major part on estimates and thus preclude an accurate quantitative assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The liposome uptake raises a question: How can uptake occur against the buildup of electrical potential? Furthermore, the apparent uptake rate seems too slow to be compatible with observed single channel activity. The authors should examine whether the process is electrogenic (as would be suggested by electrophysiology) by, for example, using K<sup>+</sup>/valinomycin system. Finally, reviewers were alarmed by very different sulfate uptake levels (including in liposome controls) shown in Figure 4D and Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1A.</p><p>3) Based on comments in (1) and (2), the reviewers are not convinced that the channel nature of these proteins has been convincingly demonstrated. This doubt is also increased because it seems unclear how sulfate would overcome the generally negative-inside potential of the bacterial cells that would be expected to oppose significant sulfate influx.</p><p>4) The uptake experiments in bacteria need to be controlled for protein expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Critique points 2 ‚Äì 4 directly connect to the concerns raised in point 1, and we have tackled these inconsistencies by performing an exhaustive set of experiments that addresses all points raised by the reviewers. In this context, we have repeated (and extended) all radiotracer-based uptake studies. Here, we have performed the kinetic characterization of CysZ-mediated sulfate flux in the proteoliposome system using known amounts of protein (1) to rule out that observed activity patterns reflect differences in the expression levels of CysZ rather than functional properties of CysZ as mentioned in critique point 4, and (2) to provide a suitable experimental platform for the measurements suggested by the reviewers for(a) the detailed kinetic characterization of sulfate flux, (b) measuring the inhibition of sulfite on sulfate flux, (c) elucidating the effect of electrochemical ion gradients on CysZ activity, and d) analyzing the effect of the membrane potential on CysZ-mediated sulfate flux to provide ‚Äòelectrophysiology-like‚Äô measurements of this system in the membrane. To connect our studies to those performed by Para et al., 1983 that first described the CysZ system, we still show sulfate uptake in <italic>E. coli</italic> wild-type cells compared to uptake measured in CysZ- <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (new Figure 4A). The purpose of showing this initial data set is to highlight that CysZ is not the only sulfate translocating system in these bacteria but that the other sulfate-translocating systems play a role in the sulfate homeostasis in bacteria.</p><p>All new flux studies were performed in CysZ-containing proteoliposomes, using similar experimental conditions as those applied to the cell-based studies. Employing proteoliposomes resulted in much ‚Äòcleaner‚Äô data compared to the initially shown cell-based uptake studies (new Figure 4B) and allowed us to determine the catalytic turnover number for all three CysZ isoforms. Furthermore, the proteoliposome system simplified the characterization of potential energizing co-factors in our experimental system as ‚Äì in contrast to cell-based studies ‚Äì the effect of native systems found in the bacterial membrane could be ruled out for our measurements. To test the effect of a potential proton or sodium driving force on CysZ activity, we used gramicidin to dissipate the proton and sodium electrochemical gradient across the membrane, thus providing a more direct assessment of the ion requirements rather than working with uncouplers that target proton-translocating ATPases in the bacterial membrane as shown in the original submission of this manuscript. Based on these findings, we could address the concerns raised in Critique Points 2 and 3 and follow the suggested experiment involving a potassium flux-generated membrane potential of defined polarity by the addition of the potassium ionophore valinomycin. We observed an increase in sulfate flux when we applied depolarizing conditions (inside positive) in the CysZ-containing proteoliposomes, a finding that directly addresses the issue raised by the reviewers regarding the buildup of a negative potential as a consequence of the accumulation of the negatively charged sulfate ion. However, our data also revealed that CysZ can mediate the flux of sulfate in inside-negative proteoliposomes or those that exhibit no membrane potential. We infer from studies performed in context with the characterization of potassium channels in membraneous systems (including proteoliposomes) by Chris Miller‚Äôs lab that the gradient of the transported ion (here sulfate) serves as driving force that acts against the buildup of electrical charge over the course of the flux experiment. Under physiological conditions, as outlined in Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1, CysZ is part of an operon that is involved in the synthesis of Cys and the incoming sulfate is quickly assimilated in this process, thus preventing a buildup of negative charge in the cells. In this context, it is worth noting that the sulfate flux mediated by CysZ is rather quick and peaks at about 10 ‚Äì 15 seconds, followed by a decrease to about 50% within 90 seconds (new Figure 4B). This observation shows that the charge buildup in the proteoliposomes actually acts against the transmembrane sulfate gradient as the uptake curve lacks a steady state of sulfate accumulation as expected for a process that is energized by an additional component (i.e., the concentration gradient of a second ion found in secondary active transport processes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The reviewers would also like to see whether all three proteins are able to bind sulfate and/or sulfite in ITC experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a critical point in our understanding of whether sulfite actually binds to CysZ and we thank the reviewers for pointing out this shortcoming in our initial submission. We have addressed this issue by performing a new set of experiments utilizing microscale thermophoresis (MST). MST detects changes in the hydration shell of biomolecules along an applied temperature gradient in response to conformational changes of the biomolecules, allowing for a quantification of ligand binding events, without requiring surface immobilization and high sample consumption (see e.g., Seidel et al., 2012). We have performed, and now show in Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1D, SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> binding by <italic>Pd</italic>CysZ and <italic>Il</italic>CysZ. The <italic>EC<sub>50</sub></italic> values for SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> binding based on the MST measurements is essentially in perfect agreement with the <italic>IC<sub>50</sub></italic> values determined by blocking radiolabeled sulfate binding with increasing concentrations of non-labeled sulfite. Only our attempts to measure SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> binding by <italic>Pf</italic>CysZ produced inconclusive data due to high background signals. However, all our SPA-based radiolabeled sulfate binding measurements were also repeated for the revision of the manuscript. In the course of performing these experiments, we realized that the initially reported SPA-based binding studies did not necessarily reflect the CysZ-specific activity but appeared to be a mix of CysZ-specific properties and elevated background (non-proximity) signals. In a very time- and effort-consuming process we were able to determine that several batches of the copper-coated YSi SPA beads bound sulfate even in the absence of protein at a level that interfered with the CysZ-specific measurements. After contacting the manufacturer of the SPA beads (Perkin Elmer) and sorting out defective batches/vials of the SPA beads, we are happy to be able to report a comprehensive set of binding studies in this revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The shown biochemical support for hexameric assembly is not sufficient. Cross-linking in all proteins across the second proposed interface would be required or perhaps cross-linking of the complete hexamer by, for example, glutaraldehyde.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed numerous experiments to address this question. These included (i) cross-linking with glutaraldehyde and another amino-reactive cross-linker on <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes expressing various CysZ orthologs, (ii) cross-linking with glutaraldehyde on CysZ proteins reconstituted in liposomes after purification, (iii) negative stain electron microscopy on protein in detergent and reconstituted in lipid-filed nanodiscs, and (iv) cryo-electron microscopy on protein in nanodiscs and in proteoliposomes. Unfortunately, and frustratingly, the results for all of these experiments were inconclusive. It has now become obvious that optimizing these approaches would require a considerable amount of additional time, beyond what we consider acceptable. However, all the plethora of functional experiments (previous and new) presented here, show that the three CysZs for which we have structures, have essentially indistinguishable functional properties and profiles. The functional equivalence of all CysZ, together with the fact that the it is implausible that the CysZ monomer be the functional unit, that the two CysZ dimeric assemblies (<italic>Il</italic>CysZ and <italic>Pf</italic>CysZ) observed in our structures are unrelated, and that they are instead both present in the CysZ hexameric assembly (<italic>Pd</italic>CysZ), strongly supports our claim that the hexamer is the functional unit of CysZ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the absence of convincing functional data showing channel properties, proposal of a permeation mechanism might be premature.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this criticism that was based on our initial functional studies. We anticipate that the new set of functional studies unequivocally support our conclusion about the channel-like properties of CysZ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) Overall, the discovery and validation that CysZ is a dual topology membrane protein are solid and novel. However, the proposed sulfate permeation pathway seems only compatible in PdCysZ. It is not clear whether there is a protein-enclosed central cavity in the middle of the membrane in IlCysZ and PfCysZ. Another way of looking at it is to ask whether the minimal functional unit of CysZs, is a dimer or hexamer. The authors went so far as to say that the two forms of dimers could be derived from the hexamers but stayed short of saying whether IlCysZ and PfCysZ were hexamers to begin with. Are there any data on whether a dimer is sufficient for the transport function?</p></disp-quote><p>See point 6 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) On the functional side, the cell-based assays confirmed and advanced the previous notion of CysZ functions, and the binding and transport assays on the purified proteins added more precision to our understanding of the protein. For the transport assay shown in Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1, there are about 20 turnovers in 60 seconds if one assumes a hexameric basic functional unit, and about 8 turnovers if a dimer is a basic functional unit (Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1A). Although there is nothing wrong with the relatively slow rate of transport, the slow rate is not compatible with the high turnover rate required for observing single channel activities in patch clamp experiments shown in Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer‚Äôs comment about the relatively slow turnover number of CysZ compared to other channel proteins. We have mentioned in the main text that we cannot rule out that the activity of CysZ, in fact, may reflect the energetically uncoupled flux of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> along its concentration gradient, characteristic for a low-turnover channel phenotype (or passive transport/uniport, or facilitated diffusion) and cite a paper in this context that addresses the blurry boundaries between channels and transporters (Ashcroft et al., 2008). From a mechanistic standpoint, however, our data clearly support an uncoupled translocation mechanism of sulfate (reflected in the term ‚Äòchannel-like‚Äô behavior).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Finally, reading through the manuscript, it seems that a transmembrane pore overlapping with the three-fold axis of the hexamer would not be out of the question? The authors mentioned this possibility but seem to dismiss it right away mainly because the tip of the H4b-H5a is not highly conserved. However, since the structures already showed that this unit is mobile, the tip may not end up coordinating the incoming sulfate after all.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) Biochemical experiments do not independently support dual topology, contrary to the authors' argument. Independent biochemical support for dual topology assembly is overstated (subsection ‚ÄúDual-topology assembly of CysZ‚Äù). The crosslinking experiments support the dimerization arrangement seen in the structure, but I am not convinced that they rule out other assemblies. The cysteines are located at a position thought to be right in the middle of the membrane. Thus, the cysteines in a parallel subunit would be positioned at a similar depth and might also crosslink.</p><p>The authors argue that the cysteine accessibility experiments shown in Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 2 support a dual-topology model (subsection ‚ÄúDual-topology assembly of CysZ‚Äù).

Although we agree with the reviewer, that sidedness is indeed lost when membranes are isolated, we believe that our disulfide crosslinking experiments confirm that a dimer crosslinked between residues L161 and A164 (Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 2) might only form if the 2 protomers are in an antiparallel conformation within the membrane.</p><p>2) The authors do not state what density of reconstituted protein is used for electrophysiology; if they use the same density of protein as they do in their radioactive uptake experiments, then they ought to see multiple channels incorporating into the bilayer with each liposome fusion if most of the protein is functional. Do they ever see multichannel currents? How many independent times have they seen single-channel insertions with similar characteristics?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have decided to remove the majority of the electrophysiological measurements that, as the reviewer pointed out here, were not controlled for protein density and do, in fact, seem to reflect multichannel currents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors do not show the Se anomalous difference map for SeO4-, or the Fo-Fc omit maps for the SO4-bound and mutant structures to support their identification of the substrate binding site (subsection ‚ÄúSulfate Binding Site‚Äù).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included an additional supplementary figure (Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 1), to show the anomalous difference map highlighting the sulfate binding site residues, with density shown for the bound sulfate ion, selenate ion as well as water molecule (in the Apo structure).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I would suggest using &quot;antiparallel&quot; rather than &quot;dual topology&quot; to describe the assembly. I think &quot;antiparallel&quot; is a slightly more precise term, since &quot;dual topology&quot; refers to stable subunit insertion in membranes. It's hard to imagine these monomers existing happily without a partner in the membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her comments and agree that ‚Äòantiparallel‚Äô is indeed more appropriate to describe the CysZ assembly and have made the changes in the text.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The functional experiments have been substantially improved.

Is it below/above the external SO4(2-)? What electric potential is expected to be established at this point if CysZ is sulfate-specific channel.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the calculations for the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> accumulation in CysZ-containing liposomes depicted in Figure 4B. In an attached appendix, we have listed the individual steps of the calculation for the CysZ-mediated SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> flux. We then compare these calculations for sulfate uptake by CysZ with similar calculations with those for tryptophan uptake by a secondary active transporter (MhsT). The MhsT experiments were performed in virtually identical reconstitution conditions as those used for CysZ, which allows for a direct side-by-side comparison.</p><p>Our calculations reveal that the accumulation of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in liposomes containing CysZ slightly exceeds equilibrium, but that this level is dramatically lower than the accumulation observed for a known transporter, thus supporting a channel-like phenotype (as facilitator or uniporter). Considering inaccuracies in the calculations, the same bias would apply for the CysZ calculations and the MhsT calculations. We note that it is difficult to explain our observations if CysZ is assumed to be perfectly selective for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> as that condition would require that the internal concentration of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> always be less than the external concentration. In light of this, it seems feasible to consider that CysZ is permeable to other ionic species with Na<sup>+</sup> being the most likely co-permeant ion for the conditions used in our experiments. Accordingly, we have indicated this in the text. We now include the conclusion about the uptake level for CysZ in comparison with the MhsT transporter (Malinauskaite et al., 2014) in the main text, and we have added the Calculations Appendix in the Supplemental Information section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To compare liposome-based assays to single channel recordings, the authors make parallels to Chris Miler's paper on Rb flux into K channel-containing liposomes. Those experiments were set up differently from the current experiments: K/Rb exchange was measured at microM concentrations of external Rb. Linearity of Rb uptake rates from microM to high mM was assumed (if we understand correctly). In the current experiments, it is not exchange that is measured, and it is not clear what determined the plateau in Figure 4B. Moreover. the Km for sulfate is expected to be ca 3 mM and linearity up to 150 mM could not be assumed. We would like to see more detailed reasoning from the authors on how the liposome-based rates relate to single channel conductance.</p></disp-quote><p>The editor is indeed correct. The Rb<sup>+</sup> flux measurements of Heginbotham et al., (1998) reflect the exchange of pre-loaded internal K<sup>+</sup> and radiotracer amounts of external Rb<sup>+</sup>, and linearity of the rates from microM to milliM could be correctly assumed. Given the fact that the K<sub>M</sub> of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> flux by CysZ is in the 3 mM range, the statement in the re-submitted manuscript about the linearity of rates up to 150 mM (conditions in the electrophysiological bilayer measurements) was ‚Äì as the editor pointed out ‚Äì not correct. It was our intention merely to provide a rationale for reconciling the apparent rates of sulfate uptake as measured by electrophysiology and by flux measurements, not to provide a direct comparison between rates determined by the two methods. Nevertheless, we realize that our statement assuming linearity is misleading. In fact, after re-assessing our SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> flux experiments, we realized that increasing concentrations of sulfate used for the determination of the catalytic turnover number (Figure 4C) would increase the internal electrical potential build-up in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, it is feasible to assume that at high sulfate concentrations the charge build-up would inhibit the accumulation of sulfate, leading to a significant underestimation of the actual flux rates at higher SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations. Since the 5-s uptake measurements were already experimentally challenging, shorter time points (to capture the real initial rate of accumulation) could not be sampled. As a consequence, the actual accumulation of sulfate at high concentrations (that show a plateau in the concentration-dependent uptake curve) may be underestimated and thus lead to an underestimated catalytic turnover number. Since this ‚Äòproblem‚Äô can be circumvented in the electrophysiological bilayer experiments, we realize that the comparison of rates assessed with these two different methods is not necessarily useful and we have clarified this in the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editor‚Äôs note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The editors have some questions regarding your latest resubmission that might be easier to address in a dialogue format.
