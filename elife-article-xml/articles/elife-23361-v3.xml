specialized cells and integration with hormonal signaling remain enigmatic. Here we show that the SAL1-PAP (3′-phosphoadenosine 5′- phosphate) retrograde pathway interacts with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling to regulate stomatal closure and seed germination in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Genetically or exogenously manipulating PAP bypasses the canonical signaling components ABA Insensitive 1 (ABI1) and Open Stomata 1 (OST1); priming an alternative pathway that restores ABA-responsive gene expression, ROS bursts, ion channel function, stomatal closure and drought tolerance in <italic>ost1</italic>-2. PAP also inhibits wild type and <italic>abi1</italic>-1 seed germination by enhancing ABA sensitivity. PAP-XRN signaling interacts with ABA, ROS and Ca<sup>2+</sup>; up-regulating multiple ABA signaling components, including lowly-expressed Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases (CDPKs) capable of activating the anion channel SLAC1. Thus, PAP exhibits many secondary messenger attributes and exemplifies how retrograde signals can have broader roles in hormone signaling, allowing chloroplasts to fine-tune physiological responses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23361.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23361.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

regulate nuclear gene transcription <italic>via</italic> several signaling pathways in a process called retrograde signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2016a</xref>). While this has been conventionally viewed as a bilateral communication to optimize organelle function and/or repair, there is emerging evidence that retrograde signaling contributes to multiple cellular processes and complex whole-plant traits including programmed cell death, drought tolerance, biotic stress tolerance, light-regulated seedling development and flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kleine and Leister, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, specific role(s) have never been examined for any chloroplast retrograde signal identified to date in relation to drought tolerance and abscisic acid (ABA) -mediated signaling in specialized cells such as guard cells surrounding stomata. The hormone ABA mediates signaling pathways that regulate stomatal closure and seed germination. The timing of seed germination needs to be coordinated with favorable environmental conditions to ensure seedling viability, while stomata are the gateways for gas exchange and water loss in leaves and thus closure mediated by guard cells is one of the most important and immediate avoidance responses to drought stress in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Murata et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, although regulation of stomatal closure by ABA directly impacts on photosynthesis and chloroplast function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yamburenko et al., 2015</xref>), how and to what extent signals emanating from oxidatively-stressed chloroplasts may be integrated with ABA signaling in guard cells have remained largely enigmatic. The metabolite 3’-phosphoadenosine 5’-phosphate (PAP) acts as a retrograde signal during oxidative stress. PAP accumulates during high light exposure and drought <italic>via</italic> redox inactivation of its catabolic phosphatase SAL1, and moves from chloroplasts to the nucleus <italic>via</italic> a transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Estavillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gigolashvili et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2016b</xref>). PAP is perceived by and inhibits exoribonuclease (XRN)-mediated RNA metabolism as evidenced in <italic>xrn</italic> double and triple mutants phenocopying <italic>sal1</italic> mutants; resulting in drought tolerance and activation of 25% of the high light stress transcriptome. Mutant alleles lacking SAL1 catabolic activity, such as <italic>altered ascorbate peroxidase2 expression 8</italic> (<italic>alx8</italic>, hereafter termed <italic>sal1</italic>-8) and <italic>fiery1</italic>-6 (<italic>fry1</italic>-6, hereafter termed <italic>sal1</italic>-6), constitutively accumulate PAP and are consequently drought tolerant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rossel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Estavillo et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>PAP was initially proposed to act largely via ABA-independent pathways as the drought tolerance in <italic>sal1</italic> correlated with accumulation of osmoprotectants, and there were conflicting reports on the impacts of <italic>sal1</italic> mutations on stomatal conductance: an earlier study suggested that SAL1 was not involved in stomatal regulation, whereas we found markedly decreased stomatal conductance in <italic>sal1</italic> with elevated PAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Xiong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rossel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Estavillo et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, a subset of ABA-responsive genes are misregulated in <italic>sal1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>), raising the question as to whether PAP can participate in ABA-mediated processes such as stomatal closure and seed germination.</p><p>Binding of ABA to its receptors (RCAR/PYR1/PYL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Park et al., 2009</xref>) leads to inactivation of the group A Protein Phosphatase 2C (PP2C) proteins such as ABI1 and activation of SNF1-Related Kinases 2.2, 2.3 and 2.6/OST1 (SnRK2.2, SnRK 2.3, SnRK2.6/OST1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koornneef et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Leung et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meyer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mustilli et al., 2002</xref>). The central role of PP2Cs and SnRKs in ABA signaling are demonstrated by the reduced sensitivity to ABA-mediated germination inhibition and stomatal closure in <italic>abi1</italic>-1 which is insensitive to ABA-PYR/PYL-mediated inhibition, and stomatal closure in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koornneef et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Leung et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meyer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mustilli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Umezawa et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, both seeds and guard cells of the triple mutant of ABA-activated SnRKs are almost completely ABA-insensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujii and Zhu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakashima et al., 2009</xref>). In guard cells active OST1 phosphorylates Slow Anion Channel-Associated 1 (SLAC1) allowing anion release, as well as facilitating potassium efflux by stimulating potassium efflux channels and inhibiting the inward potassium channels (KAT1 and KAT2), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geiger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>).

The subgroup II CDPKs are particularly important in guard cell signaling because three members (CDPK3, 21 and 23) can regulate SLAC1 and KAT channel activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2015</xref>).

Thus, SLAC1 channel activity is controlled by the joint action of OST1 and three CDPKs in counterbalance with competitive dephosphorylation by PP2Cs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandt et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The understanding of guard cell regulation is far from complete, in part due to the complex interaction between ABA and secondary messengers such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ROS. Notably, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activation of CDPKs and ROS production by NADPH oxidases are interdependent processes with multiple layers of feedback regulation. Furthermore, the extent to which SnRK2-independent ABA/Ca<sup>2+</sup>signaling contributes to stomatal closure in whole plants under drought stress has not been thoroughly investigated, as various reports to date have largely utilized epidermal peels of unstressed plants or heterologous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2015</xref>).

The novel roles of the nucleotide phosphatase SAL1 and its associated phosphoadenosine signal, PAP, in guard cell regulation are investigated in the context of known and uncharacterized ABA signaling components and secondary messengers.

We previously showed that drought tolerance in <italic>sal1</italic>-8 is not due to slower water loss from soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>) and the tolerance is conferred by PAP in shoots, not roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hirsch et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore we tested whether PAP in leaves of the double mutants decreased constitutive <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> or stomatal density, which can enhance drought tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doheny-Adams et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hepworth et al., 2015</xref>).

CryoSEM measurements of stomatal morphology and density revealed that the significantly higher total stomatal opening area per leaf area in the ABA signaling single mutants (<italic>abi1</italic>-1, <italic>ost1</italic>-2) remained high in the drought tolerant double mutants and were not decreased to wild type levels by <italic>sal1</italic>-8, which itself has wild type-like stomatal opening area per leaf area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Next, since <italic>ost1-</italic>2 and <italic>abi1-</italic>1 are in L<italic>er</italic> and <italic>sal1</italic>-8 in Col-0, we analyzed Col-0, L<italic>er</italic>, ColL<italic>er</italic> F1 hybrids and segregating F2 and F3 plants of the crosses; no ecotype effects that could account for the drought tolerance independent of the <italic>sal1</italic>-8 mutation were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). We also generated double mutants containing both lesions in the Col-0 background using T-DNA mutants of <italic>ost1</italic> (<italic>salk_008068</italic>) and <italic>sal1</italic>-6.

Significantly, the <italic>ost1 sal1</italic>-6 (Col-0 background) mutant had restored stomatal closure under drought stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>), ruling out ecotype effects as the major driver for the drought tolerance in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8.</p><p>We then tested whether the complementation could be explained by differences in ABA content.

The combined results are plotted as a heat map with the corresponding analysis of variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), and, a subset of the experiment is plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). PAP treatment significantly repressed wild type and <italic>abi1-</italic>1 germination in combination with ABA and paclobutrazol in a dose-dependent manner, but not by itself. The combinatorial treatments lowered Col-0 germination from 100% to &lt;20% and for <italic>abi1-</italic>1 from 100% in the presence of 1 or 2 µM ABA to &lt;50%.

In leaves, oxidatively-stressed chloroplasts inhibit SAL1 activity but do not alter its abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2016b</xref>); whereas during seed desiccation the chloroplasts in seeds de-differentiate into small non-photosynthetic plastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mansfield et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mansfield and Briarty, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liebers et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore we investigated whether PAP accumulation in seeds similarly reflected the oxidizing environment of seed desiccation, or, other mechanisms such as regulation of SAL1 abundance. <italic>SAL1</italic> transcript abundance in seeds is the lowest amongst all <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> developmental stages and dry seed imbibition increases SAL1 expression greater than 10-fold, constituting the most dramatic change in SAL1 expression across 3000 different perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zimmermann et al., 2004</xref>). Associated with the elevated PAP and lower <italic>SAL1</italic> mRNA levels we did observe substantially decreased SAL1 protein abundance in seeds compared to leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Therefore unlike leaves, in seeds PAP accumulation and signaling may be modulated by a downregulation of SAL1 abundance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we present evidence for organelle retrograde signaling functioning in concert with hormonal signaling in guard cells to mediate stomatal closure and in seeds to mediate dormancy and germination. This new role was discovered <italic>via</italic> the unexpected ability of PAP to restore ABA-responsiveness in the two canonical <italic>ost1</italic>-2 and <italic>abi1</italic>-1 mutants that function near the apex of ABA signaling and further demonstrated independently in wild type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Complementation of <italic>ost1</italic>-2 and <italic>abi1</italic>–1 occurred whether PAP levels were genetically or exogenously manipulated and traits observed to be restored include ABA-inducible gene expression, ROS bursts, ion fluxes, gas exchange and aperture. Similarly, dormancy and germination are impacted by elevated PAP in both wild type and <italic>abi1</italic>-1. These findings raise a series of questions. First, how do these observations relate to PAP perception and its effects on ABA biosynthesis and signaling in guard cells and seeds? Second, how can the observed effects of PAP explain the complementation of ABA-insensitive mutants? Finally, what is the physiological relevance of these findings <italic>in planta</italic>?</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>PAP perception and its influence on ABA biosynthesis and responses</title><p>We have previously reported that ABA content can be elevated by PAP in <italic>sal1</italic>-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rossel et al., 2006</xref>). Similar trends were observed herein, although the differences were not statistically significant between <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 and <italic>ost1</italic>-2 due to high variability between replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This enables formulation of an hypothesis that the primary mechanism of action of PAP is to stimulate ABA biosynthesis. Such a function for PAP may contribute to the lower <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> and seed dormancy in <italic>sal1</italic> and PAP-treated wild type, which have functional ABI1 and OST1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). However, would elevation of endogenous ABA restore responsiveness in mutants that are insensitive to exogenous ABA? The triple <italic>snrk</italic> mutant has little to no response to ABA despite accumulating three-fold more endogenous ABA than wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujii and Zhu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakashima et al., 2009</xref>) and similarly the <italic>ost1</italic>-2 mutant is largely insensitive to ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mustilli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujii and Zhu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakashima et al., 2009</xref>). Yet, <italic>ost1</italic>-2 and the <italic>snrk</italic> triple mutant were complemented by <italic>sal1</italic> and PAP treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Another expectation if PAP primarily rescued ABA sensitivity in the double mutants by enhancing ABA content is that there could be evidence for constitutive rescue and enhanced sensitivity to ABA in the double mutants in response to the elevated endogenous ABA. However, we did not observe evidence for this either in the transcriptional, stomatal aperture or <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> properties of <italic>abi1</italic>-1 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 and <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Therefore, while PAP may also function by up-regulating ABA levels we conclude it primarily acts by facilitating a signaling response to exogenously applied or endogenously stress-induced ABA.</p><p>For PAP to mediate ABA responses, it must be perceived by the cell. One hypothesis is that PAP could bind to, and affect, the activity of ABA signaling proteins. None of the ABA receptors have known adenosine binding domains and as the signaling downstream of these receptors is still blocked in <italic>abi1</italic>-1 and <italic>ost1</italic>-2, then direct receptor activation by PAP binding would be inconsistent with the restoration of ABA perception in the double or quadruple <italic>snrk sal1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>) and <italic>abi1</italic>-1 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). PAP has been reported to also bind to poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) and Nucleotide Diphosphate Kinase (NPDK) proteins in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schneider et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Toledano et al., 2012</xref>), but in plants no interaction partners other than XRNs have been described for PAP. Nor is PAP known to bind any ABA signaling proteins. Although additional PAP targets cannot be precluded our results herein indicate that PAP is primarily perceived and participates in ABA signaling through its established retrograde signaling target proteins, the XRNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, discussed below).</p><p>In retrograde signaling PAP levels are regulated in the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2016b</xref>), it is transported into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gigolashvili et al., 2012</xref>) and its only reported sites of perception in plants are nuclear exoribonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Estavillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hirsch et al., 2011</xref>). Herein we observe that <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>xrn2</italic>-1 <italic>xrn3</italic>-3 phenocopies <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 at multiple levels of ABA responses and exhibits restoration of ABA-dependent stomatal closure in whole plants and leaf peels, ROS burst and ion fluxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As further discussed below, <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>xrn2</italic>-1 <italic>xrn3</italic>-3 also phenocopies <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 in up-regulating expression of CDPKs capable of regulating SLAC1 activity in oocytes. Additionally, the petiole feeding experiments where we co-fed ATP (which we propose would inhibit import of PAP into the chloroplast) or LiCl [which is reported to inhibit chloroplastic SAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Quintero et al., 1996</xref>)] provide results consistent with modulation of the intracellular PAP pathway. Therefore, while we do not exclude the possibility that PAP is partially sensed inside or outside the cell in an XRN-independent manner; given the similarity of complementation whether endogenously manipulated or exogenously applied to seeds, leaves and epidermal peels we favor the explanation that PAP acts as an agonist of ABA physiological responses by acting <italic>via</italic> XRNs in its established retrograde signaling pathway.</p><p>The exogenous PAP-mediated closure within 10–30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) could be consistent with a transcriptional response, as nuclear transcription in response to chloroplast stress can commence within 20–60 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vogel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Suzuki et al., 2015</xref>).

Additionally, various ABA signaling genes, including multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor proteins (CDPKs, CBLs, CIPKs) that regulate ion channel activity either directly by phosphorylation or indirectly <italic>via</italic> ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batistic and Kudla, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Simeunovic et al., 2016</xref>), as well as two transcription factors that each regulate multiple genes, were up-regulated in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 +/− ABA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The transcriptional response in <italic>ost1-</italic>2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 +/− ABA reports on two facets of PAP- ABA interactions: one is that ABA-signaling is indeed restored at the transcriptional level as well as the physiological level; the second is that it may provide insight into which proteins are key for this restoration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How does PAP interact with ABA and guard cell signaling?</title><p>Genes simply restored to wild type levels after ABA treatment in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 more likely reflect the effect of complementation, not the cause of it.

This for example could include ABA receptors, PP2Cs or SnRKs that can bypass ABI1 and OST1.

Likewise, the expression of the three SnRK2 kinases did not change and the quadruple <italic>snrk sal1</italic>-6 mutant conferred drought tolerance arguing against a role for the other SnRKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, PAP up-regulates 21 individual ABA / Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling components that fulfill either of the requirements above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Many of these kinases have unclear functions with regards to ABA signaling, yet are related to group II CDPKs that are known to regulate SLAC1 activity. Interestingly, CDPK32 has key functions in regulating ion channels in pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) and can also bind to and regulate the activity of the ABA transcription factor ABF4 thereby enhancing ABA sensitivity in leaves and seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choi et al., 2005</xref>). Two CIPKs that are key regulators of ABA signaling are also constitutively up-regulated in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8: CIPK6 activates the key guard cell K<sup>+</sup> channel AKT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lan et al., 2011</xref>) and CIPK1 mediates ABA responsiveness in guard cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">D'Angelo et al., 2006</xref>). Another constitutively up-regulated gene, CIPK21, is important for stress tolerance and can interact with multiple CBLs known to regulate ABA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pandey et al., 2015</xref>). We also observed ABA-inducible expression of CRK8 and CDPK19 specifically in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 but not in wild type. Interestingly, CDPK19 regulates ROS homeostasis in guard cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zou et al., 2015</xref>). The extent to which CIPK transcriptional up-regulation can be correlated with the complementation will require careful investigation because CIPK activity is also regulated post-translationally in a complex manner through combinatorial interactions with different CBLs, PP2Cs and their target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batistic and Kudla, 2009</xref>).</p><p>We show that at least four additional non-canonical CDPKs, CRK2 and 8 as well as CDPK32 and 34, can activate SLAC1 in an oocyte heterologous system independently of OST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These results are also in line with the requirement of PAP and CDPK34 for Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Myers et al.

It would be interesting to investigate whether these CDPKs can also regulate K<sup>+</sup> channel activity, given the restoration of K<sup>+</sup> fluxes by PAP and the reported ability of other CDPKs to regulate K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Latz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>So, could over-expression of one of more of the CPDKs be sufficient for complementation of ABA signaling mutants through activation of SLAC1? This hypothesis is viable for <italic>ost1</italic>-2 as CDPKs are not directly regulated by OST1 nor PP2Cs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boudsocq and Sheen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Simeunovic et al., 2016</xref>).

Thus, increased expression of CDPKs may be hypothetically sufficient for the complementation in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 and <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>xrn2</italic>-1 <italic>xrn3</italic>-3. Indeed overexpression of CDPK32 in a wild type background has been shown to enhance ABA sensitivity in leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choi et al., 2005</xref>). In the dominant <italic>abi1</italic>-1 mutant allele used in this study, however, it is unclear if phosphorylation of SLAC1 by the PAP-upregulated CDPKs alone is sufficient for complementation since there are conflicting reports on whether this dominant PP2C allele can competitively dephosphorylate SLAC1 and thereby negate CDPK action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geiger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scherzer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandt et al., 2015</xref>). More likely additional factors, like CIPKs 1, 6, 21, MYC2 and MYB61 are needed in combination with the CDPKs for the observed restoration of ABA perception and action in absence of OST1 or in the presence of the dominant ABI1-1 PP2C. Whether these factors function in parallel, or are part of a PAP-interaction network where up-regulation of one leads to the induction and activation of the others, requires investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Complementation of ABA-deficient and -insensitive genotypes</title><p>If PAP functions at least partly through Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling proteins and requires ABA-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), how can the complementation in the various ABA biosynthesis and ABA-insensitive mutants be explained? In <italic>aba2</italic>-3 <italic>sal1</italic>-8, ABA biosynthesis is not completely inhibited, since the <italic>aba2</italic>-3 allele is leaky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Léon-Kloosterziel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Laby et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrero et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>ost1</italic>-2, ABA biosynthesis is not affected but the loss of SnRK2 activity strongly impairs ABA perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mustilli et al., 2002</xref>). Significantly, however, ABA can still activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the plasma membrane in guard cells of <italic>snrk</italic> triple mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandt et al., 2015</xref>), which would enable Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the cytosol. This was simulated to a degree in our epidermal leaf peels experiments. The high external Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the measuring buffer diffuses into the cytosol where it activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and enabled exogenous PAP to close <italic>ost1</italic>-2 stomata. This suggests that entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol and its intracellular oscillations in response to drought and/or ABA may be sufficient to activate the PAP- and XRN-upregulated proteins, thus restoring ABA sensitivity and stomatal closure in <italic>ost1-2 sal1</italic>-8 and <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>xrn2</italic>-1 <italic>xrn3</italic>-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>abi1</italic>-1, however, the mutated PP2C protein is insensitive to ABA/PYR-mediated inhibition and presumably there is stronger antagonism of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling proteins by PP2Cs in this mutant. Indeed, we observed that PAP accumulation in <italic>abi1</italic>-1 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 only partially restored germination inhibition by exogenous ABA and paclobutrazol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Similarly, the germination inhibition of <italic>abi1</italic>-1 by combinatorial treatments of exogenous PAP, ABA and paclobutrazol occurred to a lesser extent compared to wild type; and the synergistic interaction between exogenous PAP and ABA required a higher ABA concentration in <italic>abi1</italic>-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Regardless, our results in guard cells and seeds collectively indicate that PAP is indeed able to act in ABA signaling and partially complement <italic>abi1</italic>-1.

Collectively, our results indicate that ABA and PAP may act synergistically.</p><p>We propose the following working model of how PAP may facilitate ABA-mediated regulation of stomatal function under physiological conditions, thereby integrating cellular responses to oxidative stress and tuning hormonal pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Oxidative stress during drought alters chloroplast redox poise to induce a 30-fold PAP accumulation <italic>via</italic> redox regulation of SAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Estavillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2016b</xref>). PAP accumulation could activate its downstream signaling through XRNs to transcriptionally up-regulate multiple ABA/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling proteins that are normally lowly expressed, and this includes four CDPKs that can activate SLAC1 in oocytes. These observations provide mechanisms for the observed bypass of the canonical pathway in <italic>abi1</italic>-1 <italic>sal1</italic>-8<italic>, ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8, and <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>xrn2</italic>-1 <italic>xrn3</italic>-3; and, stomatal closure in PAP-treated leaf peels in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as well as the ABA hypersensitivity in <italic>sal1</italic>-8. Interestingly, combinatorial stresses are known to activate additional transcriptional responses compared to single stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>). Our previous findings also showed that <italic>sal1</italic>-8 with higher PAP content has more closed stomata relative to wild type under high light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rossel et al., 2006</xref>). This raises an open question as to whether combinatorial chloroplastic oxidative stresses, such as drought and high light, might lead to more rapid or enhanced PAP signaling to regulate stomata in conjunction with ABA. Interestingly, the role of PAP in ABA signaling in mature seeds suggests that PAP could also be a signal from small, non-photosynthetic immature plastids which de-differentiated from chloroplasts during seed desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mansfield et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mansfield and Briarty, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liebers et al., 2017</xref>). The regulation of PAP-ABA interaction might occur differently in seeds compared to guard cells, since PAP accumulation appears to be regulated more by SAL1 abundance than chloroplast redox in seeds.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23361.018</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for fine-tuning of stomatal closure by PAP retrograde signaling.</title><p>Proposed intersection between PAP and ABA signaling during drought stress, or in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 <italic>/ abi1</italic>-1 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 treated with ABA. Binding of ABA to its receptors (PYR/PYLs) inactivates the inhibitory PP2Cs, thus allowing activation of OST1 for phosphorylation of proteins such as transcription factors and SLAC1. This is the major pathway for stomatal closure. Additionally, ABA signaling results in Ca<sup>2+</sup> release which could activate multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling proteins including CDPKs and CBLs/CIPKs thus allowing phosphorylation and activation of SLAC1. Many of these ABA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling proteins can be regulated by PAP predominantly via PAP-XRN-mediated retrograde signaling. The CDPK activation of SLAC1 can occur in parallel with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent OST1, allowing a convergence between chloroplast and ABA signaling at this key anion channel for stomatal closure. It is possible that PAP can also regulate stomatal closure through other proteins, though there is as yet no evidence for this in plants.

Our findings provide unanticipated insights into how guard cell or mesophyll chloroplasts may have input into guard cell regulation by mediating an additional ABA pathway that is complementary to and independent of the OST1 signaling network. The ability of SAL1-PAP-XRN retrograde signaling to intersect with ABA signaling in multiple tissues and its complex interactions with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ROS raise the hypothesis that PAP has attributes of a secondary messenger. Consequently, PAP-mediated retrograde signaling can now be viewed as more than bilateral communication between organelles and the nucleus as it can act cooperatively with hormone signaling and influence broader physiological outcomes in specialized cells and multiple tissues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material, growth and stress treatments</title><p>Seeds were germinated in soil and kept at 4°C for three days to synchronize germination.

Ion fluxes were measured for 10 min in the control to ensure steady initial values before adding 500 µM ABA and PAP and 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> for another 50 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Oocyte voltage clamps</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings using Xenopus laevis oocytes were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Honsbein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grefen et al., 2010</xref>). Constructs with SLAC1, OST1, CDPK32, CDPK34, CRK2, and CRK8 were cloned in an oocyte expression vector. Plasmids were linearized and capped cRNA was synthesized in vitro using T7 mMessage mMachine (Ambion). cRNA quality as a single band was confirmed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. cRNA was mixed to ensure equimolar ratios unless otherwise noted. SLAC1 and OST1 were co-injected in a ratio of 3:1; SLAC1 and individual CDPKs/CRKs were co-injected in a ratio of 2:1. To ensure uniform injections of transcripts, mixtures were made up to a standard volume as necessary with RNase-free water. Stage V and VI oocytes were isolated from mature Xenopus, and the follicular cell layer was digested with 2 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> collagenase (type 1A; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hr. Oocytes were incubated in 96-well plates with ND96 (in mM: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4) for overnight before injection. Around 25 ng of SLAC1 cRNA (with OST1) were injected into each oocyte. Injected oocytes were incubated in ND96 supplemented with gentamycin (5 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>) at 18°C for 3 d before electrophysiological recordings. Whole-cell currents were recorded under voltage clamp using an Axoclamp 2B two-electrode clamp circuit (Axon Instruments). Measurements were performed in I<sub>anion</sub> measuring solution (in mM: 48 CsCl, 48 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 MES/TRIS, pH 5.6) for SLAC1 expressing oocytes. The voltage clamp protocols were set at: holding at 0 mV for 1 s, activation at +50 mV for 10 s, testing from +50 to −130 mV for 11 8 s cycles, and holding at 0 mV for 1 s (20 s cycles for SLAC1). All Xenopus experiments received ethical approval (Animal Ethics Application # S-2014–192, University of Adelaide).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Chemilumiscence detection of ROS burst in plant leaf pieces</title><p>Leaves from healthy three-week old Arabidopsis plants were cut into small pieces using a leaf punch and floated on deionized water in individual wells of a 96-well plate overnight at room temperature.

Instead, they were incubated in a fixation solution (2% formaldehyde solution, 63% ethanol, 5% acetic acid) on a microscope slide (Sigma Aldrich, USA). After fixation, the formaldehyde was removed by rinsing the peels with two wash solutions (A: 63% ethanol, 5% acetic acid; B. 0.01M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.13M NaCl). Subsequently, the epidermal peels were DNAse treated using Ambion TURBO DNAse (LifeTechnologies, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

In limited cases where just two sample groups of interest were compared, the two-sample student’s t-test assuming equal variance was used. Statistical procedures were carried out using the GraphPadInStat software (version 3.06), unless otherwise stated.</p><p>For stomatal aperture measurements, R (version 3.1.3) was used for statistical analyses, performing an ANOVA to test for significant differences (p&lt;0.05) in relative pore area between treatments at each time point using the aov function, as part of the R ‘stats’ package, and modelling stomatal closure (X) with a nested model (timepoint nested within treatment: X ~ Treatment/Timepoint). Additionally, to look at rates of closure, a mixed-effect model was produced taking into account random effects between stomata nested with peels: X ~ Timepoint * Treatment + Peel.ID/Stomate.ID. This model observed only timepoints 10–25 min as this was considered to be the predominant period of stomata closure. This was conducted using the lmer function from the lme4 package (used alongside the lmerTest package which influences the tests performed by the lmer function). Importantly, for these analyses, each stomate was considered to represent a single biological unit. This assumption was confirmed from the mixed effect model produced, which demonstrated that the variation that occurred between stomata from a single epidermal peel (0.1779) was comparable to the variation observed between epidermal peels (0.2490) for a particular treatment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank J Schroeder (UC San Diego), S Assmann (Penn State Univ), I Small (Univ.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Larkin (Reviewer #1); Markus Teige (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Pornsiriwong et al. communicate a major conceptual advance to the plastid-to-nucleus signaling and drought tolerance demonstrating that PAP signaling promotes drought tolerance by restoring the ability of ABA to promote the closure of the stomata by activating a noncanonical ABA signaling mechanism. The reviewers thought that the genetics were done with a fair amount of rigor, suggesting that indeed the SAL1-PAP pathway is responsible for this effect and further studies show clearly that PAP itself acts as signal for stomatal closure. The array of phenotypic assays: measurements of ion fluxes, ROS production and large-scale transcriptional analysis was considered impressive. The reviewers concur with the conclusion that the chloroplastic PAP pathway can act in guard cells to prime or enhance ABA responses and also acts in seeds, which lack mature plastids, to regulate germination. The data may present clues as to how Ca signals are primed in guard cells. Overall, reviewers felt that the work offers some exciting new insights into how plastid derived signals may prime ABA and Ca signalling in guard cells</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A question remains about if the signalling role of the PAP bypass is mediated by the CPKs 32 and 34 or CRKs2 and 8 – are those also upregulated in the <italic>ost1-2 xrn2-1 xrn3-3</italic> mutant? In their Discussion the authors seem also to favour this explanation of the transcriptional regulation of the &quot;alternative kinases&quot;. Why was this not been tested directly?</p><p>2) The discussion about ABA needs to be more focused, less time spent on discussing elevated ABA and more of the mode of action of PAP in this bypass – does PAP directly activate downstream ABA signalling components, for example it might bind to some factors and regulate their activity – or does it mediate a transcriptional upregulation of other kinases, which are normally lower expressed and then take over this function?</p><p>3) Include the model in the main manuscript and to make the possibilities (above) a bit clearer.</p><p>4) The use of the dominant <italic>abi1-1</italic> in this work means that some results should be interpreted with caution. For example, previous work (Schroeder lab) gives precedent for PAP to prime ABA/Ca signalling, with ABA induced increases in Ca then bypassing the SNRKs. However, the same study also shows that PP2Cs (ABI1) can dephosphorylate SLAC1, specifically OST1 and CPK-mediated phosphorylation. This is problematic given that the allele used in this study is <italic>abi1-1</italic>, which is dominant and so might be expected to negate any PAP-CPK activation of SLAC1. However, this result (ABI1 dephosphorylation of SLAC1) is itself at odds with other literature and so is not conclusive.</p><p>5) The underlying reason for lowered stomatal conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) needs to be investigated further. The conductance data in 1B might be due to significantly smaller stomata, which is supported by the higher cell densities and yet only a marginal per area increase in pore area per leaf area. Perhaps, stomatal bioassays (such as in 2A) using a range of ABA and Ca would help determine whether increase PAP in sal1-8 primes guard cells increases the sensitivity or dynamics to ABA and Ca. In this instance, the double mutants (<italic>sal1-8</italic> and <italic>abi1-1</italic> or <italic>ost1-2</italic>) are perhaps less informative as they are perturbed in a major branch of guard cell ABA signalling. However, here the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B/C</xref> is perhaps clearer and supportive of PAP increasing sensitivity to ABA (though ABA content of these seeds is not shown).</p><p>6) The potential for many of the observed responses to be due to PAPs interaction with the nuclear XRNs, rather than another role in Ca (dotted line in Figure 7—figure supplement 1) could be supported better by, for example, performing the same analyses with <italic>ost1-2 xrn2 xrn3</italic> as were done with the <italic>ost1-2sal1-8</italic> mutant to further support the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23361.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) A question remains about if the signalling role of the PAP bypass is mediated by the CPKs 32 and 34 or CRKs2 and 8 – are those also upregulated in the ost1-2 xrn2-1 xrn3-3 mutant? In their Discussion the authors seem also to favour this explanation of the transcriptional regulation of the &quot;alternative kinases&quot;. Why was this not been tested directly?</italic> </p><p>Thanks for this request.</p><p>Action: We have now tested the expression of the CDPKs in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>xrn2</italic>-1 <italic>xrn3</italic>-3. The new panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, shows that all four CDPKs are indeed significantly up-regulated in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>xrn2</italic>-1 <italic>xrn3</italic>-3, with the extent of up-regulation being strikingly similar to that in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8. The up-regulation of these CDPKs is also accompanied by restoration of ABA-responsiveness at multiple levels in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>xrn2</italic>-1 <italic>xrn3</italic>-3 (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and Essential revision #6 below), thus supporting our hypothesis that PAP is indeed mediating the bypass of OST1 through up-regulation of these CDPKs.</p><p><italic>2) The discussion about ABA needs to be more focused, less time spent on discussing elevated ABA and more of the mode of action of PAP in this bypass – does PAP directly activate downstream ABA signalling components, for example it might bind to some factors and regulate their activity – or does it mediate a transcriptional upregulation of other kinases, which are normally lower expressed and then take over this function?</italic> </p><p>Done. We agree with the reviewer request and the additional requested data has aided in fulfilling the request.</p><p>Actions:</p><p>A) We have shortened the discussion on elevated ABA as suggested, while retaining the key points.</p><p>B) As stated in the response to Essential revision #1, the CDPKs capable of activating SLAC1 that are up-regulated in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 are also similarly up-regulated in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>xrn2</italic>-1 <italic>xrn3</italic>-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This up-regulation correlates with restoration of ABA responses at the level of ion fluxes, ROS burst, stomatal closure and increased leaf temperature in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>xrn2</italic>-1 <italic>xrn3</italic>-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and Essential revision #6).</p><p>B) We now clarify in the Discussion that based on our data, PAP acts in ABA signaling largely <italic>via</italic> XRNs to mediate a transcriptional up-regulation of kinases that are normally lowly-expressed. The possibility that PAP may target other proteins viadirect binding is also addressed in the Discussion and the model figure.</p><p><italic>3) Include the model in the main manuscript and to make the possibilities (above) a bit clearer.</italic> </p><p>Done.</p><p>Action: The model is now included in the main manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, and the different possible modes of PAP action have been clarified both in the Discussion text and in the model.</p><p><italic>4) The use of the dominant abi1-1 in this work means that some results should be interpreted with caution. For example, previous work (Schroeder lab) gives precedent for PAP to prime ABA/Ca signalling, with ABA induced increases in Ca then bypassing the SNRKs. However, the same study also shows that PP2Cs (ABI1) can dephosphorylate SLAC1, specifically OST1 and CPK-mediated phosphorylation. This is problematic given that the allele used in this study is abi1-1, which is dominant and so might be expected to negate any PAP-CPK activation of SLAC1. However, this result (ABI1 dephosphorylation of SLAC1) is itself at odds with other literature and so is not conclusive.</italic> </p><p>Done. This is a good point. It is possible that the complementation in <italic>abi1</italic>-1 does not proceed through CDPKs alone but additionally require other Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling proteins and/or transcription factors that are also up-regulated by PAP.</p><p>Action: We have now addressed the conflicting literature in the Discussion and explicitly consider whether up-regulation of CDPKs can complement <italic>abi1</italic>-1 through phosphorylation of SLAC1. In our view, the dominant effect of the ABI1-1 phosphatase is evident in the partial complementation of <italic>abi1</italic>-1 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 compared to the relatively complete complementation observed in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8.</p><p><italic>5) The underlying reason for lowered stomatal conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) needs to be investigated further. The conductance data in 1B might be due to significantly smaller stomata, which is supported by the higher cell densities and yet only a marginal per area increase in pore area per leaf area. Perhaps, stomatal bioassays (such as in 2A) using a of ABA and Ca would help determine whether increase PAP in range sal1-8 primes guard cells increases the sensitivity or dynamics to ABA and Ca. In this instance, the double mutants (sal1-8 and abi1-1 or ost1-2) are perhaps less informative as they are perturbed in a major branch of guard cell ABA signalling. However, here the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B/C</xref> is perhaps clearer and supportive of PAP increasing sensitivity to ABA (though ABA content of these seeds is not shown).</italic> </p><p>Done. Our new results on both leaf peels and intact plants indicate that PAP accumulation in <italic>sal1</italic>-8 does lead to hypersensitivity to endogenous ABA; and this is more likely to be the cause of the observed lowered <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> in <italic>sal1</italic>-8 under control conditions rather than smaller stomata.</p><p>Action: We treated epidermal leaf peels and intact whole plants with a range of ABA concentrations. In both systems we observed that <italic>sal1</italic>-8 plants are indeed more sensitive to ABA compared to WT, with the stomata of the mutant closing more than WT in response to ABA in a dose-responsive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) The potential for many of the observed responses to be due to PAPs interaction with the nuclear XRNs, rather than another role in Ca (dotted line in Figure 7—figure supplement 1) could be supported better by, for example, performing the same analyses with ost1-2 xrn2 xrn3 as were done with the ost1-2sal1-8 mutant to further support the discussion.</italic> </p><p>Done. Our new results indicate that PAP can regulate stomatal closure through its interaction with nuclear XRNs.</p><p>Actions:</p><p>A) We now show that <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>xrn2</italic>-1 <italic>xrn3</italic>-3 also has up-regulation of CDPK expression to similar extent to that observed in <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>sal1</italic>-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>B) We now show that <italic>ost1</italic>-2 <italic>xrn2</italic>-1 <italic>xrn3</italic>-3 has restored ABA responsiveness at multiple levels (ROS burst, ion fluxes, stomatal closure and increased leaf temperature).</p><p>C) We have removed the dotted line to Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the model. The possibility that PAP may target unknown proteins by direct binding (Essential revision #2) is also addressed in the model and in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
