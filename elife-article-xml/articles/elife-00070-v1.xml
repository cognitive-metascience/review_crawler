This phenomenon underlies the ability of our brains to develop properly and to learn, and also enables various sensory systems—including the visual, auditory and olfactory systems—to perform optimally in diverse environments.</p><p>In most mammals, a high-functioning olfactory system is essential for carrying out tasks that are crucial for survival, such as finding food, avoiding predators and mating. In general, sensory systems have to decipher only a limited collection of stimuli, but the olfactory system must be able to process information from thousands of distinct odors that are found in a given environment and which may vary dramatically from one environment to the next. Each odor-sensing neuron in the nose of a mammal contains just one kind of odorant receptor protein, although mammalian genomes typically encode 1000 or so different kinds of receptor proteins. This suggests that it might be possible to ‘tune’ the olfactory system to a particular environment by changing the relative numbers of the different types of neurons. Indeed, it is known that the relative abundance of each type of odor-sensing neuron changes with age and experience, and that these changes might be caused by variations in the lifespans of the neurons.</p><p>Although our understanding of how these experience-dependent changes are orchestrated at the molecular level is far from complete, it is clear that adjustments in the levels of specific gene products is necessary. But how do experiences alter the levels of gene products to give rise to lasting changes in the brain? One hypothesis is that changes to a structure called chromatin are key to this process: chromatin is an assembly of DNA molecules, which are quite long, and organizing proteins, mostly proteins known as histones, that together form a compact structure that can fit inside the nucleus of a cell.</p><p>Santoro and Dulac have now discovered a previously uncharacterized protein called H2BE that is found only in the odor-sensing neurons of mice. H2BE is a variant of a protein called H2B, which is a well-known histone. They found that in odor-sensing neurons, H2BE replaces H2B to an extent that depends on the amount of activity experienced by the neuron: H2BE is nearly undetectable in highly active neurons, but almost completely replaces H2B in neurons that are inactive. Moreover, genetic manipulation showed that the deletion of H2BE significantly extended the lifespan of neurons, whereas elevated levels of H2BE shortened their lifespan. These findings reveal an extraordinary process that involves inactive odor-sensing neurons being depleted relative to active ones over time.</p><p>How does H2BE, which differs from H2B by just five amino acids, cause such dramatic changes in neuronal composition? One hint comes from evidence that these amino acids disrupt interactions between chromatin and ‘effector’ proteins, which modulate gene activity. Consistent with this, Santoro and Dulac have found that the replacement of H2B by H2BE strongly alters gene activity, although the precise mechanism by which these alterations regulate neuronal lifespans remains to be determined. Understanding this process in detail, and exploring if similar phenomena are involved in experience-dependent changes elsewhere in the nervous system, are fascinating areas of future research.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00070.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00070.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>histone</kwd><kwd>olfactory</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DC011117</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dulac</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC009019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dulac</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dulac</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1003528.02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santoro</surname><given-names>Stephen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genome-organizing protein that is present only in the olfactory system of mice has been found to orchestrate changes in the relative numbers of different odor-sensing neurons on the basis of how active these neurons are.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cellular composition and connectivity of vertebrate sensory systems are shaped by signals from the external environment. These activity-dependent changes occur during critical windows of neuronal development as well as in the adult brain, enabling the animal to best perform in a given environment. Pioneering experiments in the visual system showed that patterns of light stimuli reaching each of the two eyes are essential for the activity-dependent refinement of ocular dominance columns in the visual cortex during perinatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hubel and Wiesel, 1977</xref>). Similarly, experience-dependent plasticity has been shown to participate in the functional maturation of other sensory systems, including the auditory, somatosensory, and olfactory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hensch, 2004</xref>). In addition to their important role in shaping sensory circuits during development, environmental stimuli can also significantly affect adult brain structures, leading to adaptive as well as maladaptive changes in sensory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buonomano and Merzenich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ramachandran and Hirstein, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moseley and Flor, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Experience-dependent changes in sensory systems alter the cellular composition of sensory relays, as well as the excitability and synaptic connections of neurons involved in processing sensory information. Although a molecular-level understanding of these changes is far from complete, synaptic refinement and activity-dependent transcriptional changes appear to play prominent roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dulac, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riccio, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">West and Greenberg, 2011</xref>).</p><p>To date, activity-dependent structural remodeling of sensory systems has primarily been demonstrated in the central nervous system rather than in peripheral organs. The mouse main olfactory epithelium (MOE) offers a unique opportunity to investigate the range and mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity within a peripheral sensory tissue, where the primary sensory detection occurs. The MOE detects large arrays of chemical cues through the expression of a large family of olfactory receptor (OR) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>). Individual olfactory neurons express a single OR allele chosen through a largely stochastic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chess et al., 1994</xref>). The olfactory epithelium of mammals displays continuous neurogenesis throughout adulthood, such that a slow dividing olfactory neural stem cell population continuously replaces mature olfactory neurons that have variable, though finite, life spans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondo et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We identified a histone H2B variant, <italic>H2be</italic>, which is exclusively expressed by olfactory sensory neurons, and we hypothesized may participate in olfactory neuron gene regulation. We show that <italic>H2be</italic> displays activity-dependent expression, and that it regulates the transcriptional program and life span of olfactory sensory neurons. Our data suggest that <italic>H2be</italic> participates in a pathway that shapes the cellular and molecular composition of the olfactory epithelium based on signals from the external environment, and thus uncover a novel chromatin-based mechanism for activity-dependent neuronal plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>H2BE is an olfactory-specific, replication-independent histone variant</title><p>A molecular and bioinformatics search for genes expressed differentially in neuronal subpopulations of the mouse MOE and VNO led to the identification of an uncharacterized H2B histone variant (symbol: <italic>Hist2h2be</italic>; named for its position (e) among H2B-encoding genes within mouse histone cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marzluff et al., 2002</xref>) and referred to herein as <italic>H2be</italic>).

Initial expression analyses revealed that <italic>H2be</italic> mRNA and protein levels are not uniform among olfactory neurons. Rather, neurons with variable expression levels appear intermingled, and apically-located neurons generally display the highest levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1A and 2B</xref>).

We then used quantitative fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waters, 2009</xref>) (see ‘Materials and methods’) to assess the level of FLAG-H2BE within nuclei of the identified neurons relative to their surrounding neuronal field, imaged in tissue sections spanning the length of the MOE, and across multiple animals (<italic>n</italic> ≥ 2 per OR). Strikingly, each OR tested appears consistently and reproducibly associated with a stereotyped level of H2BE in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>).

To determine if defects in OR mRNA levels originate from differences in the frequency of OR expression in the MOE, in the cellular level of OR transcripts in individual neurons, or in both, we analyzed the expression of specific ORs by RNA FISH. For each of four ORs quantified, expression differences in H2be-KO and WT mice strongly correlate with differences in OR frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>) and not cellular levels (not shown). Remarkably, expression differences observed for various ORs in H2be-KO and WT mice were also found to correlate with the level of H2BE with which they are normally co-expressed: ORs with increased expression in H2be-KO mice are associated with high levels of H2BE, while ORs with decreased or unchanged expression appear associated with low H2BE levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ectopic over-expression of <italic>H2be</italic> alters OR expression frequencies</title><p>Changes in the representation of neurons expressing specific ORs upon loss of <italic>H2be</italic> led us to predict that ectopic over-expression of <italic>H2be</italic> might also affect OR frequencies.

High-resolution confocal imaging of neuronal nuclei in the MOE of Flag-H2be mice revealed that H2BE is not confined to nuclear puncta, but rather is widely distributed throughout the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13D</xref>). Analysis of H2BE localization by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in MOE neurons confirmed its wide distribution and revealed a slight enrichment near gene promoters, especially in genes highly expressed in mature olfactory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13E</xref>). Interestingly, these analyses and subsequent qPCR experiments revealed that the protein-coding regions of histone genes are particularly enriched for H2BE, while those of OR and vomeronasal receptor (VR) genes are relatively devoid of the variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13F–H</xref>). Because the ChIP input was obtained from a heterogeneous mixture of MOE nuclei and approximately 99.9% of OR alleles and all VR alleles are silent in a given olfactory neuron, the latter results may reflect the lower accessibility of silent OR and VR loci for replacement of canonical H2B by H2BE, perhaps due to the highly compacted nature of these loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Magklara et al., 2011</xref>).

We analyzed three relatively well-characterized H2B PTMs: mono-methylation and acetylation of lysine 5 (Lys5-Me and Lys5-Ac), which lies close to the H2BE variant residue P3L, and ubiquitination of lysine 120 (Lys120-Ub), near the variant residue S124A. Both H2B-Lys5 PTMs have been shown to be positively correlated with transcriptional activity, with Lys5-Me and Lys5-Ac enriched within transcribed and promoter regions, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).

Using an ELISA assay, we ruled out the possibility that the polyclonal antibody against H2B-Lys5-Me is incompatible with the H2BE sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14C</xref>). To determine if there is a causal link between the seemingly mutually exclusive expression of H2BE and H2B-Lys5-Me, we examined the prevalence of H2B-Lys5-Me in H2be-KO and H2be-GF mice. Remarkably, loss of <italic>H2be</italic> leads to widespread H2B-Lys5-Me immunoreactivity in H2be-KO MOEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14D</xref>), while over-expression of H2BE further reduces H2B-Lys5-Me staining in H2BE-positive nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14E</xref>). Western analysis of MOE lysates from Flag-H2be mice provided a biochemical confirmation that the Lys5-Me modification is absent from the tagged H2BE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14F</xref>). Together, our results suggest that, unlike canonical H2B, H2BE does not undergo detectable mono-methylation at Lys5 and that, consequently, replacement of H2B by H2BE causes a direct reduction of the Lys5-Me modification in H2BE expressing cells. Interestingly, we observe an increase in the number of H2BE expressing neurons, and in H2BE level in individual cells in the MOEs of older animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14G–I</xref>). This is supported by western analysis, which revealed that the overall level of H2BE in the MOE doubles from 7 weeks to 45 weeks (approximately 10 months) of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14J</xref>). In addition, we observe that the mutual exclusion between H2BE and H2B-Lys5-Me dramatically increases with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14G–I</xref>), indicating the gradual replacement of canonical H2B by H2BE, which proceeds to near-completion in a fraction of neurons by 36 weeks (approximately 8.5 months) of age.

These findings uncover a novel mechanism by which the sensory experience of a neuron is recorded within its chromatin to affect its transcriptional program and longevity.</p><p>The mammalian olfactory epithelium has the unusual property of persistent neuronal self-renewal throughout adult life. Thus, the repertoire of expressed ORs in the MOE is determined by the combined probabilities associated with the choice of a specific OR by olfactory neuron precursors and the subsequent longevity of those neurons. OR gene choice has been shown to obey a largely stochastic process influenced by the genomic context of local enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mori and Sakano, 2011</xref>). In contrast, olfactory life span appears variable and may be influenced by environmental factors such as pathogens and odorant stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondo et al., 2010</xref>). Our data uncover a chromatin-based pathway in which the absence of odor-evoked activity of specific MOE neuronal populations leads to increased H2BE expression, and in turn changes in transcription and reduced neuronal life span. In addition to a pro-apoptotic role of high levels of H2BE, we cannot exclude other roles for this olfactory-specific histone variant at low or moderate levels. Indeed our data indicate that neurons that are normally highly active and therefore express low levels of H2BE increase in abundance following olfactory deprivation, an effect that is diminished in H2be-KO mice. This result may be due to a compensatory increase of the low-H2BE expressing cells following olfactory deprivation, but could also indicate that a modest level of H2BE is optimal for neuronal longevity. In addition, our findings that changes in transcription and OR frequency following unilateral naris occlusion are significantly reduced but not eliminated in H2be-KO mice indicate that H2BE plays a key role in modulating activity dependent changes, but is likely part of a larger pathway.</p><p>The transcription factor CREB has been shown to play a major role in orchestrating transcriptional changes associated with activity-dependent neuronal plasticity and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lyons and West, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">West and Greenberg, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, a previous study showing enhanced longevity of odor-stimulated adenovirus-infected olfactory neurons implicated CREB as the mediator of this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watt et al., 2004</xref>). The absence of full CRE sites in the <italic>H2be</italic> gene does not permit the establishment of a direct functional link between the activity of a CREB family member such as ICER and H2BE levels at this point, but other indirect signaling pathways may exist. An alternative scenario would postulate the existence of a cAMP-regulated chaperone that exchanges canonical H2B and H2BE.</p><p>In addition to odor-stimulated neuronal activity, olfactory neurons have been shown to display heterogeneous levels of ligand-independent, OR-derived basal activity that vary according to OR identity and are critical for regulating cAMP signals involved in axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Imai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mori and Sakano, 2011</xref>). Such studies suggest the possibility that ligand-independent, OR-derived basal signaling may also contribute to the overall activity level in mature olfactory neurons, especially under laboratory housing conditions where the odor repertoire is minimal. This scenario would help explain the observation that loss of <italic>Adcy3</italic>, which eliminates both basal and odor-stimulated activity, appears to affect <italic>H2be</italic> levels more dramatically than olfactory deprivation through UNO, which is expected to only eliminate odor-evoked activity. Thus, along with odor-evoked activity, OR-derived basal activity may be a significant contributor to the control of H2BE levels and, in turn, of olfactory neuronal longevity.</p><p>H2BE joins a list of molecules with known activity-dependent expression in olfactory neurons, many of which have roles in axon guidance and refinement. These include NRP1, KIRREL2, and EPHA5, which are up-regulated, and SEMA3A, KIRREL3, and EFNA5, which are down-regulated by neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Imai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Serizawa et al., 2006</xref>). Like SEMA3A, H2BE levels are reduced via cAMP-dependent/ Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent signaling, but unlike the other known activity dependent molecules, which are generally expressed in either immature or mature neurons, H2BE is expressed in both. The unusual regulation of H2BE expression likely reflects the variant's unique function in olfactory neurons.</p><p>How do the five amino acid differences between H2BE and H2B convey such distinct functional attributes? Studies of H3.3, a histone variant that differs with canonical H3 by merely four amino acids and that plays a critical role in embryonic development and gene expression in adulthood, illustrate how small sequence variations in histones can generate distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elsaesser et al., 2010</xref>). Our analyses of relative PTM levels for H2BE and canonical H2B at a handful of known PTM sites suggest that incorporation of the variant could affect cellular transcription at least in part via differential post-translational modifiability. It must be acknowledged, however, that as is true for most histone PTMs, evidence that the PTMs affected by H2BE replacement play a role in transcription is merely correlative and therefore insufficient to support a strong functional prediction. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the idea that H2BE shortens neuronal life span via changes in cellular transcription and metabolism, likely over the time course of several days or weeks, although the precise mechanism for this process remains to be determined. Notably, although phosphorylation of H2B Ser14 has been associated with short trigger of apoptosis in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheung et al., 2003</xref>), we have not found evidence for involvement of H2BE in this pathway (not shown).</p><p>The extensive activity-dependent shifts in the OR repertoire that we observe complement previous studies reporting experience-dependent sensitivity enhancements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hudson, 1999</xref>) and changes in the sensory neuron representation within the MOE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones et al., 2008</xref>). A scenario thus emerges according to which neurons expressing ORs associated with environmentally salient odors are frequently active and may increase in relative abundance over time due to enhanced longevity, while neurons expressing infrequently activated ORs have a shortened life span, mediated in part by H2BE, and become less abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Differential longevity among olfactory sensory may provide an effective mechanism by which individuals with similar genomes adapt to diverse olfactory environments, facilitating enhanced sensitivity to odors important for survival. Accordingly, we observed significant impairment of olfactory learning behavior in H2be-KO mice, although it remains to be determined whether these defects are due to aberrant OR expression frequencies resulting from the lack of H2BE expression or, alternatively, to the altered expression of other genes involved in olfactory neuron signaling.</p><p>Among the more than 30 histone variants encoded in the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marzluff et al., 2002</xref>) only a handful have so far been characterized in terms of expression and function.

In an initial experiment, mice were challenged to discriminate between hexanol and hexanoic acid, and in a second experiment, were challenged with the two stereoisomers of carvone. Prior to the initial experiment, mice were trained to obtain water from two ports unconditionally (day 1), after first poking an odor port (days 2–5), after poking an odor port presenting isoamyl-acetate odor (days 6–13), and after only a single poke of an odor port presenting isoamyl-acetate odor (days 14–20). Odor discrimination training began on day 21. Odors streams, controlled by an olfactometer, were generated from air passed through a filter containing 10% of the concentrated odorant in mineral oil and diluted 1:20 into a stream of clean air.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank N.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of <italic>eLife's</italic> Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports. Our goal is to provide the essential revision requirements as a single set of instructions, so that you have a clear view of the revisions that are necessary for us to publish your work.</p><p>This manuscript describes thorough investigations of the expression and function of a histone H2 variant H2BE, which is specifically expressed in the olfactory and vomeronasal neurons and appears regulated by neuronal activity. H2BE is co-expressed with a subset of odorant receptors (ORs). Genetic loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses support the model that H2BE regulates the OR expression landscape by affecting the longevity of sensory neurons. These experiments provide compelling evidence for a novel and highly interesting phenomenon and its underlying mechanisms: lack of sensory activity over a period of weeks induces the expression of H2BE, which in turn promotes the elimination of less-used OR populations. This selection allows mice to optimize the OR repertoire for their environment. The findings are also exciting for the chromatin biology field, since only few histone variants have been studied so far in a biologically relevant context.</p><p>The topic is of broad interest and the experiments are well documented. Although the key mechanism of regulating neuronal longevity by the broadly distributing H2BE in the nucleus is still unknown, this manuscript provides the basis for future studies of H2BE function. Thus, the paper should be published pending a few key experiments:</p><p>1. There is a concern whether the BAC transgenic H2BE faithfully follows the expression of the endogenous H2BE. Recently published microarray analysis of the different developmental stages of the OE shows high levels of H2BE even before the NeuroD positive stage (e.g., Nickell et al: J Comp Neurol. 2012 Aug 15;520(12):2608-29. doi: 10.1002/cne.23052). The authors should show the authenticity of the H2BE transgene expression by crossing the BAC transgenic to the mCherry knock-in allele and compare their expression pattern.</p><p>2. A question has been raised whether the Flag-H2BE is nucleosomal. Indeed histones can be incorporated in the nucleosomes in a replication independent manner but we do not know if this happens in post-mitotic olfactory neurons. In the majority of the IFs presented here H2BE forms a distinct ring on the nuclear envelope with little signal on the nucleoplasm. Thus it is possible that the transgenic H2BE is expressed too late, differentiation-wise, and cannot be incorporated in nucleosomes as efficiently as the endogenous histone. The Chip analysis does not really alleviate this concern because it uses crosslinked chromatin. A simple answer to this question would be to generate native mononucleosomes from the olfactory epithelium and show that FLAG-H2BE is incorporated in these nucleosomes, or that it can be co-immunoprecipitated with histones H3 and H4 again from native nucleosomal preparations. The same should be also done with the OMP-driven transgene. Also the authors should provide some information on the relative levels of free vs nucleosomal FLAG-H2BE in each genotype (for example they can perform salt dialysis on OE nuclei – only free histones would be extracted).</p><p>3. It is suggested that the authors take out all the information regarding the modification status of this histone variant (since it is not clear what are the effects of Lys-5 methylation in transcription anyways) or the relationship with paused or elongating polII (the images are not very convincing and they do not really provide much insight regarding the role of this histone variant). Since the biology described here is so interesting, it is better to omit preliminary or inconclusive mechanistic data and replace them with the supplemental figures from the olfactory bulb.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00070.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1.

The authors should show the authenticity of the H2BE transgene expression by crossing the BAC transgenic to the mCherry knock-in allele and compare their expression pattern</italic>.</p><p>Based on a published report suggesting an onset of H2BE expression prior to NeuroD, the reviewers express the important concern that our H2be:Flag-H2be transgene may not fully recapitulate the endogenous H2be expression and that the endogenous gene may be initiated at an earlier developmental stage than described in our manuscript, which would potentially invalidate some of our conclusions. We have addressed this concern in multiple ways by demonstrating that (A) the transgenic and endogenous H2be genes display a similar expression onset and (B) NeuroD-positive progenitors do not yet express the endogenous H2be gene, which emerges at a later stage of olfactory neuronal differentiation. Finally, we offer a slightly different interpretation of the data in Nickell et al, which is fully compatible with our conclusions (C)</p><p>A. To directly examine the similarity of expression between the H2be:Flag-H2be transgene and the endogenous <italic>H2be</italic> gene, we analyzed the colocalization of FLAG-H2BE protein and <italic>H2be</italic> mRNA using combined IF and ISH. A representative image from this experiment (newly included as Figure 2E) demonstrates a strong agreement between cellular levels of FLAG-H2BE protein and <italic>H2be</italic> mRNA, despite the different cellular localization of the protein and RNA. The observation of occasional basally-located neurons in which <italic>H2be</italic> mRNA can be detected but FLAG-H2BE cannot is likely the expected result of a slight lag in protein production following the onset of <italic>H2be</italic> transcription in immature neurons. These results confirm previous expression data showing highly similar staining patterns for the FLAG-H2BE and endogenous <italic>H2be</italic> (e.g., Figure 1A and Figure 2B). Together with the RT-qPCR data showing identical RNA expression levels for the transgenic and endogenous alleles (Figure 2D), we believe that these data strongly suggest faithful recapitulation of endogenous <italic>H2be</italic> gene expression by the H2be:Flag-H2be transgene. Of note, we also performed the experiment suggested by the reviewers (crossing <italic>the BAC transgenic to the mCherry knock-in allele and compare their expression pattern),</italic> but have not included the data as the presence of membrane-bound mCherry in axons crossing the basal layer of the olfactory epithelium, in addition to the cell bodies, makes it impossible to obtain a clear cellular resolution of H2BE expression onset by immunostaining or intrinsic fluorescence.</p><p>B. To further confirm our previous findings of the lack of co-expression of <italic>H2be</italic> and <italic>Neurod1</italic> at the protein level (based on FLAG-H2BE protein expression in Flag-H2be transgenic mice; Figure 6B), we also examined a potential overlap between endogenous <italic>H2be</italic> and <italic>Neurod1</italic> at the mRNA level in wild type mice. A representative image of this experiment (newly included as Figure 6C) clearly demonstrates the complete absence of overlap between the expression patterns of the two mRNAs, strongly supporting our conclusion that the onset of <italic>H2be</italic> expression strictly follows and does not include the developmental window of <italic>Neurod1</italic> expression.</p><p>C. We are grateful to the reviewers for drawing our attention to the recently published Nickell et al. paper, which we think is an excellent resource for understanding comprehensive gene expression changes that occur during olfactory development. After carefully reading the Nickell paper, however, we respectfully disagree with the reviewers’ interpretation that <italic>H2be</italic> is highly expressed prior to the onset of <italic>Neurod1.</italic> Although the authors of the Nickell paper used a transgenic GFP marker (called TgN1-2G) driven from the <italic>Ngn1</italic> promoter, which is active in neural progenitors, they found that the GFP levels are actually highest in immature neurons, not in earlier neural progenitor cells (i.e., when <italic>Neurod1</italic> is expressed). As stated by Nickell et al. (page 2612):</p><p>“Even if the TgN1-2G transgene is faithful to the expression pattern of the endogenous gene, rapid transition from immediate neuronal precursor basal cells into immature OSNs could result in fluorescent labeling primarily of immature OSNs. Consistent with this expectation, we found that the GFP fluorescence pattern consisted of only a few basal cells but many cells with fluorescent dendrites and axons—cells located at the depth of the immature OSN layer of the olfactory epithelium (Fig. 1C). This GFP fluorescence overlapped well with immunoreactivity for the immature OSN-specific marker Gap43, but not for the mature OSN-specific marker, Omp, confirming that the highly fluorescent cells were nearly all immature OSNs (Fig. 1C).”</p><p>Thus, the Nickell paper shows only that <italic>H2be</italic> is expressed at high levels in immature neurons (i.e., GAP43+), which is consistent with our data, but it gives no insight into its expression in neural progenitors.</p><p><italic>2.

We have addressed this concern in multiple ways, and have confirmed the largely chromatin-bound state of transgenic H2BE:</p><p>A. To directly investigate the extent to which FLAG-H2BE is chromatin-bound, we isolated unfixed MOE cell nuclei from Flag-H2be and H2be-GF transgenic mice and then fractionated the nuclei into soluble nucleoplasm and chromatin, based on a protocol published by the Fukagawa lab (Okada and Fukagawa, <italic>Protocol Exchange,</italic> 2006). We used two-color western analysis to compare the amount of FLAG-H2BE and H3 in the two fractions. An image of the immunoblot (newly included as Figure 13A) shows that FLAG-H2BE and H3 are present at very low levels in soluble nucleoplasm and are almost entirely chromatin bound.</p><p>B. To further investigate the association of H2BE with chromatin, we immunoprecipitated native mononucleosomes containing FLAG-H2BE from chromatin of transgenic Flag-H2be mice and analyzed the associated proteins by mass spectrometry and western. This experiment (summarized in the newly included Figure 13B) revealed a large number of chromatin-associated proteins that were immunoprecipitated with H2BE at the nucleosome level, including many other histone proteins. These results provide strong evidence that FLAG-H2BE is integrated into the chromatin of olfactory neurons.</p><p>C. In performing our genome-wide location analysis experiments, we measured the amount of DNA immunoprecipitated from chromatin of transgenic Flag-H2be mice using anti-FLAG and anti-H3 antibodies. These measurements (summarized in the newly included Figure 13C) show that both antibodies precipitate large quantities of DNA. These data further confirm that FLAG-H2BE is integrated into the chromatin of olfactory neurons.</p><p>D. There are two likely explanations for the appearance of a nuclear ring in some of our IF images: 1) olfactory neurons have a single or small number of large central chromocenters that are not stained with anti-FLAG antibodies, leading to the appearance of stronger staining on the nuclear periphery (for example, see Figure 13D). 2) The anti-FLAG antibody stains chromatin within the nuclear periphery more quickly than the euchromatin within the nuclear interior. This is particularly evident for MOE tissue from H2be-GF mice, where the level of Flag-H2be is much higher than in Flag-H2be mice (for example, Figure 14E). We have observed that more uniform staining throughout the nucleus is achieved with long antibody incubation times, indicating that the apparent peripheral staining is not due to concentration of FLAG-H2BE at the nuclear periphery.</p><p><italic>3. It is suggested that the authors take out all the information regarding the modification status of this histone variant (since it is not clear what are the effects of Lys-5 methylation in transcription anyways) or the relationship with paused or elongating polII (the images are not very convincing and they do not really provide much insight regarding the role of this histone variant). Since the biology described here is so interesting, it is better to omit preliminary or inconclusive mechanistic data and replace them with the supplemental figures from the olfactory bulb</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers suggest that we remove the data related to the differential PTM status of canonical and variant H2B and the data concerning the effects of H2BE on the elongation status of polII as they find them mechanistically uninformative (PTM) or weak (polII). As detailed below we agree with some of this assessment, and propose a compromise in which we keep what we view as the strongest and most important data, while downplaying some of their mechanistic implications in the text of the manuscript.</p><p>A. With respect to the findings that H2BE receives dramatically reduced monomethylation at Lys5 compared to canonical H2B, we agree with the reviewers that the biological implication is presently unknown. Although this modification has been strongly correlated with active transcription in other cell systems (Barski et al. 2007, Cell <italic>129,</italic> 823-837; Wang et al. 2008, Nature Genetics <italic>40,</italic> 897-903), a causative association has not been established. Moreover, since we did not survey all possible H2B modifications, our understanding of H2BE’s modification status is by no means complete. However, we are reluctant to entirely omit these data, as we believe that the finding represents an important proof of concept for potential functional differences between the two histones at the molecular level, which must be mediated by only five amino acid differences. We believe that the finding of reduced Lys5-Me modification serves as a platform for further investigations into the functional differences between the two molecules and possibly for understanding the biological function of the H2B-Lys5-Me modification. Thus, we wish to keep these data in the manuscript, but we have modified the text to emphasize that the finding is not an indication of mechanism.</p><p>B. With respect to our findings that H2BE causes reduced RNAPII elongation and increased pausing, we believe that the data presented are solid and significant, but we agree with the reviewer that they are less convincing, and that they be corroborated using other methods. Thus, we have removed this set of results entirely. Please note: we have eliminated or moved supplemental data to main figures, and in particular the images of the olfactory bulb to which the reviewers referred.</p></body></sub-article></article>
