In vertebrates, the optic tectum (superior colliculus) commands gaze shifts by synaptic integration of different sensory modalities. Recent works suggest that tectum can elaborate gaze reorientation commands on its own, rather than merely acting as a relay from upstream/forebrain circuits to downstream premotor centers. We show that tectal circuits can perform multisensory computations independently and, hence, configure final motor commands. Single tectal neurons receive converging visual and electrosensory inputs, as investigated in the lamprey - a phylogenetically conserved vertebrate. When these two sensory inputs overlap in space and time, response enhancement of output neurons occurs locally in the tectum, whereas surrounding areas and temporally misaligned inputs are inhibited. Retinal and electrosensory afferents elicit local monosynaptic excitation, quickly followed by inhibition via recruitment of GABAergic interneurons. Multisensory inputs can thus regulate event-detection within tectum through local inhibition without forebrain control.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16472.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16472.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16472.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many events occur around us simultaneously, which we detect through our senses. A critical task is to decide which of these events is the most important to look at in a given moment of time. This problem is solved by an ancient area of the brain called the optic tectum (known as the superior colliculus in mammals).</p><p>The different senses are represented as superimposed maps in the optic tectum. Events that occur in different locations activate different areas of the map. Neurons in the optic tectum combine the responses from different senses to direct the animal’s attention and increase how reliably important events are detected.</p><p>If an event is simultaneously registered by two senses, then certain neurons in the optic tectum will enhance their activity. By contrast, if two senses provide conflicting information about how different events progress, then these same neurons will be silenced. While this phenomenon of ‘multisensory integration’ is well described, little is known about how the optic tectum performs this integration.</p><p>Kardamakis, Pérez-Fernández and Grillner have now studied multisensory integration in fish called lampreys, which belong to the oldest group of backboned animals. These fish can navigate using electroreception – the ability to detect electrical signals from the environment. Experiments that examined the connections between neurons in the optic tectum and monitored their activity revealed a neural circuit that consists of two types of neurons: inhibitory interneurons, and projecting neurons that connect the optic tectum to different motor centers in the brainstem.</p><p>The circuit contains neurons that can receive inputs from both vision and electroreception when these senses are both activated from the same point in space. Incoming signals from the two senses activate the areas on the sensory maps that correspond to the location where the event occurred. This triggers the activity of the interneurons, which immediately send ‘stop’ signals. Thus, while an area of the sensory map and its output neurons are activated, the surrounding areas of the tectum are inhibited.</p><p>Overall, the findings presented by Kardamakis, Pérez-Fernández and Grillner suggest that the optic tectum can direct attention to a particular event without requiring input from other brain areas. This ability has most likely been preserved throughout evolution. Future studies will aim to determine how the commands generated by the optic tectum circuit are translated into movements.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16472.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16472.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>multisensory</kwd><kwd>microcircuit</kwd><kwd>optic tectum</kwd><kwd>lamprey</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VR-M-K2013-62X-03026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grillner</surname><given-names>Sten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7/2007-2013 under grant agreement no 604102 (HBP)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grillner</surname><given-names>Sten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VR-NT-621-2013-4613</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grillner</surname><given-names>Sten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grillner</surname><given-names>Sten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Signals conveyed from two different senses from a given point in space converge onto the same neurons of the optic tectum that trigger the gaze-control-system, and at the same time inhibit other parts of the tectal motor map.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensorimotor circuits have been studied in a wide range of biological organisms in pursuit of identifying the operational principles that govern the integration of sensory information from different modalities for the generation of goal-directed behavior. The optic tectum (superior colliculus in mammals), has received particular attention for its distinct role in orienting behavior, i.e. the control of orienting and avoidance gaze movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dean et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moschovakis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basso and Wurtz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sparks, 2002</xref>), through the integration of different sensory modalities (which are species-dependent) like vision, auditory and electroreception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bodznick and Northcutt, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meredith and Stein, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wallace et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gingras et al., 2009</xref>). Although combining multiple sensory inputs has been proposed to increase the reliability of event detection in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ernst and Banks, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fetsch et al., 2009</xref>), little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this integration.</p><p>Studies of the superior colliculus have established a set of empirical principles that place constraints on the spatial and temporal dimensions underlying multisensory integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stein and Stanford, 2008</xref>).

Conceptual and computational models of multisensory integration have proposed the existence of an inhibitory mechanism to account for these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rowland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarado et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ursino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohshiro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller et al., 2015</xref>), although they have so far remained hypothetical. The goal of this study is to determine the cellular and synaptic mechanisms embedded within the optic tectum that control multisensory integration.</p><p>In many vertebrates, vision and electroreception are the spatial senses that are used to localize predators and prey in their immediate environment, whereas other species also rely on auditory, somatosensory, infrared, echolocation and/or magnetic systems. These modalities are represented within the optic tectum and are used for orienting and avoidance behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hartline et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Semm and Demaine, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Valentine and Moss, 1997</xref>) in vertebrates extending from lampreys to primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wurtz and Albano, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nieuwenhuys and Nicholson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saitoh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asteriti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kardamakis et al., 2015</xref>). We have previously shown in the lamprey that site-specific stimulation across the deep layer of the optic tectum gives rise to eye-head gaze shifts of given amplitude and direction, thus, showing the existence of a motor map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saitoh et al., 2007</xref>). We now show that visual and electroreceptive inputs are integrated in the same deep layer neurons of the optic tectum, which provide the output to different brainstem centers. Projecting output neurons, as well as local interneurons, receive monosynaptic excitatory input from both sensory afferent pathways and also disynaptic inhibition triggered by the same afferents. This applies if the two signals are activated from the same point in space, whereas signals from surrounding areas provide only inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kardamakis et al., 2015</xref>). The membrane properties of the tectal output neurons ensure the temporal integration of bimodally triggered excitatory and inhibitory currents. Due to the highly conserved organization of the optic tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nieuwenhuys and Nicholson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saitoh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asteriti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kardamakis et al., 2015</xref>), we anticipate that the mechanisms of integration of two senses on single output neurons, as demonstrated here, may also apply to other vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spatial organization of sensory inputs and motor output in the optic tectum</title><p>The full projection patterns of tectal efferents to the brainstem and incoming visual and electroreceptive afferents arising from the retina and the octavolateral area in the intact brain was examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nieuwenhuys and Nicholson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ronan and Northcutt, 1987</xref>) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

Separate stimulation of visual inputs with brief pulses of light (500 ms duration) or electroreceptive inputs activated by electrical pulses (30 ms duration) led to bursts of activity in the output neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-i,ii</xref>, control traces). When the two sensory inputs were delivered in an overlapping temporal sequence, there was a marked enhancement of deep layer neural activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-iii</xref>, control; <italic>n = 6</italic>). To achieve an enhancement, the two stimuli had to be delivered to the same parts of the visual and electroreceptive fields, respectively.</p><p>To quantify the impact of stimulus strength on bimodal integration, we systematically varied the extent of visual and electrosensory activation by means of local electrical microstimulation of the retina and the anterior lateral line nerve, respectively (for further information, <italic>see</italic> Materials and methods).

Stimulation of the rostral branches of the anterior lateral line nerve would simulate electrosensory stimuli incoming from the frontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ronan and Northcutt, 1987</xref>). Varying stimulus durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) ranging from 50 μs to 1 ms were used to drive increasing tectal responses in the deep layer, which were measured from their rectified activity.

Unisensory inputs generated up to ~55% of the maximal bimodal response across the entire stimulus range. During bimodal activation, the combined response significantly exceeded the unimodal responses (visual-bimodal: p&lt;0.01; electrosensory-bimodal: p&lt;0.001 between 100–1000 μs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, black control trace).</p><p>Recently, we have shown how on-receptive field visual responses in tectal output layer neurons can be suppressed, via the local inhibitory system, by the presence of multiple visual stimuli located at disparate positions in the visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kardamakis et al., 2015</xref>). We now show that this unisensory response suppression can also be achieved by using multiple stimuli of different sensory modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Once a tectal region responsive to a local electroreceptive stimulus was established (red trace, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we were able to suppress the magnitude of the on-response (red trace) by delivering a stimulus to an off-response region of the retina (black trace). To confirm that the lack of activity in response to the visual stimulation (blue trace) was not due to unsuccessful stimulation, we performed control recordings in other tectal regions, as well as in downstream brainstem regions. An average response reduction of ~75% was observed during spatially misaligned cross-modal sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; red for electrosensory and black for bimodal stimulation; <italic>n = 5</italic>).

It is responsible for the suppression of stimuli with spatial and temporal offsets.</p><p>Recently, we have shown that on-receptive field retinal stimuli result in local excitation followed by feedforward inhibition, while off-field retinal stimulation yields only lateral inhibition, which is widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kardamakis et al., 2015</xref>). This inhibition is carried by short- and long-range connections spanning rostrocaudally and mediolaterally across the optic tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Phongphanphanee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kardamakis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). While this local inhibition can act independently for generating stimulus selection, it has also been suggested that exogenous sources are required for generating global inhibition via GABAergic neurons in the isthmic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mysore and Knudsen, 2013</xref>). Here, we show that inhibition hard-wired in the optic tectum via interneurons, that are activated from both retinal and electroreceptive afferents in the same way as the output neurons, is essential for multisensory stimulus selection. Notably, the two types of sensory inputs not only evoke excitation in tectal interneurons, but also trigger recurrent inhibition.</p><p>Our results suggest that spatiotopic organization in the optic tectum is columnar, with output neurons and interneurons receiving retinal excitation from the same quadrant, as suggested by their morphological features and the fact that the excitation is retinotopically arranged. However, the detailed arrangement of columnar structure and function has yet to be revealed. Sensory inputs provide monosynaptic drive to the deep layer output cells and to superficial layer interneurons. The latter, in turn, provide local and long-range inhibitory projections, therefore allowing for spatial sensory discrimination. This role of inhibition is observed in our extracellular recordings. Consistent with bimodal suppression in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meredith and Stein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kadunce et al., 1997</xref>), responses in on-field regions of tectum to electrosensory stimulation undergo a drastic reduction when delivering visual stimuli to other receptive fields of the tectal map. In the present study, we could not elicit the same sort of reduction in tectal areas responsive for visual stimulation when applying off-field electrosensory stimuli. One possibility is that electrosensory maps in the lamprey tectum are not as refined as the visual ones, and therefore inhibition is less effective suppressing off-regions. In this sense, it has been shown that electrosensory receptive fields in elasmobranchs tectum are much larger than the visual ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodznick, 1990</xref>). We cannot exclude either that the way we perform electrosensory stimulation is not as local as the visual one, making it less effective to evoke a similar reduction. Consistent with our previous findings, these data suggest that inhibitory connections embedded within the tectal circuit can account for how normally effective stimuli can be attenuated by the presence of bimodal stimuli when they are spatial and/or temporally misaligned.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Response enhancement with multisensory integration</title><p>Despite the powerful action of the GABAergic system, it <italic>does</italic> allow for response enhancement during bimodal integration. The output neurons yield responses of matching amplitudes to both types of sensory inputs, without any apparent domination by a particular modality. Two overlapping (in space and time) stimuli from these two modalities will produce a stronger response, than when only one modality is present. As a rule, two sensory modalities that provide stimuli spatially and temporally aligned are most likely related to the same external event. In this manner, the response enhancement caused by the integration of two senses gives rise to higher event detection reliability. When this occurs, bimodal inputs are able to increase the amount of depolarization in output neurons and increase the probability of evoking an action potential, and therefore, to activate their downstream targets and elicit a motor response.</p><p>Tectal inhibition will continuously reset active areas to enable the constant monitoring of information flow from the environment. Without this inhibition, response enhancement will not be possible since tectal output cells rapidly saturate most likely due to a ceiling effect, making neurons incapable of further responding and thereby losing their response sensitivity, and hence, event detection reliability. Tectal inhibitory action can be interpreted as a gain modulatory mechanism whose effects are well captured by the conductance-based analysis of output neurons, and visible throughout a wide range of membrane potentials (i.e., varying from below to above spike threshold). Local circuit dynamics triggered by sensory inputs will allow for depolarizing synaptic events to reach the reversal potential of the synaptic response. We show that this value is invariant during unimodal or bimodal stimulation implying that a strong unimodal stimulus can bring the membrane potential to action potential threshold, as well as two weaker bimodal stimuli. When bimodal stimuli overlap, they will reinforce each other and generate larger depolarizing currents that will increase the likelihood that the output neurons reach spike threshold before inhibition fully develops. This enhancement most likely arises from sensory inputs that target the different dendritic compartments of output neurons (i.e., superficial vs intermediate layer), that were previously inactive during unimodal stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Top-down regulation of the optic tectum from the forebrain</title><p>Although our findings imply that tectum can perform stimulus selection without the external control from any other brain region, activity in the deep layer output neurons can be strongly influenced by forebrain structures such as the cortex and the basal ganglia. As in mammals, tectal output neurons in lamprey also receive the combination of inhibitory and excitatory input from the forebrain. The GABAergic output neurons of the basal ganglia output nuclei provide tonic inhibition at rest in both lamprey and primates, and can trigger movements by way of disinhibition of the tectal output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wurtz and Hikosaka, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stephenson-Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim and Hikosaka, 2015</xref>). Pallium (evolutionary forerunner of the mammalian cortex) projects to the lamprey optic tectum and provides monosynaptic excitation to the output neurons in the deep layer, and its stimulation is able to elicit eye-head gaze movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ocaña et al., 2015</xref>). In the forebrain control of tectum, it would seem likely that the basal ganglia disinhibition will be complementary to the excitation conveyed from pallium/cortex, and in both cases they target the soma level of the output neurons rather than the dendrites.</p><p>Extracellular recordings in cats and primates have shown a supra-linear enhancement of deep layer collicular activity in response to overlapping weak multimodal stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meredith and Stein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wallace and Stein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wallace et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stein, 2005</xref>). This amplification is thought not to arise from the intrinsic collicular circuitry, but from extrinsic cortico-collicular afferents from the anterior ectosylvian sulcus. When this area is inactivated the amplification vanishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wallace and Stein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarado et al., 2009</xref>). One mechanism would be to bypass tectal inhibition by selectively increasing excitation onto the output neurons, which are targeted by monosynaptic projections from cortex/pallium in both mammals and lamprey. Another potential mechanism that would introduce such non-linearities could be a selective decrease of inhibition by briefly ‘switching off’ the tectal GABAergic system. The variable classes of tectal interneurons may also provide an additional flexibility to manipulate sensorimotor processing within the optic tectum.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The basic anatomical and functional organization of the optic tectum across vertebrates is highly conserved, from the earliest group of vertebrates that has evolved - the lamprey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nieuwenhuys and Nicholson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saitoh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asteriti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kardamakis et al., 2015</xref>), despite the particular sensory modalities that the different species depend on. The lamprey optic tectum consists of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons activated by unimodal and bimodal inputs. The output neurons found in the deep layer are excitatory and project to the brainstem, and control gaze movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saitoh et al., 2007</xref>). In lamprey, visual and electrosensory stimuli evoke direct excitation quickly followed by recruited inhibition onto these output neurons. These synaptic responses are amplified when spatiotemporally aligned bimodal inputs are present, thus, leading to a response enhancement. We have shown here that sensory-evoked inhibition scales the neural activity of output cells to allow for a robust spatiotemporal integration, capable of integrating the enormous amount of incoming sensory inputs during natural conditions. Local inhibition may be critical for spatiotemporal processing not only in lamprey but also in other vertebrates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were performed on 47 adult river lampreys (<italic>Lampetra fluviatilis</italic>).

Labeled cells were analyzed by either confocal or conventional fluorescence microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Extracellular recordings</title><p>Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded using tungsten microelectrodes (~1–5 MΩ, a 4-channel MA 102 amplifier and a MA 103 preamplifier (Elektroniklabor, Zoologie, University of Cologne), and digitized at 20 kHz using pClamp (version 9.2) software. For natural sensory stimulation, the head was transected from animals deeply anesthetized with MS-222 (100 mg/L; Sigma) and the dorsal skin and cartilage were removed to expose the brain. The skin with the electrosensory receptive organs in the rostrolateral part of the head was kept, and the muscles in the ventral part were removed. To avoid movements that could destabilize the preparation, the neuromuscular blocker α-bungarotoxin (12.5 μM, Sigma) was locally injected into the muscles that could not be removed. Visual stimulation was performed with brief flashes of light (500 ms duration), using a 100 μm diameter-thick optic fiber connected to a standard LED light source. The optic fiber was connected to a borosilicate glass pipette painted black with nail polisher to avoid light spread, so that the light spot diameter was ~50 μm. The pipette was attached to a Narishige micromanipulator, and placed ~2 cm distance from the retina, and once the receptive field in the optic tectum (OT) was located by recording LFPs, an electric field was spatially aligned with the visual stimulus. To generate it, two copper wires (used respectively as negative and positive poles) were connected to a stimulus isolation unit (MI401; Zoological Institute, University of Cologne), and submerged in the aCSF at a distance of ~5–10 cm from the preparation, keeping a small distance between poles to ensure a local stimulus (~1 cm). Electrosensory stimulation was presented as brief pulses (30 ms in duration) with intensities between 10–100 μA.</p><p>For electric stimulation of the retina and the anterior line nerve (ALLN), the procedure was the same, but the cartilage of the otic capsule was removed in order to expose the ALLN. The stimulation was performed by using borosilicate glass microcapillaries connected to a stimulus isolation unit (MI401; Zoological Institute, University of Cologne). The stimulation intensity was set to the threshold strength (typically 10–100 μA) necessary to evoke LFPs with a 50 μs duration stimulus, and consecutive increasing stimulation durations of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 700 and 1000 μs were then applied. All experiments were performed in darkness to avoid interfering visual stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Whole-cell recordings</title><p>A novel preparation was used to perform whole-cell current-clamp recordings, slicing a thick brain section exposing the deep layer of the optic tectum, keeping the retinal and octavolateral afferent tracts intact (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To expose the different layers of the optic tectum by sectioning, the entire preparation was first embedded in agar (4% dissolved in aCSF; Fluka). The agar block containing the brain was then cut in an oblique angle and glued to a metal plate, quickly transferred to ice-cold aCSF and sagittal-oblique slices were cut using a vibrating microtome (Microm HM 650V; Thermo Scientific) until the deep layer of tectum as well as the retinal and octavolateral tracts were exposed. The agar block was then mounted in a submerged recording chamber.</p><p>Whole-cell voltage and current-clamp recordings were performed with patch pipettes made from borosilicate glass (Hilgenberg) using a vertical puller (Model PP-830; Narishige). The resistance of recording pipettes was 7–10 MΩ when filled with intracellular solution of the following composition (in mM): 130 potassium gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 phosphocreatine disodium salt, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP; (osmolarity 265–275 mOsmol). The electrode solution also included in some cases 3 mM of triethylammonium bromide (QX-314; Sigma) to block action potentials. Bridge balance and pipette-capacitance compensation were adjusted for using a MultiClamp 700B patch amplifier and Digidata 1322 analog-to-digital converter under software control ‘PClamp’ (Molecular Devices). Perfusion of the preparation was performed with aCSF at 6–8°.</p><p>Stimulation of the octavolateral and retinal afferents was performed with borosilicate glass microcapillaries (the same as for patch recordings), connected to a stimulus isolation unit (MI401; Zoological Institute, University of Cologne). The stimulation intensity was set to one to two times the threshold strength (typically 10–100 μA) to evoke PSPs. To investigate the short-term dynamics of synaptic transmission, a stimulus train of ten pulses at 10 Hz was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ericsson et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Temporal offset analysis</title><p>To examine the effect on the bimodal integration of the temporal overlap between visual and electrosensory modalities, we performed patch-clamp recordings using asynchronous visual and electrosensory stimulations, delaying one stimulus respect to the other in steps of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 ms. To temporally align visual and electrosensory responses, the EPSPs evoked by the first pulse of each sensory modality were analyzed online for every single cell to calculate the difference between the onsets. This difference was then used to adjust the timing for the different stimuli steps, which were programmed using a Master-8 programmable pulse generator (AMP Instruments LTD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Drug applications</title><p>During extracellular recordings, the GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor antagonist (Gabazine; 10 μM; Tocris) was locally applied in the deep layer of the optic tectum by pressure injection through a micropipette fixed to a holder, which was attached to an air supply and a Narishige micromanipulator. For patch-clamp recordings, gabazine was bath applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For immunohistochemical detection of GABA, sections were incubated overnight with a mouse monoclonal anti-GABA antibody (1:5000; mAb 3A12; kindly donated by Dr. Peter Streit, Brain Research Institute, University of Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland). The sections were subsequently incubated for 2 hr at room temperature with a Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and, in those cases in which the cells were filled with neurobiotin, also with Cy2-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000; Jackson ImmunoResearch). All primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton-X 100 in 0.1 M PB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Photomicrographs were taken with an Olympus XM10 digital camera mounted on an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope (Olympus Sweden). Illustrations were prepared in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop CS4. Images were only adjusted for brightness and contrast. Confocal Z-stacks of optical sections were obtained using a Zeiss Laser scanning microscope 510, and the projection images were processed using the Zeiss LSM software, ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop CS4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data analysis</title><p>For all electrophysiological recordings, data analysis was performed using custom written functions in Matlab (<italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Source code 1</xref>). For extracellular recordings, the integral under the curves were compared after fully rectifying the signals using trapezoidal numerical integration (‘<italic>trapz</italic>’ function). For patch-clamp recordings, subsequent PSPs often started on the decay phase of previous responses, so that to extract correct amplitudes the synaptic decay was either fitted by an exponential curve and subtracted or manually subtracted.</p><p>For the estimation of the synaptic conductances, we used the direct extraction of the excitatory and inhibitory conductance based on solving the conductance model equation applied to the current-clamp data as explained in p. 328–329 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Monier et al. (2008)</xref>. In all recordings, these estimates were accurate because (i) the synaptic responses were composed primarily of ionotropic glutamatergic synapses (primarily AMPA, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kardamakis et al., 2015</xref>) and chloride-mediated GABAergic (GABA<sub>A</sub>) synaptic inputs, (ii) their reversal potentials were experimentally determined and found to be at 0 and −75 mV, respectively, and (iii) due to the linearity domain of their voltage-current relationships and similar time constants.</p><p>For statistical analysis, we used two-sample unpaired and paired <italic>t</italic>-tests in Matlab. Throughout the figures, sample statistics are expressed as Means ± SEMs (SEM; standard error), unless specified otherwise.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The experiments were funded by grants from the Swedish Research Council (both Health and Science and Technology), the EU and the Karolinska Institute (Strategic Research).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Herwig Baier (Reviewer #2); Mark Wallace (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this interesting study, the authors perform an electrophysiological and anatomical analysis of multimodal integration by excitatory output neurons and inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in the optic tectum (superior colliculus) of a primitive vertebrate, lampreys. This work uses several innovative preparations to record from output cells and interneurons both extracellularly and in whole cell mode while delivering biologically meaningful stimuli. They demonstrate that visual and electrosensory stimuli evoke direct excitation onto output neurons, which is quickly followed by recruited inhibition. These synaptic responses are enhanced when spatiotemporally aligned bimodal inputs are given, whereas temporally misaligned inputs are inhibited. They also show that multisensory inputs can regulate event-detection within tectum through this local inhibition. As in other vertebrates, there is evidence that in lampreys optic tectum output neurons commands gaze shifts by synaptic integration of different sensory modalities. Thus these findings have significant implications for how multimodal sensory inputs are integrated with behavioral responses in vertebrates.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following major issues that should be addressed before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Title is inappropriate: &quot;Gaze shift neurons[]&quot; Behavior is not studied here, and no direct link is shown between the cells characterized and gaze control. Please change title to reflect what is presented in the paper. The authors should also describe what shifts in gaze entail in lampreys: head movements, eye movements, etc. Consider adding lamprey to title.</p><p>2) Please do not over-generalize the results. a) The mechanisms described apply to a small sample of cells in the lamprey and should not be generalized to the entire vertebrate lineage. b) GABAergic tectal neurons are almost certainly not a homogenous population. While there is strong pharmacological evidence that some tectal interneurons are responsible for the observed feedforward inhibition, we are not convinced that this is generally true for all interneurons. In both cases the authors should tone down their claims.</p><p>3) &quot;For statistical analysis, we used two-sample unpaired and paired t-tests in Matlab.&quot; We encourage the authors to use ANOVA followed by post-hoc testing that corrects for any multiple comparisons in each case where multiple treatments are made.</p><p>4) There was a general concern about the study and interpretation of temporal and spatial misalignment. a) In attempting to relate the temporal results to behavioral phenomena, what is the environmental range of latency differences for visual and electrosensory stimuli, and does this map on to the temporal effects demonstrated at the level of the individual neuron? b) The precipitous drop in EPSP amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) with very short latency differences between visual and electroreceptive stimulation is a bit surprising given the extensive literature in the mammalian SC of integration taking place over a fairly substantial window of time. Can these differences be readily reconciled? Furthermore, direct electrical stimulation of the retinal afferents to the OT bypasses all of the retinal processing that takes place, and that slows the conduction of information to the SC (relative to electroreception). Wouldn't one expect that peak gain would be seen when the visual inputs lag the electroreceptive inputs rather than at absolute simultaneity? c) In the experiments like those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> it would seem appropriate to test temporally and also spatially misaligned stimuli. The authors never really study spatial misalignment, yet imply their results are relevant to such misalignment. Have such experiments been done and can they be incorporated?</p><p>5) The experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are intriguing but better quantification and consideration of the composite data is needed for the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>. Just how selective is excitation to one quadrant of the retina within and across animals? Can this be quantified and statistically analyzed? How does it compare to inhibition?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Spatiotemporal interplay between multisensory excitation and recruited inhibition in the lamprey optic tectum&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Revisions have been extensive and responsive.</p><p>1) The new experiments with spatially misaligned stimuli (related to the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggest that the source of inhibition is tectum-intrinsic. This is in disagreement with a previously published model (Mysore et al. 2013), based on experiments in other vertebrates. This work should be cited.</p><p>2) Panels 9E to 9G (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) could use improvement. They are hard to understand. These panels are complex and difficult to follow (too many different colors). Also, why does Quadrant 1 (Q1) show higher PSP amplitudes? Please explain in legend or text more thoroughly.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> legend: &quot;from&quot; is repeated.

The reason we originally included the term gaze shift neurons in the title is because they are tectal-brainstem projecting neurons and therefore implicated in the control of gaze movements. We have now removed gaze shift neurons from the title and have also incorporated our animal model.</p><p>Regarding gaze shifts in the lamprey, we agree with the referees that no behavior is studied in the present paper. However, a previous paper published from our lab describes in detail the kinematics and metrics of coordinated eye and head gaze shifts elicited from electrical microstimulation of the deep layer of the optic tectum in the lamprey (Saitoh et al., 2007). To better clarify what it is known in the lamprey, we have included the following sentence in the Introduction:</p><p>We have previously shown in the lamprey that site-specific stimulation across the deep layer of the optic tectum gives rise to eye-head gaze shifts of given amplitude and direction, thus, showing the existence of a motor map (Saitoh et al., 2007).</p><p><italic>2) Please do not over-generalize the results. a) The mechanisms described apply to a small sample of cells in the lamprey and should not be generalized to the entire vertebrate lineage. b) GABAergic tectal neurons are almost certainly not a homogenous population.

In both cases the authors should tone down their claims.</italic> </p><p>a) We agree that the results cannot be generalized without further evidence, although we think that the basic circuit is most likely very similar across vertebrates, given the present data and previous work in our lab, including evidence from mammals. To tone down our statements we have made the following modifications to the text:</p><p>1. We have changed the concluding sentence at the end of the Introduction (third paragraph) from:</p><p>[...] we anticipate that the mechanisms of integration of two senses on single output neurons, as demonstrated here, will also apply to other vertebrates. into:</p><p>[...] we anticipate that the mechanisms of integration of two senses on single output neurons, as demonstrated here, may also apply to other vertebrates.</p><p>2. We have changed the concluding sentence at the end of the Discussion (final paragraph) from:</p><p>We anticipate, without the loss of generality, that local inhibition is critical for spatiotemporal processing and that this mechanism may be found throughout vertebrate phylogeny into:</p><p>Local inhibition may be critical for spatiotemporal processing not only in lamprey but also in other vertebrates</p><p>b) We agree with the reviewers that not all superficial layer interneurons are necessarily causal to the generation of the feedforward inhibition onto tectal output neurons. For instance, it may very well be that a subset of interneurons may also be responsible for the intralaminar inhibition onto other interneurons as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>. In our additional experiments, we further classified superficial interneurons into three provisional groups on the basis of their synaptic input (n=13) and, indeed, agree that they are not a homogenous population, suggesting that they may have a differential functional impact onto tectal multisensory integration. In fact, we find that some interneurons receive preferentially excitation and others excitation and inhibition we elaborate on this in point 5 and data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p>To tone down this argument, we have deleted:</p><p>It is remarkable that both interneurons and the output neurons have an almost identical input, thus, suggesting that they are responsible for the feedforward inhibition elicited by spatiotopic sensory activation onto deep layer output neurons.</p><p>We have now replaced this with a concluding statement in the final paragraph of the Results section:</p><p>Despite the variable nature of visually-evoked synaptic inhibition onto tectal interneurons, the spatiotopic arrangement of their excitatory components is critical for the feed forward inhibition onto tectal output neurons.</p><p>However, we think the general strategy we propose for the inhibitory system is not affected by this heterogeneity, but instead we trust that this provides tectum with additional degrees of freedom for manipulating the sensorimotor processing, perhaps by other extrinsic sources (eg pallium/cortex). In order to highlight this in the manuscript, we have added the following sentence as a concluding sentence in the Discussion subsection Top-down regulation of the optic tectum by the forebrain:</p><p>The variable classes of tectal interneurons may also provide an additional flexibility to manipulate sensorimotor processing within the optic tectum.</p><p><italic>3) &quot;For statistical analysis, we used two-sample unpaired and paired t-tests in Matlab.&quot; We encourage the authors to use ANOVA followed by post-hoc testing that corrects for any multiple comparisons in each case where multiple treatments are made.</italic> </p><p>In most of our analyses, we compared one sensory modality (vision or electroreception) with their bimodal product (multisensory), and in these cases it is justified the use of a simple twoway statistical measure (t-test). The only case in which a multiple treatment was employed is with the voltage-clamp and current-clamp data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We appreciate the reviewers for pointing this out. We have now corrected the statistical technique by using a three-way ANOVA for illustrating that unisensory excitatory and inhibitory currents summate during bimodal integration. We have added the following text with values starting Results section, subsection Sensory excitation and local inhibition are fully integrated by output neurons:</p><p>&quot;On a trial-to-trial basis, the statistical difference in the magnitude of evoked EPSC and IPSC currents by bimodal and visual or electroreceptive afferent stimulation was significant (visualbimodal: P = 0.008; electrosensory-bimodal: P = 0.006; one-way ANOVA), but not between those evoked during visual and electrosensory (P = 0.99).</p><p>[]</p><p>When bimodal inputs are used, excitatory currents summate and increase the resultant EPSP amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>) but are quickly quenched by an also stronger amount of inhibition.''</p><p><italic>4) There was a general concern about the study and interpretation of temporal and spatial misalignment. a) In attempting to relate the temporal results to behavioral phenomena, what is the environmental range of latency differences for visual and electrosensory stimuli, and does this map on to the temporal effects demonstrated at the level of the individual neuron? b) The precipitous drop in EPSP amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) with very short latency differences between visual and electroreceptive stimulation is a bit surprising given the extensive literature in the mammalian SC of integration taking place over a fairly substantial window of time. Can these differences be readily reconciled? Furthermore, direct electrical stimulation of the retinal afferents to the OT bypasses all of the retinal processing that takes place, and that slows the conduction of information to the SC (relative to electroreception). Wouldn't one expect that peak gain would be seen when the visual inputs lag the electroreceptive inputs rather than at absolute simultaneity? c) In the experiments like those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> it would seem appropriate to test temporally and also spatially misaligned stimuli. The authors never really study spatial misalignment, yet imply their results are relevant to such misalignment. Have such experiments been done and can they be incorporated?</italic></p><p>We break down our response to point 4 by dividing it into the spatial and time domain separately.</p><p>Spatial misalignment</p><p>To test the effectiveness of spatially disparate stimuli in the response suppression of the tectal output layer, we performed additional experiments by applying misaligned visual and electrosensory stimulation while locally recording in the optic tectum in the on-field region for one of the stimulus. These results we obtained are now summarized and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We have added the following text in the Results section (subsection Visual and electrosensory integration with local inhibtion):</p><p>Recently, we have shown how on-receptive field visual responses in tectal output layer neurons can be suppressed, via the local inhibitory system, by the presence of multiple visual stimuli located at disparate positions in the visual field (Kardamakis et al., 2015). [] An average response reduction of ~75% was observed during spatially misaligned cross-modal sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; red for electrosensory and black for bimodal stimulation; n=5). By contrast, we were able to suppress by a negligible 5 amount of only ~3% (data not shown) when the opposite combination of sensory modalites were used, i.e. on-responses to visual and off-response to electrosensory stimuli. The underlying cause that gives rise to this asymmetry remains unclear.</p><p>These results show that responses to a given stimulus in on-field regions of tectum undergo a drastic suppression when stimulating off-field regions, thereby, triggering the local inhibitory system that aims to suppress areas across the tectal map of space. Surprisingly, we observed such a drastic reduction only when visual stimulation was applied to off-field areas while recording in an on-field region for a given electrosensory stimulus. However, we were not able to achieve response suppression when we reversed the order of sensory modalities, i.e. when we tried to get suppression of on-visual responses with off-field electrosensory stimulation (only very small reductions were observed, ~3%). We discuss our results and propose potential underlying reasons to explain this response suppression asymmetry in the next paragraph added to the Discussion (subsection The role of tectal inhibition):</p><p>This role of inhibition is observed in our extracellular recordings. Consistent with bimodal suppression in mammals (Meredith and Stein, 1996; Kadunce et al., 1997), responses in on-field regions of tectum to electrosensory stimulation undergo a drastic reduction when delivering visual stimuli to other receptive fields of the tectal map. In the present study, we could not elicit the same sort of reduction in tectal areas responsive for visual stimulation when applying offfield electrosensory stimuli. One possibility is that electrosensory maps in the lamprey tectum are not as refined as the visual ones, and therefore inhibition is less effective suppressing offregions.</p><p>In this sense, it has been shown that electrosensory receptive fields in elasmobranchs tectum are much larger than the visual ones (Bodznick, 1990). We cannot exclude either that the way we perform electrosensory stimulation is not as local as the visual one, making it less effective to evoke a similar reduction.</p><p>Temporal misalignment</p><p>Physiological responses to natural and localized bimodal stimuli with spatial offsets can not be obtained at the single neuron level using our half-brain preparation since natural/electrical topographic activation of sensory receptors would not be possible. However, in this current study, we exploited the fact that we can actually use whole-cell recordings to examine the net postsynaptic effect of temporal misalignments in response to stimulation of the two sensory afferent pathways. The advantage of using the latter approach is the fact that we obtained subthreshold membrane recordings during multisensory stimulation while quantifying the effects of tectal inhibition in integrating these responses, which was one of the major findings of this study.</p><p>In doing so, we uncovered that the bimodally-induced EPSPs elicited during temporally misaligned afferent activation reduced the amount of depolarization a fact predicted by the synaptic conductance estimations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The initial drop with 17% of the control observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> is significant but it should be noted that the overall depression lasts over 50 ms. The effects seen here are due to the direct stimulation of the afferent axons originating from the retina and the octavolateral relay center. This is clearly useful technically to elucidate the microcircuit but on the other hand it is not directly behaviorally relevant. To understand whether the modest temporal changes observed here are relevant in a behavioral context, we would need to record from a number of single isolated units simultaneously, while applying visual and electrosensory stimuli. This would be an important contribution, but represents in our mind a separate rather extensive future study, and is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>It is true that this window of integration appears longer in mammals (Meredith et al., 1987; Miller et al., 2015). One difference that emerges when comparing circuit dynamics between mouse SC and lamprey OT is that interlaminar inhibition mediating the superficial and deep layers is not monosynaptic, but rather polysynaptic. For instance, lamprey tectal output neurons are able to the discharge of one time-locked action potential in response to either sensory modality and this is a consequence of the fast suppression induced by the monosynaptic recruitment of local inhibition, thus, allowing for a narrow window of opportunity for membrane depolarization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, see also Kardamakis et al., 2015). In the mouse SC, microstimulation of the superficial layer or optic tract can evoke a burst of action potentials (see Saito Y. and Isa T., 2003). We attribute this discrepancy between the time-locked action potential found in lamprey OT and the burst of action potentials in mouse SC, in that local inhibition allows for a larger window of opportunity for multisensory inputs to summate for a longer duration, thus, enabling output neurons to discharge more action potentials since no monosynaptic IPSPs have been reportedly evoked from the superficial layer (see Saito Y. and Isa T., 2003). In addition to this, it still remains unknown to what extent neocortical involvement in the manipulation of the collicular GABAergic system may affect the window in mammals. Presumably, this recruited local inhibition is even further delayed, thus, enabling an even larger window of integration in cats and primates. For such a claim to be stated, however, more needs to be understood on the tectal microcircuit in cats/primates.</p><p>During natural conditions, the peak gain of bimodal stimulation would occur when electroreceptive inputs lag visual inputs due to the delay involved in the processing of visual information by the retina. However, electroreceptive inputs are also processed at the octavolateral nucleus delaying transmission to the OT at least by one synapse. In both our extracellular and whole-cell patch experiments, we never used the absolute simultaneity but rather always corrected for delays related in conduction of information. However, we agree that direct stimulation of the retina does indeed bypass retinal processing, thus, activating monosynaptically tectal-projecting optic ganglion cells. In a similar manner, when directly stimulating the octavolateral nucleus we are monosynaptically activating tectal-projecting electroreceptive fibers. We align the onsets of the evoked EPSPs by implementing a small delay (usually of the order of 1-5ms) and then perform temporally misaligned offsets to afferent stimulation. What the behavioral advantage of having a faster sensory system (electroreceptive in this case), and if this is true in natural conditions, remains a matter of speculation. Taken together, however, the tectal inhibitory system is equipped with the requisite connections to perform spatiotemporal computations.</p><p><italic>5) The experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are intriguing but better quantification and consideration of the composite data is needed for the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>. Just how selective is excitation to one quadrant of the retina within and across animals? Can this be quantified and statistically analyzed? How does it compare to inhibition?</italic></p><p>To provide a better quantification and detailed explanation for this part, we performed additional experiments to increase the number (now 13 cells from 6 animals) of our recorded tectal interneurons by using our isolated eye-brain preparation. In doing so, we decided to divide the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> into two figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) with one focusing on the anatomy/morphology and the other on the electrophysiology. Now, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> illustrates the newly obtained data addressing the issues raised in this section:</p><p>a) By using whole-cell current clamp recordings in our eye-brain prep and QX314 in the recording pipette, we determined that all recorded interneurons responded retinotopically to mainly one quadrant. In most cases, they also responded weaker to microstimulation of the neighboring quadrant. As a measure of excitation and inhibition, the maximum PSP amplitude evoked in response to a brief stimulation train was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>?). Quadrants (Q1, Q2, Q3 &amp; Q4) are sorted on the basis of the maximal response obtained.</p><p>b) Prior to entering whole-cell configuration, we performed on-cell recordings in a subset of recorded interneurons (n=6) to determine their firing patterns by delivering a train of stimuli into their preferred quadrant. In all cases, we observed a time-locked action potential discharging to usually the first 2 stimuli with a subsequent depression and a rapid response to the recovery pulses. This is reminiscent of the discharge pattern of deep layer output neurons (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>c) While interneurons receive retinotopic excitation, we saw that patterns of synaptic inhibition were, indeed, not identical. On this synaptic basis, we subdivided them into three provisional groups: i) local excitation-local inhibition (n=6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>), ii) local excitation global inhibition (n=4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>) and iii) local excitation-no inhibition (n=3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>).</p><p>d) The nature of this inhibitory component can be seen when switching into voltage-clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), where recruitment of other interneurons would be required in order to generate this lateral inhibitory effect.</p><p>To account for all this new information, we modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> to maintain only the anatomical, morphological and bimodal aspects of tectal interneurons and added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> to illustrate the variability of tectal interneurons on the basis of their topographically-driven synaptic input. We describe this at the end of the Results section in the manuscript in the last two paragraphs (subsection Bimodal sensory inputs also drive inhibitory interneurons):</p><p>To test if superficial layer interneurons are activated in a spatiotopic manner, like deep layer output cells, we used a preparation exposing the optic tectum to allow patch-clamp recordings from the superficial layer while keeping the retina and the optic nerve intact, so that local stimulation was possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, top; see Kardamakis et al., 2015 for experimental procedure).</p><p>[]</p><p>Despite the variable nature of visually-evoked synaptic inhibition onto tectal interneurons, the spatiotopic arrangement of their excitatory components is critical for the feedforward inhibition onto tectal output neurons.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>1) The new experiments with spatially misaligned stimuli (related to the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggest that the source of inhibition is tectum-intrinsic. This is in disagreement with a previously published model (Mysore et al. 2013), based on experiments in other vertebrates. This work should be cited.</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have now included the reference Mysore et al. 2013.</p><p>To highlight this very important difference between endogenous and exogenous inhibition, we have added and modified a sentence Discussion section, subsection The role of tectal inhibition:</p><p>&quot;While this local inhibition can act independently for generating stimulus selection, it has also been suggested that exogenous sources are required for generating global inhibition via GABAergic neurons in the isthmic nucleus (Mysore et al., 2013).

Please explain in legend or text more thoroughly.</italic></p><p>The reason we have chosen to use this wide variety of colors is that we chose to plot the 'actual' data obtained from individual interneurons and not the mean responses in order to highlight the differences between synaptic response profiles. Therefore, colors are necessary in order to distinguish which excitatory postsynaptic amplitude corresponded to which inhibitory postsynaptic amplitude in each recorded interneuron. To assist visualization of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9EG</xref>, we have enlarged the panels by reducing the dead space on the x-axis, thickening the lines and increased some fonts.</p><p>To avoid dependencies on the particular retinal area (i.e., dorsal, anterior, ventral or posterior) that gives to the strongest excitatory component, quadrants are presented in descending order to facilitate the comparison of matching PSP across the population of interneurons that were recorded.</p><p>To clarify all of the above, we have added the following sentence of the figure legend: &quot;However, to avoid dependencies on the particular stimulated retinal area, we sorted the quadrants that gives rise to the strongest excitatory component in descending order (Q1 being the largest EPSP).
