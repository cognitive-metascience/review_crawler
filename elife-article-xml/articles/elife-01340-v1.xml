and drug target in oncology. We present the 2.3 Å crystal structure of the extracellular cysteine rich domain (CRD) of vertebrate Smo and show that it binds to oxysterols, endogenous lipids that activate Hh signaling. The oxysterol-binding groove in the Smo CRD is analogous to that used by Frizzled 8 to bind to the palmitoleyl group of Wnt ligands and to similar pockets used by other Frizzled-like CRDs to bind hydrophobic ligands. The CRD is required for signaling in response to native Hh ligands, showing that it is an important regulatory module for Smo activation. Indeed, targeting of the Smo CRD by oxysterol-inspired small molecules can block signaling by all known classes of Hh activators and by clinically relevant Smo mutants.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01340.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01340.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01340.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Just over 30 years ago, researchers identified a new signaling molecule with an important role in the development of fruit flies. Embryos lacking this molecule were thought to resemble a hedgehog, eventually leading to this cell–cell communication system being designated the “Hedgehog” pathway. This pathway has subsequently been shown to be involved in the development of many other animals, as well as in the repair of damaged tissues in adult organisms.</p><p>Abnormal Hedgehog signaling has also been implicated in both human birth defects and in cancers of the skin and the brain. Many such tumors are driven by the unrestrained activation of a membrane-bound protein called Smoothened, which has led to the development and clinical use of small molecules that prevent Hedgehog from activating Smoothened. The existing anti-tumor drugs all bind to the same region of the Smoothened receptor, namely the part that sits within the cell membrane. A second group of molecules, known as oxysterols, can activate Smoothened, but exactly how they do this has been unclear. Now, Nachtergaele et al. have shown that oxysterols bind to a region of the Smoothened receptor that lies outside the cell, and that is rich in the amino acid cysteine.</p><p>By solving the crystal structure of this part of the receptor from zebrafish, Nachtergaele et al. were able to map the oxysterol binding site at high resolution. This revealed strong similarities between this binding site and those in related receptors belonging to the Wnt signaling pathway. Deleting the cysteine-rich domain significantly impaired Hedgehog signaling, as did a new class of small molecule inhibitors designed specifically to target the oxysterol binding site.</p><p>In addition to providing new insights into the structure and function of the Smoothened receptor, the work of Nachtergaele et al. opens up possibilities for novel therapeutic agents that could be used in the treatment of cancers caused by abnormal Hedgehog signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01340.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01340.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Hedgehog signaling</kwd><kwd>oxysterol</kwd><kwd>smoothened</kwd><kwd>cysteine rich domain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM47969, HL67773</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krishnan</surname><given-names>Kathiresan</given-names></name><name><surname>Covey</surname><given-names>Douglas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5 T32 HL007275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mydock</surname><given-names>Laurel K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stand up to Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SU2C-AACR-IRG0209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nachtergaele</surname><given-names>Sigrid</given-names></name><name><surname>Rohatgi</surname><given-names>Rajat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pew Scholars in the Biomedical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2009-000359-011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nachtergaele</surname><given-names>Sigrid</given-names></name><name><surname>Rohatgi</surname><given-names>Rajat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT/082301/Z/07/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siebold</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C20724/A14414</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siebold</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>A*STAR Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Zhonghua</given-names></name><name><surname>Ingham</surname><given-names>Philip W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nachtergaele</surname><given-names>Sigrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whalen</surname><given-names>Daniel M</given-names></name><name><surname>Malinauskas</surname><given-names>Tomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cysteine-rich domain within the Smoothened receptor may represent a novel therapeutic target for cancers caused by abnormal functioning of the Hedgehog signaling pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway controls the development of many tissues during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McMahon et al., 2003</xref>). Even quantitative abnormalities in Hh signaling can lead to human birth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bale, 2002</xref>). After development, Hh signaling regulates tissue stem cells and regenerative responses to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machold et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shin et al., 2011</xref>). Aberrant Hh signaling can be oncogenic, and genes encoding Hh pathway proteins can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scales and de Sauvage, 2009</xref>). The most commonly damaged step in Hh-driven cancers involves the poorly understood interaction between two transmembrane (TM) proteins, Patched 1 (Ptch1) and Smoothened (Smo) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briscoe and Therond [2013]</xref>). Ptch1, encoded by a tumor suppressor gene, is a 12-pass TM protein that serves as the receptor for Hh ligands, including Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marigo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stone et al., 1996</xref>). In the absence of Hh ligands, Ptch1 inhibits the function of Smo, a 7-pass TM protein that is encoded by a human oncogene. Shh binds and inactivates Ptch1, unleashing Smo’s activity and allowing the Gli transcription factors to initiate target gene transcription. Despite the fact that Smo has become a drug target in oncology, with an FDA-approved Smo inhibitor in clinical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Von Hoff et al., 2009</xref>) and others in ongoing trials, the mechanism by which Smo is regulated by Ptch1 remains a mystery. Current models suggest that Ptch1, a protein with some homology to bacterial small molecule transporters, regulates Smo through an endogenous ligand whose identity is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davies et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Taipale et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Smo consists of an extracellular N-terminal region containing a <underline>c</underline>ysteine <underline>r</underline>ich <underline>d</underline>omain (CRD), a heptahelical transmembrane segment (7TM) and an intracellular C-terminal tail (C-term) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Smo belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily of proteins, most closely related to the Frizzled (Fz) group of Wnt receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fredriksson et al., 2003</xref>). Previous work on Smo has largely focused on the 7TM domain, which contains a binding site for cyclopamine, a sterol-like plant alkaloid that was the foundational Hh inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2002a</xref>). A battery of subsequent small-molecule screens uncovered a set of exogenous ligands that regulate Smo activity through this site, either as agonists such as SAG or antagonists such as SANT-1 and the FDA-approved Hh-inhibitor Vismodegib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frank-Kamenetsky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Robarge et al., 2009</xref>). The 2.5 Å crystal structure of the 7TM segment of Smo bound to a synthetic antagonist has provided a high-resolution view of this binding pocket, which is formed by the extracellular end of the 7TM helix bundle and connecting loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Smo drugs that occupy this ‘cyclopamine binding site’ are classified as such by their ability to compete with cyclopamine for Smo binding. No endogenous molecules are known that engage this site in the 7TM of Smo.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01340.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The mouse Smo CRD is required to bind oxysterols.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of full-length (FL), YFP-tagged mSmo and the ΔCRD and ΔC truncation mutants used in this study.

Specific oxysterols can fully activate Hh signaling in the absence of Hh ligands in multiple cell types and also induce the accumulation of Smo in the primary cilium, a trafficking step essential for Smo to activate downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kha et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corcoran and Scott, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dwyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rohatgi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). We previously demonstrated that a specific side-chain oxysterol, 20(<italic>S</italic>)-hydroxycholesterol (20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC), directly binds Smo in a manner that is highly stereospecific: the enantiomer, <italic>ent</italic>-20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC, or the epimer, 20(<italic>R</italic>)-OHC, failed to bind Smo or to activate Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nachtergaele et al., 2012</xref>). While this ‘oxysterol binding site’ showed allosteric interactions with the canonical cyclopamine binding site, it was clearly distinct since oxysterols did not show a competitive interaction with cyclopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dwyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nachtergaele et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, previous structural comparison studies have speculated that oxysterols bind to the extracellular CRD of Smo based on its relationship to the Fz CRD, which binds to the palmitoleyl group of secreted Wnt ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bazan and de Sauvage, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bazan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sharpe and de Sauvage, 2012</xref>). Wnt binding to the Fz CRD triggers signaling across the membrane, but the function of the Smo CRD has remained enigmatic.</p><p>We find that the extracellular CRD of Smo in vertebrates is both necessary and sufficient to bind to 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC, thus demonstrating that the cyclopamine and oxysterol binding sites occupy different domains in Smo. We determined the crystal structure of the zebrafish Smo CRD at 2.3 Å to provide a view of the oxysterol-binding pocket and to establish its relationship to the Fz CRD and other Fz-like CRDs that bind small hydrophobic ligands. Either deletion of the CRD or its inhibition by a new class of oxysterol-inspired small molecules can impair the signaling initiated by the native ligand Shh. Our results elucidate the molecular mechanism by which oxysterols activate Smo and show that the Smo CRD is a physiologically and therapeutically important target in the vertebrate Hh pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The extracellular CRD of mouse Smo is necessary and sufficient for binding to 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC</title><p>We previously developed a ligand affinity chromatography assay to measure the interaction between 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC and detergent-solubilized, full-length Smo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nachtergaele et al., 2012</xref>). For the studies presented here, we used a similar strategy to assay the interaction between truncated versions of Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC, using sepharose beads on which 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC was immobilized through an amino group installed on the <italic>iso</italic>-octyl chain (hereafter called 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC beads; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We produced deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged mouse Smo (mSmo) lacking the CRD (ΔCRD-YFP-mSmo) or the C-terminal intracellular domain (ΔC-YFP-mSmo) and confirmed that these proteins were folded when stably expressed in Smo<sup>−/−</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rohatgi et al., 2009</xref>). Both truncated proteins demonstrated a slower migrating species that was resistant to Endoglycosidase H (EndoH), suggesting the presence of glycan modifications usually attached in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2002a</xref>). For both YFP-mSmo and ΔC-YFP-mSmo, this post-Golgi band was selectively captured on 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC beads, showing that the C-terminal intracellular domain of Smo was dispensable for this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In this and subsequent experiments, specificity of binding was established by competition with free 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC. In contrast, ΔCRD-YFP-mSmo failed to show an interaction, suggesting that the CRD was required for oxysterol binding. Previous studies have shown that the truncated versions of Smo lacking either CRD or the C-terminal domain remain competent to bind cyclopamine and other cyclopamine-competitive ligands, consistent with these molecules interacting with the 7TM segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).

Interestingly, Shh-responsiveness was unaffected in mSmo G115F but significantly reduced in both mSmo Y134F and P168A.

In zebrafish embryos, ΔCRD-Smo can rescue phenotypes dependent on low-level signaling but not on high-level signaling, and it shows higher levels of basal accumulation in cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aanstad et al., 2009</xref>). Our work now shows that the Smo CRD in vertebrates binds to oxysterols and mediates the ability of these lipids to activate Hh signaling. Structure-guided mutagenesis studies revealed that the Smo CRD binds to 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC in the region that was previously identified as the binding site for small hydrophobic molecules in other CRDs, formed by the evolutionary conserved helical bundle of the CRD core. This supports the hypothesis that CRDs evolved from an ancestral domain that sensed hydrophobic molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bazan and de Sauvage, 2009</xref>). Our structural analysis showed that the Smo CRD oxysterol binding site is most similar to the palmitoleyl-binding site in Fz CRDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janda et al., 2012</xref>); however, the binding grooves are built of divergent residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that they accommodate different classes of hydrophobic ligands.</p><p>Smo activity can be regulated by two distinct binding sites in the CRD and the 7TM segments. Oxysterols and their derivatives regulate Smo through the CRD site, while SANT-1, SAG, and Vismodegib bind to the 7TM segment. Binding of agonists like 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC and 20(<italic>S</italic>)-yne to the CRD must be communicated to the 7TM helix bundle for transduction across the membrane. Indeed, while the 7TM and CRD sites are separable, the dramatic synergy between 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC and SAG we have previously reported suggests a positive allosteric link between these domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nachtergaele et al., 2012</xref>). This synergy also implies that 7TM and CRD ligands can bind to Smo simultaneously.</p><p>A speculative but intriguing insight into the interaction between the CRD and 7TM domains comes from our unexpected finding that the Hh inhibitor cyclopamine, an established 7TM ligand, also inhibits the binding of the isolated CRD to 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC beads. This result was unexpected because oxysterols do not decrease the binding of bodipy-cyclopamine to cells expressing full-length Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dwyer et al., 2007</xref>). We believe that this discrepancy is due to the fact that the cell-based bodipy-cyclopamine binding assay is mostly measuring the interaction between cyclopamine and its high affinity (K<sub>d</sub>∼10 nM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rominger et al., 2009</xref>) binding site in the 7TM domain. Cell (or membrane) binding assays can often miss lower affinity (∼1–10 μM) interactions, which can be detected by ligand affinity chromatography assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Phizicky and Fields, 1995</xref>). It is also possible that cyclopamine binds the CRD more weakly when the CRD is embedded in the context of the whole protein.</p><p>As noted above, cyclopamine is a sterol that induces the accumulation of Smo in primary cilia, both properties that distinguish it from the pure 7TM site inhibitors SANT-1 and Vismodegib. One possibility is that cyclopamine can bridge the two ligand-binding sites on Smo and engage both a high-affinity interaction with the 7TM segment and a lower affinity interaction with the CRD. Alternatively, two molecules of cyclopamine could engage the CRD and 7TM sites separately or cyclopamine could be involved in a ‘hand-off’ interaction between the CRD and the 7TM segments analogous to the manner in which cholesterol is transferred between NPC2 and NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). While the relevance of this interaction for the inhibition of Smo by cyclopamine in cells remains to be established, the puzzling ability of cyclopamine to induce Smo accumulation in cilia (while inhibiting Smo activity) may be related to its ability to engage the CRD. This represents a third mechanism by which ligands can engage Smo, one that is distinct from pure 7TM and CRD ligands. Interestingly, glucocorticoids have been shown to fall into two distinct classes of Smo modulators—cyclopamine-competitive ligands that presumably bind to the 7TM potentiate signaling and a second class of inhibitors that do not compete with cyclopamine but appear to engage a distinct site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The CRD of Smo is also important for signaling by Shh, since ΔCRD-Smo cannot be efficiently activated by either Shh or 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC but remains responsive to SAG. While we observed very little activation of ΔCRD-YFP-Smo by Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nedelcu et al., 2013</xref>) reported that a ΔCRD-Smo-mCherry protein retained a low level of Shh responsiveness, suggesting that the CRD is not absolutely required for signaling initiated by Shh. This difference in the degree of Shh-responsiveness may be due to the position of the fluorescent protein tag, differences in the tendency of the YFP and mCherry tags to oligomerize or differences in the expression systems used in the two studies.</p><p>The striking decrease in Shh-responsiveness when the CRD is deleted raises two questions—does Ptch1 regulate Smo through the oxysterol binding site in the CRD and is 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC an endogenous ligand for Smo? Our mutagenesis of the putative oxysterol binding site in the CRD sheds light on the first question. We find mutations in the mSmo CRD (Y134F and G115F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) that can dissociate the Shh and oxysterol responses. These mutants fail to bind or respond to 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC but can still respond to Shh. The simplest interpretation of these data is that the endogenous Smo ligand regulated by Ptch1 does not bind Smo in precisely the same site as 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC. In fact, we have previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nachtergaele et al., 2012</xref>) that cyclopamine is much less potent against Shh-activated Smo compared to 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC-activated Smo, likely because the conformation adopted by Smo is different in response to these two agonists. Both of these findings suggest that 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC is not the Ptch1-regulated ligand that modulates Smo activity in response to Shh reception. It remains possible that a Shh-regulated ligand binds to the CRD in a manner that is distinct from that of 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC.</p><p>The CRD is required for Smo to adopt a fully active conformation in response to Shh (but it is dispensable when Smo is activated by the synthetic 7TM ligand SAG). In this view, the CRD would serve as a domain that allosterically activates the 7TM helix bundle in response to Shh. Some mutations (Smo Y134F, P168A) that abolish 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC responses do indeed substantially dampen the ability of Shh to activate Smo. The observation that CRD point mutations in Smo that block oxysterol binding also impair signaling by Hh ligands has been used to infer that oxysterol binding is required for physiological Smo signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nedelcu et al., 2013</xref>). While this hypothesis has substantial implications for Hh regulation in development and cancer, it remains to be determined if the CRD site in cells is occupied by oxysterols or by a different ligand, or if perturbations in endogenous oxysterol levels can modulate Hh signaling. Finally, testing the activity of oxysterol binding site mutants in the context of embryonic development or Hh-driven tumors is essential for elucidating the physiological function of this site and whether it plays a role in graded, low-level or high-level signaling.</p><p>We have developed partial agonists of Smo that bind to the CRD. Understanding the structural and mechanistic basis for this partial agonism is an important future goal. Remarkably, the simple inversion of the stereochemistry at C-20 converts a potent agonist into a weak partial agonist and an effective inhibitor of signaling. This stereochemical inversion presumably allows the molecule to trap Smo in a poorly active confirmation, likely one similar to that stabilized by cyclopamine, in which Smo is localized in cilia but is inactive. The structures of the OBIs suggest that Smo activation potential depends critically on the spatial orientation between the ring system and the <italic>iso</italic>-octyl chain of 20(<italic>S</italic>)-OHC. Regardless of the mechanism, inhibitors targeting the Smo CRD would provide an orthogonal approach to modulate Hh signaling in regeneration and cancer. Partial agonists offer the possibility of blocking unrestrained signaling (such as that seen in cancer) while preserving lower-level, physiological signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Riese, 2011</xref>). This ability to attenuate Smo activity may be useful since currently used Smo antagonists cause significant side-effects, leading nearly half of the patients in some trials to discontinue treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Perhaps the most important question moving forward is to identify the Shh-regulated ligand that mediates the communication between Ptch1 and Smo and to understand how it regulates Smo through the 7TM and CRD sites. Structural studies of a Smo construct carrying both the 7TM segment and the CRD in complex with various ligands that engage either site or both sites will be essential to understand how Smo transmits the Hh signal across the membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>NIH 3T3 and 293T cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and 293F cells were obtained from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Reviewing editor and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. We anticipate that it will be straightforward to respond to these comments in a revised manuscript and, assuming that you are able to do so, you will receive a quick final decision from the editor without involving the reviewers any further.</p><p>The Hedgehog signaling pathway is important for tissue development and injury responses, and misregulation of this pathway can lead to cancer. Nachtergaele et al. build on previous work from their and other laboratories showing the ability of specific hydroxysterols to activate the Hedgehog signaling pathway through interactions with the 7TM protein Smoothened (Smo). In this new work, Nachtergaele and colleagues show that (i) hydroxysterols interact specifically with the N-terminal, extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of Smo (and their binding site is thus distinct from the well-characterized antagonist/agonist binding site in the 7 TM region), (ii) hydroxysterols interact with the Smo CRD at a site that homologous to the site on Frizzled CRDs that interacts with the palmitoleyl group attached to Wnt, (iii) hydroxysterol analogs can be created that show partial inhibition of Hedgehog signaling and hold promise as Hedgehog pathway-targeting therapeutics, (iv) interactions between Smo CRDs and hydroxysterols appear to be specific to vertebrate Smos, (v) hydroxysterols can activate Hedgehog signaling in fish embryos, and (vi) determine the 2.3 Å crystal structure of the Smo CRD from zebrafish.</p><p>These results are persuasive, well described, and represent significant advances in our understanding of how small molecules regulate Smo behavior. The Salic group recently published similar results in Nature Chemical Biology and we are aware of a paper in press at Developmental Cell also reporting similar results. There is overlap in many of the experiments and conclusions mapping the oxysterol binding domains of vertebrate Smoothened, the relationship between oxysterol engagement here and the action of inhibitors and activators within the 7 TM domain, and the reasons why <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smoothened works differently. Actual structural data on the CRD for Smoothened rather than inferred structural information in the Nedelcu based on lipid interactions with related CRDs for Frizzled family members distinguishes the paper under review. However, an actual structure with the CRD bound to oxysterol is not presented. Nevertheless, that all of these authors come to similar conclusions strengthens the impact of their work, and given the importance and interest in this molecule and the pathway it regulates, having more than one excellent report on this topic is no bad thing. Further, there are interesting differences in the behavior of “intelligent” drugs developed from an oxysterol base that adds an intriguing element to the current work.</p><p>Please address the following issues in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) The authors discuss the possibility that cyclopamine may engage both the CRD and 7 TM domain, explaining properties such as cyclopamine's ability to induce cilial trafficking while non-sterol pathway inhibitors thought to act at the 7 TM region do not have this effect. However, cyclopamine does not appear to compete with oxysterol binding to the CRD region in the authors' biochemical studies—a result at odds with this conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These data create confusion regarding the interplay the 7 TM and CRD sites). There are also recent data suggesting glucocorticoid interactions from Wang et al. that the authors might bring into the discussion. The authors are encouraged to open up some more in their discussion, making it very clear where their data agrees or disagrees with conclusions in Nedelcu et al., how they interpret disagreement and how they perceive the role of oxysterols in normal HH signaling.</p><p>2) There is an odd discrepancy in the figures that the authors should address. Firstly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> the Δ-CRD form of mSmo migrates higher on the gel than Wild-type mSmo when deletion of a domain suggests it should run lower (as it does in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Is there some mistake in the labeling or loading of the gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>? Also, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> the blot is labeled anti-Fc, but these forms of mSmo do not appear to have been Fc-tagged (vs YFP tagged).</p><p>3) The description of the zebrafish embryo experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) is difficult to follow for a more general audience. Please provide a more complete explanation and motivation for this experiment. Because only one example of each condition is shown and there is no data quantitation, it is difficult to know if the control and oxysterol treated samples are significantly different.</p><p>4) It would be useful to describe the fitting procedure for the bead-binding/competition curves and include a table that outlines the relative affinities for the different constructs/compounds studied.</p><p>5) The MALS experiments were performed at a zSmo CRD concentration of 5 μM. This is a very low concentration, so it is difficult to definitively state that the protein is monomeric. MALS experiments at higher protein concentrations would be useful to support the authors’ conclusion, or the authors could just say that the protein does not dimerize at low concentration.</p><p>6) A description of the structural comparison of the zSmo CRD is lacking. It is unclear what methods the authors used to make these comparisons and generate a phylogenetic tree. Are there other uncharacterized receptors that belong to this family? What are the rms deviations for the core parts of the structure, and over how many residues?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01340.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors discuss the possibility that cyclopamine may engage both the CRD and 7 TM domain, explaining properties such as cyclopamine's ability to induce cilial trafficking while non-sterol pathway inhibitors thought to act atthe 7 TM region do not have this effect.

These data create confusion regarding the interplay the 7 TM and CRD sites</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the potential contradiction between the results presented <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7C and 8G</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref> is a ligand affinity chromatography assay demonstrating that cyclopamine can indeed inhibit binding of the isolated Smo CRD-Fc to 20(S)-OHC beads. This observation is the basis of our hypothesis that cyclopamine can engage both the CRD and the 7 TM domains. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> is an assay that measures binding of bodipy-conjugated cyclopamine to cells expressing full-length Smo. In this assay (as shown previously) 20(S)-OHC does not block binding of bodipy-cyclopamine to Smo-expressing cells. Thus, we detect competition between 20(S)-OHC and cyclopamine when using the isolated, purified Smo CRD but not when using cells expressing full-length Smo. We believe the difference is because the cell-binding assay is significantly less sensitive than the affinity chromatography assay and is largely reporting on the higher affinity interaction between cyclopamine and the 7 TM site (which cannot be competed with oxysterols). Alternatively, it is possible that cyclopamine binds the CRD more weakly when it is embedded in the context of the whole protein.</p><p>The distinction between binding to the isolated CRD protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>) and full-length Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) in cells is now explicitly described in the Discussion, along with the potential explanations mentioned above. In terms of the interplay between the two sites, we describe the CRD and 7 TM sites as being physically distinct but allosterically linked early in the discussion.</p><p><italic>There are also recent data suggesting glucocorticoid interactions from Wang et al that the authors might bring into the discussion</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the Wang et al. paper is indeed quite relevant as it shows that Hh-active glucocorticoids fall into two distinct classes—a set that competes with cyclopamine and a set that does not—supporting the view that there are two ligand binding sites on Smo.

Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) are in agreement with Nedelcu et al. (and previous studies described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dwyer et al., 2007</xref>) that oxysterols do not compete with cyclopamine for binding to Smo-expressing cells. Nedelcu et al. did not report on whether cyclopamine competes with 20(S)-OHC for binding to the isolated Smo CRD—the experiment we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>—and thus there is no disagreement on this point.</p><p>We also now explicitly discuss (both in the Results and the Discussion) the following points of comparison between our manuscript and that of Nedelcu et al.:</p><p>A) The different properties of our CRD-targeted partial agonists of Smo compared to the CRD-targeted inhibitor from Nedelcu et al.</p><p>B) A comparison of Shh-responsiveness of the CRD-deleted Smo proteins reported in both the studies.</p><p>C) As the reviewers recommend, we have expanded the discussion to clarify our views on whether endogenous oxysterols regulate Hh signaling, whether oxysterols mediate the interaction between Ptch1 and Smo, and what specific studies will be required in the future to conclusively answer this important question.</p><p><italic>2) There is an odd discrepancy in the figures that the authors should address.

This is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and again in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, which depicts lysates from stable cell lines expressing YFP-Smo and ΔCRD-YFP-Smo. However, ΔCRD-YFP-Smo runs lower than YFP-Smo (as expected) when fractionated on a 4–12% gradient gel run using a neutral (Bis-Tris, pH=7.0) buffer system, which is used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>. Thus, the gel matrix composition and buffer system used had a large effect on the relative migration of YFP-Smo and ΔCRD-YFP-Smo.

Because only one example of each condition is shown and there is no data quantitation, it is difficult to know if the control and oxysterol treated samples are significantly different</italic>.</p><p>We have now expanded the description of the experiment and its motivation in the Results. The main motivation for the experiment is to demonstrate that zebrafish Smo (whose CRD we have crystallized and characterized in biochemical assays) does in fact respond to oxysterols. Since full length zebrafish Smo is poorly expressed in mammalian cells, we treated embryos to determine if endogenous Smo can respond to oxysterols by activating a transgenic Hh pathway reporter used to study Hh signaling during zebrafish development. In addition, data quantitation and statistical analysis of significance for this experiment is now provided in a new figure (Figure 4–figure supplement 1).</p><p><italic>4) It would be useful to describe the fitting procedure for the bead-binding/competition curves and include a table that outlines the relative affinities for the different constructs/compounds studied</italic>.</p><p>The fitting procedures and equations for all curves, shown in both the binding and signaling assays, are now included in the Methods section. For the binding experiments, two proteins were used—the mouse Smo CRD-Fc and the zebrafish Smo ECD. We have included saturation curves for the binding of both proteins to 20(S)-OHC beads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (new in the revised manuscript) and 4D, respectively. Estimates of the dissociation constants for the binding of these two proteins to 20(S)-OHC beads are noted in the respective figure legends. We have not used competition curves to derive dissociation constants because we measured the ability of free ligand to block binding of the Smo CRD to bead immobilized ligand—a condition in which the two ligands are clearly chemically different (hence violating a key assumption when using competition to derive dissociation constants). Finally, Figure 8–figure supplement 1 has been added to summarize the IC50 values for the two oxysterol-based inhibitors, 20(R)-yne and 20-keto-yne.</p><p><italic>5) The MALS experiments were performed at a zSmo CRD concentration of 5 μM.

It is unclear what methods the authors used to make these comparisons and generate a phylogenetic tree</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for not being clearer in our description of the structural phylogenetic tree analysis. We have now included a description in the Methods and replaced “Structure-based phylogenetic analysis of the CRD domains was performed using SHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Riffel et al., 2002</xref>)”with “Superposition of CRD structures and root mean square deviation (RMSD) values were calculated for equivalent Cα atoms using program SHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stuart et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Riffel et al., 2002</xref>).

Indeed, CRDs are structurally related distantly to the N-lobe region of the glypican protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pei and Grishin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Svensson et al., 2012</xref>). However, the N-lobe does not contain a small molecule binding groove or pocket and many of the Fz/Smo CRD motifs are different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pei and Grishin, 2012</xref>); thus, we have not included glypicans in our phylogenetic analysis.
