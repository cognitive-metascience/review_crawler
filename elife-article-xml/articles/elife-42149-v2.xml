However, how metabolic pathways influence meiotic progression in metazoans remains poorly understood. Here we examine the role of the TORC1 regulators GATOR1 and GATOR2 in the response to meiotic double-stranded breaks (DSB) during <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis. We find that in mutants of the GATOR2 component <italic>mio</italic>, meiotic DSBs trigger the constitutive downregulation of TORC1 activity and a permanent arrest in oocyte growth. Conversely, in GATOR1 mutants, high TORC1 activity results in the delayed repair of meiotic DSBs and the hyperactivation of p53. Unexpectedly, we found that GATOR1 inhibits retrotransposon expression in the presence of meiotic DSBs in a pathway that functions in parallel to p53. Thus, our studies have revealed a link between oocyte metabolism, the repair of meiotic DSBs and retrotransposon expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GATOR</kwd><kwd>TORC1</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>double-stranded breaks</kwd><kwd>retrotransposon</kwd><kwd>oogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Program HD00163 16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lilly</surname><given-names>Mary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BK20181456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Youheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31872287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Youheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The GATOR complex regulates TORC1 activity during meiosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>We are interested in understanding how metabolism impacts meiotic progression during oogenesis. <underline>T</underline>arget <underline>o</underline>f <underline>R</underline>apamycin <underline>C</underline>omplex 1 (TORC1) is a multi-protein complex that functions as a master regulator of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jewell and Guan, 2013</xref>). In the presence of adequate nutrients and positive upstream growth signals, TORC1, which contains the serine/threonine kinase Target of Rapamycin, becomes active and functions to stimulate growth and inhibit catabolic metabolism through the phosphorylation of down-stream effector proteins. The <underline>Se</underline>h1 <underline>A</underline>ssociated <underline>C</underline>omplex <underline>I</underline>nhibits <underline>T</underline>ORC1 (SEACIT), originally identified in yeast, inhibits TORC1 activity in response to amino acid limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Neklesa and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dokudovskaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wu and Tu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Panchaud et al., 2013</xref>). SEACIT, known as the <underline>G</underline>AP <underline>A</underline>ctivity <underline>To</underline>wards <underline>R</underline>ags complex 1 (GATOR1) in metazoans, is comprised of three highly conserved proteins Npr2/Nprl2, Npr3/Nprl3 and Iml1/Depdc5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Panchaud et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, depleting any of the three GATOR1 components results in increased TORC1 activity and growth, as well as a reduced response to amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kowalczyk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutchak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Marsan et al., 2016</xref>).

In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the down-regulation of TORC1 by SEACIT/GATOR1 in response to amino acid stress promotes both meiotic entry and early meiotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deutschbauer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jordan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Neklesa and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Spielewoy et al., 2010</xref>). Surprisingly, as is observed in yeast, during <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis the GATOR1 complex promotes meiotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wei et al., 2014</xref>). These data raise the intriguing possibility that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the GATOR1 complex and low TORC1 activity may be critical to the regulation of additional events of the early meiotic cycle.</p><p>Here we report that the GATOR complex is critical to the response to meiotic DSB during <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis. We find that restraining TORC1 activity via a pathway that involves both GATOR1 and the Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) promotes the timely repair of meiotic DSBs and prevents the hyperactivation of p53 in the female germline. Notably, the delayed repair of meiotic DSBs in GATOR1 mutants is due, at least in part, to the hyperactivation of the TORC1 target S6K. Conversely, our data indicate that the GATOR2 component Mio opposes the activity of GATOR1 in the female germline, thus preventing the constitutive downregulation of TORC1 activity and allowing for the growth and development of the oocyte in later stages of oogenesis. Thus, we have identified a regulatory loop required to modulate TORC1 activity in response to meiotic DSBs during <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis. Finally, during the course of our studies, we observed that the GATOR1 complex prevents the derepression of retrotransposon expression in the presence of meiotic DSBs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mio prevents the constitutive inhibition of TORC1 activity in response to meiotic DSBs</title><p>The GATOR2 complex inhibits the TORC1 inhibitor GATOR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Ovaries from mutants of the GATOR2 component <italic>mio,</italic> have reduced TORC1 activity and are severely growth restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iida and Lilly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wei et al., 2014</xref>). In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the <italic>mio</italic> ovarian phenotypes result from the constitutive downregulation of TORC1 activity via a GATOR1 dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wei et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, removing GATOR1 activity in the <italic>mio</italic> mutant background, as is observed in <italic>mio, nprl3</italic> double mutants, results in increased TORC1 activity and rescues the <italic>mio</italic> ovarian phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wei et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, <italic>mio</italic> mutants are also suppressed by blocking the formation of meiotic DSBs, with approximately 70% of <italic>mio</italic> ovaries achieving wild-type levels of growth when double mutant for genes required to generate meiotic DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iida and Lilly, 2004</xref>). One model to explain this observation is that meiotic DSBs promote the downregulation of TORC1 activity in the early meiotic cycle and that <italic>mio</italic> is required to oppose or attenuate this response. To test this idea, we examined if blocking the formation of meiotic DSBs in the <italic>mio</italic> mutant background resulted in increased TORC1 activity. Towards this end, we compared the phosphorylation status of S6 kinase, a downstream TORC1 target, in ovaries from <italic>mio<sup>2</sup></italic> single mutant versus <italic>mio, mei-W68</italic> double mutant ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). For these experiments, we used null alleles of both <italic>mio (mio<sup>2</sup>)</italic> and <italic>mei-W68</italic> (<italic>mei-W68<sup>1</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McKim and Hayashi-Hagihara, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iida and Lilly, 2004</xref>). <italic>mei-W68</italic> (<italic>SPO11</italic> homolog) is a highly-conserved enzyme required for the generation of meiotic DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McKim and Hayashi-Hagihara, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sekelsky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). We found that relative to ovaries from <italic>mio</italic> single mutants, <italic>mio, mei-W68</italic> double mutants have increased levels of TORC1 activity as measured by the phosphorylation of S6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Notably, <italic>mio<sup>2</sup></italic>, <italic>mei-W68<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants have TORC1 activity levels similar to that observed in <italic>mei-W68<sup>1</sup></italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Why ovaries from <italic>mei-W68<sup>1</sup></italic> single mutants have decreased levels of TORC1 activity relative to wild type ovaries is unclear. In addition to increasing TORC1 activity, blocking the formation of meiotic DSBs partially rescues <italic>mio</italic> mutant fertility, with <italic>mio<sup>2</sup>, mei-W68<sup>1</sup></italic> double mutants laying approximately ten times more eggs than <italic>mio<sup>2</sup></italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, mutants in the <italic>spnA</italic> homolog Rad51, which fail to repair meiotic DSBs, also have decreased TORC1 activity relative to wild-type ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). From these data, we conclude that the constitutive downregulation of TORC1 activity in <italic>mio</italic> mutants is potentiated, at least in part, by the presence of meiotic DSBs.</p><p>To refine when meiotic DSBs impact TORC1 activity during meiosis, we stained ovaries with antibodies against the phosphorylated form of the TORC1 target 4E-BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Teleman et al., 2005</xref>).

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, oogenesis begins in region 1 of the germarium when a germline stem cell divides to produce a cystoblast that undergoes four mitotic divisions, with incomplete cytokinesis, to produce a 16 cell interconnected germline cyst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Cuevas et al., 1997</xref>). In late region 2a of the germarium, Spo11/Mei-W68 generates the meiotic DSBs that initiate meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McKim and Hayashi-Hagihara, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hunter, 2015</xref>). As meiosis proceeds, meiotic DSBs are repaired such that by late region 2b, only a small fraction of oocytes retain unrepaired DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mehrotra and McKim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Narbonne-Reveau and Lilly, 2009</xref>). We found that the levels of p4E-BP are low in the vast-majority of ovarian cysts undergoing mitotic divisions in region 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A’,B</xref>). However, a small number (0.5 per germarium, n = 57) of region one ovarian cysts have dramatically higher levels of p4E-BP staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A”</xref>, arrowhead). These observations are consistent with the previously reported oscillation of TORC1 activity during the mitotic cell cycle in larval imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2017</xref>). As ovarian cysts enter meiosis I in early region 2a of the germarium, the levels of p4E-BP are low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A’,B</xref>). As ovarian cysts are encapsulated by follicle cells in germarial region 2b, the levels of p4E-BP begin to rise and remain above those observed in region one and early region 2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, arrow). In contrast to what is observed in wild type, in <italic>mio</italic> mutant ovarian cysts, p4E-BP levels remain low in germline cells in region 2b and beyond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, arrow).

This result is not surprising when one considers the anatomy of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary. In wild-type ovaries, meiotic DSBs are present in only a small number of 16 cell cysts in the germarium. Moreover, meiotic DSBs are repaired prior to the rapid growth of the egg chamber. Thus, in wild type females, ovarian cysts that contain meiotic DSBs represent an exceedingly small percentage of the tissue in the ovary. Therefore, it is unlikely that increasing TORC1 activity in only a small number of germarial ovarian cysts would result in an increase in TORC1 activity in the ovary that could be observed by western blot. In contrast, note that ovaries from <italic>spnA</italic> mutants, which retain DSBs throughout oogenesis, have low TORC1 activity relative to wild type ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Thus, using epistasis analysis we were unable to definitely determine if meiotic DSBS trigger the downregulation of TORC1 activity via the GATOR1/TSC pathway.</p><p>We were interested in defining the upstream pathway that connects meiotic DSBs to the TORC1 regulatory machinery. <italic>Ataxia telangiectasia</italic> (ATM), known as <italic>telomere fusion</italic> (<italic>tefu</italic>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, regulates both the generation and the repair of meiotic DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joyce et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>atm/tefu</italic> mutants produce supernumerary meiotic DSBs. Therefore, we examined a downstream target and effector of <italic>atm/tefu</italic>, <italic>chk2</italic>, which has not been implicated in the generation of meiotic DSBs. <italic>chk2</italic>, known as <italic>loki</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, is a critical component of the DNA damage response pathway and has multiple targets involved in DNA repair, cell cycle progression and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zannini et al., 2014</xref>). We determined that removing <italic>chk2/loki</italic> activity in the <italic>mio</italic> mutant background, by generating double-mutants of <italic>loki</italic> and <italic>mio</italic> null alleles, partially rescued the <italic>mio</italic> mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Specifically, we found that <italic>mio<sup>2</sup>, loki<sup>6</sup></italic> double mutants are approximately twice the size of <italic>mio<sup>2</sup></italic> single mutants. In contrast, we previously demonstrated that the downregulation of TORC1 activity observed in the <italic>mio</italic> mutant is not triggered by the upstream activity of Ataxia Telangiectasia–Related (ATR), known as <italic>mei-41</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iida and Lilly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joyce et al., 2011</xref>).

Importantly, <italic>spnA</italic> mutants, including the <italic>spnA<sup>1</sup>/spnA<sup>093</sup></italic> transheterozygotes used here, fail to repair meiotic DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Staeva-Vieira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joyce and McKim, 2011</xref>).

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, only the female germline undergoes meiotic recombination and thus experiences the genotoxic stress associated with developmentally programmed DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>). We show that in <italic>mio</italic> mutants, blocking the formation of meiotic DSBs prevents the constitutive downregulation of TORC1 activity thus allowing for the growth and development of the oocyte. These data are consistent with the model that meiotic DSBs trigger the activation of a TORC1 inhibitory pathway that must be opposed and/or attenuated by the GATOR2 component Mio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42149.018</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A working model for the role of the GATOR complex in the response to meiotic DSBs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) After ovarian cysts enter meiosis, meiotic DSBs function to activate and/or maintain a GATOR1/TSC dependent pathway to ensure low TORC1 activity in early prophase of meiosis I. Low TORC1 activity promotes the timely repair of meiotic DSBs.

This model is consistent with the ability of both GATOR1 and TSC depletions to rescue the <italic>mio</italic> mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wei et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, recent reports indicate that GATOR1 and TSC act in a common pathway to downregulate TORC1 activity in response to multiple upstream inhibitory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demetriades et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Menon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demetriades et al., 2016</xref>). Previously, we determined that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, amino acid starvation induces a dramatic GATOR1/TSC dependent decrease in TORC1 activity in somatic tissues, that far exceeds any reduction in TORC1 activity observed in <italic>GATOR2</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2016</xref>). This observation strongly suggests that, in addition to the removal of the GATOR2 inhibition of GATOR1, there is an activation step that is required to fully potentiate the GATOR1/TSC pathway.</p><p>Thus, based on our data we propose the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Meiotic DSBs activate, or are required to maintain, a GATOR1/TSC dependent pathway that downregulates TORC1 activity in the female germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The GATOR2 component Mio is required to oppose or turnoff this pathway to prevent the constitutive downregulation of TORC1 activity in later stages of oogenesis. While we believe our data support the role of the GATOR1/TSC pathway, we concede that an alternative regulator of TORC1 activity may also be critical to the downregulation of TORC1 activity in response to meiotic DSBs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>GATOR1 and TSC promote the repair of meiotic DSBs</title><p>Hyperactivation of TORC1 has been linked to defects in the DNA damage response in single celled and multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Begley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klermund et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xie et al., 2018</xref>). The observation that meiotic DSBs likely promote the GATOR1 dependent downregulation of TORC1 activity during <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis, suggested that limiting TORC1 activity may be important to the regulation of meiotic DSB repair. In our previous work, we found that GATOR1 mutant ovaries had TORC1 activity levels approximately three times higher than those observed in wild-type ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2016</xref>). Here we demonstrate that GATOR1 mutant ovaries exhibit multiple phenotypes consistent with the misregulation of meiotic DSB repair including, an increase in the steady state number of Mei-W68/Spo-11 induced DSBs, the retention of meiotic DSBs into later stages of oogenesis and the hyperactivation of p53. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, RNAi depletions of <italic>Tsc1</italic> partially phenocopied the GATOR1 ovarian defects. Thus, the misregulation of meiotic DSBs observed in GATOR1 mutant oocytes are due to high TORC1 activity and not to a TORC1 independent function of the GATOR1 complex.</p><p>Epistasis analysis between the GATOR1 component <italic>nprl3</italic> and the Rad51 homolog <italic>spnA</italic>, strongly suggest that GATOR1 impacts the repair, rather than the generation, of meiotic DSBs. We determined that double mutants of <italic>nprl2</italic> and the Rad51 homolog <italic>spnA</italic>, which is required for the repair of meiotic DSBs, have approximately the same number of DSBs as <italic>spnA</italic> single mutants. These data are consistent with GATOR1 and <italic>spnA</italic> influencing the common process of DNA repair and are inconsistent with GATOR1 mutants producing supernumerary breaks.</p><p>Our observations on the role of the GATOR1 complex during <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis are particularly intriguing in light of similar meiotic defects observed in a <italic>npr3</italic> mutants in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jordan et al., 2007</xref>). In the sporulation proficient strain SK1, <italic>npr3</italic> mutant cells enter meiosis and express the transcription factor and master regulator of gametogenesis IME1 with wild-type kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jordan et al., 2007</xref>). Subsequently, <italic>npr3</italic> mutants exhibit a mild delay in the generation of meiotic DNA breaks, but a substantial delay in the repair of meiotic DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jordan et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic> SEACIT/GATOR1 mutants share a common meiotic phenotype, the delayed repair of meiotic DSBs. These results raise the intriguing possibility that low TORC1 activity may be a common feature of the early meiotic cycle in many organisms.</p><p>Notably, our data indicate that the delay in the repair of meiotic DSBs in GATOR1 mutants is due to the hyperactivation of the TORC1 downstream target S6K. S6K is a critical downstream effector of TORC1 that impacts multiple essential cellular processes including, but not limited to cell growth, energy balance and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Magnuson et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, in mammals, S6K has been implicated in the regulation of the DNA damage response with hyperactivation of the TORC1-S6K pathway resulting in the accumulation of unrepaired DSBs and genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xie et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, similar to what is reported in mammals, our data are consistent with the model that the hyperactivity of the TORC1/S6K axis delays the repair of DSBs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Finally, we determined that GATOR1 mutants have a diminished response to DSBs outside the female germline in somatic tissues of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Similar to what is observed in TSC mutant cells in humans that have increased levels of TORC1 activity, we find that GATOR1 mutant embryos have a reduced ability to survive low levels of γ-irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paterson et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deschavanne and Fertil, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pai et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, in the somatic follicle cells of the ovary we observed a delay in the repair of DSBs after adult females are exposed to low levels of γ-irradiation. Thus, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> inappropriately high TORC1 activity delays the repair of DSBs in both the germline and somatic tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>GATOR1 opposes retrotransposon expression</title><p>The initiation of homologous recombination through the programmed generation of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) is a universal feature of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McKim and Hayashi-Hagihara, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>). DSBs represent a dangerous form of DNA damage that can result in dramatic and permanent changes to the germline genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>). To minimize this destructive potential, the generation and repair of meiotic DSBs is tightly controlled in space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Longhese et al., 2009</xref>). The activation of transposable elements represents an additional threat to genome integrity in germ line cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crichton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Toth et al., 2016</xref>). Genotoxic stress, resulting from DNA damage, has been implicated in the deregulation of transposons in multiple organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradshaw and McEntee, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Walbot, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beauregard et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, germ line cells may be at an increased risk for transposon derepression due to the genotoxic stress associated with meiotic recombination. Consistent with this hypothesis, germ line cells have evolved extensive surveillance systems to detect and silence transposons beyond the pathways present in most somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khurana and Theurkauf, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ku and Lin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Toth et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that DNA damage promotes the deregulation of retrotransposon in multiple organisms, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">McClintock, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradshaw and McEntee, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Walbot, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beauregard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Molla-Herman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wylie et al., 2016</xref>). In line with these studies, we find that in GATOR1 mutants, the DSBs that initiate meiotic recombination trigger the deregulation of retrotransposon expression. Similarly, <italic>p53</italic> mutant females derepress retrotransposon expression during oogenesis, but as observed in GATOR1 mutants, primarily in the presence of meiotic DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wylie et al., 2016</xref>). Double mutants of <italic>nprl3, p53</italic> exhibit a dramatic increase in retrotransposon expression relative to either <italic>p53</italic> or <italic>nprl3</italic> single mutants, implying that <italic>p53</italic> and GATOR1 act through independent pathways to repress retrotransposon expression in the female germline. One possibility is that both GATOR1 and p53 independently impact genome stability. Thus, disabling both pathways may have an additive effect on both genome stability and retrotransposon expression. Consistent with the hypothesis that genome instability drives retrotransposon expression, we find that mutants in <italic>spnA/Rad51</italic>, which fail to repair meiotic DSBs, also exhibit increased transcription of multiple retrotransposons. Intriguingly, the SpnA homolog Rad51, as well as other genes required for DNA repair, was recently identified in a high throughput screen for genes that suppress (Long Interspersed Element-1) LINE1 expression in mammalian tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>However, our data also suggest that the GATOR1 complex may influence retrotransposon expression independent of the regulation of TORC1 activity. While both GATOR1 and TSC are required for the efficient repair of meiotic DSBs, in contrast to GATOR1 mutant ovaries, we observed little to no increase in retrotransposon expression in the <italic>Tsc1</italic> depleted ovaries. We believe reflects the incomplete depletion of Tsc1 by RNAi resulting in a reduced retention of meiotic DSBs relative to GATOR1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, a second possibility is that the GATOR1 complex inhibits retrotransposon expression independent of TORC1 inhibition. As is observed with <italic>spnA</italic> the depletion of GATOR1 components, but not TSC components result in the activation of LINE1 expression in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these data hint that the GATOR1 complex may impact retrotransposon expression in the germline via two independent pathways: First by promoting the repair of meiotic DSBs through the downregulation of TORC1 activity and second via a pathway that functions independent of TORC1 inhibition.</p><p>Genes encoding components of the GATOR1 complex are often deleted in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lerman and Minna, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ji et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ueda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>). As is observed in GATOR1 mutants, cancer cells frequently have increased TORC1 activity, increased genomic instability and increased retrotransposon expression. Thus, in the future it will be important to identify the molecular mechanism by which the GATOR1 complex influences both the response to genotoxic stress and the expression of retrotransposons under both normal and pathological conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Atg1</td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FBgn0260945</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Iml1</td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FBgn0035227</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Loki</td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FBgn0019686</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Mio</td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FBgn0031399</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Mei-W68</td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FBgn0002716</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Mei-P22</td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FBgn0016036</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Nprl2</td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FBgn0030800</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Nprl3</td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FBgn0036397</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">p53</td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FBgn0039044</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Spn-A</td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FBgn0003479</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">S6K</td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FBgn0283472</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Thor</td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FBgn0261560</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tsc1</td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FBgn0026317</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Atg1<sup>Δ3D</sup>, FRT 2A/Tm3, sb1</td><td valign="top">FlyBase, PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098761">24098761</ext-link></td><td valign="top">FBal0176392</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">iml1<sup>1</sup></td><td valign="top">FlyBase, PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27672113">27672113</ext-link></td><td valign="top">FBal0325028</td><td valign="top">FlyBase symbol: iml1<sup>1</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">loki<sup>P6</sup></td><td valign="top">FlyBase, PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14729967">14729967</ext-link></td><td valign="top">FBal0216721</td><td valign="top">FlyBase symbol: lok<sup>p6</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">mio<sup>2</sup></td><td valign="top">FlyBase, PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14973288">14973288</ext-link></td><td valign="top">FBal0158954</td><td valign="top">FlyBase symbol: mio<sup>2</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">mei-P22<sup>P22</sup></td><td valign="top">Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</td><td valign="top">BDSC:4931</td><td valign="top">Genotype: y<sup>1</sup>w<sup>1</sup>/Dp(1;Y)y<sup>+</sup>;

Briefly 6 pairs of ovaries were freshly dissected in cell insect media and homogenized in 30 μl of 4x Laemmli loading sample buffer (Invitrogen, #NP0008) containing 10x sample reducing agent (Invitrogen, #NP009). Extracts were cleared by centrifugation and boiled for 10 min at 90°C. 10 μl of protein extract was loaded per lane on polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen, #NP0335). Proteins were separated and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Primary antibodies used were as follows: guinea pig anti-dS6K (gift of Aurelius Teleman,1:5,000,) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hahn et al., 2010</xref>) and rabbit anti-phospho-Thr398-S6K (Cell Signaling Technologies #9209, 1:1,000). HRP- conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, AffiniPure anti-rabbit #111-005-144 and anti-guinea pig #106-005-003) were used. Blots were developed using the ECL detection system (PerkinElmer, #NEL105001EA).

Pro-oocytes and oocytes were identified by the pattern of anti-C(3)G staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Page and Hawley, 2001</xref>). Multiple Z-sections encompassing an entire region 2a pro-oocyte nucleus were acquired by Leica SP5 confocal microscope or Zeiss LSM 880 with Airyscan confocal microscopy. The obtained z-stacks of images were deconvolved to remove out-of-focus light and z-distortion with Huygens Professional software (Scientific Volume Imaging) and clearly defined γ-H2Av were counted manually in the ovarian cyst with the highest levels of γ-H2Av staining. Alternatively, 3D images were rendered by using Imaris software (Bitplane) and a graph workstation equipped with NVIDIA Quadro 3D vision system. Clearly defined γ-H2Av foci were visualized and counted by using Imaris spots module or ImageJ to define the total number of foci per nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>MMS sensitivity assay</title><p>The assay was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghabrial et al.

Parents were transferred into German food (Genesee Scientific, Cat#66–115, Day 1) vials for 24 hr at 25°C and allowed to lay eggs. On Day two the parents were removed, and eggs were allowed to mature for 24 hr. Subsequently, the first and second instar larvae were treated with 250 μL of either 0.04% or 0.08% of the mutagen methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) (Sigma, Cat#129925–5G). Control larvae were treated with 250 μL water.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The GATOR complex regulates an essential response to meiotic double-stranded breaks in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>I have appended the reviews in their entirety below. As you can see, the reviews are reasonably well aligned, and the reviewers were favorable overall about your interesting study. However they have requested significant revisions that we hope can clarify some outstanding issues. These requests seem reasonable and I suggest you do your best to address those that are technically straightforward within a reasonable timeframe. While I agree with the reviewers that looking further into the GATOR dependency, determining whether DSBs in WT inhibit TOR, and how DSBs mechanistically affect TOR (is it via S6K?) are important directions, delineating a complete, precise mechanism is not necessarily essential for this paper to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>, so long as the conclusions are clear and warranted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Wei and colleagues delineate a pathway whereby double-stranded breaks (DSBs) inhibit mTORC1 activity via the GATOR1 complex, and this in turn allows repair of the double-stranded breaks. Overall, this is an interesting finding. A couple of the causality links of this story, however, need to be further tested to make the story solid:</p><p>1) Figure 1C shows that inhibition of DSB formation leads to increased mTORC1 activity in a mutant condition where mTORC1 activity is aberrantly low due to loss-of-function of GATOR2 (<italic>mio<sup>2</sup></italic> mutation). However, this does not show that in the wildtype condition DSBs affect mTOR activity. If the model is correct, the DSBs that occur normally in the ovary should be inhibiting mTORC1. Removing these DSBs should alleviate this suppression. So does the <italic>mei-W68<sup>1</sup></italic> mutation increase S6K phosphorylation in the ovary compared to wildtype animals?</p><p>2) The role of GATOR1 in mediating the effect of DSBs on mTORC1 needs to be tested more rigorously using loss-of-function epistasis. From the data in Figure 1C, the authors conclude DSBs affect mTORC1 via GATOR1. However, the data do not exclude the alternate possibility that DSBs and GATOR1 affect mTORC1 via parallel pathways. One way to test this is to assay S6K phosphorylation in ovaries of the following genotypes:</p><p>- WT</p><p>- <italic>mei-W68<sup>1</sup></italic></p><p>- <italic>iml1</italic>- (GATOR1 loss-of-function)</p><p>- <italic>iml1-, mei-W69<sup>1</sup></italic> double mutants</p><p>In addition, this manuscript is lacking molecular mechanisms. How does mTORC1 activity affect DSB repair? Is it through delaying cell cycle progression? Is it through affecting transcription or translation of proteins required for repair? Alternatively, the upstream mechanism how DSBs affect GATOR1 activity is also missing. This may be a significant amount of work. Hence, it is an editorial decision how much molecular mechanism is wished in the present manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Wei and coworkers describe some interesting connections between TOR signaling, meiotic double strand breaks and genotoxic stress in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary. This work builds on their previous characterization of the TORC1 regulators GATOR1 and GATOR2, the latter of which was shown to have germline-specific functions. Here they demonstrate that TORC1 activity is sensitive to DSB formation in the context of Mio/GATOR2 mutant ovaries, providing a possible explanation for these germline-specific effects. Under conditions of high TORC1 activity in GATOR1 mutants, resolution of meiotic DSBs is delayed, leading to increases in p53 activity, DNA damage sensitivity, and retrotransposon expression. Interestingly, some but not all of these effects are phenocopied by germline depletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic>, indicating some possible TORC1-independent functions of GATOR1.</p><p>This work is timely and well described, and adds to a growing literature examining the role of metabolism in gametogenesis. Overall the data are lovely and appear well controlled. Additional insight into the mechanisms behind these novel observations would strengthen the manuscript, and experiments that probe these issues in somatic cells would make it of more general interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readers.</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate that in <italic>mio</italic> mutants, disruption of DSB formation leads to increased TORC1 activity, and they repeatedly describe this result as a GATOR-dependent response. However, the observation that TORC1 activity responds to the presence or absence of DSBs in ovaries lacking <italic>mio</italic> demonstrates that GATOR2 is not required for this response (in contrast to the model depicted in Figure 6), and would suggest that it is likely independent of GATOR1 as well. The role of GATOR1 is not directly tested here, and DSBs could in principle affect TORC1 activity through any one of multiple positive or negative TORC1 regulators/components. Without evidence that GATOR1 is specifically/selectively involved in this signal, I don't see the justification for calling this a GATOR1-dependent effect in the Title, Abstract, etc.</p><p>2) The requirement for other well characterized TORC1 inputs (e.g., nutrient and insulin pathways) should be addressed. A more thorough probing of the mechanism by which DSBs affect TORC1 activity should be included here, and the effects of <italic>mei-P22</italic> mutation on TORC1 activity should be examined in otherwise wildtype animals and other mutations/conditions that lead to low TORC1 signaling.</p><p>3) The proximal signals linking DSBs to TORC1 downregulation also should be addressed, by examining the genetic requirements for DSB checkpoint components in this response. Do exogenous, non-meiotic DSBs lead to similar effects, perhaps also in somatic cells, or does this require the context of a delayed synaptonemal complex?</p><p>4) Similarly, the manuscript elegantly shows that increased TORC1 activity results in delayed or defective repair of meiotic DSBs, but is lacking in mechanistic detail. Here, examining the localization and activity of repair pathway components could prove insightful. Again, whether these observations reflect a general effect of high TORC1 activity on DSB repair or is limited to germline-specific lesions should be tested, as previous studies have described that low TORC1 activity can impair DSB repair/DNA damage response.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper analyzes the interesting intersection between the regulation of metabolism and meiotic progression. It is well known that entry of meiosis in budding yeast is regulated by nutrient availability. The PI has previously published that similar pathways, involving TORC1 and the GATOR1/2 complexes, regulate meiosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This paper is interesting because it connects these regulators of metabolism to double strand break formation as well as p53 and stress responses. The data are convincing and support the conclusions. The most significant results are that DSBs trigger a stress response, which must be modulated by regulating the TORC1 pathway and preventing hyperactivation of p53. The data are interesting with significant impact in areas of regulating gametogenesis and meiotic recombination. There are several issues raised below that are mostly asking for more clarity in describing mutants and cytological results. A couple of experiments are suggested, which entail looking at a couple additional genotypes in the assays presented and thus should not be technically challenging unless there are viability issues. These are meant to generalize the results to the entire pathway presented in Figure 1 but are not essential for the main conclusions of the paper.</p><p>In several places are statements that TORC1 activity facilitates entry into meiosis (e.g. subsections “GATOR1 promotes the repair of meiotic DSB” and “GATOR2 opposes a GATOR1 dependent response to meiotic DSBs”). This seems to be mostly taken yeast results. In the absence of GATOR1 in flies, it might be predicted that oocytes either don't form oocytes or meiotic entry does not occur. In fact, Wei et al. reported a delay in meiotic entry in GATOR1 mutants. My question is whether the observed delay in meiotic entry may be more accurately described as a defect in progression. It is also critical to know if the mutants being analyzed in this paper are null alleles. Hypomorphs or RNAi could have leaky phenotypes when it comes to meiotic entry. In subsection “GATOR1 mutants hyperactivate p53 in response to meiotic DSBs”, a <italic>nprl3</italic> is referred to as null, but this is in passing and this information should be much earlier.

One explanation is that the TORC pathway is downstream of p53. However, the phenotype of the p53 <italic>nprl3</italic> double is additive with respect to TE expression. As mentioned above, the correct interpretation of these experiments depends on both mutants being null alleles. It also suggests the elevated p53 levels in the <italic>nprl</italic> mutants is not the cause of the increased TE expression. More comment on these discrepancies would be appreciated.

Overall, this is an interesting finding. A couple of the causality links of this story, however, need to be further tested to make the story solid:</p><p>1) Figure 1C shows that inhibition of DSB formation leads to increased mTORC1 activity in a mutant condition where mTORC1 activity is aberrantly low due to loss-of-function of GATOR2 (mio<sup>2</sup> mutation). However, this does not show that in the wildtype condition DSBs affect mTOR activity. If the model is correct, the DSBs that occur normally in the ovary should be inhibiting mTORC1. Removing these DSBs should alleviate this suppression. So does the mei-W68<sup>1</sup> mutation increase S6K phosphorylation in the ovary compared to wildtype animals?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed two sets of experiments to address the reviewer’s question. First, as suggested by reviewers #1 and #2, we examined TORC1 activity in <italic>mei-w68<sup>1</sup></italic>single mutants by western blot and determined that <italic>mei-w68<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant ovaries do not have increased TORC1 activity relative to wild-type ovaries (Figure 1). A similar result was observed in <italic>mei-P22</italic> mutants, which also fail to generate meiotic DSBs (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). We believe this observation is not surprising when one considers the anatomy of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary. In wild-type ovaries, meiotic DSBs are present in only a small number of 16-cell cysts in the germarium and are repaired prior to the rapid growth of the egg chamber. Thus, ovarian cysts that contain meiotic DSBs represent an exceedingly small percentage of the tissue in the ovary. Thus, we reasoned it is unlikely that increasing TORC1 activity in only a small number of germarial ovarian cysts would result in an increase in TORC1 activity in the ovary that could be observed by western blot. However, please note that <italic>spnA/Rad51</italic> mutants, which retain meiotic DSBs throughout oogenesis, have reduced TORC1 activity relative to wild-type ovaries as measured by p-S6K levels assayed by western blot. These experiments are described in the second paragraph of the subsection “Mio prevents the constitutive inhibition of TORC1 activity in response to meiotic DSBs”, Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><p>To obtain better resolution as to when and where meiotic DSBs impact TORC1 activity during oogenesis, we used an antibody against the phosphorylated form of the downstream TORC1 target 4E-BP. Briefly, we determined that “In contrast to what is observed in wild type, in <italic>mio</italic> mutant ovarian cysts, p4E-BP levels remain low in germline cells in region 2b and beyond (Figure 2C, arrow). Consistent with the western blot analysis, <italic>mio, mei-w68</italic> double mutant ovarian cysts have an approximately three-fold increase in p4E-BP staining in region 2b of the germarium relative to <italic>mio</italic> mutants (Figure 2C, E and H) Notably, the increase in TORC1 activity in the <italic>mio, mei-w68</italic> double mutants is restricted to the germline, consistent with blocking meiotic DSBs having cell autonomous effects on TORC1 activity in the germline. Additionally, consistent with our western blot analysis in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, ovarian cysts from <italic>spnA/Rad51</italic> mutants, which do not repair meiotic DSBs, have reduced levels of p4E-BP staining (Figure 2F). Taken together these data strongly suggest that <italic>mio</italic> is required to oppose/attenuate the downregulation of TORC1 activity triggered by the presence of meiotic DSBs.” These new results are described in the third paragraph of the subsection “Mio prevents the constitutive inhibition of TORC1 activity in response to meiotic DSBs” and Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The role of GATOR1 in mediating the effect of DSBs on mTORC1 needs to be tested more rigorously using loss-of-function epistasis. From the data in Figure 1C, the authors conclude DSBs affect mTORC1 via GATOR1. However, the data do not exclude the alternate possibility that DSBs and GATOR1 affect mTORC1 via parallel pathways. One way to test this is to assay S6K phosphorylation in ovaries of the following genotypes:</p><p>- WT</p><p>- mei-W68<sup>1</sup></p><p>- iml1- (GATOR1 loss-of-function)</p><p>- iml1-, mei-W69<sup>1</sup> double mutants</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer we performed epistasis analysis using the GATOR1 component <italic>nprl3</italic> and <italic>mei-P22</italic> a gene required for the generation of meiotic DSBs. We found that p-S6K levels were not significantly different in wild-type and <italic>mei-p22</italic> mutant ovaries. Moreover, <italic>mei-p22, nprl3</italic> double mutants had lower levels of p-S6K than <italic>nprl3</italic> single mutants. Thus, blocking the formation of meiotic DSBs does not in and of itself result in increased TORC1 activity. This experiment is described in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Mio prevents the constitutive inhibition of TORC1 activity in response to meiotic DSBs” and summarized in Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, this manuscript is lacking molecular mechanisms. How does mTORC1 activity affect DSB repair? Is it through delaying cell cycle progression? Is it through affecting transcription or translation of proteins required for repair?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to examine why high TORC1 activity delays the repair of meiotic DSBs we examined three downstream targets of TORC1, <italic>atg1</italic>, 4E-BP/<italic>thor</italic> and S6K. Atg1 and 4E-BP are inhibited by TORC1 activity while S6K is activated by TORC1. Our results suggest that the delay in the repair of meiotic DSBs observed in GATOR1 mutants is due, at least in part, to the increased activity of S6K. Our negative results were also informative. We determined that null mutants of <italic>atg1,</italic> which isrequired for autophagy, as well as null mutants of the translational inhibitor 4E-BP/<italic>thor,</italic> do not alter the kinetics of meiotic DSB repair during oogenesis. Thus, we concluded it is highly unlikely that high TORC1 activity delays the repair of meiotic DSBs through the constitutive inhibition of autophagy or the inhibition of the translational inhibitor 4E-BP. These experiments are detailed in the first paragraph of the subsection “Co-depleting S6K rescues the increase in the steady state number of meiotic DSBs in <italic>iml1</italic> germline depletions” and Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, the upstream mechanism how DSBs affect GATOR1 activity is also missing.

The current model shows that Mio is not involved in regulating the initial downregulation of TORC1 activity in response to meiotic DSBs but is required to attenuate or turn off this response. This model is consistent with all of our data. The model is presented in Figure 9 and discussed in the Discussion subsection “The GATOR complex and the response to meiotic DSBs”.</p><p>We agree with reviewer #2 that we have not formally proven that the GATOR1/TSC pathway is activated by the presence of meiotic DSBs and have now adjusted the text accordingly. Importantly, we have altered the Abstract and have corrected our language throughout the manuscript to reflect the speculative nature of the connection between meiotic DSBs and the direct activation of a GATOR1/TSC dependent pathway. However, we strongly disagree that the most logical explanation for our results is that the response to meiotic DSBs activates a pathway that is completely independent of the GATOR/TSC pathway. We believe a much simpler explanation is that the regulation of TORC1 activity in the female germline requires two steps: (1) the activation of a GATOR1/TSC dependent pathway by meiotic DSBs and (2) the failure of Mio to attenuate or turnoff this activated pathway. This would be consistent with our published epistasis analysis which demonstrated that double mutants of <italic>mio</italic> and GATOR1 or TSC components rescue the <italic>mio</italic> mutant phenotypes (Wei et al., 2014).

Finally, in unpublished data we see a slight activation of p53 in some GATOR2 mutants, including <italic>mio,</italic> which may be the result of low TORC1 activity. For all of these reasons, we believe the result from the suggested experiment would be difficult to interpret.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, can the authors add p53 be in the model of Figure 6?</p></disp-quote><p>I think this would be difficult to do without causing confusion. We simplified our previous model at the request of the other reviewers. Currently, we believe that p53 is activated in GATOR1 mutants due to the delay in the repair of meiotic DSBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “GATOR1 inhibits retrotransposon expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic>”: The most confusing results concern the relationship between the GATOR1, p53 and TEs. The effect of these mutants on TE expression is DSB dependent. However, while nprl2/3 mutants have elevated TE expression, they also have elevated, rather than reduced, p53. One explanation is that the TORC pathway is downstream of p53. However, the phenotype of the p53 nprl3 double is additive with respect to TE expression. As mentioned above, the correct interpretation of these experiments depends on both mutants being null alleles. It also suggests the elevated p53 levels in the nprl mutants is not the cause of the increased TE expression. More comment on these discrepancies would be appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and have now clearly stated that the epistasis analysis between <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>nprl3</italic> was performed with null alleles. We realized that the introduction to these experiments was extremely confusing. We have now reorganized as well as rewritten components of this section of the manuscript.</p><p>Our data indicate that p53 is necessary but not sufficient for repression of retrotransposon expression in the female germline. This result is consistent with our epistasis analysis, which demonstrated that GATOR1 and p53 function to suppress retrotransposon expression via independent pathways (Figure 8). Because they are functioning in independent pathways, increasing p53 activity would not be predicted to rescue the GATOR1 phenotypes.</p><p>As currently outlined in the discussion subsection “GATOR1 opposes retrotransposon expression”, our data support the model that genotoxic stress, due to the delay in the repair of meiotic DSBs, is upstream of both increased p53 activity and derepressed retrotransposon expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be helpful to see a GATOR1-2 (mio nprl) double mutant, or a mio single, to determine if TE regulation is dependent on the pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>It is unclear what one might predict for a <italic>mio</italic> single mutant, decreased retrotransposon expression perhaps? Because we have not yet examined how <italic>mio</italic> and other GATOR2 components impact genome stability, we believe these experiments are beyond the scope of the manuscript. As noted above, low TORC1 activity, disrupts the response to DSBs in mammalian cells. Consistent with these reports, in unpublished data we see a slight activation of p53 in some GATOR2 mutants, including <italic>mio</italic>. Thus, we believe it would be difficult to interpret the results from these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “GATOR2 opposes a GATOR1 dependent response to meiotic DSBs”: this seems to be speculation (reasonable, but still a hypothesis) but stated more like fact – that the function of Mio is required to regulate the response to meiotic DSBs. If this were true, the mei-P22 mio double would be as fertile as mei-P22 single. Is that true?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we examined <italic>mio, mei-w68</italic> double mutants. We determined that blocking the formation of meiotic DSBs partially rescues the fertility deficit in <italic>mio.</italic> We propose the partial nature of the rescue may reflect the requirement for <italic>mio</italic> at multiple times during oogenesis as well as the decreased fertility associated with blocking the formation of meiotic DSBs. Notably, the GATOR2 complex has been reported to play a role in spindle assembly and thus may impact the construction of the efficiency of the meiotic divisions (Platani et al., 2015). Please note we tried to be conservative in the interpretation of this result stating: “<italic>…</italic>we demonstrate that the tissue specific requirement for Mio during oogenesis is due, at least in part, to the generation of meiotic DBSs during oogenesis.” These results are presented in subsection “Mio prevents the constitutive inhibition of TORC1 activity in response to meiotic DSBs” and Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Please note, in <italic>mio</italic> mutantsDSBs trigger a small egg chamber phenotype. These data indicate that <italic>mio</italic> is required to regulate a physiological response to meiotic DSBs. We do not claim that <italic>mio</italic> directlyregulates the repair of meiotic DSBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors comment on the small ovary phenotype. When does developmental arrest occur and is that related to some kind of checkpoint. Is it temporally separate from the induction and repair of DSBs.</p></disp-quote><p>We observe problems with oocyte specification in <italic>mio</italic> mutants beginning in late region 2a of the germarium (Iida and Lilly, 2004). However, while the oocyte fails to maintain the oocyte fate, other aspects of egg chamber development continue for some time including the endoreplication of nurse cell nuclei. Thus, it is difficult to establish exactly when <italic>mio</italic> egg chambers arrest their development. We have not been able to temporally separate the induction of meiotic DSBs and the failure to properly maintain oocyte fate in <italic>mio</italic> mutants. Both these events occur as early as region 2a.</p><p>We explored the role of the ATM downstream target and checkpoint protein, Chk2. Chk2 is known as Loki in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Specifically, we determined that removing Chk2/Loki activity partially rescues the <italic>mio</italic> mutant phenotype. From this result we conclude that Chk2/Loki is partially responsible for the downregulation of TORC1 activity observed in <italic>mio</italic> mutants. These results are presented in subsection “Mio prevents the constitutive inhibition of TORC1 activity in response to meiotic DSBs” and Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p><p>Additionally, we have previously published that ATR does not link DSBs to TORC1 downregulation in <italic>mio</italic> mutants (Iida and Lilly, 2004).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “GATOR1 opposes retrotransposon expression”: the implication is that TE expression is upregulated by genotoxic stress, correct? Is that known or a correlation with DSB formation.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been noted by Barbara McClintock and others, that genotoxic stress activates retrotransposons although the exact mechanism of activation remains elusive (Beauregard, Curcio, and Belfort, 2008; Bradshaw and McEntee, 1989; Hagan, Sheffield, and Rudin, 2003; Walbot, 1992). We proposed that “germ line cells may be at an increased risk for transposon derepression due to the genotoxic stress associated with meiotic recombination.” To test the model that unrepaired meiotic DSBs trigger retrotransposon expression we examined retrotransposon transcript levels in <italic>spnA/Rad51</italic> mutant ovaries and determined that they were increased relative to wild type (Figure 8). These data are consistent with work from HeLa cells that LINE1 element activity is increased in Rad51 depleted cells (Liu et al., 2018). This work is presented in subsection “GATOR1 inhibits retrotransposon expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic>” and Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2G gives the impression that many of the mutants have more DSBs in region 2A than wildtype. This could be due to asynchrony and variation within the different pro-oocytes of region 2A. Thus, there should be nprl mutant pro-oocytes that have the same number of foci as wild-type, the difference being that as the oocytes progress, the number of foci increases because the DSBs are not repaired. The authors should correct his by showing oocytes of equivalent stage (difficult) or showing all pro-oocytes from one germarium to show how the progression of foci number changes with time.</p></disp-quote><p>We found that GATOR1 mutants had an increase in the number of γ-H2Av foci relative to wild type. This is not just an impression. We used a modified method of counting γ-H2Av foci that was originally presented in Mehrotra and McKim (Mehrotra and McKim, 2006). For both mutant and wild type germaria, we reported the number of foci in the ovarian cyst that had the highest levels of γ-H2Av staining in the oocyte in region 2A of the germarium. As can be seen in Figure 3, this number can be the same as is observed in wild type germaria. However, on average, the number of foci in the GATOR1 mutants is higher. GATOR1 mutant germarium are somewhat misshapen, at least in part, because of the large number of 32 cell cysts. Thus, it would be difficult to establish equivalent stages in the germarium in mutant and wild type. Additionally, it is not clear how scoring all of the oocytes within a cyst, which would be a large amount of work, might alter our interpretation of the role of GATOR1 in the response to meiotic DSBs.</p><p><italic>Figure 2H: Add spnA to the graph.
