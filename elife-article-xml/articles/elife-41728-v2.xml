neuronal structures perform compartmentalized computations. However, previously we showed that the Gastric Mill (GM) neuron in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) operates like a single electrotonic compartment, despite having thousands of branch points and total cable length &gt;10 mm (Otopalik et al., 2017a; 2017b). Here we show that compact electrotonic architecture is generalizable to other STG neuron types, and that these neurons present direction-insensitive, linear voltage integration, suggesting they pool synaptic inputs across their neuronal structures. We also show, using simulations of 720 cable models spanning a broad range of geometries and passive properties, that compact electrotonus, linear integration, and directional insensitivity in STG neurons arise from their neurite geometries (diameters tapering from 10-20 µm to <underline>&lt;</underline> 2 µm at their terminal tips).

How synaptic voltage events propagate within and across neurite branches is determined by the structure’s geometrical and biophysical properties. Passive voltage propagation is influenced by the neurite’s diameter, membrane resistance, and axial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rall, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rall, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rall, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jack et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmes, 1989</xref>). Rall and colleages were the first to apply passive cable theory and develop the equivalent cylinder model for the study of electrotonus in single dendrites and branched dendritic trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rall, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rall, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rall, 1969</xref>). Schierwagen then devised a broader mathematical description of membrane voltage distributions in complex, highly-branched neurite trees with non-uniform boundary conditions and geometries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schierwagen, 1989</xref>). These seminal theoretical studies have provided an invaluable framework for understanding passive neuronal physiology. However, in a functioning neuron, synaptic inputs, receptors, and ion channels may shunt or amplify propagating voltage signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>). Thus, the transformation from neuronal morphology to electrophysiological activity patterns is often unpredictable in the absence of direct experimental assessment. To date, measuring voltage attenuation across the many neurite paths presented in complex neuronal structures using electrophysiological techniques has proven difficult. Thus, electrotonus has been experimentally assessed in only a handful of neuron types (for example: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Spruston and Johnston, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spruston et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rapp et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carnevale et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stuart and Spruston, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chitwood et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaffe and Carnevale, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otopalik et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Medan et al., 2018</xref>), and this greatly restricts our understanding of the breadth of biophysical organizations utilized in different neuron types and circuit contexts.</p><p>In two recent studies, we characterized the morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Otopalik et al., 2017a</xref>) and passive electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otopalik et al., 2017b</xref>) of the identified neurons of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG), a small central pattern-generating circuit mediating the rhythmic contractions of the animal’s foregut. The 14 identified neurons of the STG present distinct, cell-type-specific electrophysiological waveforms, firing patterns and circuit functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris-Warrick et al., 1992</xref>). We quantified numerous morphological features pertaining to the macroscopic branching patterns and fine cable properties of four neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Otopalik et al., 2017a</xref>). Interestingly, the four neuron types did not adhere to optimal wiring principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuntz et al., 2010</xref>) or Rall’s 3/2 rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rall, 1959</xref>) and exhibited expansive neurite trees that sum to &gt;10 mm of total cable length, tortuous and long individual branches (ranging between 100 µm and 1 mm in length) and thousands of branch points with complex geometries. There was quantifiable inter-animal variability in many features within neuron types, and no single metric or combination of metrics distinguished the four neuron types.</p><p>In a second study, we then asked: How do STG neurons produce reliable firing patterns across animals, given their apparently inefficient and highly variable structures? As a first examination of how neuronal morphology maps to physiology in the STG, we characterized electrotonus, or passive voltage signal propagation, in one STG neuron type, the Gastric Mill (GM) neuron. We were surprised to find that, despite their expansive and complex neuronal structures, GM neurons are relatively electrotonically compact and operate much like single electrical compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otopalik et al., 2017b</xref>). We suggested that compact electrotonic structures may effectively counteract the potential physiological consequences of morphological variability observed in GM neurons across animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Otopalik et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otopalik et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>We first motivate the present study with an empirical numerical model that measures electrotonus in a library of cable models with varying geometrical and passive properties. In doing so, we recapitulate passive electrotonic decrement described in the aforementioned seminal theoretical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rall, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rall, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rall, 1969</xref>). Yet, we also show that a subset of cable models with geometries consistent with those observed in multiple STG neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Otopalik et al., 2017a</xref>), are relatively resilient to electrotonic decrement. Given this prediction, we asked whether compact electrotonus is a generalizable feature in the STG, and therefore common among multiple, distinct neuron types. Using glutamate photo-uncaging in tandem with intracellular electrophysiology (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otopalik et al., 2017b</xref>), we measure electrotonus in four STG neuron types. We then investigate how neurite geometry shapes voltage integration in these complex neuronal structures. By complementing these experiments with validating computational simulations, we demonstrate that STG neurite geometries and passive properties are sufficient to account for the compact electrotonus and voltage integration observed in this pattern-generating circuit. Furthermore, our numerical simulations suggest that different neurite geometries may be suitable for circuits that subserve different functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Simulating electrotonus in diverse neurites</title><p>In previous work, we were surprised to find that STG neurons exhibit neurite lengths as long as 1 mm and neurite diameters between 10–20 µm at their primary neurite junctions, that decrement to <underline>&lt;</underline>1 µm at their terminating tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Otopalik et al., 2017a</xref>), suggesting geometries with a 1–2% taper. Passive cable theory suggests that voltage signals passively propagating such long distances are likely to undergo a great deal of attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rall, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rall, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rall, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jack et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schierwagen, 1989</xref>). Experimental studies to date have validated predictions presented in these theoretical studies in dendrites with uniform and/or smaller diameters (typically <underline>&lt;</underline>3 µm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmes, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaffe and Carnevale, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stuart and Spruston, 1998</xref>). These studies suggested that diameter is a critical parameter in determining electrotonic decrement in the absence of amplifying or shunting mechanisms. Yet, none of these studies examined electrotonus in neurites with the wide diameters exhibited by STG neurites. Thus, we first asked whether there may be a boundary at which a neurite’s diameter is wide enough to overcome distance-dependent attenuation.</p><p>We conducted a proof-of-concept computational characterization of electrotonus in a library of 720 passive cable models with a much broader range of geometries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and passive properties (specific R<sub>a</sub> values between 50–300 Ω x cm and specific R<sub>m</sub> values between 1,000–20,000 Ω x cm<sup>2</sup>; see Materials and methods) than explored in earlier studies. These geometries range from narrow cables with uniform diameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, gray) to broad cables with diameters reminiscent of STG neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, blue), thereby spanning the broad range of neurite geometries existing in diverse nervous systems. Electrotonus was characterized by measurement of an effective electrotonic length constant (λ<sub>effective</sub> in µm; see Materials and methods), which is equivalent to the distance at which a voltage signal decrements to 37% of the maximal voltage amplitude (at the activation site). Thus, greater λ<sub>effective</sub> values are suggestive of less electrotonic decrement. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> illustrates the measurement of λ<sub>effective</sub> in a classic cable model with a uniform diameter of 0.5 µm, R<sub>a</sub> = 100 Ω x cm, R<sub>m</sub> = 10,000 Ω x cm<sup>2</sup>. In this case, the voltage event attenuates greatly with distance (λ<sub>effective</sub> is approximately 300 µm). This voltage attenuation is robust and λ<sub>effective</sub> is less than 1 mm for a broad range of passive properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Altering the morphology of this cable model to reflect the geometry of an STG neurite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) results in a smaller response amplitude at the site of activation (compare maximum amplitudes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). However, this is accompanied by a robust increase in λ<sub>effective</sub> and similar signal amplitudes across the cable. Larger λ<sub>effective</sub> values are observed for a broad range of passive parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). R<sub>a</sub> values between 50–150 Ω x cm and R<sub>m</sub>values <underline>&gt;</underline> 10,000 Ω x cm<sup>2</sup> yield λ<sub>effective</sub> values greater than 1 mm. Examining the entire morphological and biophysical parameter space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) demonstrates that a range of λ<sub>effective</sub> values can be achieved across neurites varying not only in their passive properties, but also in their geometries. Neurites with wide proximal diameters present relatively long λ<sub>effective</sub> values even in the presence of a large load at the proximal end of the cable (d<sub>0</sub>), made to mimic a putative shunt imposed by the rest of the neurite tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, these simulations demonstrate that long λ<sub>effective</sub> values can be achieved as a consequence of neurite geometry alone, in the absence of voltage-gated ion channels or other amplifying mechanisms that have been implicated in boosting distally-evoked events in other neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Magee and Cook, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrasfalvy and Magee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gulledge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lavzin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41728.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Electrotonus in cable models with diverse passive properties and geometries.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the complete matrix of cable model geometries assessed in the computational simulation.

Consistent with this prediction, we recently demonstrated that the Gastric Mill neuron exhibits a relatively uniform electrotonic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otopalik et al., 2017b</xref>). To determine if this is a generalizable feature across different STG neuron types, we characterized electrotonus in multiple neurites of three additional STG neuron types: Lateral Pyloric (LP), Ventricular Dilator (VD), and Pyloric Dilator (PD) neurons, while also corroborating our previous findings in GM neurons (N = 5–6 neurons of each type). These four neuron types present equally complex and expansive morphologies, but distinct voltage waveforms and circuit functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). PD, LP, VD, and GM neurons were unambiguously identified by their innervation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and by matching their intracellular spiking patterns with concurrent extracellular recordings of nerves known to contain their axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). PD and LP neurons innervate two muscles in the pylorus of the foregut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and participate in the ongoing, triphasic pyloric rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). PD and LP can both be identified by matching their intracellular firing patterns with spiking units on the lateral ventricular nerve (<italic>lvn;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The VD neuron innervates the cv1 muscle of the pylorus and can be identified on the medial ventricular nerve (<italic>mvn;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The GM neuron participates in the episodic gastric mill rhythm, innervates gm1, 2, and 3 muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and can be identified on the dorsal gastric nerve (<italic>dgn;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When filled with fluorescent dye, each neuron presents highly branched and expansive neurite trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The morphological features of these neuron types have been described quantitatively and in detail in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilensky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bucher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thuma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Otopalik et al., 2017a</xref>). To examine neurite geometries in these four neuron types, we completed volumetric reconstructions and continuous measurement of neurite diameters (from soma to terminating tip) for 23 neurite paths, for which we had confocal image stacks with sufficient resolution. Recapitulating previous work, we observed neurite paths that taper from 10 to 20 µm at the soma-primary neurite junction to <underline>&lt;</underline>2 µm at terminating tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Otopalik et al., 2017a</xref>). Geometrical taper from proximal to distal end is thought to increase the electrotonic length constant for long neurite paths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holmes and Rall, 1992</xref>). Yet, we found that, while some STG neurites tapered gradually, others presented diameters that decrease in an abrupt step. Previous study has demonstrated that geometrical taper influences action potential shape and velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldstein and Rall, 1974</xref>). But, it is unclear whether this geometrical feature influences the electrotonic decrement of slower inhibitory potentials. Thus, we simulated and measured λ<sub>effective</sub> (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) in cables with varying degrees of taper from proximal to distal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, Part A). We ran this simulation in cables with varying proximal diameters (ranging between 1 and 10 µm) and maintained the same 80% reduction in diameter from proximal to distal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, Part B). In brief, we found that cables with a gradual taper presented longer λ<sub>effective</sub> than those with abrupt step reductions (consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holmes and Rall, 1992</xref>). Yet, cables with wide diameters consistent with those measured in STG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), presented λ<sub>effective</sub><underline>&gt;</underline> 1 mm for even abrupt step-reductions in diameter for a range of passive properties (R<sub>a</sub>values <underline>&lt;</underline> 100 Ω x cm and R<sub>m</sub>values <underline>&gt;</underline> 10,000 Ω x cm<sup>2</sup>). This contrasts with finer cables (tapering from 1 to 2 µm to sub-µm diameters), wherein any step reductions along the path of propagation resulted in λ<sub>effective</sub> &lt; 0.5 mm.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41728.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of four identified STG neuron types.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bilateral innervation patterns of each neuron type, depicted on one side of the dissected foregut.

These biases persist across a broad range of passive properties. However, the inward bias in the classic cable model does attenuate with increasing axial resistivity (R<sub>a</sub>) and decreasing membrane resistivity (R<sub>m</sub>).</p><p>The arithmetic of voltage integration was characterized by comparing the combined response to the arithmetic sum of the individual events (example traces depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>, bottom). Integration is described as sublinear, linear, or supralinear if the combined response is less than, equal to, or larger than the predicted arithmetic sum. We calculated the arithmetic, or linearity, of the evoked responses as the integral of the inward response minus the integral of the combined individual responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>, bottom). The classic cable presents sublinear integration of inhibitory voltage events. Yet, as the R<sub>m</sub> decreases and R<sub>a</sub> increases, voltage summation transitions from sublinear to linear. In contrast, the STG neurite presents relatively linear integration across a broad range of passive properties. Examination of directional sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and summation arithmetic in the entire cable library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) demonstrates that a broad range of computations can arise as a consequence of neurite morphology. Taken together, these simulations predict that STG neurites will present directional insensitivity and near-linear voltage integration if they operate predominantly by passive propagation and in the absence of active properties serving to shunt or amplify voltage signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Direction insensitivity in STG neurites</title><p>To test for directional bias in voltage signal propagation, sequential voltage events were evoked at multiple sites within the same secondary branches (from tip to primary neurite junction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ai</xref>). The integrals of the summed responses for inward and outward activation were measured at the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Aii</xref>).

Any branches with points left of the identity line present an inward, or centripetal bias, whereas any points right of the identity line are suggestive of a centrifugal, or outward, bias.

Taken together, these findings suggest that STG neurons are built to linearly sum and unify synaptic inputs distributed across their expansive and complex structures, rather than perform distributed computations on a branch-by-branch, or subtree-by-subtree basis. Our computational simulations suggest that this biophysical architecture may be achieved passively and as a simple consequence of neurite geometry in these neurons, which present neurites with wide diameters that taper from 10 to 20 µm near the soma, to sub-micron diameters at their terminating tips.</p><p>This computing strategy stands in contrast to that which has been observed in other neuron types with similarly complex neuronal structures. When voltage signals propagate long distances in the absence of amplifying mechanisms, electrotonic decrement is thought to result in sublinear voltage integration and directional bias within single branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rall, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gulledge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>).

Linear and supralinear integration are thought to require amplifying mechanisms, such as voltage-gated ion channels or distance-dependent scaling of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Magee and Cook, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrasfalvy and Magee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gulledge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lavzin et al., 2012</xref>). Collectively, these studies support the notion that highly-branched and expansive neuronal structures, are likely to present some degree of passive voltage attenuation (in the absence of amplifying mechanisms) and perform compartmentalized computations as a consequence. Yet, this framework for dendritic computation does not rely on the study of, or account for, the diverse dendrite and neurite morphologies observed in nature.</p><p>To make sense of our findings in the STG, we revisited basic cable theory and simulated electrotonus and passive voltage integration in a library of neurites exhibiting diverse geometries and passive biophysical properties. We observed a surprising range of electrotonic decrement, directional bias, and voltage summation arithmetic across the surveyed morphological and biophysical parameter space. Thus, this simulation revealed multiple morphological and biophysical solutions for achieving varying degrees of passive electrotonic decrement and different computational strategies. We also show that linear summation and directional insensitivity, as observed in four STG neuron types, can be achieved in the absence of active properties altogether and in the face of potential heterogeneity of passive biophysical properties. Altogether, this proof-of-concept simulation both recapitulates the principles describe in early theoretical studies and also demonstrates that different biophysical and morphological strategies are likely to be utilized by different neuron types, to suit their unique physiological function. Thus, the widely-accept principles derived from the study of so-called canonical neuron types may be less general than previously thought.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A general solution for reliable pacemaking physiology</title><p>Our findings are interesting in light of the synaptic organization of the STG.

Thus, we can only speculate how action potentials, arising from such TTX-sensitive currents, may influence the integration of graded inhibitory glutamatergic synaptic events in the intact circuit. We would not expect TTX-sensitive currents to substantially alter inhibitory voltage signal propagation or integration at the range of membrane potentials probed here (−100 to −40 mV for apparent reversal potentials measurements and −50 mV for the voltage summation and directional sensitivity measurements). Moreover, spike initiations zones, where such TTX-sensitive channels are most likely to reside, are located just outside the neuropil, where the axons exit the ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raper, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller, 1980</xref>).

Spatial separation of spike initiation zones from synaptic integration and slow wave generation in the neuropil may reduce shunting of synaptic currents.

We fully traced each neuron from the origin of the primary neurite near the soma to the tips of each branch. As our analyses concerned only the branches visited for photo-uncaging, our reconstructions therefore do not recapitulate the entirety of the neuronal arbor. We traced each preparation in two ways. First, we generated a skeleton wherein the neuron is represented by a tree of connected nodes. Second, we traced the full volume of each branch containing the skeleton by manually coloring in a region in each z-layer that contained that branch.</p><p>Using these two reconstructions for each neurite, we measured the path distance of each node in the skeleton to the soma along with the cross-sectional area of the branch at each node. From these cross-sectional areas, we calculate an approximated diameter of the branch assuming the branch were cylindrical; in most cases, of course, the branches are not perfectly cylindrical. To generate cross-sectional area, we used the built-in coding environment of FIJI to write a custom Python script. Briefly, the algorithm generates a list of all points on the edge of branches in the arbor, then finds those which lie within a small threshold (0.5 μm) of a plane orthogonal to the arbor of the branch at each node. The number of these points are further reduced by excluding those which lie outside a certain distance of the node (which corresponds to the maximum expected radius of the branch at that node). For most branches, we used a distance threshold of 3 μm, while for thicker branches we used 11 μm. Finally, the projection of these points onto the orthogonal plane through the branch at each node defines a polygon of which the area is calculated using the shoelace formula.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Passive cable models</title><p>The library of cable models utilized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otopalik et al. (2017b)</xref> was adapted to explore electrotonus, directional bias, and voltage integration in neurites with varying geometries (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and passive properties: six specific axial resistances (R<sub>a</sub>): 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300 Ω*cm; and six specific membrane resistances (R<sub>m</sub>): 2 × 10<sup>4</sup>, 1.6 × 10<sup>4</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>4</sup>, 5 × 10<sup>3</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>3</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>2</sup> Ω*cm<sup>2</sup>. All cables were 1000 µm in length and had a membrane capacitance of 1 µF*cm<sup>−2</sup>. Electrotonus was assessed as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and voltage summation was assessed by simulating our experimental glutamate photo-uncaging procedure using the simulation platform NEURON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hines and Carnevale, 2001</xref>). All possible combinations of neurite geometries, membrane resistances, and axial resistances were assessed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, whereas a representative cross-section of cable models are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. To assess voltage integration directional bias and arithmetic, voltage was recorded 100 µm from the proximal end (d<sub>0</sub>) and inhibitory potentials (E<sub>rev</sub> = −75 mV, 𝜏 = 70 ms, g<sub>max</sub> = 10 nS) were evoked at five sites with increasing distance from the recording site (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Sites were activated individually, and then at 5 Hz in the inward (toward the recording site) or outward (away from the recording site) directions. Using MATLAB (Mathworks, version 2018b), integrals were calculated for the inward and outward summed responses and the expected linear sum of the individual events in either direction. Directional bias was calculated as the inward integral minus the outward integral. Linearity was calculated as the expected arithmetic sum minus the recorded voltages sum for the inward direction. Custom scripts written to generate cable models and simulate experimental procedures in NEURON were composed in Sublime Text (Sublime HQ Pty Ltd, Sydney) and can be found on the Marder Lab GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/marderlab">https://github.com/marderlab</ext-link>), along with all simulation output.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jennifer Bestman for assistance in spinning disk and confocal microscopy; the Marine Resources Center at the Marine Biological Laboratories for acquiring and maintaining animals; Louie Kerr at the Central Microscopy Facility; Dana Mock-Munoz de Luna for administrative support; Kamran Kodhakhah, Heather Rhodes, and the 2017 Grass Fellows for their support and feedback; and lastly, Edward Dougherty at the Brandeis University Confocal Imaging Lab for support and microscope maintenance.

The authors combine an exploration of parameter space by compartmental modeling with experimental tests, contrasting dendritic integration in neurites with large taper (as in STG neurons) with integration in dendrites with low taper (as is typical of cortical neurons, often used as &quot;typical&quot; or representative examples). The basic claim is that the geometry of the dendrites in this system makes the neurons act virtually as a single compartment even though they have a very elaborate dendritic structure. The authors claim that this is a result of substantial tapering of the dendrites and conduct compartmental simulations to support their conclusion. The paper is well written and the experimental sample size impressive. It seems to do a good job in considering and testing different cases with simulation and matching experimental data to simulations which is the gold standard in this type of studies. Nevertheless, we ask the authors to address several concerns, as listed below, to strengthen the conclusions of this work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reading the manuscript gives the feeling a negative result (synaptic inputs seem to be location independent) is turned into a feature. However, there may be methodological reasons why location dependence of some features is found to be weak (see below) and even if it is true, it does not justify consideration as a special mechanism. There are many neurons even in mammalian CNS where apparently there is not much dendritic integration (e.g. cerebellar granular cells).</p><p>2) Figure 1 – the authors perform many simulations to test the effect of change in diameter on voltage attenuation along the dendrites. They make the point that geometry can affect attenuation along the dendrites even when all other parameters are kept the same.</p><p>a) While the results are presented as a surprise, the understanding that dendritic geometry affects voltage attenuation is at the heart of cable theory and is present already in Rall's 59 paper.</p><p>b) In addition, the specific case of tapering is analytically covered in the papers of Schierwagen (admittedly very difficult to read): Schierwagen, A.K., A non-uniform equivalent cable model of membrane voltage changes in a passive dendritic tree, J. Theor. Biol. (1989) 141, 159-179, which is not even cited.</p><p>c) The simulated case assumes sealed end boundary condition at both sides of the cable, while in fact the relevant case is that there is a large &quot;load&quot; (e.g. killed end boundary condition) on the side with large diameter, because the rest of the dendritic tree is connected to that part. This might have a significant effect on the conclusions.</p><p>d) The authors have both the experimental data of the geometry of the neurons (which they studied in detail in the first paper) and the physiological properties (allowing them to extract the biophysical properties of the membrane). They could simulate the specific neuron they record from, rather than choose to simulate simplified models, which might fail to capture the intricate properties of the real geometry.</p><p>3) The authors use sharp electrode recordings and in fact two of them at the soma, which indeed makes the current clamp better. However, it is accepted that sharp electrode recordings may fundamentally change the estimate of membrane parameters and may create a significant conductance leak in the recording location. On top of that, most of the relevant integration happens near the location of synaptic inputs and far away from the recording site. So, it is difficult to escape the alternative explanation in which all the input looks similar at the recording point because they all very far from it, especially when the inputs are very slow (0.5 s rise time, voltage attenuation is far smaller for steady state inputs as compared to transients, and here the inputs are so slow that they are virtually steady state).</p><p>4) The authors find a fit for the data with effective space constant of order of magnitude of 1mm with total dendritic length of &gt; 10mm. This means that there are certainly points that are quite far from each other, and still they claim that the neuron acts as a single compartment.</p><p>5) The measurements of E<sub>rev</sub> in their hands shows almost no sensitivity to dendritic location of the activation. This together with simulation that shows that under certain condition (short space constant) E<sub>rev</sub> estimation should be sensitive to location is taken as an indication that the space constant is long. However, for this the authors are only using very simplified models, which we suspect are very different in terms of boundary conditions than their experimental setup (see above).</p><p>6) The individual responses presented in Figure 5—Figure supplements 1, 2 and especially 3, seem to have different shape indices (i.e. rise time and decay time, consistent with classical cable theory of inputs arriving from different locations along the dendrites) and inconsistent with a single compartment scenario.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41728.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reading the manuscript gives the feeling a negative result (synaptic inputs seem to be location independent) is turned into a feature.

We hope that it is now clear that the experimental results align well with the predictions generated by the passive cable simulations. This is not a negative result, but an excellent outcome. The alignment of the experimental and simulation results tells us that the compact electrotonic structures and voltage integration properties observed in these four neuron types can potentially arise from passive voltage propagation in the absence of active properties, in part because they present such wide neurite diameters. This is stated clearly in the Discussion:</p><p>“…we find that multiple STG neuron types present electrotonically compact structures and within-neurite voltage summation that is relatively linear and directionally insensitive. […] Our computational simulations suggest that this biophysical architecture may be achieved passively and as a simple consequence of neurite geometry in these neurons, which present secondary branches with wide diameters that taper from 10-20 µm at their proximal, primary-neurite junctions, to sub-micron diameters at their terminating tips.”</p><p>Although the reviewer suggests that there are many neuron types thought not to perform compartmentalized, dendritic computations, the direct experimental assessment of electrotonus and such compartmentalization has actually only been executed in a handful of neuron types. We describe this in the Introduction:</p><p>To date, measuring voltage attenuation across the many neurite paths presented in complex neuronal structures using electrophysiological techniques has proven difficult. Thus, electrotonus has been experimentally assessed in only a handful of neuron types (for example: Spruston and Johnston, 1992; Spruston et al., 1994; Rapp et al., 1994; Carnevale et al., 1997; Stuart and Spruston, 1998; Chitwood et al., 1999; Jaffe and Carnevale, 1999; Otopalik et al., 2017b; Medan et al., 2018), and this greatly restricts our understanding of the breadth of biophysical organizations utilized in different neuron types and circuit contexts.</p><p>While we understand that STG neurons may not be the first neuron types to be described as electrotonically compact, we do think it important to present this study, along with the founding papers (Otopalik et al. 2017a, b), as a case wherein the complex morphologies are in fact compact, and this is perhaps what allows for robust circuit output in the face of a great deal of morphological variability in the same neuron types across animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1 – the authors perform many simulations to test the effect of change in diameter on voltage attenuation along the dendrites. They make the point that geometry can affect attenuation along the dendrites even when all other parameters are kept the same.</p><p>a) While the results are presented as a surprise, the understanding that dendritic geometry affects voltage attenuation is at the heart of cable theory and is present already in Rall's 59 paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Our description of the simulation results as ‘surprising’ was not meant to be interpreted as ‘novel.’ This said, we have altered the text throughout the manuscript to clarify this. Our computational simulations in NEURON rely heavily on the seminal theoretical findings of Rall, Schierwagen, and many others. Our intention in presenting these simulations was to apply these seminal theories, generate predictions, and provide a useful pedagogical narrative throughout the paper (Goldstein, 2018). Yet, it is also important to distinguish the analytical approaches of these seminal studies from our numerical simulations: whereas these earlier studies generated biophysical rules and cable equations, in our simulations we were able to scan a broad parameter space of passive and morphological properties and test the boundaries of these aforementioned rules regarding electrotonus, directional sensitivity, and passive voltage integration. By doing this, we found that the wide neurite diameters exhibited by STG neurons renders them relatively resilient to the conventional electrotonic decrement expected from such long neurite paths. The fact that this phenomenon is predicted by passive cable models in NEURON, suggests that our experimental observations can indeed be explained by passive propagation and neurite geometry. By revising the last paragraph of the Introduction, we believe we will have prepared the reader to enter the Results section with this outlook.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In addition, the specific case of tapering is analytically covered in the papers of Schierwagen (admittedly very difficult to read): Schierwagen, A.K., A non-uniform equivalent cable model of membrane voltage changes in a passive dendritic tree, J. Theor. Biol. (1989) 141, 159-179, which is not even cited.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that this study was brought to our attention and regret that it was not on our radar at the time of writing this manuscript. One hurdle faced in pursuing this work is synthesizing and making sense of the wealth of previous studies examining geometry, electrotonus, and neuronal function. The diverse numerical, analytical, and experimental methods used in previous studies have led to a somewhat incongruous literature. This said, we have now read Schierwagen (1989) closely. In this study, Schierwagen derived the equations for equivalent cable models for multiple branched trees or subtrees. These were then used to determine the distribution of subthreshold membrane voltage in highly branched neuronal structures. This is now cited in the Introduction (first paragraph) and again in the Results section (subsection “Simulating Electrotonus in Diverse Neurites”, first paragraph). It is important to note that, in this study, Schierwagen considered taper as a descriptor of an equivalent cylinder for multiply branched trees or subtrees; the taper we refer to in our manuscript is simply referring to the geometry of individual neurite paths, not multiply branched trees. Additional studies we failed to reference in the original manuscript, that consider the role of taper and flare of individual branches (Goldstein and Rall, 1974; Holmes and Rall, 1992), have now been properly cited in the subsection 2 Linking Electrotonus and Neurite Geometry in STG Neurons”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The simulated case assumes sealed end boundary condition at both sides of the cable, while in fact the relevant case is that there is a large &quot;load&quot; (e.g. killed end boundary condition) on the side with large diameter, because the rest of the dendritic tree is connected to that part. This might have a significant effect on the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue that is also brought up in essential revision #5 (below). In this work, we have simulated neurite paths that we view as a representation of the entire path from terminal neurite tip to a recording electrode at the soma. These two ends are, in fact, sealed. However, it is true that there may be some shunting at branch points along this path, particularly at the junction between the secondary and primary neurites. To test how such putative shunting may influence our measurements of electrotonus, we ran a set of cable simulations with a large load on the proximal side of the cable (with the larger diameter, d<sub>0</sub>) in a representative cross-section of our cable model library (R<sub>m</sub> = 10000 Ω × cm<sup>2</sup>,d<sub>1</sub> = 0.5 µm (constant); d<sub>0</sub> = 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20 µm; R<sub>a</sub> = 50, 100, 150, 200, 300 Ω × cm). We added the shunt by simply adding a compartment at 300 µm from this proximal end of the parent cable (passive properties consistent with the parent cable), effectively mimicking the rest of the neurite tree. We varied the size of the shunt by simply varying the length of this added compartment (as choosing an exact leak conductance magnitude or cable length was somewhat arbitrary; the different shunt sizes had lengths 100, 300, 500, 1000 µm; all had an axial diameter of 5 µm). We measured the effective λ in these cables, as in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1. We found that increasing the shunt did indeed alter the effective λ measured, but that the relative relationships across the varying cable geometries shown in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 remained true (that is, increasing the proximal diameter to 10 microns resulted in effective λ greater than 1 mm for a range of axial resistance values). The results of this simulation are now presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, and discussed briefly in the Results text (subsection “Simulating Electrotonus in Diverse Neurites”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>d) The authors have both the experimental data of the geometry of the neurons (which they studied in detail in the first paper) and the physiological properties (allowing them to extract the biophysical properties of the membrane). They could simulate the specific neuron they record from, rather than choose to simulate simplified models, which might fail to capture the intricate properties of the real geometry.</italic></p><p>In the first submission of this manuscript, path lengths were the only geometrical measurements that we had for the evaluated neuronal structures. In previous work, we had shown that the apparent reversal potentials measured across many sites in GM neurons were independent of distance from soma, neurite diameter, and branch order (Otopalik et al., 2017). Thus, for this paper we simply used ImageJ to measure distance from soma for each photo-activated site, and set aside these other geometric measurements. Thus, in the first submission we lacked other geometrical data for these neurons.</p><p>To address this and other concerns expressed by the reviewers in this revised manuscript, we have completed volumetric reconstructions and continuous measurement of neurite diameter from primary neurite to terminating tips of 23 neurites from neurons for which we had high-quality confocal stacks with sufficient resolution (now described in the Materials and methods section “Volumetric Neurite Reconstructions”). In these analyses, we found that, while some neurites tapered gradually from the proximal primary neurite junction to terminal tip, others decreased in diameter in surprisingly abrupt steps. We have summarized these data in Figure 2D-E and presented all diameter measurements in Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2. These results are discussed in the subsection “Linking Electrotonus and Neurite Geometry in STG Neurons”.</p><p>Having made these finer measurements, we then completed a new set of simulations in a revised set of cable models that test the influence of taper, versus step-reductions, in cable models with varying diameters. We found that, for cables with the wide diameters presented by STG neurites, there exists a regime of passive properties that are resilient to step-reductions in diameter. These results are now shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and discussed in the aforementioned subsection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors use sharp electrode recordings and in fact two of them at the soma, which indeed makes the current clamp better. However, it is accepted that sharp electrode recordings may fundamentally change the estimate of membrane parameters and may create a significant conductance leak in the recording location. On top of that, most of the relevant integration happens near the location of synaptic inputs and far away from the recording site. So, it is difficult to escape the alternative explanation in which all the input looks similar at the recording point because they all very far from it, especially when the inputs are very slow (0.5 s rise time, voltage attenuation is far smaller for steady state inputs as compared to transients, and here the inputs are so slow that they are virtually steady state).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that sharp recordings are not the standard in many biological preparations, whereas they are the standard in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion preparation. This is, in part, because STG neurons present relatively large somata (125.8 ± 47.5 µm in diameter; Otopalik et al., 2017a) that are well-suited for sharp recordings with one or two electrodes. In the present study, experiments were only conducted in cells with inputs resistances &gt; 5 MOhms following the insertion of both electrodes, which is consistent with the input resistance cut-off specified in other STG studies, even those utilizing only a single electrode. The kinetics of the events described here are consistent with the glutamate-evoked potentials conducted in cultured, transplanted STG neurons (e.g. Cleland and Selverston, 1995). These transplanted neurons are thought to act essentially as a single compartment, as they grow few neurites in vitro. Furthermore, we and others who work in the STG have now provided increasing evidence that these neurons are relatively compact and that voltage decrement must be minimal for these inhibitory glutamate-mediated voltage events:</p><p>1) In this and previous work (Otopalik et al., 2017b), we have demonstrated that we can inject current at the soma and alter the membrane potential at distal activation sites sufficiently enough to flip the sign of the evoked glutamate response at somatic membrane potentials that are within close range of the predicted reversal potential based on the chloride-dependence of the evoked current (Otopalik et al., 2017b; Figure 3 and associated supplements in this manuscript).</p><p>2) Summation of events activated in sequence across branches appears relatively linear (Figure 5) and independent of direction of activation. This is consistent with our interpretation of compact electrotonus; dendrites that present a greater degree of electrotonic decrement are thought to give rise to a centripetal bias in voltage propagation and current flow toward the open end of the cable (Barlow and Levick, 1965; Euler et al., 2002; London and Häusser, 2005; Branco et al., 2010). In our study, it appears that the wide diameters of STG neurites render them impervious to such directional biases.</p><p>3) Although technically difficult, in previous studies experimentalists have completed dual recordings with one electrode at the soma and a second electrode several hundred microns away on the primary or secondary neurites (Golowasch and Marder, 1992; Miller, 1980). In both accounts, they found that while action potentials are subject to attenuation across this distance, graded inhibitory potentials with kinetics consistent with the events evoked in the present study do not undergo much attenuation. It was not clear from these studies, however, whether the many neurite paths in these complex neuronal structures were uniformly electrotonically compact, or if this was a specific feature of this experimentally accessible path from primary neurite to soma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors find a fit for the data with effective space constant of order of magnitude of 1mm with total dendritic length of &gt; 10mm. This means that there are certainly points that are quite far from each other, and still they claim that the neuron acts as a single compartment.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Abstract and Introduction (second paragraph) we write that STG neurons often present total cable lengths &gt; 10 mm. The total cable length is the summed length of the entire neuronal structure, not the length of single neurite branches. Because individual secondary branches are typically no longer than 1mm, events arising at disparate locations are unlikely to be greater than 2 mm apart. A lambda of ~1 mm would certainly allow for integration of events evoked at sites separated by this distance. To ensure that this confusion does not arise among readers, we have clarified the meaning of total cable length in the Introduction. We now write: “expansive and complex neurite trees that sum to &gt; 10 mm of total cable length…”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The measurements of E<sub>rev</sub> in their hands shows almost no sensitivity to dendritic location of the activation. This together with simulation that shows that under certain condition (short space constant) E<sub>rev</sub> estimation should be sensitive to location is taken as an indication that the space constant is long. However, for this the authors are only using very simplified models, which we suspect are very different in terms of boundary conditions than their experimental setup (see above).</p></disp-quote><p>This is addressed in our response to comment 2, part c.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The individual responses presented in Figure 5—figure supplements 1, 2 and especially 3, seem to have different shape indices (i.e. rise time and decay time, consistent with classical cable theory of inputs arriving from different locations along the dendrites) and inconsistent with a single compartment scenario.</p></disp-quote><p>The kinetics of the events described here are consistent with the glutamate-evoked potentials conducted in cultured, transplanted STG neurons (Cleland and Selverston, 1995). Yet, it is true that there is heterogeneity in shape (as described by the reviewer) and amplitude across sites. Given the uniformity of apparent reversal potentials and the long lambdas predicted with the cable simulations in neurites with geometries similar to those observed in these neurons, we are inclined to speculate that these variable shape indices arise from local variations in receptor densities across photo-activated sites (this is discussed in Otopalik et al., 2017b).</p></body></sub-article></article>
