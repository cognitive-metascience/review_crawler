Several channel types can mediate dendritically initiated spikes (dSpikes), which may impact information processing and storage across multiple timescales; however, the roles of different channels in the rapid vs long-term effects of dSpikes are unknown. We show here that dSpikes mediated by Na<sub>v</sub> channels (blocked by a low concentration of TTX) are required for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the distal apical dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, imaging, simulations, and buffering experiments all support a model whereby fast Na<sub>v</sub> channel-mediated dSpikes (Na-dSpikes) contribute to LTP induction by promoting large, transient, localized increases in intracellular calcium concentration near the calcium-conducting pores of NMDAR and L-type Ca<sub>v</sub> channels. Thus, in addition to contributing to rapid neural processing, Na-dSpikes are likely to contribute to memory formation via their role in long-lasting synaptic plasticity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06414.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06414.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06414.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When we explore somewhere new, we activate a region of the brain that processes spatial information called the entorhinal cortex. This brain region stimulates the brain's memory-formation center, known as the hippocampus, which in turn forms a spatial memory of the new place. The process of forming these memories involves strengthening nerve connections, including those between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus.</p><p>Groups of neurons that produce synchronized electrical activity will naturally strengthen the nerve connections between them. This led scientists to predict that synchronized electrical activity between neurons in the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus may contribute to the formation of spatial memories.</p><p>Previous research revealed that hippocampal neurons produced short bursts of electrical activity that are localized at specific sites along their branched nerve processes that extend out of the cell body and are where inputs from other neurons are received. These types of localized electrical activity have been associated with a strengthening of the nerve connections between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal neurons. Ion channels that allow calcium to flow through these neurons' cell membranes had been identified as a potential source of these local electrical activities, and calcium is responsible for the strengthening of nerve connections. But it remained unclear whether channels that allow only sodium ions to flow through might also be involved.</p><p>Kim, Hsu et al. have now investigated this question by devising a way to selectively block the electrical activity produced by sodium ion channels on the branched nerve processes of hippocampal neurons. Slices of rat brain were collected and an inhibitor that specifically affected the sodium channels was delivered to the brain slices. Electrodes were used to stimulate the inputs from the entorhinal cortex, and to monitor the resulting electrical activity in the hippocampal neurons.</p><p>Kim, Hsu et al. analyzed the results and reproduced them using computer simulations, which showed that sodium ion channels are essential for triggering brief electrical events within the individual branches of nerve processes. These local electrical events appeared to activate calcium channels to produce highly concentrated, short-lived calcium signals that are necessary for strengthening nerve connections. Future studies will determine whether local electrical activity mediated by sodium channels is also involved in strengthening nerve connections between other types of neurons, and how this mechanism affects the formation of memories.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06414.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06414.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>CA1 pyramidal neuron</kwd><kwd>dendritic excitability</kwd><kwd>dendritic sodium spike</kwd><kwd>perforant pathway</kwd><kwd>long-term potentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Yujin</given-names></name><name><surname>Hsu</surname><given-names>Ching-Lung</given-names></name><name><surname>Cembrowski</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name><name><surname>Mensh</surname><given-names>Brett D</given-names></name><name><surname>Spruston</surname><given-names>Nelson</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS035180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spruston</surname><given-names>Nelson</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS046064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spruston</surname><given-names>Nelson</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001868</institution-id><institution>National Science Council Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSC98-2917-I-002-145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hsu</surname><given-names>Ching-Lung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>At distal synapses onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, synaptic plasticity is dependent on dendritically initiated sodium spikes, thus establishing a new role for voltage-gated sodium channels in the dendrites that may have important implications for how learning rules are implemented.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hebbian remodeling of neural circuits, encapsulated by the phrase ‘neurons that fire together wire together’, is the leading candidate mechanism for learning in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shatz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cooper, 2005</xref>). Thus, the finding that synaptic plasticity often has properties compatible with Hebbian learning has been a powerful driver of experimental and theoretical studies of changes in synaptic weights. The simple idea is that coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity results in changes in synaptic strength such as long-term potentiation (LTP). Many in vitro studies support a model in which modifiable synapses detect presynaptic activity through glutamate binding to postsynaptic receptors and detect postsynaptic activity through depolarization, which relieves magnesium block of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) and activates voltage-gated calcium (Ca<sub>v</sub>) channels. Both of these effects mediate postsynaptic calcium entry, which is believed to be a critical activator of the biochemical steps necessary for increases in synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Madison et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bliss and Collingridge, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blackstone and Sheng, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cavazzini et al., 2005</xref>). Four decades of research have led to this general picture, but important questions about the events leading to the critical calcium entry remain unanswered.</p><p>Three distinct ideas have been considered for the type of postsynaptic depolarization required to produce the calcium entry leading to Hebbian LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Williams et al., 2007</xref>):<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Postsynaptic axo-somatic action potential firing is necessary, and this signal reaches synapses in the form of backpropagating action potentials (bAPs),</p></list-item><list-item><p>Postsynaptic axo-somatic action potential firing is not necessary; rather, localized passive synaptic depolarization is sufficient,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Postsynaptic axo-somatic action potential firing is not necessary and passive synaptic depolarization is not sufficient; rather, localized synaptic depolarization must activate dendritic nonlinearities, such as locally initiated dendritic spikes (dSpikes).</p></list-item></list></p><p>At any given synapse at any moment in time, these three mechanisms of postsynaptic activity detection are mutually exclusive. However, all three mechanisms may exist in the brain, for example, in different cell types or even within the same cell at different synapses, different stages of development, or possibly in response to different activation patterns at the same synapse. Such heterogeneity would be consistent with the idea that LTP is not a single phenomenon, but rather a collection of mechanisms that can produce a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Malenka and Bear, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In each of the three cases above, the concerted action of multiple synapses is required—the so-called ‘cooperativity’ requirement for LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feldman, 2012</xref>)—but the patterns of synaptic activation that result in LTP are quite different. In the first case, the synapses that drive action potential firing could be located anywhere in the dendritic tree and plasticity would occur at all synapses that experience significant depolarization as a result of the bAP. This is the most conventional interpretation of Hebbian LTP. In the second and third conditions, synapses have to be co-localized in the dendrites in order to depolarize each other sufficiently to produce Hebbian LTP. In these conditions, the postsynaptic axon does not have to ‘fire’ at all; the third condition additionally requires that the co-localized synapses produce enough depolarization to trigger a dSpike, which may occur with or without axonal firing. Although these conditions may still be classified as ‘Hebbian LTP’, because of the requirement for co-incident presynaptic and postsynaptic activation, the existence of LTP under these conditions would imply that Hebbian-like LTP occurs at finer spatial scales than the more cell-wide form that most current models employ. Thus, during behavior, neurons that fire may undergo LTP, but even a neuron that is synaptically activated but axonally silent during a behavioral event can be recruited to participate in the neural engram.</p><p>Interestingly, hippocampal place cells behave in a manner suggestive of a form of Hebbian LTP that may not require postsynaptic action potential firing: many cells are silent when the animal first goes to a new place, and then they are recruited to participate in the network representation of the spatial map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frank et al., 2004</xref>). This suggests that if synaptic plasticity contributes to reshaping the network upon initial exposure to a new environment, it need not be conventional Hebbian plasticity, but rather a modified form of Hebbian plasticity that does not require axonal firing, such as the second and third conditions described above. Consistent with this idea, hippocampal neurons receive spatially tuned synaptic inputs even when they are silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Understanding whether and how such inputs can drive synaptic plasticity will be an important step toward understanding how spatial memories are formed in the hippocampus.</p><p>If axonal action potential firing is required for synaptic plasticity, memories can only be stored in active neurons. On the other hand, if it is not required, memories can <italic>also</italic> be formed in silent neurons. Furthermore, plasticity that is induced by dSpikes that remain localized to individual dendritic branches has been proposed to enhance the memory-storing capacity of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Poirazi and Mel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Mehta, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Wu and Mel, 2009</xref>). Collectively, these considerations underscore the importance of understanding the dendritic events leading to the postsynaptic calcium entry necessary for the induction of LTP.</p><p>At synapses from the perforant path (PP; which carries predominantly spatial information from the entorhinal cortex) to the distal apical tuft of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, LTP requires strong synaptic activation, and LTP induction can have a significant impact on the output of CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Colbert and Levy, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Remondes and Schuman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed and Siegelbaum, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>). In previous work, we showed that LTP at these synapses does not require bAPs; rather, LTP is correlated with the initiation of dSpikes, which often do not trigger action potential firing and bAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golding and Spruston, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 2002</xref>). This pathway therefore offers an ideal opportunity to study the potential role of dSpikes in the induction of LTP.</p><p>The hypothesis that dSpikes are a causal step in the induction of LTP has not been directly tested, owing to the difficulty of blocking them selectively. Three types of dSpikes have been described, which have been named according to the primary channel type supporting the regenerative event: dendritic sodium spikes (Na-dSpikes) and dendritic calcium spikes (Ca-dSpikes) are mediated primarily by voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels and Ca<sub>v</sub> channels, respectively, while dendritic NMDA spikes (NMDA-dSpikes) are mediated primarily by NMDAR channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Schwartzkroin and Slawsky, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreasen and Lambert, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Schiller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Golding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Larkum et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Spruston, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Major et al., 2013</xref>). NMDAR and Ca<sub>v</sub> channels are known to contribute to the induction of LTP at PP-CA1 synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>), but it is difficult to disentangle the importance of the calcium permeability of these channels from their roles in mediating regenerative dendritic voltage changes. Furthermore, the importance of dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channels and Na-dSpikes has not been addressed, mostly because these channels are essential for action potential firing in presynaptic axons and terminals, thus making it difficult to block them without inhibiting synaptic transmission.</p><p>One strategy to block postsynaptic Na<sub>v</sub> channels without affecting presynaptic Na<sub>v</sub> channels is to use the intracellular blocker QX-314; however, this drug also blocks Ca<sub>v</sub> channels, voltage-gated potassium (K<sub>v</sub>) channels and has effects on other channels and receptors, making the overall consequences difficult to interpret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Nathan et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrade, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Oda et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lambert and Wilson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Martin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Otis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Perkins and Wong, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Talbot and Sayer, 1996</xref>). As an alternative strategy, we used a relatively low concentration of bath-applied tetrodotoxin (TTX; 20 nM) to achieve partial block of the Na<sub>v</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kaneda et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Madeja, 2000</xref>), which we demonstrate is able to inhibit postsynaptic dSpikes mediated by Na<sub>v</sub> channels without blocking presynaptic action potential firing or synaptic transmission. This strategy works because the density of Na<sub>v</sub> channels is much lower in dendrites than in axons. As a result, the safety factor for spike initiation is lower in dendrites, so partial block of Na<sub>v</sub> channels affects postsynaptic (dendritic) dSpikes much more than presynaptic (axonal) action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mackenzie and Murphy, 1998</xref>). Using this strategy, we demonstrate that Na-dSpikes are necessary for the induction of LTP in response to theta-burst stimulation (TBS) of the PP synapses in the apical tuft dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, and we offer an explanation for why these spikes are an essential mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To determine whether a low concentration of TTX (20 nM) could be used without interfering with synaptic transmission over a range of stimulus intensities, we performed whole-cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices while stimulating the PP (‘Materials and methods’) to activate synapses in the distal apical tuft dendrites (henceforth ‘PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub>’ synapses). We adjusted stimulus intensity to yield single PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) of 3–10 mV at the soma, which likely corresponds to activation of several tens of synapses onto the apical tuft dendrites of the recorded neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Golding et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Nicholson et al., 2006</xref>). We chose 20 nM TTX (henceforth ‘low TTX’) because it was the highest concentration we could use without obviously reducing the size of EPSPs. The IC<sub>50</sub> of TTX on Na<sub>v</sub> channels has been estimated as 6–10 nM in dissociated hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kaneda et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Madeja, 2000</xref>), but it may be higher for slice experiments due to limited drug penetration in brain slices. Single EPSPs in response to low-frequency (single shock) stimulation were not affected by bath application of low TTX (control: 4.57 ± 0.36 mV, low TTX: 5.02 ± 0.49 mV, n = 7; p &gt; 0.05 by Student's t-test; data not shown). We also tested the effects of low TTX on the responses to low-frequency or high-frequency (5 stimuli at 100 Hz) activation of the PP, while using localized application of a higher concentration of TTX (10 µM in the application pipette) to the vicinity of the soma and proximal axons (‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in order to prevent somatic or axonal action potential initiation. Bath application of low TTX had no significant effect on PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> EPSPs in response to either type of stimulation, across a wide range of stimulus intensities resulting in EPSPs from ∼3 mV (single shock) up to ∼27 mV (high-frequency burst; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). These results suggest that excitatory synaptic transmission is not affected by bath application of low TTX within the range of stimulus intensities and frequencies tested here.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06414.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reducing Na<sub>v</sub> channel availability with 20 nM TTX does not affect synaptic transmission at PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental configuration showing somatic whole-cell recording with presynaptic stimulation of the perforant pathway (PP), 10 µM TTX locally applied to the soma, and bath application of 20 nM TTX.

In addition, we tested the effects of low TTX on action potentials evoked by repeated bursts of antidromic stimulation of CA1 axons and found that low TTX only affected antidromic action potential firing at low stimulus intensities. At high stimulus intensities, antidromic spikes were not blocked by low TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Together with the lack of effect of low TTX on synaptic responses, these data suggest that the effects of low TTX on presynaptic action potential firing and glutamate release are minimal.</p><p>To analyze the effects of low TTX on dSpike initiation, we performed recordings from the primary apical dendrite (n = 9; 200–320 µm from the soma, mean distance = 250 µm; about 50–80% of the distance from the soma to the end of the apical tuft). Dendritic recording is necessary to increase the probability of detecting dSpikes originating in the apical tuft, because their steep attenuation makes them impossible to detect hundreds of microns away in somatic recordings. We used a stimulus pattern known to cause dSpikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 2002</xref>), which consisted of PP stimulation in high-frequency bursts (5 stimuli at 100 Hz), repeated five times at theta frequency (5 Hz; a ‘theta-burst stimulation’, TBS, consisting of 25 stimuli in total). Stimulus intensity was set to evoke single PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> EPSPs of 4–10 mV recorded in the dendrites, approximately the same as that required to produce single PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> EPSPs of 2–5 mV recorded at the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Golding et al., 2005</xref>). This stimulus pattern is intended to mimic the theta rhythm observed both in the hippocampus and in the entorhinal cortical neurons forming the PP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buzsáki and Moser, 2013</xref>), and is known to be an effective stimulus for induction of LTP in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Larson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Phillips et al., 2008</xref>). A TBS is normally repeated multiple times to induce LTP, but in this first series of experiments, we used a single TBS in the presence of low TTX followed by another single TBS after washout of TTX. We used this order of drug application and avoided repeating TBS in each condition in order to prevent the induction of LTP, which would confound the comparison of responses in the presence and absence of TTX.</p><p>Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golding and Spruston, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>), we observed three types of regenerative dendritic responses: (1) bAPs, (2) large dSpikes, and (3) small dSpikes (also known as ‘spikelets’). These three kinds of events were distinguishable in most cases by their voltage amplitude, first temporal derivative of voltage (dV/dt) and onset kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’). Large dSpikes reflect dSpikes that have propagated actively from their initiation site to the recording site. However, dSpikes can fall below threshold for active propagation (often because of large impedance drops at branch points) and then propagate passively to the recording electrode, where they appear as small dSpikes (spikelets) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golding and Spruston, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jarsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Katz et al., 2009</xref>). dSpikes that are generated far from the recording site may not be visible at all. Observations of events with amplitudes in between those of large dSpikes and small dSpikes (spikelets) are rare, because the transition from a large dSpike to a small dSpike occurs over very short distances due to the large attenuation at branch points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Katz et al., 2009</xref>).

However, consistent with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 2002</xref>), we showed here again that PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP is not affected by blocking bAPs. Thus, we attribute the effect of low TTX on this particular form of LTP to its effect on Na-dSpikes. This is a surprising result, because of the brief duration of Na-dSpikes, compared to Ca- or NMDA-dSpikes.</p><p>One possible explanation for the requirement of Na-dSpikes during PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP induction is that they are required to activate channels mediating synaptic calcium influx. We therefore sought to determine which calcium-permeable channels are responsible for the underlying sources of calcium influx. We previously showed that PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP was reduced ∼50% by blocking NMDARs, ∼50% by blocking L-, T-, and R-type Ca<sub>v</sub> channels, and almost completely by blocking NMDARs and Ca<sub>v</sub> channels together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 2002</xref>).

The observation that partial block of Na<sub>v</sub> channels by low TTX blocked PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP almost completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>) indicates that Na<sub>v</sub> channel-mediated events are required to activate these two types of calcium-permeable channels, and these events are unlikely to be bAPs, as we showed here and in our previous study (see above). We therefore performed additional analyses on the dendritic recordings (described above) to determine how low TTX affects membrane potential changes that can activate these channels.</p><p>As described above, low TTX blocked large and small dSpikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). In one of the two dendritic recordings where we observed inhibition of a clear large dSpike by low TTX, we subsequently washed out TTX and applied 50 µM AP5, which did not block the large dSpike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). By contrast, low TTX had almost no effect on the slow depolarization produced by each burst of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> EPSPs in response to TBS, whereas 50 µM AP5 had a much greater effect on the slow depolarization associated with each burst. This differential effect of low TTX and 50 µM AP5 on the slow depolarization was confirmed in additional dendritic recordings (n = 9; for four cases, data in TTX and AP5 were obtained from the same cell; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Because low TTX was a more potent inhibitor of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP than 50 µM AP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), these results suggest that the fast depolarization associated with Na-dSpikes is more important for the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP than the slow synaptic depolarization mediated solely by EPSPs.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06414.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Reducing Na<sub>v</sub> channel availability reduces the slow synaptic depolarization in distal apical trunk in response to TBS significantly less than blocking NMDAR channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Differential effects of 20 nM TTX and 50 µM AP5 on dendritically recorded voltage in response to presynaptic TBS. <bold>A</bold><sub><bold>1</bold></sub>, Left, experimental configuration showing dendritic whole-cell recording with presynaptic stimulation of the PP.

We next turned our attention to investigating the calcium entry that links Na-dSpikes with the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP. Given that NMDAR and L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels are both voltage-dependent sources of calcium entry, and they both contribute to PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP (approximately equally, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), the most parsimonious hypothesis is that Na-dSpikes are effective activators of calcium entry via these pathways. Although LTP induction at these synapses may depend on the complex spatiotemporal properties of calcium entry, the simplest scenario is that Na-dSpikes produce particularly large calcium entry in synaptically activated portions of the tuft dendrites, which triggers LTP.</p><p>To test this idea, CA1 pyramidal neurons were filled with 100 µM Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 (OGB-1) and 50 µM Alexa Fluor 594 Hydrazide (AF-594) and imaged on a two-photon laser-scanning microscope during stimulation of the PP with single burst of 5 stimuli at 100 Hz (‘Materials and methods’). In these experiments, the soma was voltage-clamped at ∼ −70 mV in order to prevent action potential firing, thus limiting detected calcium influx to that induced by synaptic events and dendritically initiated spikes. For quantification of calcium signals, the calcium-induced change in OGB-1 fluorescence was measured as a fraction of the baseline fluorescence of the calcium-insensitive reference, AF-594 (ΔG/R; see ‘Materials and methods’). Although we could easily resolve dendritic spines, we could not determine which spines received direct synaptic input, so we restricted our analysis to the calcium signals in dendritic shafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), using the response integral as the best measure of dendritic calcium entry (see ‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06414.024</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Reducing Na<sub>v</sub> channel availability reduces the calcium influx in distal apical tuft dendrites in response to high-frequency burst stimulation significantly less than blocking NMDAR channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bottom, experimental configuration showing somatic whole-cell recording with presynaptic stimulation of the PP, with a representative Z-stack image of a neuron (filled with 50 µM AF-594) on which the imaging experiments were performed.

However, in small apical tuft branches, where direct patch-clamp recording cannot be performed, simulations revealed that a dSpike was initiated on several branches in response to burst activation of spatially distributed synaptic inputs, appearing as multiple dSpikes on the apical tuft branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12-data">Figure 8—source data 1</xref>). This is consistent with the observations in the experiments that multiple spikelets occurred in response to burst stimulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The simulations also offered insight into how Na-dSpikes could provide the calcium influx necessary for PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP induction. By comparing the dendritic calcium signals (reported by simulated OGB-1) and the calcium influx through the synaptic channels in the model, we could clearly distinguish the difference between dendritic ‘bulk’ calcium signals and the calcium signals near the mouth of channels. Simulations at the synapses revealed that the largest instantaneous calcium currents (I<sub>Ca</sub>) through NMDAR and L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels were mediated by locally generated Na-dSpikes, owing to efficient relief of magnesium block of NMDAR channels and strong activation of L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12-data">Figure 8—source data 1</xref>). These simulations, combined with the experimental results, suggest that a large, rapid, Na-dSpike-mediated component of calcium entry may produce transient, localized increases in intracellular calcium concentration that are essential for the induction of TBS-induced PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP. To further test this model, we experimentally tested two predictions.</p><p>First, we posited that blocking L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels, which inhibits LTP by ∼50%, would have minimal effect on measurements of bulk calcium entry in the distal apical dendrites, as indicated in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13-data">Figure 8—source data 2</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Tsay et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, we found that 10 µM nimodipine did not have a significant effect on dendritic calcium responses during burst stimulation of the PP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13-data">Figure 8—source data 2</xref>). This result is consistent with our hypothesis that L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels contribute to the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP by mediating increases in localized calcium near the channel pores rather than in dendritic bulk calcium.</p><p>Second, we posited that LTP would be inhibited by chelating intracellular calcium, but only when the buffering kinetics were fast enough to disrupt localized calcium signaling close to the channel pores (see ‘Discussion’). 1,2-<italic>Bis</italic>(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>',<italic>N</italic>'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) has a much faster calcium binding kinetics than ethylene glycol-<italic>bis</italic>(2-aminoethylether)-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>',<italic>N</italic>'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Tsien, 1980</xref>), and we therefore tested this hypothesis by buffering cytoplasmic calcium elevations with either a relatively low or high concentration of EGTA or BAPTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Maravall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Henneberger et al., 2010</xref>), while maintaining the basal calcium concentration at 50 nM by adding an appropriate amount of CaCl<sub>2</sub> (‘Materials and methods’).

These results suggest that NMDAR and L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels contribute to the induction of TBS-induced PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP by mediating calcium influx, and are consistent with the hypothesis that it is the large, transient, localized increases in intracellular calcium concentration mediated by Na-dSpikes that are critical for this form of LTP.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06414.032</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>TBS-induced PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP is blocked by intracellular calcium buffering with a high concentration of BAPTA, but not a low concentration of BAPTA or low or high EGTA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) Representative time course of EPSP amplitude before and after TBSx3+Current was delivered (arrows) from cells buffered with 0.5 mM EGTA (<bold>A</bold>), 0.5 mM BAPTA (<bold>B</bold>), 10 mM EGTA (<bold>C</bold>), or 10 mM BAPTA (<bold>D</bold>).

The results support this hypothesis, as this manipulation resulted in block of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP. The completeness of the block further suggests that Na-dSpikes are a critical component of the LTP induction process at these synapses.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Key findings and interpretation</title><p>Our results advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP induction in three important ways. First, whereas previous evidence for the role of dSpikes in the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 2002</xref>) was correlative (stimuli that evoked dSpikes also induced LTP, while stimuli that failed to evoke dSpikes also failed to induce LTP), this work supports a more direct causal link between the occurrence of dSpikes and the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP.</p><p>Second, our results firmly establish a role for dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channels in the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP. Previously observed correlations between dSpikes and PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 2002</xref>) could not discern whether the relevant dSpikes were mediated by Na<sub>v</sub>, Ca<sub>v</sub>, or NMDAR channels. One possibility is that these channels could be activated in concert and support relevant dendritic plateau potentials via a ‘spike-chain mechanism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schiller et al., 2000</xref>) to trigger PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP, but our results suggest that Na-dSpikes are the major contributors, and slow NMDAR-dependent synaptic depolarization is neither sufficient nor necessary for LTP at these synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5, 6</xref>). Our evidence for the necessity of Na-dSpikes in synaptic plasticity adds to the list of important functions of dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channels, which also includes contributions to synaptic integration leading to action potential initiation and a central role in action potential backpropagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Stuart and Sakmann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Golding et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Larkum and Nevian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Spruston, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Third, our results provide insight into the mechanisms by which Na-dSpikes are coupled to the induction of LTP through calcium influx at PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> synapses, as discussed in detail below. The block of LTP only by the fast calcium chelator BAPTA strongly supports the hypothesis that the large, localized increases in intracellular calcium concentration are necessary for the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP. This is in interesting contrast to the block of LTP also by the slow calcium chelator EGTA at the more proximal Schaffer collateral synapses of CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lynch et al., 1983</xref>), which suggests a different underlying mechanism for the calcium dependence of LTP at these synapses.</p><p>The most parsimonious explanation for our results is that the effective block of LTP by low TTX is through the inhibition of Na-dSpikes per se; however, a few alternative interpretations should be considered. For example, LTP induction could depend on a non-ionic mechanism directly coupled to the conformational changes of Na<sub>v</sub> channels or an ionic mechanism mediated by sodium flux through them (but little has been reported regarding these speculative mechanisms). Alternatively, during synaptic activation, Na<sub>v</sub> channels may affect membrane potential and calcium entry in spines independently of dSpikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Araya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2007</xref>; note that blocking Na<sub>v</sub> channels enhanced synaptic calcium influx in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2007</xref>). Finally, TTX may have a presynaptic effect, as presynaptic sodium has been shown to regulate synaptic strength constitutively at the Calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Huang and Trussell, 2014</xref>). A few observations argue against these possibilities, such as the lack of effect of low TTX on synaptic responses at PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the strong correlation between dSpikes and PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 2002</xref>) and the reduction in Na-dSpikes that accompanies the block of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP by low TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2, 3</xref>). However, additional experiments would be required to test these alternative possibilities directly.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanisms for coupling Na-dSpikes to the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP</title><p>The finding that Na-dSpikes play such a critical role in the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP is somewhat surprising, given the brief duration of these Na-dSpikes compared to slow depolarization mediated by EPSPs, Ca-dSpikes, or NMDA-dSpikes. The fact that simultaneously blocking NMDAR and L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels eliminated PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Remondes and Schuman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed and Siegelbaum, 2009</xref>) suggests that Na-dSpikes contribute to the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP by increasing calcium influx through these channels. But how does this work, given that Na-dSpikes have a brief duration and thus a limited contribution to the increase in ‘bulk’ calcium concentration (i.e., the calcium measurable with the spatiotemporal resolution provided by imaging with calcium-sensitive dyes) compared to slow synaptic depolarization?</p><p>A simple explanation, supported by our modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and the subsequent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), is that the calcium influx during Na-dSpikes (via NMDAR and L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels) is vigorous and brief, whereas the calcium influx during slow synaptic depolarization (via NMDAR channels) is smaller, but longer lasting. Although the latter ultimately contributes more to the total amount of calcium entry during a burst and comprises the vast majority of the bulk calcium measured with dendritic calcium imaging, the vigorous and brief calcium entry during Na-dSpikes is more critical for the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP.</p><p>During TBS, Na-dSpikes produce the largest voltage excursions and maximize I<sub>Ca</sub> through both NMDAR and L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Activation of NMDAR channels is strongly voltage dependent (through voltage-dependent magnesium block) as is activation of L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels (through high-voltage-activated conformational changes). Thus, these calcium-permeable channels that we implicate in PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP are activated more by the Na-dSpike than by the slow synaptic depolarization. The large I<sub>Ca</sub> caused by the Na-dSpike produces a brief, high calcium concentration near the mouth of the channels, which will quickly diffuse away and contribute modestly to the bulk calcium concentration in the rest of the dendritic spine and shaft. On the other hand, most of the bulk calcium is generated by the smaller, but longer-lasting flux of calcium through the NMDAR channels activated during the slow synaptic depolarization. The calcium concentration near the mouth of the channels is proportional to the instantaneous amplitude of I<sub>Ca</sub>, while the bulk calcium concentration is proportional to the time integral of I<sub>Ca</sub> through the calcium-permeable channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Augustine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eggermann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tadross et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06414.034</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for the critical role of Na-dSpikes in the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Synaptic membrane potential and calcium currents in response to a high-frequency burst activation of glutamatergic synapses (re-plotted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

The locally generated Na-dSpike mediates the largest I<sub>Ca</sub> through both NMDAR channels (3) and L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels (4), thus resulting in a high, localized calcium concentration near the mouth of the channels (dark red), which activates a series of biochemical events necessary for the induction of LTP. This intracellular calcium diffuses away, contributing only modestly to the ‘bulk’ calcium concentration throughout the dendritic spine and shaft (pink), which is eventually removed from the cytoplasm by pumps in the plasma membrane and in organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, the smaller, longer-lasting I<sub>Ca</sub> through NMDAR channels generated during the slow synaptic depolarization produces a lower localized calcium concentration near the channel pore, but contributes more to the bulk calcium concentration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06414.034">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06414.034</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06414-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>The efficacy of low TTX as a blocker of LTP by inhibiting Na-dSpikes could be explained by the existence of a calcium sensor near the channels that triggers a series of LTP-inducing biochemical events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The affinity and co-operativity of the calcium sensor would have to be matched to the spatiotemporal features of the calcium concentration profiles near the mouths of NMDAR and L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels in response to TBS. The affinity of the sensor would need to be relatively low, in order to respond <italic>only</italic> to the high calcium concentration near the calcium-conducting pores during a large Na-dSpike. As our model predicts a modest increase in peak I<sub>Ca</sub> (proportional to local calcium concentration) during a dSpike, relative to the slow synaptic depolarization, it is likely that the sensor would also need high cooperativity in order to respond selectively during the dSpike. Importantly, experimentally observed Hill coefficients are indeed high enough for this operation; for example, assuming a Hill coefficient of 4, a modest dSpike-driven difference in peak I<sub>Ca</sub> (∼twofold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) would increase calcium sensor activation from 20% to 80%. The identities of the calcium sensors and the downstream biochemistry leading to LTP induction are the subjects of ongoing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amici et al., 2009</xref>), but calmodulin may have the properties necessary to serve this function, namely low affinity, rapid binding kinetics, and high cooperativity for calcium binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Faas et al., 2011</xref>). Calmodulin has been postulated to be the initial calcium sensor coupled to other key LTP-inducing molecules such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bradshaw et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lisman et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, Na-dSpikes might couple activation of NMDAR or L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels to LTP via mechanisms that operate independently of postsynaptic calcium influx or in concert with it. For example, it is well known that the gating of L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels is coupled to muscle contraction independently of calcium flux through the channels and that similar mechanisms may exist in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kaczmarek, 2006</xref>). Indeed, activation of NMDARs in the absence of calcium influx through the channels has been suggested to be sufficient for induction of long-term depression (LTD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Nabavi et al., 2013</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Babiec et al., 2014</xref>).

However, the block of LTP by intracellular calcium buffering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) suggests that NMDAR and L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels contribute to the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP by their ionotropic rather than metabotropic functions. Moreover, high-frequency stimulation of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> synapses has been shown to result in LTP expression mediated by functional upregulation of presynaptic Ca<sub>v</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed and Siegelbaum, 2009</xref>), but the lack of effect of nimodipine on synaptic responses after LTP induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicates that the effect of nimodipine on TBS-induced PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP cannot be explained by the block of a presynaptic expression mechanism mediated by L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out a possible role of presynaptic NMDARs in LTP induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kunz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The requirement for Na-dSpikes has interesting functional implications for PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP. The activation of multiple synapses on a single dendritic branch leads to initiation of a dSpike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>), but dSpikes tend to fail at branch points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Spruston, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Katz et al., 2009</xref>).

If true, such compartmentalization of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Losonczy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Makara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Makino and Malinow, 2011</xref>) would have substantial implications for the granularity of associations learned at the dendritic level, and consequently, the information-carrying capacity of a pyramidal neuron, as information may be stored discretely in individual dendritic branches or segments, rather than in an entire neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Poirazi and Mel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Mehta, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Wu and Mel, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Comparison to other forms of LTP</title><p>There are many forms of LTP, so it is not clear how general the requirement for Na-dSpikes will prove to be, even at the same synapses but with a different induction protocol. PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP has also been reported to occur in response to combined activation of the PP and the more proximal Schaffer collaterals (SCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>). In those experiments, dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channels would be critical because bAPs were necessary to trigger calcium plateau potentials (a form of Ca-/NMDA-dSpike) that induced LTP. For this reason, it may prove difficult to disentangle the contributions of dendritic regenerative events mediated primarily by dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channels (such as Na-dSpikes and bAPs) from dendritic regenerative events mediated by other channels (such as Ca- and NMDA-dSpikes) to the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP with this paradigm. Moreover, although NMDARs and R-type Ca<sub>v</sub> channels were shown to be important for this form of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>), the role of dendritic L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels is unclear. L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels were not required for plateau potentials, but whether their activation by plateau potentials contributes to the induction of this form of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP has not been tested.</p><p>Given the remarkable capacity of the brain to store information, it is no surprise that there are many different forms of LTP. Thus, we expect our findings generalize to some synapses but not others. For example, LTP has been induced at SC synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons using many different protocols, such as those that produce synaptic depolarization alone, without bAPs or dSpikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gustafsson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Isaac et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liao et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Han and Heinemann, 2013</xref>). Another interesting form of LTP at SC synapses depends on an instructive signal from coincident PP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dudman et al., 2007</xref>). This form of LTP does not depend on bAPs or dSpikes either, but is mediated by endocannabinoid release from dendrites, induced by summation of EPSPs from both pathways, which ultimately downregulates feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basu et al., 2013</xref>). At these same SC synapses, other forms of LTP have been reported to depend on postsynaptic action potential firing, presumably via bAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Magee and Johnston, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Thomas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wittenberg and Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buchanan and Mellor, 2007</xref>). Still other forms of LTP at SC synapses, however, are correlated with the initiation of dSpikes (Remy and Spruston, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hardie and Spruston, 2009</xref>), but it is unclear what role Na-dSpikes play, relative to Ca-dSpikes or NMDA-dSpikes.</p><p>At excitatory synapses on other cell types, LTP has been reported to result from a range of postsynaptic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gordon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Holthoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kampa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Froemke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hsu et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brandalise and Gerber, 2014</xref>). Importantly, however, a recent study demonstrated that rhythmic whisker stimulation induced LTP in somatosensory cortex, even when the stimulus did not drive somatic action potential firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gambino et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, LTP can occur in vivo, in response to naturalistic simulation, even in the absence of axo-somatic spiking. Nevertheless, action potentials and bAPs are likely to be important for other forms of synaptic plasticity. The diversity of LTP induction mechanisms is likely to contribute to the powerful learning capacity of the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A potential role for Na-dSpikes in cognition at multiple timescales</title><p>In summary, the experiments presented here argue for a critical, causal role of dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channels, by triggering Na-dSpikes, in the induction of PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP. With this conclusion, we have now established possible functional roles for Na-dSpikes not only in the rapid, moment-to-moment processing of internal and external information (by influencing synaptic integration; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golding and Spruston, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jarsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Katz et al., 2009</xref>), but also in the long-term storage of this information (by a Na-dSpike-dependent form of LTP). Dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channels were previously known to contribute to the cellular basis of memory by mediating forms of LTP that require action potential backpropagation. In this case, the Hebbian plasticity rule—‘neurons that fire together wire together’—is implemented by bAPs. Our results suggest that dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channels can also contribute to memory formation via a critical role for Na-dSpikes in some forms of LTP. Our view is that this form of LTP is Hebbian on a finer spatial scale, for which the rule can be rephrased as ‘neurites that fire together wire together’. Dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channels play a central role in the cellular implementation of this rule, by determining which postsynaptic neurites fire.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus and Northwestern University. 3- to 7-week-old male Wistar rats were decapitated under deep isoflurane anesthesia, and the brain was transferred to an ice-cold dissection solution containing (in mM): 110 Choline-Cl, 0.2 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 15 Dextrose, 2.4 Na-Pyruvate, 1.3 Na-Ascorbate, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 MgCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.4, oxygenated with 95% CO<sub>2</sub> and 5% O<sub>2</sub>). 300- to 350-µm thick, near-horizontal slices were sectioned using a vibrating tissue slicer (Vibratome 3000, The Vibratome Company, St. Louis, MO; or Leica VT 1200S, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).

For LTP induction, stimulus intensities were set to give EPSP amplitudes of 2–5 mV in somatic recordings and 4–10 mV in dendritic recordings, consistent with approximately 50% attenuation of EPSPs between the dendrite (200–300 µm from the soma) and the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Golding et al., 2005</xref>).

To induce PP → CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP, we used TBS, which consisted of five burst stimuli grouped at 5 Hz, with each consisting of 5 synaptic stimuli at 100 Hz. This stimulus was repeated three times (TBSx3), at 30-s intervals. Each TBS was delivered under one of the following three conditions: (1) paired with brief (2 ms) somatic current injections at 50 Hz to evoke 3 action potentials during each burst (TBSx3+Current), (2) with the soma voltage-clamped at −68 to −70 mV (TBSx3+SomaticVC), or (3) alone (5-stim TBSx3).

Laser power was controlled with an electro-optical modulator (Model 350-80; Conoptics, Danbury, CT). Line-scan imaging along dendritic shafts (typically 5–10 µm in length) and across spines was performed using the Ultima scanner at 250–500 Hz with a dwell time of 10 µs, and fluorescence was collected by multi-alkali photomultiplier tubes (PMTs; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan). Laser power was adjusted to ensure a good signal-to-noise ratio of the fluorescence signal without photo-bleaching the dyes or photo-damaging the dendrites (see below). In some experiments, multiple locations on several branches or longer stretches of the branch (up to ∼35 µm) were imaged to determine the spatial profile of the calcium signals.

Control experiments suggested that dye saturation did not occur under our conditions (data not shown). The largest peak ∆G/R achieved in the distal dendrites (∼250%, by pairing TBS with somatic current injection to evoke bAPs) was well above the largest value observed in response to a single high-frequency burst stimulation. Furthermore, the dye was not saturated by a single burst in general because calcium responses were able to facilitate upon delivery of additional bursts in TBS with the ratio ΔG/R <sub>(Max)</sub>:ΔG/R <sub>(first burst)</sub> = 1.52 ± 0.31 (n = 4). Importantly, no correlation was observed between normalized drug effects and the ∆G/R measure in control (data not shown), which would be expected if dye saturation had resulted in an underestimate of pharmacological inhibition.

For somatic recordings, the apparent voltage threshold of action potentials was measured as the voltage at which dV/dt crossed 40 V/s. In dendritic recordings, the voltage responses after each synaptic stimulus position (Stim. #) could be divided into two populations with non-overlapping amplitude distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Large-amplitude dendritic events (defined as those with the peak amplitude &gt;40 mV) were presumed to consist of both bAPs and large dSpikes. The apparent voltage threshold of large-amplitude dendritic events was measured as the voltage at which the second temporal derivative of voltage d<sup>2</sup>V/dt<sup>2</sup> crossed 7.5 mV/ms<sup>2</sup>. bAPs typically have a high apparent voltage threshold, because large dendritic EPSPs are required for the axonal EPSPs to be large enough to reach the threshold for action potential initiation after EPSP attenuation between the dendrites and the axon. In contrast, large dSpikes have a lower apparent threshold, because they are initiated closer to the dendritic recording electrode.</p><p>bAPs and large dSpikes also differ in their onset kinetics, quantified as ‘initial phase slope’, which was measured as the slope of a linear fit to the initial portion of the phase plot (dV/dt vs V; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). As dV/dt is proportional to membrane current, the initial phase slope can be conceptualized as the <italic>apparent</italic> voltage sensitivity of membrane current. It is an <italic>apparent</italic> voltage sensitivity because the source of the current (e.g., the Na<sub>v</sub> channels) and the membrane potential responsible for the current are at a remote location, and therefore the observed voltage sensitivity does not necessarily reflect the voltage dependence of the activation of the channels per se. In dendritic recordings, actively propagating spikes initiated in the axon (i.e., bAPs) typically have a sharp ‘kink’ at their onset, because they are initiated by axial current flowing from a remote location of spike initiation (i.e., the axon), which precedes local dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channel-mediated currents. The ‘kink’ is reflected as a large initial phase slope (&gt;3.5 ms<sup>-1</sup>), and thus a steep apparent voltage sensitivity of the membrane current, because the axial current is driven by the voltage difference between the axon and the dendrite, thus resulting in a current that is not driven by changes in the local dendritic depolarization and therefore does not require activation of local channels. As a result of this sudden current, the onset of these backpropagating spikes shows a kink in the time domain and a steep initial slope in the phase domain. In contrast, large dSpikes have a more gradual onset, because they are initiated by local Na<sub>v</sub> channel-mediated currents generated closer to the dendritic recording electrode, and therefore the voltage sensitivity of the membrane current (as measured by initial phase slope) more accurately reflects the voltage sensitivity of the Na<sub>v</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Shu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brette, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Smith et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of these two criteria, some events could be identified as clear bAPs (high threshold and large initial phase slope) or clear large dSpikes (low threshold and small initial phase slope), while the other events were ambiguous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>), perhaps owing to complications such as coincident local dendritic depolarization (which may reduce the initial phase slope of bAPs) or very distal locations of dSpike initiation (which may result in large initial phase slope of propagating dSpikes). Three large-amplitude dendritic events with relatively small initial phase slope but high threshold also had relatively broad halfwidth, suggesting a larger contribution from Ca<sub>v</sub> and/or NMDAR channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>Small dSpikes (spikelets) were identified as outliers in the distribution of peak dV/dt values (stimulus positions with a large-amplitude dendritic event in the control condition were excluded for this analysis) for each of the five stimulus positions (Stim. #) in each burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

A fit of an exponential decay function to the whole population of data (control and 20 nM TTX) was then performed. Small dSpikes were identified as events that fell outside the prediction band of the fit; in this way, a single criterion was applied to both experimental conditions (i.e., control and 20 nM TTX). Because there is no perfectly objective way to determine which events should be called small dSpikes, we analyzed the data for prediction bands at confidence levels ranging from 85% (least stringent; largest number of small dSpikes) to 99% (most stringent; smallest number of small dSpikes).

Special caution was taken to confirm that the smoothing reduced random noise without changing the kinetics and amplitude of the original signals. Tissue autofluorescence was determined to be negligible in the two-photon experiments, so no background subtraction was carried out. The two-photon Z-stack images of neurons were generated by two-dimensional projection of maximal AF-594 fluorescence intensity from three-dimensional Z-stacks.</p><p>All analyses were performed using IGOR Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA), ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).</p><p>In most cases (unless noted otherwise), data were presented as mean ± S.E.M. Significance of the difference in normalized EPSP amplitude between experimental conditions was tested by one-way ANOVA with <italic>post hoc</italic> multiple comparisons by Tukey's method. Significance of LTP expression for each experimental condition was tested by one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Significance of the difference in number of events counted as small dSpikes (spikelets) between two experimental conditions was tested using a binomial test; rejection of the null hypothesis suggests an unequal likelihood of an event occurring above threshold between two conditions. All other comparisons between two experimental groups/conditions were done with Student's t-test.

The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study characterizes the effects of low concentrations of TTX on the generation of dendritic action potentials and the induction of LTP in response to theta burst stimulation of perforant path (PP) synaptic inputs to distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Earlier work from this lab demonstrated the remarkable electrical isolation of distal dendrites from the rest of CA1 pyramidal cells, in which local spikes play an important role in local computations, and are also important in triggering LTP. The background for this study is the nature of these dendritic spikes. Dendrites are capable of a number of regenerative processes, including sodium spikes, high threshold calcium spikes and NMDAR-dependent “spikes”. The authors conclude that 20 nM TTX selectively inhibits dendritic spikes without any apparent effect on the amplitude of subthreshold synaptic responses. The low dose of TTX is surprisingly effective in blocking theta burst LTP, which is dependent on calcium influx through NMDA receptors and L-type voltage gated calcium channels. The authors present evidence that the sodium spikes engage L-type calcium channels as well as unblock NMDARs, both of which contribute to LTP.</p><p>Both reviewers thought that the topic was interesting and that the experiments were well-performed, however the reviewers raised important concerns regarding whether the results prove that Na-dependent dendritic spikes “trigger” or “cause” or whether they are contributors to the observed plasticity along with L-type calcium channels and NMDA receptors. <italic>eLife</italic> policy is not to extend the review process by demanding major sets of additional experiments that would require months and/or detailed re-review. Thus as you review the comments below, please consider which experiments are essential to prove that dendritic Na spikes “contribute” and which are necessary to support the stronger conclusion that dendritic sodium spikes are causal and “trigger” plasticity as the title implies. The revised Discussion and conclusions should match the experiments in that regard. We regard the experiments suggested in point 2 of reviewer 1 and point 3 of reviewer 2 to be essential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1 questioned the strength of the conclusion that block of dendritic spikes by TTX is causally related to the effect of TTX to block LTP. This conclusion is based on a single concentration of TTX, and the argument that it is unlikely that the voltage-gated sodium channels are acting through means other than dendritic spikes. However, Na<sub>v</sub> channels can contribute to synaptic activation and influence calcium levels in individual spines (Bloodgood and Sabatini, Neuron 2007; Araya et al., PNAS, 2007) and conceivably could influence calcium indirectly by Na elevation and a decreased activation of Na/Ca exchange (e.g. Huang and Trussell, Neuron 2014). Can the authors demonstrate a more convincing causal link between the Na spikes and LTP? For example, can block of LTP be rescued by direct injection of current to simulate dendritic spikes, or do changes in spikes by a wider range of low TTX concentrations correlate with changes in LTP (i.e. do the two have similar IC50s?).</p><p>2) The authors fail to address certain discrepancies between their results and previous studies of synaptically evoked calcium signals in CA1 distal dendrites. The authors conclude that the L-type calcium channels participate in LTP by contributing to postsynaptic calcium influx. However, two previous studies using related stimulation protocols failed to observe any effect of L-type channel antagonists on synaptically evoked calcium signals in distal dendrites (Takahashi and Magee, Neuron 2009; Tsay et al., Neuron 2007). Did the authors examine the effects of L-type blockers on calcium levels under the conditions of their calcium imaging experiments?</p><p>One possible explanation for the discrepancy between effects of L-type blockers on postsynaptic calcium versus LTP is that the L-type channels are acting presynaptically to enhance transmitter release, consistent with a previous study (that the authors fail to discuss) demonstrating that PP LTP can have a significant presynaptic component of expression (Ahmed and Siegelbaum, Neuron 2009).</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Given that local synaptic responses in the distal dendrites and isolated spines are likely to be significantly larger than the 3-10 mV depolarization in the soma, and thus capable of activating spine or shaft voltage-gated sodium channels, it is surprising that 20 nM TTX had no effect on the subthreshold synaptic response. Is it possible that the 10 μM local TTX applied to the soma had some effect distally? Did the authors try applying 20 nM TTX in the absence of local somatic TTX (using weak subthreshold distal stimulation)?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8 fig9">Figures 7–9</xref>. To explain the discrepancy in their results in which Na<sub>v</sub> channel blockade causes only a small decrease in total calcium signal yet fully blocks LTP, the authors postulate that LTP depends on a local calcium microdomain located near the inner mouth of L-type calcium channels. The authors could test this interesting idea by showing that LTP is relatively insensitive to block with the slow calcium buffer EGTA but is efficiently blocked by the fast buffer BAPTA (in contrast to previous studies at Schaffer collateral synapses showing LTP is blocked efficiently by EGTA).</p><p>Minor comment</p><p>1. Why do the authors use such a high affinity calcium dye (OGB-1)? Previous studies on dendritic calcium signals generally use much lower affinity dyes to prevent saturation. If OGB-1 is saturated by high dendritic calcium levels, this would lead the authors to underestimate the effects of the pharmacological inhibitors on calcium levels.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>The experiments are well crafted and the conclusions are generally reasonable.

It is possible that subthreshold depolarization contributed by Na<sub>v</sub> channels (which is less likely according to our data) or Na<sup>+</sup> entry into spines is somehow critical for the induction of LTP, independently of Na-dSpikes. We have added text to the Discussion to address these possibilities. However, we feel that the data and modeling we present, including the new experiments (see below), make a strong case for the importance of Na-dSpikes driving the critical calcium influx at the mouth of L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels and NMDAR channels. We hope the reviewers and editors agree that discussing alternatives is an acceptable alternative to absolute proof, which is hard (maybe even impossible) to achieve.</p><p>We note also that we used a single concentration of TTX because there is a narrow range over which this experiment is likely to work. Higher concentrations of TTX would block synaptic transmission and lower concentrations would be expected to have a smaller effect on LTP and Na-dSpikes. Assaying the concentration dependence of these effects would consume a lot of time and resources; it is not clear to us what the benefit of that effort would be.</p><p>We opted not to do the experiments involving direct current injection into dendrites for a couple of reasons. First, the experiments are very difficult, as they involve maintaining dendritic recordings long enough to induce and monitor LTP. Second, even if we were to perform these experiments, a negative result would be difficult to interpret, because we would not know if we were able to induce the right amount of depolarization at the right time and in the right place in the vast expanse of distal dendrites.</p><p><italic>2) The authors fail to address certain discrepancies between their results and previous studies of synaptically evoked calcium signals in CA1 distal dendrites. The authors conclude that the L-type calcium channels participate in LTP by contributing to postsynaptic calcium influx.

Rather, we think the relevant localized calcium elevations near L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels do not contribute substantially to the “bulk” calcium concentration measured by calcium imaging in dendrites. To test this, we conducted additional calcium imaging experiments and we indeed found that 10 µM nimodipine had little effect on dendritic calcium signals during high-frequency burst stimulation (new figure: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with our model, presented in the Discussion that L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channel-mediated calcium influx contributes to TBS-induced PP-CA1<sub>tuft</sub> LTP by activating plasticity-related downstream signaling near the mouth of the channels, without providing a large contribution to the overall dendritic calcium influx during TBS. In addition, we experimentally ruled out the possibility that nimodipine blocks LTP by masking presynaptic contribution of L-Ca<sub>v</sub> channels to LTP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, our hypothesis is now directly supported by additional new experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; see below).</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>.

These data were included in the Results section (control: 4.57 ± 0.36 mV; TTX: 5.02 ± 0.49 mV, n = 7 cells), before we introduced the concept of applying 10 µM TTX at the soma, which was done to prevent spiking when bursts of stimuli were applied.</p><p>One possible reason that 20 nM TTX had marginal or no effect on subthreshold synaptic responses is that this low concentration of TTX blocks only some of the Nav channels.

In the LTP experiments, where 20 nM TTX was an effective blocker of LTP, 10 µM TTX was not applied perisomatically.

As we predicted, only 10 mM BAPTA was able to block LTP. The new data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. We hope the reviewer will agree that this strengthens the case for localized calcium entry activating plasticity-related downstream signaling responsible for LTP, and also supports our model which is based on not only activation of dendritic Na<sub>v</sub> channels, but also Na-dSpikes.</p><p><italic>Minor comment</italic></p><p><italic>1. Why do the authors use such a high affinity calcium dye (OGB-1)? Previous studies on dendritic calcium signals generally use much lower affinity dyes to prevent saturation. If OGB-1 is saturated by high dendritic calcium levels, this would lead the authors to underestimate the effects of the pharmacological inhibitors on calcium levels.</italic></p><p>We used OGB-1 in order to facilitate identification of dendritic calcium signals that were much harder to detect with lower-affinity dyes OGB-5N and OGB-6F (data not shown). A major difference between our and previous studies (such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Tsay et al., 2007</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>) is that we used a milder stimulation paradigm, which did not elicit dendritic plateau potentials. Thus, we needed the high-affinity dye to observe dendritic calcium signals reliably. We did two things to address the reviewer’s concern about dye saturation: first, to see the largest calcium responses achievable by physiological activities in our settings, we performed experiments assaying the relationships between ΔG/R and various patterns of synaptic stimulation (with 1.3 or 2 mM Ca2+) or different numbers and frequencies of bAPs evoked bysomatic current injection (because bAPs have considerable activity-dependent attenuation along the dendrites, the latter had to be performed in more proximal dendrites, ~15-90 μm from the soma). We found the largest possible peak ΔG/R values (observed when TBS was paired with somatic current injection to evoke bAPs) were well above the largest ΔG/R in response to single high-frequency burst stimulation in our dataset, and the dye was not saturated by a single burst in general because calcium responses were able to facilitate upon delivery of additional bursts in TBS (five bursts) with the ratio ΔG/R <sub>(Max)</sub>: ΔG/R <sub>(1st burst)</sub> = 1.52 ± 0.31 (n = 4 cells, in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref>). In addition, we plotted our pharmacological data to determine if there was any positive correlation between drug effect and the ΔG/R in control, which would be expected if dye saturation had led to significant underestimate of pharmacological inhibition for larger responses; however, no such relationship was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 2</xref>). These new data are provided here for the reviewer, but we decided not to clutter the paper with additional supplements.
