have indicated that both genetic and non-genetic determinants can contribute to intra-tumor heterogeneity and influence cancer outcomes. Among the best described sub-population of cancer cells generated by non-genetic mechanisms are cells characterized by a CD44+/CD24− cell surface marker profile. Here, we report that human CD44+/CD24− cancer cells are genetically highly unstable because of intrinsic defects in their DNA-repair capabilities. In fact, in CD44+/CD24− cells, constitutive activation of the TGF-beta axis was both necessary and sufficient to reduce the expression of genes that are crucial in coordinating DNA damage repair mechanisms. Consequently, we observed that cancer cells that reside in a CD44+/CD24− state are characterized by increased accumulation of DNA copy number alterations, greater genetic diversity and improved adaptability to drug treatment. Together, these data suggest that the transition into a CD44+/CD24− cell state can promote intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity, spur tumor evolution and increase tumor fitness.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21615.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21615.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21615.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A single tumor can be made up of thousands of cancer cells that look and behave differently from one another. This observed diversity arises from changes in the DNA sequence of particular genes, changes in the activity of genes, and the ability of cells to transition between different states. As a result, individual cells within a tumor may react differently to certain anti-cancer drugs: most of the cells may be sensitive to the treatment and die, whereas some might be resistant and survive.</p><p>Previous studies on several types of human cancers – including breast, brain and lung cancers – have identified a group of cells called CD44+/CD24- cells that seem to be more aggressive and resistant to therapy than other cancer cells. However, it is currently not known exactly how these CD44+/CD24- cells influence a whole tumor’s resistance to anti-cancer drugs.</p><p>Certain cancer cells in tumors are exposed to a signal molecule called TGF-β. CD44+/CD24- cells are unusual in that they are able to produce and release this signal molecule themselves. Pal et al. show that in CD44+/CD24- cells from a human lung cancer cell line, TGF-β decreased the activity of genes responsible for accurately fixing breaks in the CD44+/CD24- cells’ DNA. As a result, these cells made more mistakes than other lung cancer cells when repairing damaged DNA and consequently accumulated additional genetic mutations. Furthermore, tumors containing these cells were more likely to survive treatment with chemotherapy.</p><p>The findings of Pal et al. show that the CD44+/CD24- cells exposed to TGF-β had a survival advantage because they were more genetically diverse and therefore better able to adapt to new drug treatments and other changes in their surroundings. Future experiments may explore how to specifically target and kill the CD44+/CD24- cells from tumors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21615.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21615.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>genetic diversity</kwd><kwd>drug adaptability</kwd><kwd>intra-tumor heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>tumor evolution</kwd><kwd>tumor fitness</kwd><kwd>copy number alteration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCI P01 CA129243-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sordella</surname><given-names>Raffaella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phenotypic diversity and cell state transition (i.e., acquisition of a CD44+/CD24- cell state or exposure to TGF-beta) can spur intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity and contribute to acquired resistance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Differences in the morphology and behavior of cancer cells within tumors were first noted by pathologists in the 1800s. However, advancements in genome-sequencing technologies and the possibility of analyzing the genome at single-cell resolution have affirmed that cancer within a single patient is a heterogeneous mixture of genetically distinct sub-clones that can arise from the accumulation of random mutations during tumor initiation, progression and response to drug treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greaves and Maley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burrell et al., 2013</xref>). Tumors have been considered the result of neo-Darwinian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zellmer and Zhang, 2014</xref>) evolution processes within tissues. However, ample evidence has also indicated that non-genetic determinants, including epigenetic modifications (e.g. chromatin modifications or the activities of microRNAs and other noncoding RNAs) and the capability of cancer cells to transition between various cell states, contribute to the diversity of cell type and to the cell behaviors observed within tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almendro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kreso and Dick, 2014</xref>).</p><p>One of the best examples of a cell state transition that responds to epigenetic/stochastic events is the differential expression of the cell surface markers CD44 and CD24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hajj et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Polyak and Weinberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korkaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>). CD44 and CD24 are cell surface glycoproteins that are reportedly involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, as well as in the regulation of cancer cell growth, anchorage-independent proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alho and Underhill, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birch et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sy et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jain et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodison et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>CD44+/CD24− cell populations are particularly salient in the field of oncology. It has been shown that CD44+/CD24− cancer cells are more adept at forming tumors, are more resistant to chemotherapy and tend to have greater metastatic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hajj et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Polyak and Weinberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korkaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>). CD44+/CD24− cells were initially identified in breast tumors and breast-cancer-derived cell lines and have since been observed in the vast majority of tumors and tumor-derived cell lines, including non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), glioblastomas, neuroblastomas and leiomyosarcomas, as well as pancreatic, colon, prostate and ovarian tumors/cancers. Although CD44+/CD24− cells are the most abundant sub-population of cells in certain tumors, in many cases, they constitute only 3–5% of total tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hajj et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Polyak and Weinberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korkaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>From a molecular standpoint, CD44+/CD24− cells are characterized by mesenchymal-like features including a decreased expression of E-cadherin and an increase in both vimentin and the master regulators of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT): TGF-β, Snail and Zeb2. These cells also exhibit upregulation of stem-cell markers, such as Oct3/4, Nanog, Sox2, IL-6, C-Myc and BMI-1, and of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Mcl1, Bcl2 and Bcl-XL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hajj et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Polyak and Weinberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korkaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned characteristics, we found that CD44+/CD24− cells have intrinsic defects in their ability to repair DNA lesions. In particular, we observed that these defects could be ascribed to the activation of TGF-β-mediated signaling; we discovered that this signaling pathway was both necessary and sufficient for decreasing the expression of genes such as <italic>BLM</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, <italic>FANCF</italic>, <italic>NBN</italic>, <italic>PMS1</italic>, <italic>RAD50</italic>, <italic>RDM1</italic>, <italic>WRN</italic>, <italic>ATM</italic> and <italic>ATR</italic>, which are essential in homology-directed repair (HDR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).</p><p>TGF-β was first described in human platelets as a secreted protein that played a potential role in wound-healing responses. Since then, the TGF-betaβ signaling pathway has been the focus of a multitude of studies. Upon activation, TGF-betaβ can bind to the TGF-β receptor II (TβRII), which in turn phosphorylates the TGF-β receptor I (TβRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Massagué et al., 2005</xref>). From here, the activated TβRI can trigger a signaling cascade that propagates and amplifies the signal through the phosphorylation of intracellular downstream effectors such as SMAD2 and SMAD3, AKT and MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Massagué et al., 2005</xref>). In the case of SMAD2/3, these effectors can form a complex with the SMAD4 protein that translocates the nucleus where, upon binding to specific DNA sequence motifs and transcriptional regulatory complexes, they can trans-activate target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Massagué et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The activation of the TGF-β signaling axis impacts diverse and often contrasting cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal differentiation, migration, apoptosis and ECM remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Massagué, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derynck and Miyazono, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oshimori and Fuchs, 2012</xref>). The duality of TGF-β-mediated signaling is best exemplified by the role of TGF-β in tumorigenesis. In fact, depending on the context, TGF-β can either halt or promote tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Massagué, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, TGF-β signaling has recently been shown to mediate resistance to targeted and conventional anticancer agents through the activation of pro-survival pathways (such as those involving Il-6, Bcl2 or Mcl-1) or of cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franco et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oshimori et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, previous observations have already implied a role for TGF-β in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glick et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Preobrazhenska et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kirshner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wiegman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). While some previous studies align with our findings and demonstrate a possible role for TGFβ in reducing the expression and/or activity of certain genes involved in DNA repair, other works have challenged this view by showing that inhibition of TGF-β signaling tends to attenuate DNA damage responses.</p><p>Owing to these contradictory observations, we utilized a multifaceted approach to investigate whether a decrease in the expression of genes involved in homology directed repair (HDR) by TGF-β was sufficient to induce DNA DSBs and an increased accumulation of DNA copy number alterations (CNAs). In fact, because of the decrease in the efficiency of HDR, a switch to other break-repair mechanisms, including non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fitzgerald et al., 2017</xref>), could give rise to an increase in the accumulation of chromosomal translocation and CNAs in CD44+/CD24− cancer cells and cells exposed to TGF-β. Consistent with the observation that TGF-β decreases the expression of <italic>BLM</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, <italic>FANCF</italic>, <italic>NBN</italic>, <italic>PMS1</italic>, <italic>RAD50</italic>, <italic>RDM1</italic>, <italic>WRN</italic>, <italic>ATM</italic> and <italic>ATR</italic>, we found that cells exposed to TGF-β have a decreased capacity to repair DNA DSBs. In addition, we also observed that CD44+/CD24− cells from tumor and tumor-derived cell lines, as well as cells that have been exposed to TGF-β, had an increased clonal genetic diversity.</p><p>Central to current cancer research is the notion that the acquisition of genetic mutations in cancer cells generate complex populations of cells that are subject to Darwinian evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cahill et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almendro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burrell et al., 2013</xref>). In keeping with this principle, much like the branching evolution that Darwin described, the progeny of a cancer cell with increased fitness thrives in certain environments and gives rise to a dominant clonal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cahill et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almendro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burrell et al., 2013</xref>). Consistently, we observed that the increased genetic diversity in the cancer cell population that was induced by transient exposure to TGF-β enabled cancer cell populations to better respond to multiple-drug treatments when compared to TGF-β-naïve cells. This observation is particularly interesting because previous works have already shown that TGF-β could induce drug resistance by activating anti-apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yao et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the fact that TGF-β could induce drug resistance by accelerating cancer evolution suggests that exposure to TGF-β could possibly provide a survival niche for cancer cells, allowing them to develop more stable genetic traits and increased malignancy.</p><p>In summary, our findings imply that the tumor microenvironment and gene regulatory networks could generate phenotypic diversity, including cells defined by a CD44+/CD24− state, enabling the development of novel, heritable genotypic profiles that could be selected for. Therefore, our findings could unify the non-genetic (Lamarckian) and mutation-driven (Darwinian) mechanisms that have been used to explain tumor adaptability and drug resistance.

The latter are derived from H1650 cells and harbor both phenotypic characteristics (i.e., epithelial to mesenchymal transition, increased metastatic capacity, motility, invasion and resistance to drug treatment) and molecular characteristics (i.e., increased surface expression of CD44 and decreased expression of CD24, constitutive activation of the TGF-β axis, and autocrine secretion of IL-6) of CD44+/CD24− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yao et al., 2010</xref>). H1650 and H1650-M3 cells were infected with a retroviral shRNA library that was previously constructed in the pSM1 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paddison et al., 2004</xref>). This library consists of 28,000 sequence-verified shRNAs designed to target approximately 9,000 genes that have been implicated in tumorigenesis. Each shRNA is linked to a unique 60-nucleotide sequence (its DNA ‘barcode’) that can be used to monitor relative frequencies of individual shRNAs in complex populations over time. Infected cells were grown, after which the representation of individual shRNAs was determined using barcode microarray analysis. DNA was extracted, amplified and hybridized on custom-made microarrays. In the context of our drop-out screen, the decreased abundance of a particular shRNA in the pool indicates that that shRNA is targeting a gene that is essential for proliferation and/or survival. An outline of the experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>. We found that 135 shRNAs reached a p-value of less than 0.5 and had reduced representations of more than 1-fold in H1650-M3 cells compared with H1650 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Among the top shRNAs selectively depleted in the CD44+/CD24− H1650-M3 cells, we identified shRNAs targeting IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This finding is consistent with previous reports (both from our group and others) indicating that the IL-6 axis is required for the survival of cells in a CD44+/CD24− state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marotta et al., 2011</xref>).

Mutations in or downregulation of the expression of this gene is associated with predisposition to cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ford et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miki et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thompson et al., 1995</xref>). <italic>ORC5L</italic> encodes one of the six subunits that form the origin recognition complex (ORC) that is essential for the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. In addition, ORC5L has been shown to be involved in other processes such as transcriptional gene silencing and sister chromatid cohesion in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suter et al., 2004</xref>). ERCC8 is part of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, a complex system that eliminates a broad spectrum of structural DNA lesions, including ultraviolet-induced pyrimidine dimers, chemical adducts and DNA cross-links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reardon and Sancar, 2005</xref>). RPA2 is one of the three components of a protein complex involved in DNA replication, DNA repair and recombination. Interestingly, RPA2 phosphorylation is observed after the exposure of cells to ionizing radiation (IR) and other DNA-damaging agents, which suggests that the modified RPA2 protein participates in the regulation of DNA repair and/or DNA replication after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zou et al., 2006</xref>). When DNA replicative polymerases stall at sites of DNA lesion, translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases such as POLS are recruited. POLS is also reported to be involved in cohesion at the replication fork in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Christman, 2001</xref>). Replication factor C3 (RFC3) has been shown to be part of multiple protein complexes that have distinct functions. In conjunction with RFC1, RFC2, RFC4, and RFC5, it forms a heteropentameric protein complex that is required for the loading of PCNA onto DNA at template-primer junctions and for the polymerase switch between DNA polα and DNA polδ. As part of a complex that contains the RAD17 subunit, it regulates DNA damage checkpoints; in a complex with the CTF18 subunit, it is necessary for sister chromatid cohesion; whereas in a complex with ATAD5, it aids fork stalling recovery and DNA DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mayer et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The identification of these genes in our drop-out screen was of particular interest as it indicated possible phenotype/cell state dependencies. As a first step to validating these findings, independent siRNAs were used to silence the expression of <italic>IL-6, BRCA1, ORC5L, RFC3, POLS, ERCC8</italic> and <italic>RPA2</italic> in H1650-M3 and H1650 cells, as well as in seven additional tumor-derived cell lines characterized by low (A549, MCF7 and BT474) or high (NCI-H23, PC9, MDA-MB-435S and MDA-MB-231) content of CD44+/CD24− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, we observed that tumor-derived cell lines that had a high content of CD44+/CD24− cells were more sensitive to the inactivation of these genes.</p><p>Many studies have shown that stochastic, non-genetic processes can drive the acquisition of phenotypic differences among cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>). This phenomenon is also evident in CD44+/CD24− cells. As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gupta et al. (2011</xref>), cancer cells grown in a uniform tissue culture <italic>in vitro</italic> microenvironment, when separated on the basis of the CD44 and CD24 cell surface markers, return to their original equilibrium proportion over a relatively short period of time.</p><p>Therefore, to determine whether the selective vulnerabilities that we identified in our screen also typified stochastically generated CD44+/CD24− cells, we extended our analysis to four pairs of tumor-derived (CD44+/CD24−)<sup>lo</sup> cell lines that were FACS-sorted on the basis of their surface expression of CD44 and CD24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Overall, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, we observed that the knockdown of the genes we identified in our original drop-out screen resulted in higher lethality in cells that reside in a CD44+/CD24− state compared to cells of other immune types.</p><p>Cancer cells harbor many genetic alterations that, while important for tumorigenesis, can render them vulnerable to the loss of function of only one additional gene. To exclude the possibility that the selective vulnerabilities we observed in CD44+/CD24− cells were not due to a concealed genetic mutation but instead to an intrinsic property of the CD44+/CD24− state, we generated multiple single cell-derived cell lines from the H1650 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Within these isogenic cell lines, we then compared, at early passages, the effect of <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>ORC5L</italic>, <italic>RFC3</italic>, <italic>POLS</italic>, <italic>ERCC8</italic> and <italic>RPA2</italic> knockdown in FACS-sorted CD44+/CD24− cells and in cells of other immune types. Consistent with our previous data, we observed a decrease in the representation of CD44+/CD24− cells in the H1650 isogenic cell lines (H1650-Isg-C, -Isg-D6 and -Isg-E4) upon silencing of the indicated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>The decrease in the number of CD44+/CD24− cells was not due to inter-conversion of cell states or a decrease in cell proliferation; rather, it was the result of increased lethality in the CD44+/CD24− cell populations upon silencing of the indicated genes.

Consequently, following a Darwinian model of cancer evolution, the transition of cancer cells into a CD44+/CD24− state or exposure to TGF-β leads to an increased adaptability to any given perturbation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21615.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21615.029</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21615-fig7-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig7s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21615.030</object-id><label>Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>A549 cells undergo changes in the surface expression of CD44 and CD24 before, during and after exposure to TGF-β.</title><p>The chart depicts the percentage of of A549 cells in the CD44+/CD24− state and the CD44−/ CD24+ state, before, during and post exposure to TGF-β.

In this experiment, the number of colonies that could survive the drug treatment was in fact consistently and significantly higher for A549-3w△ and A549-6w△ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>In principle, the increased adaptability that we observed in A549-3w△ and A549-6w△ cells upon exposure to high drug concentrations could be explained by the selection of a particular clonal population during TGF-β treatment. If this were the case, cells that were resistant to one drug would be equally resistant to the other drug treatments. But when we tested the sensitivity of tunicamycin-resistant clones to tunicamycin and taxol, we observed that these cells retained resistance to tunicamycin but were still sensitive to taxol. This result indicated that any particular clonal population was not selected but rather presented the possibility that their resistance was due to diverse molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Whole genome sequencing of cisplatin-resistant clones further supported this likelihood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Individual malignant cells within a tumor can possess a wide variety of traits (e.g., affecting growth, metabolism, motility, morphology, stress responses, etc.) that could ultimately impact the progression and recurrence of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greaves and Maley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almendro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burrell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kreso and Dick, 2014</xref>). The acquisition of these distinct features may result from genetic mutations and/or non-genetic determinants, such as the fluctuation among different cell states resulting from epigenetic/stochastic mechanisms or exposure to cues present in the micro-environment.</p><p>Here, we have shown that cells that reside in a CD44+/CD24− state are characterized by intrinsic defects in their abilities to repair DNA DSBs, leading to both augmented genetic instability and clonal diversity. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the oscillation between different cell states is not ‘genetically’ neutral. Instead, much like stress-induced mutagenesis, the oscillation between cell states can both promote the acquisition of new mutations and increase the total phenotypic and genomic diversity of a cancer population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ponder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gutierrez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fitzgerald et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the CD44+/CD24− state not only can serve as a substrate for but also can spur tumor evolution by promoting continued acquisition of genetic diversity.</p><p>When we consider that cancer cells within a tumor can die, proliferate, enter dormancy and/or exhaust their long-term clonal growth, then therapy failure and reoccurrence should be attributed not only to the acquisition of new mutations, but also to the surviving cells’ ability to propagate clonally. Consequently, the tumor cells contributing to recurrence must have regenerative potential and behave like cancer stem cells. In light of these considerations, the fact that CD44+/CD24− cells have self-renewal capabilities and have been referred to as ‘cancer stem cells’ is particularly captivating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hajj et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korkaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>). Another interesting feature of CD44+/CD24− cells is their general sturdiness and ability to survive exposure to lethal stimuli when compared to cells in other cell states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yao et al., 2010</xref>). As noted above, CD44+/CD24− cells express higher levels of genes that are known to protect cells from pro-apoptotic stimuli, including <italic>BCL-2</italic>, <italic>BCL-XL</italic> and <italic>MCL-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keitel et al., 2014</xref>). It is, therefore, tempting to propose that the transition of cancer cells into a CD44+/CD24− state could provide not only a small sub-population of tumor cells that can withstand and survive an initial destructive drug attack, but also the means to accumulate new genetic mutations that will further increase their fitness, ultimately allowing their growth and expansion even in the presence of a drug.</p><p>Our data indicated that TGF-β-mediated signaling is both necessary and sufficient to reduce the expression of HDR genes and to increase both CNA and the genetic heterogeneity of cancer cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). TGF-β is not only produced by CD44+/CD24− cells but it is among the many factors that mediate the communication between the cancer cells and their surrounding stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Massagué, 2008</xref>). Hence, our findings are particularly exciting because, in principle, they could provide additional support for the role of the tumor microenvironment in shaping tumor fitness. This could be especially relevant in the case of chronic inflammatory conditions and current cancer treatments, as both have been shown to increase TGF-β levels in tissues. Consequently, we can view chemotherapy regimens as double-edged swords. While they can kill cancer cells by inducing inflammation and TGF-β, they can also spur cancer cell evolution and paradoxically contribute to drug resistance. In other words, as noted by Dr Huang in one of his current review articles, our observations may echo Nietzsche’s classic statement: ‘What does not kill me, makes me stronger’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pisco and Huang, 2015</xref>). This could be particular relevant when designing cancer treatments because the progression-stimulating effects of a therapy could shape the behavior of the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pisco and Huang, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Whereas exposure to TGF-β in malignant cells often elicits pro-tumorigenic activities, in non-transformed cells, it can instead induce cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis through a p53-, p21- and p16-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Massagué, 2008</xref>). As persistent DSB could elicit these same effects, the downregulation of DNA-repair genes and the consequent induction of DNA damage by TGF-β in non-transformed cells could be part of the tumor-suppressor activities of TGF-β. As often is the case in cancer, a mechanism that has been implemented during evolution to protect tissue homeostasis could become hijacked by cancer cells to promote their survival. In this regard, the observation that the p53 tumor suppressor network is disabled in cancer cells is particularly interesting.</p><p>TGF-β plays a role not only in the context of tumorigenesis but also during development and in adult organism by regulating tissue-injury responses, adaptive and innate immune responses, tissue homeostasis and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Massagué and Gomis, 2006</xref>). The possibility that TGF-β could impair DNA-damage responses not only in the context of cancer cells but also in normal somatic cells is intriguing. This, in fact, could provide a means to activate a tumor suppressor network that is based on DNA-damage responses. Consequently, TGF-β=mediated impaired HDR could be part of an intrinsic cell mechanism that balances cell proliferation in tissues. On the other hand, it could also be possible that when DNA-damage-repair mechanisms are dimmed, the genetic diversity of cells in tissues is increased. Herein, inhibition of HDR by TGF-β could provide a means to increase the heterogeneity of cells within tissues during development. This phenomenon could be important in the context of organs or tissues in which diversity could increase functionality as, for example, in the case of immune cells or neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rehen et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2005</xref>). Interestingly in this regard, recent data have indicated that certain somatic cells are not genetically uniform but are characterized by different ploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duncan et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2012</xref>).</p><p>HDR-mediated repair is also utilized by viruses and transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yant and Kay, 2003</xref>). Hence, the downregulation of component of this DNA-repair pathway by TGF-β could be part of innate mechanisms that limit the reactivation of transposable elements and viral integration.</p><p>Notably, some reports have illuminated the possible role of TGF-β in regulating the expression and/or activities of DNA-repair genes. Similar to our observations, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanamoto et al., 2002</xref>) showed TGF-β-dependent downregulation of Rad51 and decreased DNA -epair efficiency in Mv1Lu lung epithelial cells treated with TGF-β. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al. (2014</xref>) reported that TGF-β regulates the expression and/or activity of <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>ATM</italic> and <italic>MSH2</italic>. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glick et al. (1996</xref>) reported that mouse keratinocytes deficient in TGF-β show a significant increase in gene amplification in response to the drug PALA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kirshner et al. (2006</xref>) also showed that TGF-β signaling inhibition attenuates the function of ATM under stress (ROS stimulation), thus impeding the response to DNA damage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wiegman et al. (2007</xref>) provided evidence that TGF-β can stimulate ATM and p53 phosphorylation in primary irradiated cells in a Smad-independent pathway. Our multi-faceted approaches and data gathering greatly expand upon this existing body of evidence and strongly indicate that TGF-β plays a broader role in decreasing the expression of DNA-repair genes, contributing to CNA accumulation and the clonal diversity of cancer cell populations. As a possible explanation for the differences observed across the studies mentioned here, we noted that those indicating that TGF-β promotes DNA-damage-repair responses were conducted under stress conditions (i.e., PALA treatment, irradiation or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment) and in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and did not distinguish between the effect of TGF-β on these experimental conditions (i.e., on ROS scavengers) and a direct effect on DNA repair. Our findings are also in accordance with a recent review on the implications of stress-induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fitzgerald et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our data strongly indicate that the transition into a CD44+/CD24− cell state can promote intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity, spur tumor evolution and increase tumor fitness. These findings have important prognostic and therapeutic implications and speak strongly to the need to target CD44+/CD24− populations in tumors. In this regard, the observation that the decreased expression of HDR genes in CD44+/CD24− cells comes at the expense of increased dependency on other DNA-repair components is particularly notable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). As some of these genes are potentially druggable, our studies could apprise the development of novel therapeutic options to ameliorate the outcome of cancer based on targeting the processes of cancer evolution, instead of targeting the cancer evolution products.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>A549 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0023">CVCL_0023</ext-link>), H1650 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1483">CVCL_1483</ext-link>), HCC4006 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1269">CVCL_1269</ext-link>), H23 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1547">CVCL_1547</ext-link>), BT-474 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0179">CVCL_0179</ext-link>), MDA-MB-231 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0062">CVCL_0062</ext-link>), MDA-MB-435S (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0622">CVCL_0622</ext-link>) and NCI-H23 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1547">CVCL_1547</ext-link>) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection repository (ATCC, Manassas, Virginia).

Then, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pDR-GFP (Addgene) or 2 μg of pCBASce-I (Jasin Lab) or both the plasmids for 6 hr; subsequently, transfection media were removed and cells were grown in media with vehicle (DMSO) or TGF-β (1 ng/ml each of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2) for 3 days. Cells were then harvested and subjected to FACS analysis. 20,000 cells were analysed for each sample replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Generation of isogenic clones</title><p>H1650 cells were serially diluted in 96 wells such that one well contains one cell. They were then grown for 2 months before the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Single nuclei sorting (SNS)</title><p>To perform SNS, cells from culture were stained with antibodies against CD44 and CD24 or nuclei were isolated from cells in culture and stained with 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). We use FACS to gate a desired population of cells (for antibody-stained cells , we gated CD44−/CD24+ and CD44+/ CD24−) or nuclei (by total DNA content) and deposited desired cells/nuclei singly into 96-well plates. For sorting cells from tumor, we stained a single-cell suspension derived from a tumor with CD45, CD31, EpCAM, CD44 and CD24 antibodies. We gated the CD45−/ CD31−/ EpCAM <sup>mid/high</sup> population and then gated the desired CD44−/CD24+ and CD44+/ CD24− from the EpCAM <sup>mid/high</sup> population. After WGA using Sigma GenomePlex, sonication was performed to create free DNA ends without WGA adapters and then we constructed libraries for 76-bp, single-end sequencing using one lane of an Illumina GA2 flow cell per nucleus. For each nucleus, we typically achieve at least 9 million (mean 59.042 million, s.e.m. 60,328, n = 5,200) uniquely mapping reads using the Bowtie alignment software. These sequences cover approximately 6% (mean 5.95%, s.e.m. 0.229, n = 5,200) of the genome and are used to count sequence reads in 50,000 variable bins. The bin counts are segmented using a KS statistic and then used to calculate integer copy number profiles. Neighbor-joining trees are constructed both from the integer profiles and from the chromosome breakpoint patterns of each cell to infer evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Single-cell sequencing data analysis using Ginkgo</title><p>The copy-number profiles, dendrograms and heatmaps of single cells were generated using Ginkgo, a visual analytics tool for the analysis of single-cell copy-number variations. Ginkgo automatically corrects for known biases in single-cell data and generates copy number profiles for each cell. To generate copy number profiles, we used Ginkgo with the the following parameters: variable length 500 kb bins simulated using 101 bp reads mapped with bowtie, cell segmented independently with normalized read counts and all bad bins masked. In order to cluster cells to generate dendrograms and heat maps, we using ward linkage and euclidian distance metrics. Quantification of DNA joint points (referred to as ‘breakpoints’ in the Ginkgo website) was done by extracting the breakpoint counts for each cell from the ‘Breakpoints’ file under Ginkgo’s ‘Download processed data tab’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Drug adaptability assay</title><p>Twenty-five thousand cells were plated in each well of a six-well plate and treated with either 3.2 µM tunicamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 1.6 µM epitaxol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or 3.2 µM etoposide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 days. In another assay, 12,000 cells were plated in a six-well plate; after the cells formed small colonies with ~10 cells/ colony, they were treated with 3.2 µM tunicamycin for 3 days followed by either tunicamycin or epitaxol (1.6 uM) treatment for 3 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Patient study details</title><p>The collection of human lung tissue samples and blood for this study was covered by Huntington Hospital/Northwell Health IRB #14–496 (PI V Singh; approval date 11/14/14). The samples were acquired from patients already undergoing thoracic procedures (e.g. surgical tumor resection or biopsy) at Huntington Hospital. All study participants provided informed consent for the use of their lung tissue and blood for research purposes. Participants were informed of study aims, the potential risks and benefits of participation, and that any discoveries facilitated by the analysis of their tissues might be published.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see from the reviewers' reports, there are differing opinions to what extent this manuscript presents substantial novelty, in how far the previous literature has been properly credited, and in how far this is a logical extension of previous research by your lab and other labs. In fact, this manuscript is presented as if all findings are new, and only in the second to last paragraph are previous observations mentioned &quot;in passing&quot;. While we appreciate the logical flow of the experiments and how you came to the important conclusions based on the data provided, the manuscript would come over much better if you present right upfront what has already been learnt from previous publications, so that you and the reader can then better appreciate the novelty. This relates to previous relevant observations linking e.g. TGF-b signaling to increased chemoresistance, or TGF-b signaling to impaired DNA repair, or CSCs to DNA repair, etc. We do, however, fully appreciate the overall novelty and importance.</p><p>There were also comments that need to be experimentally addressed. Specifically:</p><p>It feels somewhat uncomfortable using only LY2157299 as TGF-b inhibitor, since it does have other signaling kinase targets besides the type I TGF-b receptor. Considering the central role of this aspect in the manuscript, further validation using another (more specific) TGF-b signaling inhibitor or neutralizing TGF-b antibodies would help. Even though LY2157299 is clinically under evaluation as galunisertib, further substantiation of specific TGF-b signaling would provide confidence.</p><p>The DR-GFP reporter system is used in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref> and supplementary data). These cells are not used in other experiments with major findings in this manuscript, are from mesenchymal origin, whereas the others are carcinomas, and have impaired TGF-b signaling. It would provide confidence to have this assay done in H1650 cells.</p><p>Additional comments to be addressed are:</p><p>The title and/or Abstract should provide a clear indication of the biological system under investigation (i.e., species name or broader taxonomic group, if appropriate). Please revise your title and/or Abstract with this advice in mind.</p><p>In all figures, please explain the error bars – what do they represent and if variance, how many experiments. Are the ones on the data from two experiments a range?</p><p>Throughout the paper where CNAs are discussed, please do not refer to &quot;DNA breaks&quot; or &quot;break points&quot;. What is being quantifying is novel DNA junctions or join points. &quot;Breaks&quot; implies a mechanism of genome rearrangement that the authors do not know has occurred-one using DNA breakage. Models like microhomology-mediated replicative template switching and MMBIR are dominating modern understanding of CNA formation, and these are not break and join models.
