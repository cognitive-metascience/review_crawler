Using TCR alpha and beta repertoire sequencing for T-cell subsets, as well as single-cell RNAseq and TCRseq, we track the concentrations and phenotypes of individual T-cell clones in response to primary and secondary yellow fever immunization — the model for acute infection in humans — showing their large diversity. We confirm the secondary response is an order of magnitude weaker, albeit ∼10 days faster than the primary one. Estimating the fraction of the T-cell response directed against the single immunodominant epitope, we identify the sequence features of TCRs that define the high precursor frequency of the two major TCR motifs specific for this particular epitope. We also show the consistency of clonal expansion dynamics between bulk alpha and beta repertoires, using a new methodology to reconstruct alpha-beta pairings from clonal trajectories.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>yellow fever</kwd><kwd>TCR</kwd><kwd>single-cell</kwd><kwd>vaccination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Consolidator Grant no 724208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mora</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name><name><surname>Walczak</surname><given-names>Aleksandra M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006769</institution-id><institution>Russian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15-15-00178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Minervina</surname><given-names>Anastasia A</given-names></name><name><surname>Pogorelyy</surname><given-names>Mikhail V</given-names></name><name><surname>Komech</surname><given-names>Ekaterina A</given-names></name><name><surname>Karnaukhov</surname><given-names>Vadim K</given-names></name><name><surname>Lebedev</surname><given-names>Yuri B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002261</institution-id><institution>Russian Foundation for Basic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18-29-09132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mamedov</surname><given-names>Ilgar Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002261</institution-id><institution>Russian Foundation for Basic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19-54-12011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mamedov</surname><given-names>Ilgar Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Exc2167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bacher</surname><given-names>Petra</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosati</surname><given-names>Elisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Franke</surname><given-names>Andre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4096610003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosati</surname><given-names>Elisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012190</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>075-15-2019-1789</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chudakov</surname><given-names>Dmitriy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-throughput clonal tracking quantifies intrinsic differences between primary and secondary T cell response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>T-cells play a crucial role in the immune response to pathogens by mediating antibody formation and clearance of infected cells, and by defining an overall response strategy. The specificity of T-cells is determined by the T-cell receptor (TCR), a heterodimer of alpha and beta protein chains. Genes for alpha and beta chains assemble in a random process of somatic V(D)J-recombination, which leads to a huge variety of possible TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murugan et al., 2012</xref>). The resulting diverse naïve repertoire contains T-cell clones that recognize epitopes of yet unseen pathogens, and can participate in the immune response to infection or vaccination. One of the best established models of acute viral infection in humans is yellow fever (YF) vaccination. Yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated virus with a peak of viremia happening around day 7 after vaccine administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akondy et al., 2009</xref>). The dynamics of primary T-cell response was investigated by various techniques: cell activation marker staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kongsgaard et al., 2017</xref>), MHC multimer staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akondy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">James et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kongsgaard et al., 2017</xref>), high-throughput sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeWitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pogorelyy et al., 2018</xref>) and deuterium cell labelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akondy et al., 2017</xref>). Primary T-cell response sharply peaks around 2 weeks after YFV17D (vaccine strain of yellow fever virus) vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akondy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pogorelyy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">James et al., 2013</xref>). The immune response is very diverse and targets multiple epitopes inside the YF virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Melo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Co et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akondy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">James et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blom et al., 2013</xref>). An essential feature of effective vaccination is the formation of immune memory. Although most of the effector cells die shortly after viral clearance, YF-specific T-cells could be found in the blood of vaccinated individuals years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akondy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kongsgaard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">James et al., 2013</xref>) and even decades after vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fuertes Marraco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wieten et al., 2016</xref>). While the immune response to the primary vaccination has been much studied, there is only limited data on the response to the booster vaccination with YFV17D. Both T-cell activation marker staining and multimer staining show that the secondary response is much weaker than the primary one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kongsgaard et al., 2017</xref>), but their precise dynamics, diversity, and clonal structure are still unknown.</p><p>In summary, previous studies provide insight into the macroscopic features of the T-cell response, such as total frequency of T-cells with an activated phenotype, or T-cells specific to a particular viral epitope on different timepoints after vaccination. However, with recently developed methods it is now possible to uncover the microscopic structure of the primary and secondary immune response, such as the dynamics and phenotypes of distinct T-cell clones, as well as the receptor features that determine the recognition of epitopes.</p><p>TCR repertoire sequencing allows for longitudinally tracking individual clones of responding T-cells irrespective of their epitope specificity. Single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) enables simultaneous quantification of thousands of transcripts per cell for thousands of cells, providing an unbiased characterization of immune cell phenotype. Single-cell TCR sequencing produces paired αβ repertoire data, and thus could help discover conserved sequence motifs in one or both TCR chains. These motifs encode TCR structural features essential to antigen recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dash et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glanville et al., 2017</xref>). Information about complete TCR sequences allows homological modeling of TCR structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schritt et al., 2019</xref>), which can be used for binding prediction with protein-protein docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pierce and Weng, 2013</xref>). We combine longitudinal TCR alpha and beta repertoire sequencing, scRNAseq, scTCRseq, TCR structure modelling and TCR-pMHC docking simulations to get a comprehensive picture of primary and secondary T-cell response to the yellow fever vaccine – the in vivo model of acute viral infection in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Secondary T-cell response to the YFV17D vaccine is weaker but faster than the primary response</title><p>We sequenced TCR alpha and TCR beta repertoires of bulk peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and different T-cell subsets at multiple timepoints before and after primary and booster vaccination against yellow fever of donor M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In accordance with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akondy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kongsgaard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pogorelyy et al., 2018</xref>), we show that during the primary response T-cells expanded intensely (with cumulative increase of about 950-fold) within 2–3 weeks after YF immunization. They subsequently contracted, but still exceeded baseline frequency 18 months afterwards.</p><p>We then tracked these YF-responding clonotypes identified during primary immunization before and after the second vaccination 18 months after the first one. The cumulative frequency of these clonotypes increased ≈2.5-fold at the peak of the response after the second immunization, reaching 0.5% of the TCR repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, blue curve). The secondary response was weaker, but happened much faster than the primary one, with a peak frequency of responding clonotypes occurring on day 5 instead of day 15 after vaccination. To check if there was also recruitment of new clonotypes in the secondary response, we applied edgeR to timepoints from the second immunization only. Although we identified 73 additional responding clonotypes, their impact on the magnitude of the secondary response was negligible and we did not use them for further analyses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Backtracking of these novel clonotypes showed that they also slightly expanded during the primary response but not enough enough to pass our significance and magnitude thresholds. In summary, we found no evidence of substantial recruitment of naive clones in the response to the booster vaccination.</p><p>Using sequenced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets, we attributed a CD4 or CD8 phenotype to each responding clone (see Materials and methods) and thus could track these two subsets separately. After booster immunization in donor M1, YF-responding CD4+ cells peaked earlier (day 5 vs day 10) and expanded much more (≈8 times vs. ≈1.5 times) than CD8+ T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, green and pink curves). During primary immunization, the difference in response dynamics between CD4+ and CD8+ subsets was less prominent, as they both peaked on day 15. However, by day 21 CD4+ responding clones contracted much more (to 43.6% of peak frequency) than CD8+ clonotypes (87% of peak frequency). These observations confirm previous reports that the CD4 response precedes the CD8 response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blom et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Secondary response to booster vaccination after 18 months and after 30 years have similar features</title><p>To see how long-lived T-cell memory response to YF can be, we recruited an additional donor (P30), who received the first YF-vaccine 30 years earlier and has not been in YF endemic areas for at least 28 years. From this donor, we collected bulk PBMCs and several T-cell subsets before and after booster immunization. Both the numbers of responding clonotypes (204 for TCR beta and 201 for TCR alpha) and the maximum frequency at the peak of the response (0.69%) were much lower than for any primary vaccinee both from this and other studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Most of these clonotypes were low frequency or undetected before the second immunization, although a few were sampled in the memory repertoire prior to vaccination.</p><p>The response to the booster vaccination was characterized by a large expansion between days 0 and 5, and a peak on day 10, for both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Overall the dynamics and the magnitude of this response was very similar to the response to the booster vaccination after 18 months we observed in donor M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that protection against the virus was maintained even after 30 years.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Diversity of clonal time traces in primary and secondary responses</title><p>Our approach allows us to estimate the contribution of individual clones to the total response. We already showed that the overall response strength to secondary immunization was an order of magnitude lower compared to the primary response. However, several clones showed remarkable expansion rates and peak frequencies, comparable to the ones observed in primary immunization. Such clones were observed in both donors upon secondary immunization after 18 months and 30 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We traced each single clone during primary and secondary response in donor M1.

By contrast, in our sample we could re-identify 96% of CD4+ and 88% of CD8+ clones that responded to the primary immunization in at least one sample after the booster immunization. This suggests that practically all the diversity of the responding repertoire is maintained in memory. The larger fraction of re-identified YF-responding clones in comparison to previous work may be explained by the sampling depth. Sequencing more T-cells will lead to the re-identification of even more YF-responding clonotypes.</p><p>We then wanted to characterize how these persistent clonotypes responded to the booster vaccination. Interestingly, we found that the largest YF-specific CD8+ clones did not expand in response to the booster vaccine. Instead, the most expanded clonotypes were rare prior to the booster immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The situation was different for CD4+ cells: both high and low-frequency CD4+ clones expanded in response to the booster immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>The specific features of clonal trajectories shared by YF-responding clones make it possible to distinguish them from non-expanding clones, using unsupervised clustering (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4AB</xref> and Materials and methods). This method shows good concordance with edgeR and works also without biological replicates. In addition, we demonstrated that the heterogeneity of clonal trajectories could be leveraged to computationally pair alpha and beta chains from from bulk alpha and beta sequencing data, by exploiting the similarity of trajectories of alpha and beta clonotypes belonging to the same clone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref> and Materials and methods).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TCR sequencing shows the transition of clonotypes between memory subpopulations</title><p>Several studies have reported subsets of long-lived memory YF-specific T-cells, whose concentration remained stable for years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fuertes Marraco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akondy et al., 2017</xref>). It was shown that these long-lived memory cells are the progenies of effector cells, which divide vigorously during the peak of the response to the vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akondy et al., 2017</xref>). TCR sequences can be used as ‘barcodes’ to measure transitions between different memory subsets after YF immunization, defined by their surface markers revealed by flow cytometry.</p><p>We isolated with FACS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for the gating strategy) and sequenced TCR repertoires of 3 conventional T-cell memory subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fuertes Marraco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appay et al., 2008</xref>): effector memory (EM, CCR7-CD45RA-), effector memory re-expressing CD45RA (EMRA, CCR7-CD45RA+), and central memory (CM, CCR7+CD45RA-) on days 0, 15, 45, and 18 months after the primary vaccination of donor M1 and on days 0, 15, and 45 after the second vaccination of donor P30. On day 45 we also isolated and sequenced the repertoire of the recently described Tscm (T-cell stem cell-like memory) subset (CCR7+CD45RA+CD95+).</p><p>On day 0, the concentration of almost all YF-responding clonotypes was too low to be detected in any of these subpopulations. However, we were able to calculate the distribution of YF-responding clonotypes between these phenotypes after immunization. In agreement with previous studies the memory status of T-cell clones was tightly correlated with their CD4/CD8 status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sathaliyawala et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thome et al., 2014</xref>). The vast majority of CD4+ T-cells were distributed between EM and CM, with &lt;1% in EMRA, while CD8+ T-cell clones were predominantly found in EM and EMRA with ∼2% in CM. This difference also held for YF-responding clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). While for most CD8+ clonotypes in the total repertoire EM/EMRA phenotypes were stable between day 15 and day 45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,C</xref>), the distribution of CD8+ YF-responding clones between memory subsets was significantly shifted towards the EMRA phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This shift results from two processes: the rapid decay of EM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and the phenotype switch from EM to EMRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Almost all YF-responding CD8+ clones detected 18 months after the first immunization corresponded to the EMRA phenotype (among 71 clones found in more than three copies in bulk repertoire at day 0 before second vaccination, 41 were found only in the EMRA subset, four only in EM, and six in both). For CD4+ T-cells, we did not observe any trend in phenotype switching between days 15 and 45 after the vaccination. We hypothesize that switching from EM to CM phenotype was masked due to homing of CM cells to lymphoid organs, defined by the expression of the CCR7 chemokine receptor.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Distribution of clonotypes in memory subsets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Each color bar shows the estimated distribution of T-cell clones between memory subpopulations for a set of CD4+ (left panel) and CD8+ (right panel) clonotypes for donors M1 (top) and P30 (bottom) on day 15 and day 45.

To match single-cell gene expression data with measurements of clonotype concentrations obtained with TCRseq, we averaged mRNA counts over the all cells of the same clonotype, and repeated the differential gene expression analysis (see Materials and methods). We obtained two clusters of clonotypes with the same enriched genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) as observed for clusters of single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), confirming the association of phenotype and clonotype.

This result suggests that even for T-cells recognizing the same epitope, particular clones are linked to particular memory phenotype.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we applied high-throughput sequencing of TCR alpha and TCR beta repertoires to track T-cell immune response to primary and secondary immunization with yellow fever vaccine. This approach does not require previous knowledge of TCR specificity and thus allows us to quantify and compare the response of individual T-cell clones recognizing different epitopes on the same scale.</p><p>We found that up to 60% of all responding CD8+ T-cells were specific to a single immunodominant peptide. Several studies reported high precursor frequency of T-cells reactive to this epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bovay et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bovay et al. (2018)</xref> recently suggested that recognition of antigenic peptide through the germline-encoded CDR1 loop of the TRAV12 segment is one of the main reasons for high precursor frequency. This hypothesis is supported by our TCR structural modeling and TCR-pMHC docking simulations, as well as by the analysis of the NS4B-specific T-cell repertoire. We also identified an additional motif defined by TRAV27+TRBV9+ TCRs. It will be interesting to investigate if these two motifs differ in binding affinity or are susceptible to potential escape mutations that can appear in the antigenic peptide. Another question is how diverse is the level of clonal response to the YF vaccine in HLA-A02 negative donors, and what fraction of the response is directed towards the most immunodominant epitopes in the context of other HLA types.</p><p>Most previous studies focused on TCR beta repertoires, partially because the diversity of TCR beta is higher, making it a better marker for clonal tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2019</xref>). We found that TCR alpha may be used for clonal tracking as well, giving almost the same results as TCR beta in terms of the number of expanding clonotypes and their cumulative fractions on different timepoints. In the particular case of the response of HLA-A02 donors to the YF vaccine, the TCR alpha repertoire turned out to be even more informative, as T-cells responding to the immunodominant epitope predominantly use certain TRAV segments.</p><p>One of the major limitations of bulk TCR sequencing is that the resulting repertoires are unpaired, while TCR specificity in most cases is defined by the combination of alpha and beta chains. We show that the simultaneous sequencing of bulk alpha and beta repertoires performed on many timepoints allows us to make predictions on alpha-beta pairing. Even with the rise of single-cell sequencing, this method might still be of interest since most available single-cell platforms can only analyze limited numbers of 10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>5</sup> cells. In addition, these experiments are still expensive in comparison to the bulk TCR sequencing, which enables the profiling of millions of lymphocytes more cheaply.</p><p>We found that ≈ 90% clonotypes responding to primary immunization were present in peripheral blood 18 months after immunization. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akondy et al. (2017)</xref> showed using deuterium cell labeling that long-survived memory cells have a history of intense clonal expansion, and thus are likely to differentiate from effector cells after response.</p><p>Interestingly, we observed a very different response of CD4+ and CD8+ memory cells to the booster vaccination. It may be explained by differences in antigen presentation mechanisms: CD4+ T-cells may be activated well by antigen presenting cells phagocyting neutralized viral particles and presenting exogenous peptides on MHC-II complexes, while CD8+ memory cells can be more efficiently triggered by a productive viral infection resulting in the presentation of endogenously translated viral proteins on MHC-I. It was previously shown that the magnitude CD8 response depends on the viral load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akondy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>It will be interesting to perform a similar study in donors vaccinated with YF backbone chimeric vaccines, where genes from other viruses substitute some of the YFV17D genes. It was shown that preexisting anti-YF immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Monath et al., 2002</xref>) does not affect the formation of neutralizing antibodies to the novel virus. This finding suggests that not only efficient reactivation of existing CD4 memory but also the formation of CD4 responses to novel epitopes is possible during the booster with slightly different antigen.</p><p>We found that, while the overall secondary response to the vaccine was much smaller both in terms of clonal diversity and cumulative frequency, a few clones still undergo strong clonal expansion. This may be indirect evidence for the programmed proliferation hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moore et al., 2019</xref>) according to which a single encounter of a TCR with an antigen triggers several rounds of T-cell division. It was shown that the virus is undetectable in the peripheral blood after booster vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reinhardt et al., 1998</xref>), meaning that the amount of available antigen is much lower, and so is the number of encounters and responding clonotypes.</p><p>The transition between EM and EMRA phenotypes in CD8+ clones responding to yellow fever vaccine was previously measured using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wieten et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fuertes Marraco et al., 2015</xref>). Here we confirm these reports with high-throughput sequencing, using TCR as a barcode to mark cells of the same clonal lineage. Furthermore, we identified two distinct cytotoxic phenotypes in NS4B-specific T-cells 18 months after primary immunization. It is not clear why the distribution of clonotypes between two these phenotypes was biased. Since we performed scRNAseq of clonotypes specific to the single antigen, these differences might be either the consequence of different TCR affinity or some phenotypic heterogeneity present in the precursor cells. Additional experiments at later timepoints would be required to estimate the longevity of these clonotypes.</p><p>To summarize, we show that vaccination with YFV17D leads to the recruitment of a diverse repertoire of T-cells, which is then available as immune memory for the secondary response years after the immunization. Even T-cells with the same epitope specificity show several distinct motifs in TCR and have different memory phenotypes. Such heterogeneity of cells might be crucial for individual immune response robustness, underlying cross-reactive responses to similar viruses, and the possibility to escape mutants, which could be tested directly in future studies. However, this diverse T-cell response is strongly focused on single HLA-A02 restricted epitope. An interesting question is how many distinct foci of response exist in the human population with a variety of HLA-types; and how this diversity of individual responses contribute to the defense from the infection at the population level. Systematic studies of donors with different genetic backgrounds and corresponding immunodominant epitope-specific repertoires will be able to address this question.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-CD3-FITC (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>eBioscience</td><td>CAT# 11-0038-42</td><td>FACS (5 ul per test)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CD45RA-eFluor450 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>eBioscience</td><td>CAT# 48-0458-42</td><td>FACS (5 ul per test)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CCR7-AlexaFluor647 (Rat monoclonal)</td><td>BD Pharmingen</td><td>CAT# 560921</td><td>FACS (5 ul per test)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CD95-PE (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>eBioscience</td><td>CAT# 12-0959-42</td><td>FACS (5 ul per test)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CD3-eFluor450 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>eBioscience</td><td>CAT# 48-0038-42</td><td>FACS (5 ul per test)</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>HLA-A*0201 (LLWNGPMAV) dextramer</td><td>Immudex</td><td>CAT# WB3584</td><td>FACS (10 ul per test)</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial kit</td><td>Chromium Single Cell A Chip Kit</td><td>10x Genomics</td><td>CAT# 1000009</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial kit</td><td>Chromium Next GEM 5’ Library and Gel Bead Kit</td><td>10x Genomics</td><td>CAT# 1000014</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial kit</td><td>Chromium V(D)J Enrichment Kit, Human T Cell</td><td>10x Genomics</td><td>CAT# 1000005</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial kit</td><td>Chromium Single Cell 5’ Library Construction Kit</td><td>10x Genomics</td><td>CAT# 1000020</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial kit</td><td>Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit</td><td>10x Genomics</td><td>CAT# 120262</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial kit</td><td>Dynabeads CD4 Positive Isolation Kit</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>CAT# 11331D</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial kit</td><td>Dynabeads CD8 Positive Isolation Kit</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>CAT# 11333D</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Donors and blood samples</title><p>Blood samples were collected from two healthy donors (M1 male age 26, and P30 male age 39) on multiple timepoints before and after immunization with YFV17D vaccine.

Libraries for the fractions with low amount of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) were prepared using SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (TakaraBio). Libraries were sequenced on Illumina platform HiSeq 2500 with 2×100 bp sequencing length or NovaSeq 2×150 bp sequencing length. Parallel single-cell alpha/beta TCR and 5’ gene expression sequencing was performed using 10x Genomics Kits (Chromium Single Cell A Chip Kit, Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ Library and Gel Bead Kit, Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit, Human T Cell, Chromium Single Cell 5’ Library Construction Kit, Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina platform HiSeq 3000 with 2×150 bp sequencing length.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Repertoire data analysis</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Raw data preprocessing</title><p>Raw repertoire sequencing data were preprocessed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pogorelyy et al.

In brief, for each timepoint, we used two biological replicates of bulk PBMC. TMM-normalization and trended dispersion estimates were performed according to edgeR manual. We used an exact test based on the quantile-adjusted conditional likelihood (qCML) to identify clonotypes significantly expanded between pairs of timepoints. A clonotype with FDR adjusted p-value &lt;0.01 (exact qCML-based test) was considered YF-responding if its log<sub>2</sub>-fold change estimate log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 5 between any pairs of timepoints from 0 to the peak of the primary response (day 15). The usage of log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt;5 threshold in addition to p-value threshold is important to filter statistically significant but small clonal expansions, which were previously shown to occur in healthy donors in the absense of vaccination on the timescale of one week, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pogorelyy et al. (2018)</xref>. The list of YF-responding clonotypes identified in alpha and beta TCR repertoires of donors M1 and P30 are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>. CD4/CD8 in silico phenotyping was performed as suggested before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pogorelyy et al., 2018</xref>): for each clone from bulk PBMC repertoire we assign CD4 phenotype if it is more abundant in the sequenced CD4 repertoire and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Over 98% of clonotypes were found exclusively in CD4 or CD8 compartment. However, a small group of clonotypes (1.4% for TCR alpha and 0.14% for TCR beta for day 15 timepoint of donor M1) was present in both compartments in comparable frequencies. These clonotypes have significantly higher TCR generative probabilities than others (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, Mann Whitney U-test) and thus are likely to arise from convergent recombination of the same TCR chain in both compartments.</p><p>To quantify the magnitude of the response on each timepoint we inferred the fraction of YF-responding cells as the proportion of all αβT-cells. To estimate this quantity from TCR repertoire data, for each susbset of interest (CD4+, CD8+, or NS4B-specific YF-responding clonotypes) we calculate the cumulative frequency of these clonotypes in TCR repertoire of bulk PBMCs in each timepoint.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Identification of YF-responding clonotypes by Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</title><p>We chose clonotypes that appeared in the top 1000 most abundant clonotypes at any timepoint after primary immunization. For these clonotypes, we made matrices of frequencies on all timepoints after primary immunization. Before applying PCA to these matrices, each value was normalized by dividing on maximum frequency for this clonotype. For cluster identification, we used hierarchical clustering with average linkage on euclidean distances between clonotypes. The number of clusters was set to 2. This analysis was performed for both alpha and beta chains of donor M1. For the twin donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pogorelyy et al., 2018</xref>), only replicate F1 was used for expanded clones identification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Memory transition analysis</title><p>For this analysis, we used clonotypes that had at least 30 UMIs at day 45 after primary vaccination. The clonotype frequency in memory subset is multiplied by the number of cells obtained by FACS on this timepoint for this subset. Then adjusted frequencies are normalized across all subsets to get a partition of each TCR clonotypes across subsets. Obtained partitions were multiplied by the frequency of a clonotype in bulk at this timepoint to get the concentration of clonotypes with a particular memory phenotype in the bulk repertoire.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>Computational decontamination of NS4B-specific repertoire</title><p>Since FACS sorting is not precise, TCR repertoires of the population of interest often contains abundant clonotypes from the bulk population. To obtain a list of NS4B-specific TCRs we took clonotypes that were enriched (at least 10 times) in the A02-NS4B-dextramer positive fraction compared to A02-NS4B-dextramer negative fraction. We also discarded TCR clonotypes that were more abundant in CD4 than CD8 subpopulation on day 0 (as only CD8 cells should bind to A02 which is a MHC I allele). Although ∼30% of resulting unique NS4B-specific clonotypes overlapped with the list of significantly expanded clonotypes identified with edgeR, they corresponded to ∼90% of NS4B-specific T-cells.

For each α clonotype, we picked the five closest β clonotypes as candidate pairings. As a benchmark, we used two single-cell TCR sequencing (scTCRseq) experiments using the 10x Genomics platform and obtained paired repertoires for samples of bulk T-cells (CD3+) and YF epitope-specific T-cells (CD8+NS4B-dextramer+). Note that these two samples are very different in their clonal time traces: NS4B-specific clones show very active response dynamics, expanding and contracting in the course of primary and booster immunization, while the CD3+ T-cell sample corresponds to the most abundant clones in the repertoire, which are largely stable between timepoints. A αβTCR clonotype from 10x Genomics experiment was considered correctly paired from bulk TCRseq data using the algorithm if the correct TCR beta was present among the five most probable TCR beta sequences predicted for the TCR alpha of this clonotype. Out of the 62 NS4B-specific clonotypes sampled in the 10x Genomics experiment, we were able to computationally identify 41 correct pairs from the bulk TCRseq data.

We filtered out cells that had more than 2700 features or more than 8% of mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Feature expression measurements for each cell were normalized using default log-normalization in the Seurat package.

single-cell level&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Benjamin Chain (Reviewer #1); Philip Bradley (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and with the Reviewing Editor. Clearly, the study is interesting and worthy of publication, despite the limitation that it is based on only two individuals. However, the manuscript is poorly constructed, and hence very hard for a non-specialist to understand the message. Substantial revision and focusing are essential. Both reviewers have made these points in specific ways. Therefore, instead of a synthesised decision, both reviews are being provided in full below for ease of specific addressing to help you prepare a revised submission. The major issues raised by both reviewers must be substantively addressed in order to increase enthusiasm for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper contains a descriptive study of TCR sequencing and some single cell RNAseq on one primary, and two secondary responses to yellow fever vaccination in humans. There are definitely some interesting and intriguing observations here, although the study essentially remains a case-report, with many results supported by data from one single individual. How strongly these findings will generalise remains to be determined. The impact of the paper is weakened by a very loose and anecdotal writing style, and an attempt to include a large number of disparate findings. The paper could be much improved by more effort to clearly identify a small number of key messages and support them with data.</p><p>The authors focus on large clonal expansions (&gt;32 times frequency post-primary mmunisation) and show that the secondary response contains many fewer large clone expansions than the primary response. Interestingly, a large proportion of clones expanded in primary responses can be resampled in the secondary. Almost as an aside they claim they can pair α and β chains by timecourse similarity alone (but see comment below). I found the PCA analysis and the clone pairing extraneous to the message of the paper, and merely a distraction.</p><p>They next demonstrate that most YF-specific clones switch from EM to EMRA phenotype post immunisation. This is an intriguing observation, given that the bulk population of EM is much larger than the EMRA one, but this observation is not followed up at all. Strangely there are no CD8 CM cells. Next, the authors analyse TCRs specific to the immunodominant epitope, which they show accounts for 60% of the total number of CD8 clones responding in primary immunisation. Next the authors analyse the TCR sequences of the immunodominant epitope, which they demonstrate fall into at least two distinct clusters of sequences. They support their claim that the two sets of TCRs bind via different modes by using some homology modelling, although this is buried in the supplementaries, and it is not clear how much weight to give to these results. Finally the authors use sc RNAseq to look at these clones, and show that they are heterogeneous, and specific clones are biased towards specific phenotypes.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>I didn't follow exactly how the authors defined responding TCRs. They mention both a p value, and a cut-off of 32 fold enrichment. How are these related ?</p><p>The Y-axis in many panels is given as% YF_responding cells. This is very ambiguous – do they mean the fraction of cells which respond as a proportion of all cells ? Do all panels mean the same thing. This needs clarification.</p><p>In the section of TCR pairing, the authors state that they can correctly identify a large proportion of scTCRs using this approach on bulk sequences. But they also say, they pair each α with five nearest betas. So what do they mean by &quot;correct paring&quot;: one of the five they computationally pair is the correct pair as determined by scTCR ? This is all very unclear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript reports a detailed characterization of T cell responses to Yellow Fever vaccination in two individuals, one over the course of primary and secondary (after 18 months) vaccination, and one a secondary vaccination 30 years after initial vaccination. The main strengths of the study are (1) the detailed, longitudinal characterization of the TCR repertoires (unpaired α and β chain) in bulk PBMCs as well as sorted T cell subsets (&gt;15 time points over the two individuals), (2) bulk α/β and paired TCRseq data for T cells that bind an immunodominant A*02:01-restricted YFV epitope (NS4B), (3) paired scTCRseq and scRNAseq data for several thousand T cells positive for NS4B from one of the donors prior to their secondary vaccination, and (4) new and interesting analytical approaches for TCR repertoire analysis (time-course clustering, computational α/β pairing, scRNAseq profiles of T cell clonotypes). In my view the main weaknesses are the small number of donors and the mostly confirmatory nature of the biological results in light of the existing literature on YFV vaccination. Nonetheless I am enthusiastic about the study: the repertoire and RNAseq data will benefit others working in this area, and the new methods look like they will have a wide range of applications. I have a few questions/clarifications/potential typos, as detailed below.</p><p>– Clonotypes were assigned CD4/CD8 according based on the subset in which they had the highest frequency: did any clones span both the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8 compartments, robustly (in terms of UMI counts)? Would you attribute these to sorting noise?</p><p>– My read of the paper is that for donor M1, YFV-responding clonotypes were defined in terms of their counts in the primary response. These clonotypes were then used to assess the magnitude of the secondary response. This begs the question of whether any new clonotypes were recruited into the secondary response. Are any new YFV-responding clonotypes identified by edgeR in the secondary response? Or are the frequency changes just too low to call new responding clones?</p><p>– How many of the NS4B-specific clones were called as YFV-responding by edgeR? Were there &quot;genuine&quot; NS4B-binders that did not expand? And did they have any special features? If so, were TRAV12 and TRAV27 NS4B+ clonotypes equally likely to be called as responding by edgeR?</p><p>– &quot;Overall the dynamics and the magnitude of this response was very similar to the response to the booster vaccination after 18 months we observed in donor M1&quot;, maybe this is splitting hairs but to me the P30 response looks a little slower. Is this true/significant?</p><p>– I'm a little confused by the memory subset sorting. Where would plain old T effector cells show up here? How would they be distinguished from the memory subsets? Is there also CD45RO data? Or is there an assumption about composition based on the timepoints analyzed?</p><p>– &quot;Interestingly, we found that the largest YF-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> clones did not expand in response to the booster vaccine. Instead, the most expanded clonotypes were rare prior to the booster immunization (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A).&quot;, I think this should be &quot;Figure 2—figure supplement 3B&quot; if you are really talking about CD8 here.</p><p>– &quot;While for most CD8<sup>+</sup> clonotypes in the total repertoire EM/EMRA phenotypes were stable between day 15 and day 45 (Figure 3B, and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, C), the distribution of CD8<sup>+</sup> YF-responding clones between memory subsets was significantly shifted towards the EMRA phenotype (Figure 3C).&quot; I don't see &quot;CD8&quot; in Figure 3B/C or Figure 3—figure supplement 2 (figure or legends), are there labels missing? Or are Figure 3C/Figure 3—figure supplement 2 actually PBMC?</p><p>– Figure 3A, legend, typo: &quot;EM (CD45RA-CCR7+)&quot;</p><p>– &quot;Prior to dimensionality reduction, data were scaled so that the mean expression was 1 and the variance equals to 1&quot;, I think maybe this should say &quot;mean expression was 0&quot;?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53704.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper contains a descriptive study of TCR sequencing and some single cell RNAseq on one primary, and two secondary responses to yellow fever vaccination in humans.

But there are some clonotypes that are present in both CD4 and CD8 compartments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This clonotypes can be further divided into a very small group of clonotypes that are significantly enriched in one of the subsets (more than 10-fold, shown in blue on the figure) and clonotypes that are present in both subsets at similar frequencies (&lt;10-fold difference in frequency, pink). We believe that the first ones represent contamination during isolation of CD4 and CD8 T cells, and our procedure provides correct phenotyping for this group.</p><p>The second group of clonotypes is much more interesting, because it consists of clonotypes with high generation probability (Pgen, as calculated by OLGA, Sethna et al., 2019), which convergently recombined in both subsets (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, right panel). This effect is much more prominent in α chains, due to their lower diversity. In our analysis, these clonotypes will be attributed to CD4/CD8 compartment randomly, but as they represent only a tiny fraction of all clonotypes we deliberately ignored it.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53704-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We expanded Materials and methods section (subsection “Identification of changed clonotypes by edgeR”) to explain this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– My read of the paper is that for donor M1, YFV-responding clonotypes were defined in terms of their counts in the primary response.

We were able to identify 91 YF-responding TCR β clones using second immunization, 18 of which intersect with the ones identified during the primary response. We were able to identify 103 YF-responding TCR α clones using second immunization, 30 of which intersect with the ones identified during the primary response. However, the contribution of these 73 additional clonotypes to the magnitude of response was low (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 1), and some of them also clearly expanded to the first immunization, but were not called significant by edgeR due to their low peak abundance. To summarize, we have no evidence of recruitment of naive clones during secondary response and no strong novel clonal expansions.</p><p>We expanded the main text to include this new results (paragraph three of subsection “Secondary T-cell response to the YFV17D vaccine is weaker but faster than the primary response”) and added a new figure to visualize them (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How many of the NS4B-specific clones were called as YFV-responding by edgeR? Were there &quot;genuine&quot; NS4B-binders that did not expand? And did they have any special features? If so, were TRAV12 and TRAV27 NS4B+ clonotypes equally likely to be called as responding by edgeR?</p></disp-quote><p>About 30% of NS4B-specific clones were also called as YF-responding by edgeR (537 out of 1790 in TCRbeta; 525 out of 1983 in TCRalpha). However these 30% clones correspond to 90% of all NS4B-cells (and thus non-overlapping clones have small abundances).</p><p>Interestingly, before the computational decontamination procedure we observed a small group of 60 CD4<sup>+</sup> clonotypes and this group extensively used TRAV12-2 segment (26% of clones vs 2.6% in bulk subpopulation). This suggests that TRAV12-2 indeed may drive non-specific dextramer staining, even in CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, which should not recognise pMHC class I dextramers.</p><p>After the decontamination procedure we used to filter out sorting noise (including CD4<sup>+</sup> genuine binders mentioned before, see subsection “Computational decontamination of NS4B-specific repertoire”), we see almost no binders which do not expand between days 0 and 15 (however some appear at day 15 at low frequency and thus are not called significant by edgeR).</p><p>We expanded Materials and methods text to include these results (subsection “Computational decontamination of NS4B-specific repertoire”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;Overall the dynamics and the magnitude of this response was very similar to the response to the booster vaccination after 18 months we observed in donor M1&quot;, maybe this is splitting hairs but to me the P30 response looks a little slower. Is this true/significant?</p></disp-quote><p>This is true, the secondary T-cell response of M1 seems to peak on day 5 (Figure 1C) vs day 10 for donor P30. However, on Figure 1D we see that this effect is likely driven by a more active and rapid CD4 response in M1, while CD8 response also peaks on day 10 and thus dynamics is more similar to what we see in P30. As a speculation, delayed secondary CD4<sup>+</sup> response in P30 may be explained by lower initial level of YF-responding T cells, but more donors would be needed to support this claim. Another interesting speculation is that some responding clones in P30 are actually newly recruited naive clonotypes, which take more time to expand. Such naïve clones might be produced after the first vaccination of P30 in childhood, and thus did not have a chance to participate in the primary response. Experiments on additional donors with deeper naive and memory repertoire sequencing on every time point could support or disprove this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I'm a little confused by the memory subset sorting. Where would plain old T effector cells show up here? How would they be distinguished from the memory subsets? Is there also CD45RO data? Or is there an assumption about composition based on the timepoints analyzed?</p></disp-quote><p>We define CM, EM and EMRA subpopulations by CCR7 and CD45RA expression (similarly to Fuertes Maracco et al., 2015), but it is known that CD45RO expression is the opposite of CD45RA expression (as an example see Sathaliyawala et al., 2013, Figure 2A https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1074-7613%2812%2900521-3), so we expect it CD45RA-negative EM and CM compartments.</p><p>Term “effector” doesn’t have a well defined set of markers in humans and could mean either (1) cells that were recently primed by antigen or (2) cells that have effector functions. This issue is discussed in the Review by Appay et al., see https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cyto.a.20643). We can say that “effector cells” (defined as cells with effector functions) could be found in both EM and EMRA compartments, and additional markers would be necessary to distinguish short-lived effector cells (our results suggest that the majority of them correspond to EM, see subsection “TCR sequencing shows the transition of clonotypes between memory subpopulations”).</p><p>We added references to the review on T cell memory population and the study we used as an example for memory subpopulation partition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;Interestingly, we found that the largest YF-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> clones did not expand in response to the booster vaccine.
