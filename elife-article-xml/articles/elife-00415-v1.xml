We found that glands of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> female reproductive tract, spermathecae and/or parovaria, are required for ovulation and to promote sperm storage. Reducing total secretory cell number by interferring with Notch signaling during development blocked ovulation. Knocking down expression after adult eclosion of the nuclear hormone receptor Hr39, a master regulator of gland development, slowed ovulation and blocked sperm storage. However, ovulation (but not sperm storage) continued when only canonical protein secretion was compromised in adult glands. Our results imply that proteins secreted during adulthood by the canonical secretory pathway from female reproductive glands are needed to store sperm, while a non-canonical glandular secretion stimulates ovulation. Our results suggest that the reproductive tract signals to the ovary using glandular secretions, and that this pathway has been conserved during evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00415.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00415.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00415.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mammalian oviducts, or Fallopian tubes, convey egg cells from the ovaries to the uterus. Signalling between the ovary and oviduct, and secretory products produced throughout the reproductive tract, help to increase the likelihood of conception, minimise the loss of egg cells, and reduce the risk of ectopic pregnancy (in which an embryo implants outside the uterus). These processes may also influence the development of ovarian cancer, since Fallopian tube secretory cells were recently identified as the source of the most common and lethal subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer, high grade serous ovarian cancer.</p><p>Oviduct to ovary signalling is poorly understood in mammals. However, experiments using model organisms such as the fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) provide a potentially powerful approach to the problem, since many mechanisms in gametogenesis are conserved between species. In particular, secretions within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> female reproductive tract appear to boost reproductive success by interacting with sperm cells and seminal proteins, as in mammals. But whether these secretions reach the ovary and influence ovulation, or simply act on other aspects of reproduction such as mating, sperm storage, fertilisation or egg laying, remained unknown.</p><p>In this study, Sun and Spradling identified new genes controlling reproductive gland development and used this knowledge to elucidate secretory cell function. By mutating these genes, or the nuclear hormone receptor <italic>Hr39</italic>, they were able to reduce the total number of secretory cells that developed in the female reproductive tract, or to alter their function in adults. The ovaries of flies with abnormal secretory cell function contained as many egg cells as those of normal flies, but the mutant females laid fewer eggs. This indicates that secretory cells are required for at least one stage of reproduction.</p><p>By comparing ovulation rates in mutant and normal flies, Sun and Spradling showed that the secretory cells generate a product that is specifically required for ovulation, and that production depends on Hr39 activity. This Hr39-dependent secretion is a good candidate for a conserved signal between the reproductive tract and ovary because mouse <italic>Lrh-1</italic>, a mammalian gene closely related to <italic>Hr39</italic>, is expressed in oviduct secretory cells and is itself required for ovulation. The secretory cells were also found to produce protein secretions that are necessary for female flies to store sperm in the reproductive tract after mating.</p><p>By elucidating the roles played by female reproductive tract secretions, and demonstrating that they include a signal to the ovary that stimulates ovulation, the work of Sun and Spradling may lead to an increased understanding of ovarian cancer in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00415.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00415.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Ovulation</kwd><kwd>sperm storage</kwd><kwd>exocrine gland</kwd><kwd>nuclear receptor</kwd><kwd>Notch signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spradling</surname><given-names>Allan C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Secretory cells in the fruit fly reproductive tract produce secretions that control ovulation through a conserved mechanism that could provide insights into ovarian cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The oviduct must interact extensively with the ovary to receive ovulated eggs in a manner that maximizes successful reproduction and minimizes egg loss and ectopic pregnancy. In humans, oviduct-ovary signaling also likely influence serous ovarian carcinoma development, a disease now thought to originate from the secretory epithelia of the distal oviduct (Fallopian tube) following an extended number of ovulatory cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levanon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowtell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurman and Shih Ie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berns and Bowtell, 2012</xref>). How the oviduct normally influences mammalian ovulation remains unclear, although a great deal has been learned about the hormonal control of ovulation within the ovary itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conti et al., 2012</xref>), and genes such as the nuclear hormone receptor <italic>Lrh-1</italic> are known to be essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duggavathi et al., 2008</xref>). The growing realization that important aspects of gamete biology have been conserved during evolution suggests that insights into oviduct-ovary signaling may come from studies of model systems.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> oviduct plays important roles during egg production that may involve communication with the ovary. The oviduct must be prepared to transport each oocyte released from the ovary to the uterus, to mediate its water uptake and eggshell crosslinking, and to position it for efficient fertilization (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spradling, 1993</xref>). During each cycle of ovulation, just one of the many mature oocytes present in the two ovaries is released into an oviduct. Octopaminergic neurons innervating oviduct muscle and epithelia are needed for ovulation, probably to activate oviduct muscle contraction and to stimulate epithelial secretion by activating the Oamb octopamine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monastirioti, 2003</xref>). The steroid hormone ecdysone is produced in the adult ovary and is required to maintain egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buszczak et al., 1999</xref>), although a specific role in ovulation has not been tested.</p><p>Glandular secretions from male reproductive tracts in both invertebrates and vertebrates facilitate reproduction at multiple steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloch Qazi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suarez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heifetz and Rivlin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holt and Fazeli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ikawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunlap et al., 2011</xref>). Multiple proteins produced in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male accessory glands are mixed with sperm upon ejaculation and transferred to the female reproductive tract where they mediate sperm storage, capacitation, and maternal reproductive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avila et al., 2011</xref>).

Ovulin, a protein transferred in male seminal fluid induces ovulation shortly after copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herndon and Wolfner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heifetz et al., 2005</xref>).

Ejaculate components produced in the mammalian testis, prostate, and epididymis also play important roles in reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suarez, 2008</xref>). For example, mammalian spermadhesins secreted from seminal vesicles mediate sperm attachment to the oviduct epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Talevi and Gualtieri, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Female reproductive tract secretions also boost reproduction by interacting with transferred sperm and seminal proteins in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holt and Fazeli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunlap et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schnakenberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wolfner, 2011</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermathecae and parovaria, the major exocrine glands of the female reproductive tract, are required for fertility and sperm storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 1945</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Spradling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schnakenberg et al., 2011</xref>). Whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> female secretory products regulate other aspects of reproduction remains poorly understood, however. Recently, reproductive secretory cell development in the spermathecae and parovaria was shown to follow a stereotyped cell lineage and to depend on the transcription factor Lozenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 1945</xref>) and Hr39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Spradling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun and Spradling, 2012</xref>), a nuclear hormone receptor homologous to Lrh-1.</p><p>Here we used our new understanding of reproductive gland development to manipulate the number and activity of secretory cells in adult females. In addition to documenting a role for protein secretion in sperm storage, we show that adult Hr39 expression and a non-canonical secretion from the adult female reproductive glands are required for normal ovulation. Thus, ovulation in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice depends on the homologous nuclear hormone receptors Hr39 and Lrh-1. Our results suggest that a conserved program of reproductive tract secretion mediates oviduct-ovary signaling and may be relevant to the origin of ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Female reproductive glands are essential for ovulation</title><p>The overall function of female reproductive glands can be assessed by studying adult females bearing mutations in <italic>lz</italic> or <italic>Hr39</italic> which disrupt their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 1945</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Spradling, 2008</xref>).

In controls, about 50% of females initiated ovulation within this time interval, as indicated by the presence of an egg in either the oviduct, the uterus, or the food vial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>).

In particular, the time required per ovulation event was not increased compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Females in which canonical secretion was disrupted by knocking down <italic>betaCOP</italic> or <italic>sec23</italic> also laid eggs and ovulated similarly to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). Nonetheless, the secretory cell requirement that we had previously documented for the early ovulation was confirmed when we knocked down Hr39 in adult secretory cells. After six days at the non-permissive temperature, these animals showed a significantly lower rate of egg laying, about half of normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) and ovulated much more slowly than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), requiring an average of 27 Â± 6.1 min per egg compared to 7.6 Â± 3.6 min in controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Our results show that at least two types of secretory cell products are released from reproductive gland secretory cells using different mechanisms. Products produced by the canonical protein secretory pathway are required to attract and store sperm in the spermathecae and to maintain their normal morphology. In addition, products needed to achieve a normal rate of ovulation require the function of <italic>Hr39</italic> in secretory cells, but do not utilize the canonical secretory pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> female reproductive tract secretions are required to attract and store sperm</title><p>Our experiments extend previous knowledge about the role reproductive tract secretions play in storing sperm. Sperm storage in the female reproductive tract is a general phenomenon in the animal kingdom including humans and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neubaum and Wolfner, 1999b</xref>). In mammals, carbohydrate-dependent binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelia is important in order to form a sperm reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Talevi and Gualtieri, 2010</xref>). In the absence of glands and hence of secretions, <italic>Drosophila</italic> sperm are still stored in the seminal receptacle, but they are poorly motile and fertility is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 1945</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Spradling, 2008</xref>). The same outcome is observed when spermathecal secretory cells are partially ablated in adults prior to mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schnakenberg et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The work reported here allows several additional conclusions. First, the initial attraction of sperm to the spermathecae within 6 hr of mating requires a minimum amount of secretion from the secretory cells (SCs). Females with fewer than 25 SCs rarely contain sperm. In contrast, females with 80 or more SCs show the same high frequency of sperm in their spermathecae as wild type. The secreted attractive factor might interact with the accessory gland protein Acp36DE to facilitate uterine contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avila and Wolfner, 2009</xref>), or act directly on sperm to regulate flagellar function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kottgen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Second, the fact that sperm still move to the seminal receptacle in the absence of SCs shows that different mechanisms are involved in transporting sperm to the two different storage organs. Third, we found that female reproductive tract secretions are required to maintain sperm structurally. In the absence of secretory cells, sperm are not attracted to the spermathecae and those in the seminal receptacle aggregate and are difficult to individually assess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 1945</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Spradling, 2008</xref>). However, when protein secretion in SCs is disrupted using <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup>, sperm that do make it to the spermathecae exhibit distinctive morphological abnormalities.</p><p>Finally, we documented that secretory cells competent to carry out canonical protein secretion and expressing <italic>Hr39</italic> are required to store sperm during adulthood. When protein secretion was disrupted after eclosion, sperm storage in the spermathecae was drastically compromised. Since we did not mate these females until the day they were tested, our experiments show that any initial accumulation of secretory products during pupal development turns over or is insufficient to store new sperm. The requirement for new secretion from the reproductive glands is consistent with previous studies showing that some proteins in these glands are induced by mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mack et al. 2006</xref>). The fact that Hr39 is required confirms that this gene, which is known to play a prominent role during reproductive gland development and to be expressed in adult secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Spradling, 2008</xref>), does play a key functional role in the adult gland. Many but not all spermathecal protein mRNAs, including many that are likely to be involved in sperm maintenance, are greatly reduced in an <italic>Hr39</italic> mutant that retains spermathecae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Spradling, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> female reproductive tract secretions are required for ovulation</title><p>A major finding of this study is that the secretory cells of <italic>Drosophila</italic> female reproductive glands are required for efficient ovulation. When secretory cell number is deficient initially, ovulation is drastically reduced, despite normal copulation and the presence of sperm in the reproductive tract. When secretory cell function is reduced during adulthood by knocking down expression of <italic>Hr39</italic>, the time required for ovulation is greatly increased. Unlike the secretions that attract and stabilize sperm, ovulation is not disrupted by knocking down the protein secretory pathway. However, there are many possible reproductive tract secretions that might be released from the gland secretory cells by other mechanisms.</p><p>A previous study by Schnakenberg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schnakenberg et al., 2011</xref>) examined the role of spermathecal secretory cells by partially ablating them during adulthood using secretory protein regulatory elements to drive the apoptosis inducer Hid. Like these authors, we found that reproductive tract secretions are required to attract sperm to the spermathecae and to maintain their normal structure. We extended these observations by showing that a minimum number of about 80 secretory cells is required for normal sperm attraction and storage, and that these functions require the canonical protein secretory pathway and Hr39 expression. Schnakenberg et al. reported that egg release from the uterus frequently but sporadically is reduced in females with a deficit of secretory cells, and suggested that secretory cells produce an initial, long-lasting lubricant that coats the uterus. In contrast, when secretion was compromised, we saw that egg laying was strongly and consistently reduced due to defects in ovulation rather than in egg release. Schnakenberg et al. did not study ovulation independently from egg laying. In contrast, we used assays that separate these processes, allowing the role of secretion in ovulation to emerge.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The control of ovulation may be conserved</title><p>In mammals, mature Graffian follicles compete for ovulation based on complex hormonal and biochemical signals that are closely tied to products locally produced by the follicle's granulosa and nascent luteal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mihm and Evans, 2008</xref>). Much less is known about how individual follicles in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary are selected for oviduct entry from a large pool. While nervous control of ovulation is clearly required to coordinate egg release with environmental and circadian factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2008</xref>), the underlying mechanism of egg selection is likely to be more complex and involve local interactions as well as communication between the ovaries. Identification of the secretory cell product(s) that are required for ovulation would provide an important clue to uncovering these mechanisms.</p><p>A particularly attractive possibility is that communication signals between the reproductive tract and the ovary have been partially conserved between mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This prospect is now strengthened by the finding that Hr39 is required for ovulation, like its mammalian counterpart, Lrh-1. Prostaglandin-like molecules are known to regulate ovulation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dinchuk et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim et al., 1997</xref>), and Lrh-1 is thought to function by regulating expression of the prostaglandin-generating enzyme COX-II in mouse granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duggavathi et al., 2008</xref>). A prostaglandin-like signal already is known to function during egg maturation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tootle and Spradling, 2008</xref>), and a COX-II-like enzyme, CG10211, is expressed in spermathecae under the control of Hr39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Spradling, 2008</xref>). It will be interesting to determine if Lrh-1 functions in reproductive tract secretory cells. Finally, identifying additional glandular products acting in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> reproductive tract may elucidate additional pathways of communication between oviduct and ovary that are relevant to the induction of ovarian cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics</title><p>Flies were reared on standard cornmeal-molasses food at 25Â°C unless otherwise indicated.

Your article has now been peer reviewed and we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication at this time. Your submission has been evaluated by 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision has been discussed further with one of eLife's Senior editors. The Reviewing editor and the outside reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision.</p><p>Each reviewer has acknowledged the importance of the work, but all three are unanimous in suggesting that the work presented is not complete and ready for publication. Reviewer 1 points to the lack of a detailed developmental analysis or identification of gene function, aspects that echo the comments of Reviewer 3. Similarly, Reviewer 2 feels that the nature of the secreted product, indeed the nature of secretion itself, is not fully examined, a view shared by Reviewer 1. Finally, Reviewer 3, an expert in the specific field, raises many technical questions and also would like to be further convinced that some of the points raised in different parts of the manuscript have indeed been settled by the results that are presented. The detailed comments of each reviewer are included below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The paper âOvulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> requires reproductive track secretions controlled by nuclear hormone receptor Hr39â explores an interesting link between secretions from female reproductive tract glands (Spermathecae and Parovaria) with ovulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The authors show that a developmental defect in the specification of secretory organs in the female reproductive tract (through mutations in genes such as lozenge and Hr39) causes significant ovulation defects. These defects are neither due to mating deficiencies, nor caused by defects in neurons that innervate the oviduct muscles.</p><p>Based on the stereotypical division patterns seen in cells of the secretory unit precursor (SUP) cells and the expression of Notch signaling reporters at high levels, the authors test and establish that Notch signaling is required for the specification of secretory cells. Similarly, the authors establish a role for the transcription factor Hindsight, which is also expressed in these cells. Finally, using a Janelia Gal4 driver line expressed specifically in developing but not in mature secretory cells, the authors establish that secretory cells are needed in sufficient numbers to allow normal ovulation and sperm storage. Previous studies have shown that secretory cells in the female reproductive glands release their secretions into a structure called the end apparatus, which is in close apposition to the microvilli of the secretory cells. The authors test the role of secretions from these cells using a specific Gal4 and block exocytosis from these cells by over-expressing a dominant negative version of Dynamin (shi[ts]). This causes a defect in sperm storage but not in ovulation. The authors conclude that either the secretory factors from SC that regulate ovulation are independent of exocytosis or they are needed at very low levels, not disrupted in the chosen experimental design.</p><p>This is largely an observational paper, with few broader insights to report. That the secretory cells control ovulation, and that this process is Notch dependent is an interesting finding, described and proven with well-planned experiments and originality in the paper. But the manuscript does not explore much beyond this basic premise.</p><p>The data presented are of high standard but the paper lacks a cohesive narrative that moves the field forward. For example, the paper does not explore in detail the developmental aspects of the SC cells, and uses an assortment of mutations (in <italic>Hr39</italic>, <italic>lz</italic>, Hindsight, Notch) only as ways to eliminate the function of these cells rather than explore their interdependencies, or developmental relevance. Similarly, no attempt is made on the functional side to determine the nature of the secretions that have such profound effects on ovulation. In the end, the negative result with shibire-ts leaves the question wide open for further exploration. This work represents an exploratory project that has a lot of future potential but is not yet ready to move the field forward.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The findings of Spradling and colleagues are potentially interesting. The paper clearly shows the requirement of secretory cells in the events leading to attraction and storage of the sperm. However, the data on the nature of the secretory components is not satisfactory. The authors report the involvement of Shibre (Dynamin); however, shibre is known to affect endocytosis in the neurons: the significance of this mutation on exocytosis is, therefore, unclear. It is important to know if the defect is due to secretion of extracellular matrix components or some growth factors or cytokines. I do not expect the authors to reveal the identity of the essential secreted component(s); they must, however, provide the clear involvement of the secretory process. Does it involve the regulated or the constitutive secretory pathway? The authors should test the effect of mutations in the genes that block constitutive (ER-Golgi-plasma membrane) and the regulated (Golgi-secretory storage granules-PM) in sperm attraction and attachment to support their proposal.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>There are a number of interesting conclusions in this paper; however, the title suggests a link between Hr39 and secretory cell function in the spermathecae, but the only clear role suggested by the experiments for Hr39 is a role in the formation of the spermathecae and the parovaria, not in the functioning of fully formed secretory cells in these tissues. In fact, using Hr39 RNAi with the dpr5-Gal4 driver showed what appears to be a small drop in ovulation after 6 hrs (from 64.5 to 45.8 although the RNAi control is missing) â however, no drop in egg laying after 48 hours was seen. In addition, no significant drop in sperm storage was seen. Based on these findings, it is difficult to see why the authors used Hr39 in the title of this paper. In addition it seems that the interesting conclusions are not highlighted in the Abstract or Introduction. There needs to be a clear differentiation in the writing of the paper between conclusions based on the absence of the entire tissue, and those effecting cell number on adult function. Overall, the paper should be rewritten to clearly highlight the more interesting conclusions regarding the role of the secretory cells of the spermathecae (i.e. ovulation defects and sperm storage defects), and the conclusions based on <italic>hr39</italic> and <italic>lz</italic> should be more clearly stated for what they are, a study of the loss of the tissues they help form.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>* The authors should state in the introduction the previously established link between the secretory cells of the spermathecae and sperm storage/ovulation â although Schnakenberg et al., (2011) is mentioned in the Discussion, it should also be mentioned up front in the Introduction.</p><p>* The authors need to clearly state that <italic>lzGal4</italic> expression has previously been shown to recapitulate actual <italic>lz</italic> expression. When does the <italic>lzGal4</italic> line come on in development?</p><p>* The authors state: â<italic>lz</italic> is expressed in the subset of these neurons near the oviduct-uterus junction, but the number of <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>ppk</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> neurons was not affected by knocking down <italic>cycA</italic> or <italic>hr39</italic> using the <italic>lzGal4</italic> driver.â How do the authors know that knocking down <italic>cycA</italic> or <italic>hr39</italic> should change neuronal numbers? Do they know if <italic>lz</italic> is required for their proliferation? What if it has another function in these neurons?</p><p>* Why is <italic>hr39</italic> knockdown using RNAi tested in <italic>lz</italic> cells, but not <italic>lz</italic>-RNAi itself? Has <italic>hr39</italic> previously been shown to be expressed in these <italic>lz</italic> neurons? ppk-Gal4 with <italic>hr39</italic>-RNAi does not effect egg laying â why don't the authors test <italic>lz</italic>?</p><p>* The result in Figure 2E is <italic>not</italic> that mSP expression in <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> neurons induces egg laying, an already published finding (Yang et al., 2009), but that mSP expression in <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> neurons can not bypass the egg-laying defect in <italic>hr39</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants. Therefore, the SP behavioral switch can happen in the absence of <italic>Hr39</italic> (and therefore no spermathecae or parovaria are needed); however, the loss of egg-laying in <italic>hr39</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cannot be overcome by the SP behavioral switch.</p><p>* It appears from the methods that the shi[ts] flies are shifted just prior to mixing males and females. Is one possible explanation for the shi[ts] phenotype that all the important secretions for ovulation/egg-laying are already in place prior to mating?</p><p>* There appears to be no mention of statistical analysis: the types of analysis should be clearly stated along with every figure/table where they have been used and statistically significant differences/similarities should always be highlighted.</p><p>* <italic>fru</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>/ppk</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> neurons have recently be shown to also be dsx-positive (RezÃ¡val et al., 2012).</p><p>* There are many different Gal4 lines used in this study: the authors should make it clear throughout the paper exactly where the lines have been shown to be expressed (either previously published or by the authors themselves). For example, the syt12-Gal4 line is introduced near the end of the paper but its overall expression pattern and reasons for use are far from clear.</p><p>* The first paragraph of the Discussion is confusing (for example, using double-negatives): this section should be re-worked to clearly state what was previously shown, and then clearly state what the current study adds to the story. The authors have shown a clear ovulation defect that was previously not shown; this is an interesting result that currently gets lost in the detailed explanation of the previous study.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Decision letter outlining revision requirements</title><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled âOvulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> requires reproductive tract secretions controlled by the nuclear hormone receptor Hr39â for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>, and for telephonic discussions with Detlef Weigel and K.

A new section of Results and portions of the Discussion were modified to accommodate the new experiments.

Experiments that report the effects of disrupting at least one key gene in the ER/Golgi/PM secretory pathway(s) on ovulation would also greatly strengthen the manuscript. Your appeal letter indicates that both types of experiments are readily feasible</italic>.</p><p>The main reason for the delay in resubmitting the revised version was to carry out both of these experiments. To unequivocally test the adult role of Hr39 (and the ER/Golgi/PM pathway) in adults, we drove RNAi expression targeting Hr39, betaCOP or Sec23 with Syt12-Gal4 in the presence of GAL80ts. At 18 <bold>Â°</bold>C the GAL80 inhibitor prevents Gal4 expression and the flies are phenotypically wild type with a normal number of secretory cells. We raised the temperature to 29<bold>Â°</bold>C at the time of adult eclosion. Some secretory products have probably been produced already at this time, and the turnover of the GAL80 protein at the restrictive temperature can take a few days, providing additional time for additional normal secretory cell function. Despite the potential for perdurance, when we tested the ability of these flies to store sperm, ovulate, or lay eggs at day 6 of adulthood, we saw strong defects (described below), thereby proving that Hr39 gene function and secretory cell function are required in adulthood. These results are presented in a revised Figure 5 and a new table: Table 2. The first two bars of panels D, G, and H present the original results, while the remaining bars show the new experiments. In addition, we added a new panel to Figure 5 with a timeline for the temperature shift and assay to make it clear that we are testing only adult function.</p><p>With respect to sperm storage, knocking down Hr39 in adulthood caused an extensive and statistically significant reduction in the ability of females to store sperm following mating (Figure 5D). When either betaCOP or sec23 was knocked down we observed even stronger effects on sperm storage than previously documented with shi[ts], in that all spermathecae now contain 15 or fewer stored sperm (see new Figure 5D). The few sperm that were present showed the same defective morphology illustrated in Figure 5F for shi[ts]. Moreover, knocking down betaCOP or sec23 by shifting the temperature beginning in 9-day-old adults (rather than at eclosion) and testing at 14 days of age gave the same result.</p><p>When we quantitatively analyzed egg laying and ovulation, these experiments also confirmed and extended our previous studies. We previously showed that shi[ts] did not cause a significant reduction in egg laying (over 24 hr) or in ovulation rate (measured in the first 6 hours after mating). We improved on these assays by measuring both the egg laying rate of the flies over 2 days beginning at day 6 (Table 2, column 1) and for a 6 hour sample of this period, measuring in individual flies of each genotype the number of eggs laid and the presence or absence of an egg still in the uterus (Table 2, column 2). (We confirmed that the percentage of flies with uterine eggs was the same after 6 hours and after the longer 2-day period.) By calculating the total time required for each laid egg, and by using the percentage of uterine eggs, we apportioned that time between ovulation time and time in the uterus (Table 2, column 3). Ovulation time provides a sensitive measurement of how efficiently ovulation is occurring in the different genotypes.</p><p>These results show that egg laying is not significantly reduced over 2 days by blocking secretion from reproductive secretory cells using shi[ts], betaCOP RNAi or sec23RNAi (Figure 5F), although it does trend downward, most likely due to secondary effects. Strikingly, ovulation time is not increased at all by disrupting ER/Golgi/PM secretion in these cells, confirming our previous result with shi[ts]. In contrast, Hr39-RNAi in secretory cells does significantly decrease the number of eggs laid and substantially and significantly slows ovulation (Fig. 5H). This confirms our conclusion that sperm storage requires ER/Golgi/PM secretion from female secretory cells and shows that this requirement exists in adulthood. Moreover, these data now show clearly that female secretory cells also function in adulthood to stimulate ovulation by a process requiring adult Hr39 expression, but that the stimulation of ovulation by secretory cells is independent of the canonical secretory pathway. We suspect that this second secretion is likely to be a small molecule that can move more easily than a large protein from the spermathecae and/or parovaria to the base of the ovary.</p><p><italic>4) Finally, a measured and brief analysis of your views on the Schnakenburg et al. paper, in the context of the current work, will be useful for readers to compare the two studies and to reach their own conclusions about the similarities and differences between them</italic>.</p><p>We have added such comments to the Discussion as a second paragraph in the initial section on ovulation. Rather than discussing all the issues raised by their paper, we summarized the areas of agreement and the major difference: Schnakenburg et al. were unable to analyze ovulation whereas we discovered this connection between reproductive tract secretion, Hr39 expression, and ovulation.</p><p>Additional changes:</p><p>The Materials and methods and Figure legends have been revised to describe the new experiments. In addition, error bars that had been inadvertently omitted in the original version were restored, and additional statistical test information was added to Figure legends or the Materials and methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
