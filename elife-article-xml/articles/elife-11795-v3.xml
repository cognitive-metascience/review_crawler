The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoproteins (NPs) from the genus <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> (family <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>), a group of enveloped (-)ssRNA viruses. The main difference between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal extensions, which appear to determine the characteristics of the distinct multimeric assemblies – a flexuous, helical rod or a loose ribonucleoprotein.

Each virus particle contains a single molecule called ribonucleic acid (RNA), which is protected by hundreds of copies of a coat protein. The RNA and coat proteins are arranged in a helical fashion to make a flexible rod-shaped particle.</p><p>The flexibility of these viruses makes it difficult to carry out in-depth studies of their three-dimensional structures. As a result, we do not know how the RNA and coat proteins interact to form the structure of each virus particle. Agirrezabala et al. used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy (or cryoEM for short) to generate a highly detailed three-dimensional model of a flexible filamentous virus called Pepino Mosaic Virus.</p><p>Agirezabala et al.’s findings reveal how the virus particles assemble, and the interactions between the coat protein and the ssRNA. Unexpectedly, the structure of the coat protein from Pepino Mosiac Virus is very similar to the structure of “nucleoproteins” from a group of viruses called the Phleboviruses, which infect animals. This similarity is striking and suggests that the gene that encodes these proteins has been transferred between the two groups of viruses during evolution. A future challenge is to find out whether this similarity extends to other groups of viruses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11795.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11795.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>flexible plant virus</kwd><kwd>coat protein</kwd><kwd>ssRNA viruses</kwd><kwd>cryoEM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2012-34873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valle</surname><given-names>Mikel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AGL2012-37390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aranda</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The high-resolution structure of a filamentous flexible plant virus shows that there is structural homology between its coat protein and the nucleoproteins of an unrelated group of enveloped RNA animal viruses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flexible filamentous viruses are ubiquitous plant pathogens that have an enormous impact in agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Revers and Garcia, 2015</xref>). Their infective particles are non-enveloped and flexible rod-shaped virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kendall et al., 2008</xref>) and contain several hundreds of copies of a coat protein (CP) arranged in a helical fashion protecting a ssRNA of positive polarity, or (+)ssRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kendall et al., 2008</xref>). They are distributed in families <italic>Alphaflexiviridae, Betaflexiviridae, Closteroviridae</italic>, and <italic>Potyviridae</italic>, which have different genomic organizations (particularly different between <italic>Potyviridae</italic> and the rest of the groups) and belong to different superfamilies, but it is thought that their CPs have strong evolutionary relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koonin et al., 2015</xref>). Structural studies of virions by X-ray fiber diffraction and cryoEM have indeed revealed a common architecture for flexible plant viruses. The filaments are 120-130 Å in diameter, and the CPs are arranged following helical symmetry with slightly less than 9 subunits per turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kendall et al., 2008</xref>). This overall arrangement is shared by <italic>Soybean mosaic virus</italic> (SMV) a potyvirus (from the family <italic>Potyviridae</italic>), and three different potexviruses (family <italic>Alphaflexiviridae), Potato virus X</italic> (PVX), <italic>Papaya mosaic virus</italic> (PapMV), and <italic>Narcissus mosaic virus (</italic>NMV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kendall et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kendall et al., 2008</xref>). The flexibility of the virions has limited high-resolution structural studies, and most of the previous data were at moderate resolution. Very recently, the cryoEM structure of <italic>Bamboo mosaic virus</italic> (BaMV), another potexvirus, was determined at 5.6 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DiMaio et al., 2015</xref>), and the CP was modeled based on the atomic structure of a truncated version of the CP from <italic>Papaya mosaic virus</italic> (PapMV CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). The work revealed that N- and C-terminal extensions of the CP mediate viral polymerization and allow for the flexuous nature of the virions.</p><p><italic>Pepino mosaic virus </italic>(PepMV) is another potexvirus which has emerged recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jones et al., 1980</xref>), progressing from endemic to epidemic in tomato crops causing severe economic losses worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hanssen and Thomma, 2010</xref>). PepMV is transmitted by mechanical contact and virions contain a (+)ssRNA of about 6.4 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilar et al., 2002</xref>). The PepMV CP is strictly required for cell-to-cell movement of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sempere et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We present the cryoEM structure of PepMV virions at 3.9 Å of resolution. The near-atomic three-dimensional (3D) map allows for accurate modeling of the CP, the viral RNA, and their interaction. In vivo functional studies of several CP mutants confirm the role of several residues in RNA binding and polymerization. Surprisingly, we have also found a clear structural homology between the CP of flexuous viruses and the NP of the genus <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>, a group of enveloped viruses with a segmented (-)ssRNA genome. The NPs from phleboviruses are associated with the viral genome in loose ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Raymond et al., 2012</xref>) protected inside an envelope, in which inserted glycoproteins construct an icosahedral shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huiskonen et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Freiberg et al., 2008</xref>). Despite the divergence of both viral groups, CP from potexviruses and NP from phleboviruses have the same all α-helix fold, and their high similarity suggests a horizontal gene transfer event between these evolutionary distant groups of eukaryotic RNA viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CryoEM structure of PepMV</title><p>We have analyzed by cryoEM PepMV virions isolated from infected <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The 3D map at 3.9 Å of resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) was calculated by single particle-based helical image processing implemented in Spring software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Desfosses et al., 2014</xref>). The cryoEM map reveals a left-handed helix with a diameter of 130 Å and an inner narrow channel of 13 Å, and the structure shows a pitch of 34.6 Å and 8.7 CP copies per turn. This overall helical arrangement is in agreement with previous works with other potexviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kendall et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), but in the current case and in the recent cryoEM structure of BaMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DiMaio et al., 2015</xref>) the attained resolutions allowed a clear assignment of the symmetry. Our cryoEM map reaches near-atomic resolution, to date the highest resolution structural data for a flexible filamentous virion, where bulky protein side chains are discernible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This allowed us to generate an atomic model for PepMV CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) by iterative modeling starting with the atomic structure of PapMV CP (see 'Materials and methods'). The PepMV CP structure thus generated has three major regions: the core; an N-terminal flexible arm; and a C-terminal extension. The first 20 amino acids in the N-terminal side are not included in the atomic model because the region projects outwards, and its density vanishes due to high flexibility. The modeled structure for PepMV CP is, as defined for PapMV CP, an all-helix fold, and the low RMSD between the two structures (1.5 Å in the core region) reflects their clear homology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11795.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CryoEM structure of PepMV and atomic model for its CP.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Renderings of the 3D density map for PepMV that displays a left-handed helical symmetry with 34.6 Å of helical pitch (P).

Several 3D maps with different helical symmetry parameters are calculated starting with bi-dimensional averaged classes. Re-projections of the calculated 3D maps are then compared with the 2D averages, and their relative cross-correlation coefficients identify possible parameters. We tested a grid with variations in the helical pitch and the number of subunits per turn and calculated low resolution reconstructions using the parameters with higher correlations. The visual inspection of these initial maps lead to the selection of the helical symmetry for PepMV sample (better definition of CP subunits in the low-resolution map with 8.75 copies per turn). Further local searches were also performed to refine the symmetry.

The ssRNA runs in a helix of 70 Å in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Each CP binds five ribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), so that the entire genome of PepMV would require 1290 copies of PepMV CP spanning 510 nm (3.95 Å of axial rise/subunit), which agrees with the 509 nm length originally reported for the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jones et al., 1980</xref>). The signal clearly separates the individual nucleotides, but we could not identify the bases due to the helical averaging of the variable sequence of the ssRNA. In order to explore the protein–ssRNA interactions, we modeled a polyU and included a set of four PepMV CP monomers in a molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Trabuco et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). The results show that the RNA resides in a continuous groove with a high electropositive potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) constructed by CPs from consecutive turns of the helix. Local resolution measurements in the cryoEM map suggest a high variability in positions 3 and 4 at the segmented density for the ssRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The fluorescent signal by GFP allowed following the cell-to-cell movement of the virus. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) reveal that the three amino acids at the binding pocket for nucleotide at position 2 (R124, D163 and K196) are required to complement the cell-to-cell movement of the CP-defective PepMV mutant, suggesting a disruption of the CP-RNA interaction needed in virus intercellular transport. Mutant K93A also impairs viral propagation within the inoculated leaf, probably due to structural changes at the loop that contains S92 and S94.

However, the improved resolution of the current data allowed for additional insights. The N-terminal arm from the N<sub>i</sub> subunit interacts with a hydrophobic groove of the N<sub>i-1</sub> subunit and establishes the main side-by-side contact in the helical arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). A hydrophobic pocket in N<sub>i-1</sub> accommodates part of the N-terminal arm, where F28 from N<sub>i</sub> fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A similar type of interaction was observed between subunits in the crystal structure of PapMV CP via amino acid F13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), and for BaMV, by residue W41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DiMaio et al., 2015</xref>).

This C-terminal segment describes a turn that runs along the axial channel and creates a network of small and local interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), where each subunit contacts neighbours at upper and lower levels. Thus, the C-terminal extensions are responsible for the axial interactions that support helix formation. As for BaMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DiMaio et al., 2015</xref>), the flexible links between PepMV CPs via N-terminal arm and C-terminal region allow for relative movements between CPs and explain the flexuous nature of the virions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Structural homology between CP from potexviruses and NP from phleboviruses</title><p>All the high-resolution structures for flexuous filamentous plant viruses correspond to representatives of the genus <italic>Potexvirus</italic> (family <italic>Alphaflexiviridae</italic>) and include our current data and previously reported structures of PapMV CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yang et al., 2012</xref>) and BaMV virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DiMaio et al., 2015</xref>). We cannot confirm whether members of other families of flexuous filamentous viruses (<italic>Betaflexiviridae, Closteroviridae</italic> and <italic>Potyviridae</italic>) have a similar fold in their CPs. We have, nevertheless, looked for structural neighbours within the database of Dali server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Holm and Rosenstrom, 2010</xref>). The search revealed that the CP structure from potexviruses shares its topology with the NP of several representatives of genus <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> (family <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>), such as <italic>Rift Valley fever virus</italic> (RVFV), <italic>Toscana virus</italic>, and <italic>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus</italic> (SFTSV). These viruses infect animals, including humans, are transmitted by arthropod vectors, and pose serious public health concerns. Genera <italic>Potexvirus</italic> and <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> belong to different superfamilies of RNA viruses when these are classified based on phylogenetic relationships among RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) and also have different genomic organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koonin et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the organization of phlebovirus particles is very different. They have segmented (-)ssRNA associated with the NP in loose RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Raymond et al., 2012</xref>), and these are protected inside an icosahedral shell of glycoproteins inserted in a membrane, as has been observed for RVFV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huiskonen et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Freiberg et al., 2008</xref>). The topology of CP from potexviruses and of the NP from phleboviruses (illustrated for RVFV) are, nonetheless, very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A and 4C</xref>) and show a TM-score of 0.51 when aligned, pointing to a common family fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang and Skolnick, 2005</xref>). The similarities include: the overall topology of the all-alpha helical domain; the N-terminal arm and its binding site from the adjacent protomer, and hence, the side-by-side mechanism for oligomerization; the groove for the ssRNA binding; and the relative positions of all these elements. The crystallographic studies with phlebovirus NPs have shown tetrameric, pentameric, and hexameric oligomers, in which each NP interacts with the core of the adjacent subunit via an N-terminal arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) following the same side-by-side polymerization mechanism shown in potexviruses. The divergence between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal regions. The C-terminus in PepMV CP protrudes from the core domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and allows longitudinal interactions for helix building. The C-terminus of the phlebovirus NP folds back into the core region and participates in the RNA-binding site that incorporates seven bases/subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The location of the C-terminal arm in phlebovirus NPs cannot support a longitudinal assembly, and hence, their RNPs remain more loosely associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Raymond et al., 2012</xref>) than in their plant-virus counterparts.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11795.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Structural homology between PepMV CP and NP from phleboviruses.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) The atomic structures for the modeled PepMV CP and for the NP from RVFV (pdb code 4H5O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Raymond et al., 2012</xref>) are depicted in similar orientations.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Stephen Harrison, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the other two reviewers, Ed Egelman, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports a structure for <italic>Pepino mosaic virus</italic>, a flexuous rod, like a number of other plant viruses. The structure, determined by electron cryomicroscopy, is at sufficiently high resolution to permit a proper chain trace of the capsid subunit and a clear view of the interaction of five nucleotides with each subunit. The most interesting result is the relationship of the capsid subunit to the nucleoprotein of bunyaviruses – another nice example of close relationships between plant and animal viruses, but in this case particularly striking because <italic>Pepino mosaic virus</italic> is a plus-strand ssRNA virus and the bunyaviruses are minus-strand viruses.</p><p>The paper is appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>, but it needs extensive rewriting and some substantive revision, as outlined below. All these required changes should be straightforward.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) More explicit comparison with BaMV. The authors should compare their atomic model with the BaMV model (5A2T.pdb). They should also include the BaMV sequence in Figure 2—figure supplement 4.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>: The point of this figure is not clear. It shows a helical symmetry search with a peak at 9.28 units/turn, which looks even stronger than the peak at 8.75 (the correct symmetry). Did the authors choose the latter simply because of the BaMV symmetry or because the alternative did not give a plausible map? Please clarify.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. The reviewers have concerns about using ResMap. In the ResMap manual, one reads: &quot;Helical particles are not well supported&quot;. Is this why the authors used it on an &quot;isolated&quot; subunit rather than on the full helix? But cutting out a subunit introduces a strong masking function, and ResMap actually works by comparing the density fluctuations within the subunit with those outside it. But the latter are now masked off. So in the figure there is a helix stated to be at ~3.5 Å resolution, but no helical grooves can be seen. The authors should show an FSC curve between that reconstruction and their atomic model.</p><p>4) In the subsection “CP and ssRNA interaction”: Interpretation of the CP-complementation studies (e.g., &quot;suggesting a disruption of the CP-RNA interaction&quot;) seems to be flawed. Previous studies showed CP mutants that do not interrupt CP-RNA interactions and can still assemble virions (e.g., a C-terminal trucation) are defective in cell-cell movement. CP mutants that do not assemble into virions can complement the defect of cell-to-cell movement. CP mutants that do not assemble into virions can complement the defect in cell-cell movement.</p><p>5) In the last paragraph of the Introduction and in the first paragraph of the subsection “Structural homology between CP from potexviruses and NP from phleboviruses”: The icosahedral shell in RVFV is not a &quot;capsid&quot;, which refers instead (in this case) to the helical structure associated with the RNA inside the particle. It is the &quot;icosahedral shell of glycoproteins&quot;.</p><p>6) The title should be changed. The data do not &quot;reveal gene transfer&quot; – such a revelation could come only from an observation of a transfer intermediate. We suggest: The structure of a flexuous-helix plant virus shows homology of its capsid protein with the nucleoprotein of animal bunyaviruses.</p><p>7) The Abstract should be revised along the lines suggested below:</p><p>Flexible filamentous viruses include economically important plant pathogens. Their viral particles contain several hundred copies of a helically arrayed coat protein (CP) protecting a (+)ssRNA. We describe here a structure at 3.9 Å resolution, from electron cryomicroscopy, of Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), a representative of the genus Potexvirus (family Alphaflexiviridae). Our results allow modeling of the CP and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoprotein (NPs) from the genus Phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae), a group of enveloped (-)ssRNA viruses. The main difference between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal extensions, which appear to determine the characteristics of the distinct multimeric assemblies – a flexuous, helical rod or a loose ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The homology suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic (+) and (-) SSRNA viruses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11795.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) More explicit comparison with BaMV.

Then we proceed with local searches around the chosen symmetry. Of course, this is not very objective, and only the high resolution of the final map confirmed the accuracy of the parameters, and there was no need to calculate maps with alternative symmetries. It is clear that the figure legend was misleading and now it has been changed.</p><p>When the map was calculated, the structure for BaMV was not available. In any case, since small structural variations in the CP might change the helical symmetry we must search the parameters in every new sample.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>.

This issue has been clarified in the corresponding figure legend.</p><p>On the other hand, in the Resmap manual, it is stated that &quot;Helical particles are not well supported&quot;. This statement is related to the fact that Resmap needs the input volume to have the reconstructed particle well centered in the box, and long helical structures might not be suitable. We calculated the resolution using a short, well centered helical particle with a few turns of the helix, so that the requirement for a central position could be fulfilled. Calculations using Resmap have been used in recent works with helical particles. For instance in:</p><p>Gutsche et al. Near-atomic cryo-EM structure of the helical measles virus nucleocapsid. Science. 2015 May 8;348(6235):704-7;</p><p>Clare et al. Novel Inter-Subunit Contacts in Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus Revealed by Cryo-Electron Microscopy. Structure. 2015 Oct 6;23(10):1815-26.</p><p>It is true that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, the map did not look to contain information at ~3.5 Å resolution (helical grooves absent). The reason is that we used a raw version of the cryoEM map with no further processing (unmasked and unfiltered) and with no enhancement of high frequencies, so these structural details were missing in the rendering. Now, the same figure shows a map with enhanced high resolution features (using a B-factor of -200 1/Å<sup>2</sup> as stated in Materials and methods). The FSC curve calculated between the cryoEM and the atomic model is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection “CP and ssRNA interaction”</italic></p><p><italic>. Interpretation of the CP-complementation studies (e.g., &quot;suggesting a disruption of the CP-RNA interaction&quot;) seems to be flawed. Previous studies showed CP mutants that do not interrupt CP-RNA interactions and can still assemble virions (e.g., a C-terminal trucation) are defective in cell-cell movement. CP mutants that do not assemble into virions can complement the defect of cell-to-cell movement. CP mutants that do not assemble into virions can complement the defect in cell-cell movement.</italic> </p><p>The straightforward interpretation of these results is that:</p><p>&quot;The three amino acids at the binding pocket for nucleotide at position 2 (R124, D163 and K196) are required to complement the cell-to-cell movement of the CP-defective PepMV mutant […]“</p><p>As it is first stated in the manuscript (in the revised version). The same sentence continues:</p><p>“[…] suggesting a disruption of the CP-RNA interaction needed in virus intercellular transport.”</p><p>Since the three amino acids are located in the binding pocket for the RNA, and the cell-to-cell movement needs a protein-RNA complex, it is reasonable to infer such a conclusion. Since we say &quot;suggesting&quot;, it does not imply that it has been fully demonstrated, but we think that the interpretation is more than plausible and it needs to be stated. Therefore, we would like to keep it.</p><p><italic>5) In the last paragraph of the Introduction and in the first paragraph of the subsection “Structural homology between CP from potexviruses and NP from phleboviruses“</italic></p><p><italic>.

In the present comparison between potexvirus and phlebovirus the use of these words can be confusing. We have removed &quot;capsid&quot; and now use the suggested &quot;icosahedral shell of glycoproteins&quot;, which is more specific and clear.</p><p><italic>6) The title should be changed.
