Although sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling have been shown to be phosphorylated, the biochemical and physiological roles of protein phosphorylation within the lumen of the SR remain essentially uncharacterized. Our laboratory recently identified an atypical protein kinase, Fam20C, which is uniquely localized to the secretory pathway lumen. Here, we show that Fam20C phosphorylates several SR proteins involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, including calsequestrin2 and Stim1, whose biochemical activities are dramatically regulated by Fam20C mediated phosphorylation. Notably, phosphorylation of Stim1 by Fam20C enhances Stim1 activation and store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Physiologically, mice with <italic>Fam20c</italic> ablated in cardiomyocytes develop heart failure following either aging or induced pressure overload. We extended these observations to show that non-muscle cells lacking Fam20C display altered ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Overall, we show that Fam20C plays an overarching role in ER/SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and cardiac pathophysiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>heart disease</kwd><kwd>Stim 1</kwd><kwd>calsequestrin 2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32HL136122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pollak</surname><given-names>Adam J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3T32HL007444-34S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pollak</surname><given-names>Adam J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32CA009523-32</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mayfield</surname><given-names>Joshua E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI109842</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hogan</surname><given-names>Patrick G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI040127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hogan</surname><given-names>Patrick G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK018849-41</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dixon</surname><given-names>Jack E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK018024-43</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dixon</surname><given-names>Jack E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37HL028143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heller Brown</surname><given-names>Joan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Protein phosphorylation within the lumen of the secretory pathway regulates cardiac function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heart failure remains the leading cause of death in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamin et al., 2018</xref>) and is clinically characterized by reduced cardiac function and pathological remodeling. Intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) handling is the basis of cardiac contraction and relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bers, 2014</xref>). Contraction involves the release of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol via the ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2); relaxation occurs with SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase pump (SERCA2a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bers, 2002</xref>). Multiple proteins and post-translational modifications tightly regulate this SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling, including phosphorylation of proteins on the cytosolic face of the SR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaanine and Hajjar, 2011</xref>), and are a focus of several clinical attempts to improve cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marks, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hulot et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling underlies a broad range of cellular process in a variety of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raffaello et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the biochemical and physiological roles of protein phosphorylation within the ER/SR remains essentially unknown. Here we describe a luminal ER/SR kinase that is important for cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and cardiac pathophysiology.</p><p>While studies of protein phosphorylation focus, almost exclusively, on the role of kinases in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells, many important secretory proteins are also phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). For over 100 years the identification of the physiological kinase that phosphorylates secretory proteins, such as Î²-casein, the most abundant phosphoprotein in milk, remained a mystery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tagliabracci et al., 2013</xref>). The discovery of the atypical kinase Fam20C solved this conundrum, as Fam20C has a signal peptide that brings it to the lumen of the secretory pathway where it preferentially phosphorylates Ser within Ser-x-Glu/pSer (S-x-E) motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tagliabracci et al., 2012</xref>). Fam20C is important for bone and teeth formation in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Simpson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui et al., 2015</xref>) and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vogel et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequent studies demonstrated that Fam20C is responsible for generatingÂ &gt;90% of the secreted phosphoproteome and that its substrates are likely involved in diverse biological functions that mostly remain uncharacterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tagliabracci et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Fam20Câs potential role in cardiac function was highlighted by the identification of a heart disease-associated polymorphism in luminal SR resident histidine-rich Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein (HRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arvanitis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, this polymorphism (HRC-Ser96Ala) was observed within a Fam20C consensus S-x-E phosphorylation motif and Fam20C was responsible for HRC-Ser96 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pollak et al., 2017</xref>). This phosphorylation modulated HRCâs interactions with triadin and SERCA2a and was demonstrated to be necessary to prevent arrhythmias in vitro. However, Fam20Câs physiological role in normal and diseased heart function remains unknown. Importantly, we hypothesize that several SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory proteins are Fam20C substrates, given the extent of SR proteins containing S-x-E motifs and that Fam20C has been shown to be responsible for the majority of secretory pathway phosphorylation in several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tagliabracci et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>This study identifies, mechanistically, several critical ER/SR proteins as substrates of Fam20C, and demonstrates Fam20Câs broad impact on cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in cardiomyocytes and other cell types. Notably, we show that stromal interaction molecule 1 (Stim1), which is important for controlling cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2013</xref>), and calsequestrin 2 (CSQ2), the major Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein in the SR, are dramatically regulated by Fam20C phosphorylation. We then developed a cardiomyocyte-specific <italic>Fam20c</italic> conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model to determine the physiological roles of SR luminal protein phosphorylation. Upon numerous pathological stimuli, we demonstrate that Fam20C deficiency in cardiomyocytes results in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM involves left ventricle (LV) dilation and reduced functional capacity in both human and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hershberger et al., 2013</xref>). A better fundamental understanding of the underlying molecular biologic mechanisms of these processes is critical to improving patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fam20C phosphorylates multiple SR regulatory proteins important for Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis</title><p>Given the dramatic biochemical effects of Fam20C phosphorylation of HRC-Ser96 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pollak et al., 2017</xref>), we postulated that Fam20C phosphorylation of other SR proteins would have important regulatory functions. Therefore, we sought to uncover new Fam20C substrates to determine the overall mechanistic role of Fam20C phosphorylation in the SR lumen. Focusing on luminal SR proteins that have been shown to regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in cardiac function, we identified several proteins that contain S-x-E motifs and are, therefore, potential Fam20C substrates; this includes calsequestrin 2 (CSQ2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Houle et al., 2004</xref>), stromal interaction molecule 1 (Stim1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2013</xref>), calumenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sahoo and Kim, 2010</xref>), sarcalumenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshida et al., 2005</xref>), calreticulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), and triadin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Terentyev et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We engineered triadin, calumenin, calreticulin, and sarcalumenin, each with a C-terminal FLAG-epitope tag, and co-expressed each of them with HA-epitope tagged Fam20C WT or a catalytically inactive Fam20C mutant, D478A, referred to as Fam20C kinase-inactive (KI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tagliabracci et al., 2012</xref>), in HEK293 cells, followed by <sup>32</sup>P-orthophosphate labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Following Flag-immunoprecipitation of cell extracts, immunoblotting, and autoradiography, each of these proteins was determined to be phosphorylated by WT Fam20C. It is likely that these phosphorylations will have multifaceted contributions to ER/SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation (see discussion). We note that triadin (and Stim-1, below) is known to be phosphorylated on its cytosolic portion, explaining the background in signal in the Fam20C KI lane. Next, we chose to focus on CSQ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Houle et al., 2004</xref>) and Stim1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2013</xref>) given the significance of their physiological roles.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41378.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fam20C phosphorylates luminal SR proteins and regulates CSQ2 polymerization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative autoradiograph and Flag immunoblot (IB) of Flag immunoprecipitates (IPs) of <sup>32</sup>P-orthophosphate-labeled HEK293 cells co-expressing HA-tagged WT or D478A kinase-inactive (KI) Fam20C with the indicated substrates (nÂ =Â 3).

It is intriguing that CSQ2 has a single, conserved S-x-E site (Ser385) on its C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the region of the protein necessary for proper Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shin et al., 2000</xref>) and polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park et al., 2003</xref>).

Stim1 was shown to be phosphorylated by Fam20C in cells and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>) using the same techniques as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, Stim1-Ser88Gly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), a mutation recently discovered in a patient with heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 2017</xref>) (see discussion), is less robustly phosphorylated than Stim1-WT in vitro and in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D and E</xref>), suggesting that Fam20C phosphorylates Stim1-Ser88. Next, we employed a recently developed approach to measure Stim1 activity in ER membranes that relies on an engineered cysteine in Stim1 (A230C) to capture the conformational change involving the interaction between paired luminal domains that accompanies its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirve et al., 2018</xref>). Stim1 activation involves a dramatic reorganization of the protein complex, where the transmembrane regions of two Stim1 molecules (where the engineered cysteine are) align close together, allowing the complex to extend and activate plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirve et al., 2018</xref>).

Moreover, this demonstrates that Fam20C plays a role in regulating cellular ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p><p>Using an alternative approach to study Fam20Câs role in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, we treated cells with thapsigargin, a SERCA inhibitor, which results in the release of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wiley et al., 2013</xref>). In WT and Fam20C shRNA knockdown (shFam20C) U2OS cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tagliabracci et al., 2015</xref>) we observed that thapsigargin-induced release of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> was reduced upon Fam20C knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), showing Fam20Câs role in maintaining ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage. Because dysregulation of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cells, we assessed WT and shFam20C U2OS cell lines for UPR induction using qRT-PCR to monitor levels of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a common UPR marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wiley et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). There was no basal UPR detected; however, shFam20C U2OS cells showed a robust expression of CHOP following stimulation with a mild amount of thapsigargin, at concentrations that did not elicit a response in WT cells. This suggests that the shFam20C cells were already compromised in their ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and were predisposed to Ca<sup>2+</sup> stress-induced induction of the UPR. Together, these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) suggest a general role for Fam20C in regulating ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41378.013</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Fam20C regulates ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single-cell [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i measurements in HeLa cells expressing Fam20C WT (nÂ =Â 156), Fam20C KI (nÂ =Â 139), or in non-transfected HeLa cells (HeLa; nÂ =Â 126).

Fam20C is the primary protein kinase within a small family of putative kinases, all of which have a signal peptide that guides them to the lumen of the ER/SR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tagliabracci et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tagliabracci et al., 2015</xref>). Interest in Fam20Câs role in heart function came from our observation that Fam20C phosphorylates HRC on Ser96 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pollak et al., 2017</xref>). DCM patients with the common HRC-Ser96Ala polymorphism develop deadly arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arvanitis et al., 2008</xref>), likely due to loss of Fam20C phosphorylation at that site. The clinical significance of Fam20C phosphorylation is highlighted by the fact that this polymorphism is predicted to be present in 60% of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tzimas et al., 2017</xref>), and that roughly one in 2,500 Americans has DCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamin et al., 2018</xref>). A comparison, however, of our results with prior studies suggests that Fam20Câs physiological roles extend beyond phosphorylation of HRC-Ser96. For example, HRC-Ser96Ala knock-in mice were only mildly deficient in cardiac function following aging in comparison to HRC-Ser96 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tzimas et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to HRC, here we have identified multiple novel Fam20C substrates that reside in the SR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). While our data indicate that these phosphorylations affect SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, dissecting the individual contribution of each substrate is likely to be very complex and remains to be determined. The biochemical functions of Fam20C phosphorylation remain mostly unknown but have been demonstrated in some instances. For example, Fam20C mediated phosphorylation of HRC regulates its binding to SERCA2a and triadin, the latter of which is important for preventing arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pollak et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that Fam20C phosphorylation of CSQ2 increases its ability to polymerize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This result is consistent with a previous report using phospho-mimetics of CSQ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sanchez et al., 2011</xref>). CSQ2 is expressed in cardiac muscle, while the closely related calsequestrin 1 (CSQ1) regulates SR function in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanchez et al., 2012</xref>). It is intriguing that CSQ2 has a disordered, acidic C-terminal tail which contains an S-x-E site, but CSQ1 does not. This suggests that CSQ2 is differentiated from CSQ1 via regulation by Fam20C phosphorylation. In response to increasing amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CSQ2 transitions from a monomer to higher-ordered polymeric states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">GyÃ¶rke and Terentyev, 2008</xref>). As a monomer, CSQ2 binds more effectively to triadin; upon polymerization, it more effectively sequesters Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Therefore, Fam20C phosphorylation likely effects CSQ2âs Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and its ability to bind to and regulate triadin. Interestingly, the physiologically critical KEKE motif of triadin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) contains an S-x-E site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Terentyev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobayashi et al., 2000</xref>), whose phosphorylation status may affect triadinâs ability to bind to its protein partners: HRC, CSQ2, and RyR2. Finally, sarcalumenin, calumenin, and calreticulin regulate cardiac function through their interactions with SERCA2a; we anticipate that their phosphorylation may alter their interactions with SERCA2a, similarly to HRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pollak et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We also show that Fam20C mediated phosphorylation of Stim1 shifts the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration dependence of the Stim1 conformational change and thereby favors Stim1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirve et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Given the location of the phosphorylation on the EF-hand motif, it is likely that it acts to modulate Stim1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, which is the basis of its activity as an ER/SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Soboloff et al., 2012</xref>); alternatively, Fam20C phosphorylation may induce a structural change favoring Stim1 activation. Interestingly, a recently identified mutation at the phosphorylation site (Stim1-Ser88Gly) has been linked to cardiac dysfunction in patients; importantly, this mutation causes Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 2017</xref>). This patient is one of three patients identified to date where a mutation to Stim1âs luminal EF-hand causes cardiac dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walter et al., 2015</xref>). However, further experimentation is necessary to directly show Fam20C mediated phosphorylation of Stim1 regulates cardiomyocyte SOCE.</p><p>It is intriguing that Stim1 is widely expressed in mammals, and therefore when mutated is involved in multiple pathological roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Soboloff et al., 2012</xref>), further suggesting a broad regulatory function for Fam20C in ER/SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) that is likely to be a general mechanism in all cells, which can be addressed by future studies. This is an extension of the previously appreciated role of Fam20C in the phosphorylation of only secreted proteins, and this extension is in-line with a recent report showing Fam20âs role in regulating ER redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Physiologically, we show that loss of murine cardiomyocyte <italic>Fam20c</italic> causes accelerated deterioration of cardiac function following various pathological stimuli, including aging, TAC, and isoproterenol infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). These severe functional consequences are likely due to loss of SR luminal protein phosphorylation. The mild alterations in cardiomyocyte performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and pressure development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) at baseline (2 months old) -- where no functional abnormalities were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) -- foreshadow the significant defects found in cardiomyocyte function and cardiac contractility and relaxation following aging which accompanies heart failure. Fam20C has not been previously demonstrated to phosphorylate SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling proteins or play a critical role in stress-induced heart failure development. There is broad precedent for this general concept, however, as CaMKII mediated RyR2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ling et al., 2009</xref>) and PKA mediated phospholamban phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braz et al., 2004</xref>) have established roles in the development of heart failure.</p><p>In summary, we present protein phosphorylation by Fam20C within the lumen of the ER/SR as an important regulatory mechanism that controls cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and cardiac pathophysiology. Most strikingly, aging led to significantly worsened systolic and diastolic function, associated with interstitial fibrosis, in Fam20C cKO mice. Interestingly, in adult patients, approximately 50% of those suffering from congestive heart failure display a preponderance of diastolic dysfunction, often associated with myocardial fibrosis as they age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ouzounian et al., 2008</xref>). By establishing Fam20C as a regulator during aging of myocardial form and function, this study portends an important molecular biologic role for Fam20C in the modern epidemic of congestive heart failure.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Simultaneous measurement of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) and cell contractility was assessed by using a video-based edge-detection system (IonOptix, Milton, MA). Briefly, cardiomyocytes were field stimulated at a frequency of 0.5 Hz using a pair of platinum wires placed on the opposite sides of the dish chamber and connected to a MyoPacer Field Stimulator (IonOptix). The cardiomyocytes being studied were displayed on the computer monitor using an IonOptix MyoCam camera. 15â25 individual myocytes were recorded and analyzed for each heart. The ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence at 340 nm and 380 nm (R) was calculated and the amplitude of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient was determined by the change between the basal and peak ratio (ÎR). The amplitude of cell contraction was assessed by % change of peak shortening, and the rate of cell relaxation was assessed by the time to 63% re-lengthening (Tau).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cloning</title><p>Human cDNAs were purchased from either Open Biosystems or DNASU.

Your article has been favorably reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: John D Scott (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript reports comprehensive analyses of the role of Fam20C, a relatively novel ER/SR lumen-localized protein kinase, in cardiac function. The authors show that FAM20C can phosphorylate calreticulin, calumenin, sarcalumenin and calsequestrin. A dead FAM20C, made by mutating aspartate 478 to an alanine, can no longer phosphorylate calsequestrin. Triadin phosphorylation, in contrast, is not abolished. The phosphorylation site on calsequestrin is S385, which is conserved in mammals. Phosphorylated CSQ2 aggregates more easily. Similarly, STIM1 is phosphorylated on S88 by FAM20C both in vitro and in vivo. FAM20C KO mice experience heart failure upon exposure to chemical stressors as well as aging. Their hearts show hypertrophy and fibrosis. The authors show that FAM20C activity combats cardiac stress in mice, their proposed mechanism involves changes to cardiac contractility and calcium transients and differential phosphorylation or ER proteins.</p><p>In general, the findings are interesting, supporting an important and novel pathophysiological functions for protein phosphorylation within the SR in regulating cardiac calcium handling and contractility. The manuscript is well suited for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers raise some concerns that are noted below. While additional data that address these issues would be useful, the authors can also choose to revise the manuscript in a way that makes clear the limitations in interpretation, without providing new data. In addition, the reviewers have provided a number of suggestions that could improve the manuscript. Please consider all of these in revising the manuscript.</p><p>Important points to address:</p><p>1) While the authors show that Fam20C can phosphorylate calsequestrin-2 (cardiac-specific isoform), STIM1, and other ER/SR proteins, the current data provide only a limited biochemical hint as to how this may impact calcium handling by the SR/ER. The loss of Fam20C appears to inhibit calsequestrin-2 oligomerization, which is predicted to decrease SR calcium storage. While data from HELA cells in Figure 8 appears consistent with decreased ER calcium storage, these cells likely express calsequestrin-1, not calsequestrin-2. Does Fam20C also regulate calsequestrin-1? Can the authors obtain evidence for decreased calcium storage in cardiomyocytes? Similarly, biochemical data indicate that Fam20C drives STIM1 dimerization (activation) at high calcium concentrations, which is predicted to result in store-operated calcium entry via Orai1 even at high calcium. Does the loss of Fam20C affect SOCE in cardiomyocytes or other cells? Without these functional data, there is some concern that the authors are over-interpreting the very indirect biochemical changes as important regulatory effects of Fam20C. Does higher turbidity necessarily correlate with formation of higher order oligomers and increased calcium binding to calsequestrin? Similarly, does the dimerization of STIM1 necessarily correlate with activation? Without such functional data, the mechanistic link between the loss of Fam20C and the cardiac phenotypes is rather unclear.</p><p>2) It appears from the manuscript that the data reporting and statistical analyses do not meet current expectations for transparency and rigor in several ways. Notably, the authors do not provide any explanation of their approach to data analysis using <italic>eLife</italic>'s supplementary transparent reporting form. First, there is no indication that several qualitative data sets (e.g., gels and blots in Figures 1A, C, D; Figures 2B-E) have been replicated. This is particularly problematic for the analysis of the STIM1-S88G mutant in Figure 2C, D, where the qualitative differences are not very striking/convincing, especially if the phosphorylation is &quot;eyeball&quot; normalized to levels of total protein on the gels. These studies need to be repeated using more quantitative approaches to show that there is in fact a significant difference. Second, the authors report mean Â± SEM data using bar graphs in several panels (e.g., Figure 3C, D), which can be very misleading. They should superimpose the individual data points on these bar graphs to provide a transparent indication of data variability (as they have done in several other panels), or they should use box/whisker graphs to depict data variability in cases where there are larger numbers of data points. Third, the statistical analyses are not adequate, and as such do not convincingly support the authors interpretations. It appears that the authors exclusively use t-tests to compare selected pairs of data sets, whereas the experiments are comparing data across two variable (genotype and age), such that a 2-way ANOVA is needed. We do not think this will have a big impact on interpretation of many data sets, but in some cases it might. For example, multiple panels of Figure 5 are not very convincing because it appears that a single &quot;outlier&quot; point may be driving a difference. Was an outlier test performed? Were data tested for a normal distribution? Similarly for Figure 4A at 9 months of age. Fourth, how were sample sizes determined for the in vivo studies? Fifth, all the gels and blots need to be labeled to indicate the positions of molecular weight markers.</p><p>Other points to consider:</p><p>1) The designation FAM20C DA for the kinase dead form of the enzyme is jargon. We suggest using a more clearly understood abbreviation.</p><p>2) How many times was the turbidity assay in Figure 1E performed. Since the effect of phosphorylation on calsequestrin 2 is modest this information should be included in the body of Figure 1.</p><p>3) The authors state in the legend for Figure 2E that &quot;Crosslinked, dimerized (active) Stim 1 is indicated by the upper arrow, and monomeric (inactive) Stim1 is indicated by the lower arrow&quot;. The reviewers feel that it would be more accurate to say that crosslinked Stim1 is multimerized. There is no real biochemical proof that the complex is only a dimer.</p><p>4) The mouse studies in Figure 4 are nice but the authors need to clearly indicate that red traces represent Fam20 -/- animals and that black traces represent floxed controls. This is an important point that complicates interpretation of the data. (please note that Figures 5 and 6 provide this information).</p><p>5) The in vivo data presented in this article are impressive and strongly support a role for FAM20C in cardiovascular disorders. Many of the effects that are shown in the physiological analysis are reminiscent of changes in the Î² adrenergic and other second messenger signaling pathways that cause heart disease. While these effects are clearly distinct from the findings of this article there may be some merit in adding something to the Discussion that puts the new findings of this work in context with this well-established literature.</p><p>6) For the experiments in Figure 1A, please clarify whether all the over-expressed proteins are exclusively localized with the ER, or does the over-expression result in some leak into the cytoplasm (which might impact the results).</p><p>7) In Figure 1B, the authors should indicate whether the highlighted S-X-E sequence motif is the only such conserved motif in calsequestrin-2.</p><p>8) In Figure 1C, it seems odd that the S385A mutant protein migrates more slowly than the WT because phosphorylation more typically reduces mobility. Is the gel correctly oriented?</p><p>9) The Stim1(A230C) dimerization assay in Figure 2E detecting supposedly activated dimeric confirmations of Stim1 could be explained in more detail for a diverse readership.</p><p>10) The title for Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 is not phrased very well: it may be better written as: &quot;Role of Fam20C in the acute hemodynamic response to Î²-adrenergic receptor activation.&quot;</p><p>11) In Figure 3, the meaning of the red/black traces/bars does not appear to be explained.</p><p>12) Figure 1E. Turbidity is a poor proxy for oligomerization but a good proxy for precipitation or polymerization. Maybe you want to call it &quot;polymerization&quot; or &quot;aggregation&quot; according to Wang 1998 Nat. Struct. Biol. 5, 476-483. Shin, Ma and Kim, 2000, shows interaction of CSQ with triadin but not CSQ oligomerization.</p><p>13) Figure 2E. WB image is either overexposed or at high contrast. Increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphorylation encourages STIM1 dimerization.</p><p>14) Figure 3.

Notably, this tail contains the only Fam20C S-x-E phosphorylation site on calsequestrin-2 (as noted in the third paragraph of the subsection âFam20C phosphorylates multiple SR regulatory proteins important for Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasisâ). Interestingly, calsequestrin-1 has a Fam20C site in an alternative location on the protein. While future work is necessary to determine if and how Fam20C regulates calsequestrin-1, it is overwhelmingly likely that the lack of the phosphorylation site on the C-terminal tail of calsequestrin-1 will make its biochemical response to Fam20C phosphorylation different than calsequestrin-2âs biochemical response. Importantly, it is likely that Fam20C mediated phosphorylation of Stim-1 is the cause of the effects demonstrated in the Hela cells (Figure 8A).</p><p>We chose to employ the turbidity assay to study calsequestrin-2, as several studies have used this as a basis for investigations of calsequestrin-2 polymerization (Sanchez et al., 2011). As noted below, and now in the manuscript, we state that turbidity is used to study polymerization, not oligomerization (subsection âFam20C phosphorylates multiple SR regulatory proteins important for Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasisâ, fourth paragraph). Future work involving additional experimental approaches is necessary to more completely determine Fam20Câs role in calsequestrin-2 oligomerization and calcium binding properties.</p><p>While we think that a thorough investigation of Fam20C mediated regulation of calcium storage and SOCE in cardiomyocytes will be very interesting, we feel that it is beyond the scope of our current study. We now indicate these limitations of our current study in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion. However, weâd like to note here that Hela cells have been a well-established model to study SOCE.</p><p>Our current study employs a recent but thoroughly developed method that relates Stim-1 mediated âdimerizationâ to Stim-1 activation (Hirve et al., 2018). In particular, we note that Fam20C mediated activation of SOCE is similar to the activation of SOCE demonstrated via Stim-1 activating mutants (Hirve et al., 2018), as described in the last paragraph of the subsection âFam20C regulates ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasisâ. This is suggestive yet not definitive evidence for a broader role for Fam20C regulation of Stim1 in other cell types. This is noted in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>Triadin has known cytosolic phosphorylations, which like Stim-1 causes a background of phosphorylation in the KI lane in Figure 1A, as noted in the paper (subsection âFam20C phosphorylates multiple SR regulatory proteins important for Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasisâ, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It appears from the manuscript that the data reporting and statistical analyses do not meet current expectations for transparency and rigor in several ways.

In addition, we employed densitometry to more accurately quantify the phosphorylation shown in both Figure 2C and D, which is now shown as newly generated Figure 2E.</p><p>The individual data points are now shown in Figure 3C and D. 2-way ANOVA tests were performed for the relevant datasets and are now reported within the figures.</p><p>We performed outlier and normalized distribution tests for all data sets from Figures 4 and 5. All data were normally distributed via the Shapiro-Wilk test, except for Figure 4A (max contractility at 9 months, cKO). We performed the Grubbs test for outliers and all datasets contained no outliers, except for Figure 4A (max contractility at 9 months, cKO) and Figure 5A (LVIDd at 9 months, cKO). However, it has been a long-standing practice of Dr. Kirk Petersonâs laboratory to report and include all experimental data collected in a given experiment, unless a clear error was identified. We strongly feel that our physiological datasets (Figure 4 and 5 in particular) do not contain outliers, and are instead genuine representations of the variation induced as a physiological consequence of the removal of Fam20C from cardiomyocytes. Therefore, we chose to include the data as is. Regardless, removal of these outliers would not change the fundamental conclusions that Fam20C cKO mice develop heart failure and diastolic dysfunction following aging in comparison to controls.</p><p>The sample sizes were determined by following the conventions of established literature, where 8-15 mice per group were used.</p><p>The gel markers are now included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points to consider:</p><p>1) The designation FAM20C DA for the kinase dead form of the enzyme is jargon.

(please note that Figures 5 and 6 provide this information).</p></disp-quote><p>Legends to indicate genotype are now indicated in all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The in vivo data presented in this article are impressive and strongly support a role for FAM20C in cardiovascular disorders. Many of the effects that are shown in the physiological analysis are reminiscent of changes in the Î² adrenergic and other second messenger signaling pathways that cause heart disease. While these effects are clearly distinct from the findings of this article there may be some merit in adding something to the Discussion that puts the new findings of this work in context with this well-established literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a section (line 345), including new references (Ling et al., 2009 and Braz et al., 2004), to contextualize our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) For the experiments in Figure 1A, please clarify whether all the over-expressed proteins are exclusively localized with the ER, or does the over-expression result in some leak into the cytoplasm (which might impact the results).</p></disp-quote><p>Our lab has previously over-expressed several secretory pathway proteins and monitored their locations via immunofluorescence (Tagliabracci et al., 2012; 2016). In every case, the proteins appear to be expressed only within the secretory pathway. Therefore, over-expression of proteins does not cause any leakage into the cytoplasm. Importantly, both triadin and Stim-1 are transmembrane proteins that contain cytosolic portions that have been documented as phosphorylated. This is now mentioned in the paper (subsection âFam20C phosphorylates multiple SR regulatory proteins important for Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasisâ, second paragraph), which fully accounts for the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 1B, the authors should indicate whether the highlighted S-X-E sequence motif is the only such conserved motif in calsequestrin-2.</p></disp-quote><p>It is now indicated that calsequestrin-2 has a single S-x-E sequence in the protein in both the text (subsection âFam20C phosphorylates multiple SR regulatory proteins important for Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasisâ, third paragraph) and the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 1C, it seems odd that the S385A mutant protein migrates more slowly than the WT because phosphorylation more typically reduces mobility. Is the gel correctly oriented?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the gel is correctly oriented. Multiple possible explanations exist for why the protein runs slower, such as changes to the proteinâs glycosylation pattern. A detailed understanding of this is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The Stim1(A230C) dimerization assay in Figure 2E detecting supposedly activated dimeric confirmations of Stim1 could be explained in more detail for a diverse readership.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a more general description of this assay (subsection âFam20C phosphorylates multiple SR regulatory proteins important for Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasisâ, last paragraph) and included a better description in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The title for Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 is not phrased very well: it may be better written as: &quot;Role of Fam20C in the acute hemodynamic response to Î²-adrenergic receptor activation.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the title to the one suggested here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In Figure 3, the meaning of the red/black traces/bars does not appear to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>It is now explained in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 1E. Turbidity is a poor proxy for oligomerization but a good proxy for precipitation or polymerization. Maybe you want to call it &quot;polymerization&quot; or &quot;aggregation&quot; according to Wang 1998 Nat. Struct. Biol. 5, 476-483. Shin, Ma and Kim, 2000, shows interaction of CSQ with triadin but not CSQ oligomerization.</p></disp-quote><p>The nomenclature was changed from oligomerization to polymerization. A new reference (Park et al., 2003) was added to describe calsequestrin-2 oligomerization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Figure 2E. WB image is either overexposed or at high contrast. Increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphorylation encourages STIM1 dimerization.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that the western blot shows an appropriate range of contrast to support the conclusion that Stim1 can be activated by Fam20C under high calcium conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Figure 3. Please state red (FAM20C KO) and black (WT) in figure key or legend.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been done.</p><p>As a final note, the wording of a few sections of the manuscript were slightly altered for added clarity. We also decided to slightly alter the presentation of the data in Figure 8B.</p></body></sub-article></article>
