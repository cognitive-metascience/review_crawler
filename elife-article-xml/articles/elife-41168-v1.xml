cytotoxicity is ill-defined. Previously we showed that HeLa cells readjust homeostasis upon proteostatically driven ER stress, triggered by inducible bulk expression of secretory immunoglobulin M heavy chain (μ<sub>s</sub>) thanks to the unfolded protein response (UPR; Bakunts et al., 2017). Here we show that conditions that prevent that an excess of the ER resident chaperone (and UPR target gene) BiP over µ<sub>s</sub> is restored lead to µ<sub>s</sub>-driven proteotoxicity, i.e. abrogation of HRD1-mediated ER-associated degradation (ERAD), or of the UPR, in particular the ATF6α branch. Such conditions are tolerated instead upon removal of the BiP-sequestering first constant domain (C<sub>H</sub>1) from µ<sub>s</sub>. Thus, our data define proteostatic ER stress to be a specific consequence of inadequate BiP availability, which both the UPR and ERAD redeem.</p></abstract><kwd-group

proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)—a condition referred to as ER stress—activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which, in turn, mitigates the stress, most notably through enhancing the ER chaperone content to boost the protein folding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). What defines ER stress, and how ER stress may engender cytotoxicity, however, are poorly understood issues. Moreover, it is still debated what feature of ER stress activates the UPR. An important reason why these are still open questions is the wide-spread use of ER stress-eliciting drugs, such as tunicamycin (Tm), which inhibits N-glycosylation, or thapsigargin (Tg), which causes Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). These drugs have pleiotropic effects and are inherently cytotoxic, hence obscuring important aspects of how ER homeostasis can be restored by virtue of the UPR or not. To overcome the shortcomings of ER stress-eliciting drugs, we recently have developed a HeLa cell-based model for proteostatically driven ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>). Inducible overexpression of the IgM subunits µ<sub>s</sub> and the λ light chain, in stoichiometric amounts, leads to bulk secretion of IgM with little if any UPR activation. In the absence of λ, however, µ<sub>s</sub> is retained in the ER, and maximally activates the three main UPR branches, governed by IRE1α, PERK, and respectively, ATF6α. Yet, the cells successfully adapt to the proteostatic insult by expanding the ER both in size and in chaperone content, such that cell viability and growth are unaffected in the process, and UPR signaling subsides to a submaximal amplitude once homeostasis is restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The ER resident chaperone BiP stands out in the course of the adaptation to µ<sub>s</sub> expression in two ways. First, ER stress sensing and UPR signaling occur in a µ<sub>s</sub>/BiP ratiometric fashion, that is the amplitude of UPR signaling is maximal when µ<sub>s</sub> levels eclipse those of BiP, which is sequestered through binding to µ<sub>s</sub>, while UPR signaling subsides to submaximal output when an excess of BiP over µ<sub>s</sub> is restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>). ER homeostatic readjustment is due to the UPR, since BiP is a key UPR target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Second, ER homeostatic readjustment to µ<sub>s</sub> expression causes a ∼10-fold increase of BiP levels overall, which entails that BiP shifts from about one tenth to about one third of the total protein mass in the ER, such that BiP is the only chaperone in the ER of which the levels outmatch those of µ<sub>s</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The two main models that have been proposed for UPR activation are that it entails i) dissociation of BiP from the lumenal domains of the main ER stress sensors, IRE1α, PERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>) and ATF6α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shen et al., 2002</xref>), and ii) direct binding of unfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karagöz et al., 2017</xref>), including the Ig heavy chain C<sub>H</sub>1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karagöz et al., 2017</xref>), to these sensors. Based on insights obtained from µ<sub>s</sub>-driven ER stress, we argue that these two UPR activation models are not mutually exclusive. Rather, the two models are complementary and should be unified, since in a three-way competition between UPR sensors, BiP, and an ER client protein (µ<sub>s</sub>) for binding one another, the ratio of UPR sensors bound to the client versus those bound to BiP most robustly report on the client/BiP ratio, to which indeed the UPR signaling amplitude correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>HeLa cells tolerate genetic ablation of the main three UPR transducers, but expression of µ<sub>s</sub> in the context of UPR-ablated cells causes synthetic lethality through apoptosis, underscoring the key role the UPR has in restoring ER homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>). In this study we exploited this synthetic lethality to define how ER stress becomes proteotoxic.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IRE1α and PERK are expendable, but ATF6α is key for µ<sub>s</sub>-provoked ER homeostatic readjustment</title><p>To investigate in detail how the UPR sustains ER homeostatic readjustment to bulk µ<sub>s</sub> expression, we exploited cells in which IRE1α was deleted and PERK and ATF6α were silenced with good efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>), either individually or in combinations. Surprisingly, ablation of IRE1α and PERK (either individually or in combination) had negligible effects on viability and growth of µ<sub>s</sub>-expressing cells, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), or on ATF6α activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, IRE1α and PERK are dispensable for restoring ER homeostasis upon bulk µ<sub>s</sub> expression, and ER stress levels are not enhanced in their absence (although there is some ATF6α activation already under basal conditions when IRE1α and PERK are ablated; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Conversely, in µ<sub>s</sub>-expressing cells no AMPylation occurred upon CHX treatment at any time upon the onset of µ<sub>s</sub> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that the vast majority of BiP is permanently engaged in chaperoning µ<sub>s</sub> even though the BiP pool is expanding massively in response to µ<sub>s</sub> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>As BiP stands out as a key chaperone for orphan µ<sub>s</sub>, we reasoned that the level of BiP at basal conditions is a key determinant for µ<sub>s</sub>-driven ER stress susceptibility. To test this idea, we created a derivative of the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> cell line with an integrated copy of the hamster HSPA5 gene that encodes BiP under control of doxycycline (Dox). The induction of µ<sub>s</sub> with Mif leads to it being the most abundantly transcribed gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>) in the cells and concomitant induction of other transgenes would lead to competition for the transcription and/or translation machineries (not shown), thereby mitigating µ<sub>s</sub> expression and, hence, µ<sub>s</sub>-driven ER stress by default. We therefore decided to pre-emptively enhance BiP levels with Dox at least ~10 fold prior to induction of µ<sub>s</sub> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Even though exogenously driven BiP transcription ceased after that, exogenous (hamster) BiP levels remained high for a prolonged time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>In line with the notion that ER stress sensing in the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> model occurs in a µ<sub>s</sub>/BiP ratiometric fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>), and in line with earlier reports that BiP overexpression dampens UPR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA splicing and upregulation of the UPR target GRP94 occurred with a delay when BiP levels were exogenously boosted as compared to when BiP was at endogenous levels, in spite of the similar extent and kinetics of µ<sub>s</sub> accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Altogether the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> model thus provides further support that sensing of ER stress correlates with the extent of the folding machinery being engaged in chaperoning its clients, and that BiP sequestration by client proteins appears to serve as the main proxy for that.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Turnover of µ<sub>s</sub> as afforded by ERAD is remarkably robust</title><p>While µ<sub>s</sub> levels increase, and the ER expands (~3–4 fold compared to basal levels), as wild-type cells are still adapting to the proteostatic insult, there is no further build-up of µ<sub>s</sub> levels and ER expansion after ~2–3 days once homeostasis is restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>), which implies that at that stage the influx of µ<sub>s</sub> molecules into the ER must be matched by countermeasures. Translational attenuation through PERK activation can alleviate the burden on the ER folding machinery by diminishing the input of nascent clients entering the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harding et al., 1999</xref>). Yet, we ruled out that PERK-driven translational attenuation was a key determinant for ER homeostatic readjustment in the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> model, considering that PERK ablation hardly impeded cell growth upon µ<sub>s</sub> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Accordingly, there was only a marginal reduction in overall protein synthesis (being at the lowest ~80% of that before induction) that was moreover transient (i.e. only manifest during the first 16 hr of µ<sub>s</sub>-expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Following the same reasoning, we also ruled out that regulated IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hollien et al., 2009</xref>) of mRNAs that encode ER client proteins (and thereby limiting their influx into the ER) is important for homeostatic readjustment upon µ<sub>s</sub> expression, since ablation of IRE1α had negligible impact on cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Nevertheless, the build-up of BiP levels (~2 fold further increase after 3 days), could not keep pace with the augmented accumulation of µ<sub>s</sub> (~3 fold further increase after 3 days) upon ERAD inhibition, such that µ<sub>s</sub> reached levels in the ER that were at about a 1:1 stoichiometry with BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Indeed, aggregation of µ<sub>s</sub> increased when ERAD was defective, as judged by µ<sub>s</sub> shifting more towards heavier fractions in HRD1 KO than in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, under those conditions the chaperoning machinery becomes limiting, similarly as upon ablation of IRE1α and/or ATF6α in ERAD-competent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>We previously estimated the volume of the ER under basal conditions to be (0.10–0.12)<sup>3/2</sup>≈3–4% of the cytoplasmic volume, and upon 3 days of µ<sub>s</sub> expression to be (0.18–0.20)<sup>3/2</sup>≈7–8% of the cytoplasmic volume, corresponding to a ~ 2–3 fold increase of ER volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>). Upon ERAD inhibition with Kif the ER did not markedly expand in non-µ<sub>s</sub>-expressing cells. In µ<sub>s</sub>-expressing cells, instead, ERAD inhibition caused the area of ER staining within the cytoplasm to reach 30–35%, which on a rough estimate would account for (0.3–0.35)<sup>3/2</sup>≈17–20% of the cytoplasmic volume, implying that the ER had expanded ~6–7 fold since the onset of µ<sub>s</sub>-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>).</p><p>We concluded that curtailing the µ<sub>s</sub> load by ERAD is essential for the cells to cope with µ<sub>s</sub> expression in bulk. ER homeostatic failure upon ERAD inhibition coincided with an inadequacy to raise BiP levels in sufficient excess over those of µ<sub>s</sub> and, hence, with its ‘under-chaperoning’, in spite of the impressive BiP upregulation and ER expansion at large. Thus, in absence of ERAD, not only the chronic maximal UPR activation, but also the µ<sub>s</sub>–driven proteotoxicity appear to be due to BiP running short, similarly as when UPR signaling was compromised upon ablation of ATF6α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Sequestration of BiP is both necessary and sufficient for UPR activation and ER stress-provoked proteotoxicity</title><p>In plasma cells BiP stringently interacts with µ<sub>s</sub> through the C<sub>H</sub>1 domain, until it is displaced by the light chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bole et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), which makes µ<sub>s</sub> an unusual ER client. Evolutionary pressure against secretion of orphan µ<sub>s</sub> (i.e. unaccompanied by the light chain) must have been extraordinarily high for obvious immunological reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anelli and van Anken, 2013</xref>), which would explain the exceptionally strong affinity of the C<sub>H</sub>1 domain for BiP, that is to let BiP mediate stringent ER retention of unpaired µ<sub>s</sub>. Thus, we reasoned that removal of the BiP binding C<sub>H</sub>1 domain from µ<sub>s</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), would offer an ideal tool to validate whether limitations in BiP availability define both the amplitude of UPR activation as well as any proteotoxicity that would ensue from overexpression of ER client proteins. In line with our model, µ<sub>s</sub>∆C<sub>H</sub>1 hardly activated the UPR, as shown for the IRE1α and PERK branches, despite being expressed at similar levels as µ<sub>s</sub> wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Overexpression of BiP dampens UPR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>), which we confirm with the data presented here, while inactivating BiP with the AB5 subtilase cytotoxin acutely causes ER stress and UPR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paton et al., 2006</xref>). Yet, by employment of a proteostatic stimulus with a single well-defined BiP binding module as the source of ER stress, we have provided here experimental evidence that defines both proteostatic ER stress, and the resulting activation of the UPR, to be the specific consequence of insufficient BiP availability. Both the UPR and ERAD redress the relative BiP shortage, and thus counteract that the proteostatic stress becomes proteotoxic. BiP indeed has been acclaimed as the master regulator of ER function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hendershot, 2004</xref>), and various cytotoxic consequences may follow from the excessive sequestering of BiP by µ<sub>s</sub> that precludes BiP from attending to its other functions. For instance, BiP closes off the translocon, and efflux of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER into the cytosol through poorly gated translocons may already be sufficient to cause apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schäuble et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our data emphasize that proteotoxicity stemming from the accumulation of client proteins in the ER is not the result of UPR signaling, as often is assumed from the notion that the UPR can initiate pro-apoptotic pathways. Instead, the UPR foremost counteracts proteotoxicity by inducing the ER resident folding machinery (most in particular BiP). In light of our data, the capacity of the UPR to switch from cytoprotective to pro-apoptotic signaling may well have arisen in metazoans to pre-emptively eliminate cells in which restoration of ER homeostasis is unachievable, and, hence, cell death has become inevitable.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, our results furthermore highlight that PERK and IRE1α are dispensable for successful ER homeostatic readjustment to the µ<sub>s</sub> stimulus in HeLa cells. Apparently, the PERK-mediated translational block, which is only transient, offers negligible advantage when cells face a sudden proteostatic insult that sequesters BiP (and/or the ER chaperone machinery at large) in a persistent manner. PERK-mediated translational attenuation instead may be required in particular to sustain episodic secretory activity, such as in β-cells of the pancreas. PERK KO mice indeed suffer mostly from degeneration of tissues with episodic secretory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, requirements for the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway seem to be tissue-specific. Both deletion of IRE1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Urano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>) and of XBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reimold et al., 2000</xref>) cause embryonic lethality, but XBP1 KO mice are rescued with an XBP1 transgene specifically expressed in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2005</xref>), while IRE1α KO mice are rescued when the placenta expresses IRE1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iwawaki et al., 2009</xref>), and the resulting rescued mice display relatively mild symptoms, that ishyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, and decreased antibody titers, despite the lack of IRE1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iwawaki et al., 2010</xref>). In line with our findings, homeostatic readjustment to ER stress in most mammalian tissues seems to rely mainly on ATF6 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>), that is ATF6α, and its related ER stress sensor ATF6β. The ATF6α/β double KO confers embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). At present, it is unclear whether embryonic lethality of the ATF6α/β double KO can be rescued, for instance through enhancement of other UPR branches.</p><p>Finally, since proteotoxicity due to the accumulation of (mutant) proteins in the ER seems to play a key role in various types of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anelli and Sitia, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao and Kaufman, 2014</xref>), our insights may be of relevance for the design of drugs aimed at alleviating ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hetz and Papa, 2018</xref>), and hence proteotoxicity stemming from ER stress. We argue that pharmacological intervention against pathogenic ER stress foremost should promote a favorable ratio of BiP levels over those of its disease-causing client protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All assays were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>), except that in addition, along the same principles as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>), the following cell lines were derived by clonal selection from either HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> or HeLa-MifON, as summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>: HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> HRD1 KO, and HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub>-BiP<sup>H</sup>, which inducibly (by Dox) expresses hamster BiP, HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub>∆C<sub>H</sub>1, which inducibly (by Mif) expresses µ<sub>s</sub>∆C<sub>H</sub>1, and HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub>∆C<sub>H</sub>1/V<sub>L</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1, which inducibly (by Mif) expresses µ<sub>s</sub>∆C<sub>H</sub>1 in combination with V<sub>L</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1.

The model entails HeLa cells transfected with inducible IgM heavy-chain μs in presence or absence of λ light chain. Without light-chain, μs expression causes what the authors refer to as &quot;proteostatically driven ER stress&quot;, by contrast to less direct ER stress induced by drugs such as thapsigargin or tunicamycin, which is then resolved via the unfolded protein response (UPR). In the present study, they use this model to examine the relative importance of the major ER chaperone, BiP (known to be critical for IgM secretion by plasma cells), and the three UPR branches, IRE1, PERK and ATF6, in the successful resolution of ER stress.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to show that BiP's sequestration to μs is the major cause of cytotoxicity as claimed by demonstrating that the sole over-expression of BiP reverts the phenotype. This is important as other ATF6α target genes such as PDI and GRP94 might also impact the cellular fitness.</p><p>2) The knockdown levels or knockout phenotype of the transducers needs to analyzed by blotting and be included in the figures.</p><p>3) The physiological or pathophysiological relevance of the findings, e.g., for IgM-producing plasma cells, for other specialized secretory cell types, or more broadly to any cell that folds proteins in its ER, remains unknown. As such, some of the conclusions in the title and text are overstated. The effect of μs expression on Ig-producing plasma cells (such as a multiple myeloma cell line) should be examined.</p><p>4) The claims of the paper need to be tuned down to match more closely what was actually shown. For example, this paper does not distinguish between the two main models of UPR activation as implied in the Introduction. The chosen client binds to both Ire1 and BiP. Furthermore, the discussion regarding mouse KO phenotypes imply that ATF6 is more generally important in diverse cell types than IRE1 or PERK. While this may be true, the model used here to underscore ATF6 may be more specifically relevant to IgM production by plasma cells than to other types of cells. In the same vein, the authors should qualify more clearly that their conclusions are limited so far to the context of their model system, and may or may not be more generally applicable depending on further studies in other models and contexts.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41168.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to show that BiP's sequestration to μs is the major cause of cytotoxicity as claimed by demonstrating that the sole over-expression of BiP reverts the phenotype.

To that end we placed BiP under control of doxycycline (Dox) in the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> cells. Since µ<sub>s</sub> is the most highly expressed transcript in these cells when they are induced with mifepristone (Mif), over-expression of another gene (i.e. BiP) at the same time leads to attenuation of µ<sub>s</sub> expression, as there will be competition for the transcription and/or translation machinery, which would confound the interpretation of results. Therefore, we decided to pre-emptively upregulate BiP through Dox before driving µ<sub>s</sub> expression with Mif. As such, we found that BiP levels could be increased substantially (we estimated it to reach levels of at least 1 order of magnitude higher). Upon subsequent µ<sub>s</sub> expression (while removing Dox), we witnessed that µ<sub>s</sub> induction was similar with or without pre-boosted BiP levels, while BiP levels remained highly elevated in the cells that were pre-boosted to express BiP. UPR activation, however, was delayed, as judged by kinetics of XBP1 mRNA splicing, and upregulation of the UPR target GRP94. These results further support that UPR activation primarily reflects how much client protein (µ<sub>s</sub>) builds up in the ER in relation to available BiP. We added a figure displaying these findings and discuss them in the text.</p><p>We argue that under conditions of ERAD inhibition, BiP cannot keep pace with µ<sub>s</sub> levels, which correlates with cytotoxicity. The reviewers argue that if a shortage of BiP indeed leads to cell death that boosting BiP levels should offer protection against cytotoxicity. That idea is attractive, but in practice we obtained preliminary findings that cells suffer in the longer run too when we pre-emptively increase BiP levels and subsequently drive µ<sub>s</sub> expression (not shown). As is clear from the results described above, cells with pre-emptively boosted BiP levels signal through the UPR with a delay, and thus UPR targets are upregulated with a delay (as shown for GRP94). Apparently, the overall choreography of the response is perturbed in a way that interferes with homeostatic readjustment, but not necessarily similar to the conditions that ensue from BiP running short. We feel that it would not be meaningful to include these findings in the manuscript, as it would lead to convoluted speculations about what the cause(s) of cytotoxicity would be under conditions of a rather artificial form of ER homeostatic failure (i.e. when levels of BiP are preemptively boosted prior to µ<sub>s</sub> expression). That said, we provide various lines of evidence throughout the manuscript that implicate relative BiP scarcity with cytotoxicity, which is why we feel inclined to discuss that correlation in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The knockdown levels or knockout phenotype of the transducers needs to analyzed by blotting and be included in the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>The ablation efficiency of the UPR sensors has been shown as a supplementary figure to Bakunts et al. already, which is cited for this purpose, as is custom. Moreover, from the current figures it is apparent that when IRE1α is ablated ipso facto no splicing of XBP1 mRNA occurs, no CHOP upregulation ensues when PERK is ablated, and that ATF6α itself and upregulation of its downstream targets GRP94 and PDI are undetectable upon ATF6α silencing. We therefore consider that the knockdown efficiency of the three UPR transducers can be reliably inferred from these functional readouts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The physiological or pathophysiological relevance of the findings, e.g., for IgM-producing plasma cells, for other specialized secretory cell types, or more broadly to any cell that folds proteins in its ER, remains unknown. As such, some of the conclusions in the title and text are overstated. The effect of μs expression on Ig-producing plasma cells (such as a multiple myeloma cell line) should be examined.</p></disp-quote><p>We and others have studied the effect of IgM production in plasma cells before. The main conclusion from those endeavors pertaining to ER homeostasis (e.g. van Anken et al., 2003) is that ER expansion already precedes IgM production, as it is (at least initially) developmentally driven (i.e. driven by B cell activation). Ectopically inducible expression of µ<sub>s</sub> in otherwise quiescent B lymphocytes analogous to that in the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> model would be interesting, but B lymphocytes are poorly amenable to genetic engineering and, thus far, our attempts have been unsuccessful. However, it is tempting to speculate that also in B lymphocytes such ectopically induced µ<sub>s</sub> expression readily would lead to ER stress along similar lines as in the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> model, considering that there is this pre-emptive ER expansion prior to bulk IgM production, apparently to avoid such ER stress.</p><p>Most multiple myelomas and/or lymphomas already express Ig subunits in bulk and, consequently, these cells have an ER that is already adapted to the bulk Ig load. For similar reasons as for quiescent B lymphocytes, myelomas and lymphomas are unruly when it comes to their genetic manipulation. For that reason, we exploited some historical mouse myeloma cell lines that were already available in our freezer, namely NS0 (which is famous for being the cell line from which for the first time hybridomas were created by Cesar Milstein and colleagues), and Nµ1. NS0 had been specifically selected to not express any Ig subunits but J-chains (with the hybridoma idea in mind), while Nµ1 was derived from NS0 already in the 1980s having the µ<sub>s</sub> cassette genomically integrated. The inducible expression system (with sodium butyrate) that was available at the time is less sophisticated than what is currently the standard. Nevertheless, we assessed XBP1 mRNA splicing in both cell lines but there was no splicing in either cell line even upon sodium butyrate treatment. Apparently, these cells (likely due to their being derived from plasma cells) have such a robust ER that further induction of µ<sub>s</sub> expression posed no detectable ER stress. Accordingly, with a standard tunicamycin dose (5 µg/ml), no splicing was detected in NS0, even after a 4 hr treatment. Yet, the Nµ1 that were induced to expressed µ<sub>s</sub> showed some splicing at that time point, indicating that tunicamycin and µ<sub>s</sub> expression synergized to cause ER stress.</p><p>Along the same lines, we found that an endometrial cell line (T-HESC), which is another model for professional secretory cells, is highly refractory to tunicamycin treatment (based on the lack of XBP1 splicing – not shown), again likely because they have such an expanded ER already. Moreover, while secretion of various cargo proteins (such as collagens and prolactin) increases when these cells are triggered to decidualize, there is no XBP1 mRNA splicing detectable nor even an increase in BiP transcripts. Thus, cells that have undergone a developmental program to become professional secretors are much more ER stress resistant than non-professional secretory cells (such as HeLa). We feel that these insights have too many ramifications to be included as a control in the current manuscript, and, instead, merit a separate manuscript dedicated exclusively to how ER stress in professional secretory cells may differ from that in non-professional secretors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The claims of the paper need to be tuned down to match more closely what was actually shown. For example, this paper does not distinguish between the two main models of UPR activation as implied in the Introduction. The chosen client binds to both Ire1 and BiP.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not distinguish between the two models; our data support both models of UPR activation, which anyway are not mutually exclusive, but instead complementary. We witness through several experimental setups in both Bakunts et al. and the current manuscript that UPR activation is not correlated to the amount of accumulating protein in the ER, nor to the (depletion) levels of BiP per se, as would be the case if either model on its own would explain UPR activation. As we argued already in Bakunts et al., it is the ratio of client/BiP which is the best predictor of UPR activation amplitude, which best fits with a unified model, since the ratio of client bound to UPR sensors versus BiP bound to UPR sensors more robustly reflects the client/BiP ratio than either complex on its own would do. That aside, considering that the two models are complementary, the discussion on which of the two models is correct – in our opinion – is less central, which is why we put this reasoning forward again also in the Introduction of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the discussion regarding mouse KO phenotypes imply that ATF6 is more generally important in diverse cell types than IRE1 or PERK. While this may be true, the model used here to underscore ATF6 may be more specifically relevant to IgM production by plasma cells than to other types of cells. In the same vein, the authors should qualify more clearly that their conclusions are limited so far to the context of their model system, and may or may not be more generally applicable depending on further studies in other models and contexts.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon careful rereading of the particular section in the Discussion, we adapted the text to be more specific. We disagree with the reviewers that the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> model is a model for plasma cells (since neither J nor light chains are expressed). As we envisioned it, the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> model recapitulates how a non-professional secretory cell homeostatically readjusts to the accumulation of a misfolded or orphan client protein in the ER (for instance due to a genetic disease or due to a somatic mutation), which then sequesters the chaperone machinery, in particular BiP (as a multitude of such ill-fated ER clients would do). Certainly, as discussed in Bakunts et al., the HeLa-µ<sub>s</sub> model better recapitulates such (patho-)physiological events than drug-elicited ER stress does.</p><p>We do agree with the reviewers that, depending on the client protein, different type of responses may ensue, which is why we included in the manuscript the non-BiP sequestering µ∆C<sub>H</sub>1, which in fact fails to induce a robust UPR. Moreover, cell types vary in their levels of ER chaperones and UPR transducers, as is also evident from our response above to point 3, but we feel that we would merely state the obvious to suggest that such variability would lead to variability in UPR signaling once these cells are challenged by stressful conditions in the ER.</p></body></sub-article></article>
