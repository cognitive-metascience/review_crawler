of Gram-negative bacteria, an organelle that shields the underlying peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall. Both LPS and PG are essential cell envelope components that are synthesized independently and assembled by dedicated transenvelope multiprotein complexes. We have identified a point-mutation in the gene for O-antigen ligase (WaaL) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> that causes LPS to be modified with PG subunits, intersecting these two pathways. Synthesis of the PG-modified LPS (LPS*) requires ready access to the small PG precursor pool but does not weaken cell wall integrity, challenging models of precursor sequestration at PG assembly machinery. LPS* is efficiently transported to the cell surface without impairing OM function. Because LPS* contains the canonical vancomycin binding site, these surface-exposed molecules confer increased vancomycin-resistance by functioning as molecular decoys that titrate the antibiotic away from its intracellular target. This unexpected LPS glycosylation fuses two potent pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05334.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05334.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05334.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tiny Gram-negative bacteria are one of humankind's deadliest foes, causing infections of wounds and the bloodstream that are very hard to treat. Many Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to several common antibiotics, and the few treatments available that can successfully kill the bacteria are often also toxic to the patients. Understanding how these bacteria elude antibiotics could help scientists develop better, less toxic treatments.</p><p>Most bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall that helps protect the bacteria and gives them structure. Many broad-spectrum antibiotics, including penicillin and vancomycin, work by interfering with how this protective wall is built from molecules called peptidoglycans. However, Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane that prevents many antibiotics from reaching the cell wall, and so the antibiotics are unable to kill the bacteria.</p><p>The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is made up of sugars and fatty molecules called lipids. Recently, scientists discovered a mutation that interferes with the movement of the lipid and sugar molecules that make up the outer membrane, which compromises this protective layer and makes the bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics.</p><p>To learn more about how this mutation interferes with the defenses of the Gram-negative bacteria <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Grabowicz et al. searched for compensating mutations that can counteract it and restore the antibiotic resistance of these mutant bacteria. The search revealed that a mutation in a gene called <italic>waaL</italic> increases <italic>E. coli'</italic>s resistance to vancomycin, but not to other antibiotics<italic>.</italic> The gene encodes an enzyme, and the mutant form of the enzyme attaches some peptidoglycans to the surface of the outer membrane instead of incorporating them into the cell wall. The stray peptidoglycans on the cell's surface act as decoys, binding to vancomycin and keeping the drug from reaching its true target—the cell wall. The decoy strategy is similar to a mechanism used by Gram-positive bacteria—which lack a protective outer membrane—to resist vancomycin treatment, which also involves creating sites that bind the drug and keep it from its target.</p><p>Vancomycin is not currently used clinically to treat <italic>E. coli</italic> or other Gram-negative infections because these bacteria are naturally quite resistant for other reasons. However, Grabowicz et al.'s findings do demonstrate how quickly bacteria can adapt and produce new defenses to antibiotics when old strategies fail.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05334.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05334.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>lipopolysaccharide</kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>vancomycin</kwd><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>cell envelope</kwd><kwd>outer membrane</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM034821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grabowicz</surname><given-names>Marcin</given-names></name><name><surname>Silhavy</surname><given-names>Thomas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM066174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andres</surname><given-names>Dorothee</given-names></name><name><surname>Lebar</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name><name><surname>Kahne</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P300P2_147905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malojčić</surname><given-names>Goran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM103056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lebar</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PA00P3_134194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malojčić</surname><given-names>Goran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A single mutation in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> connects two essential cell envelope assembly pathways and confers vancomycin resistance by displaying molecular decoys at the cell surface.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Main text</title><p>A peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall is an essential extracytoplasmic feature of most bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singer et al., 1989</xref>); this essentiality has made its biogenesis a fruitful target for antibiotics, including vancomycin and penicillin. The cell wall is directly exposed to the extracellular milieu in Gram-positive bacteria, but is shielded in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and other Gram-negative species by a highly selective permeability barrier formed by the outer membrane (OM). The OM prevents influx of antibiotics, such as vancomycin, restricting their access to intracellular targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eggert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ruiz et al., 2005</xref>). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) forms the surface-exposed outer leaflet of the OM and is key to the barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Osborn et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kamio and Nikaido, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nikaido, 2003</xref>). LPS is a glycolipid consisting of a ‘lipid A’ anchor within the bilayer, and a set of covalently attached distal ‘core’ saccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raetz and Whitfield, 2002</xref>). LPS is made at the cytosolic leaflet of the inner membrane (IM) before being flipped to the periplasmic leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 1998</xref>). A transenvelope complex of seven <underline>l</underline>ipo<underline>p</underline>olysaccharide <underline>t</underline>ransport proteins (LptABCDEFG) delivers LPS from the IM to the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ruiz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chng et al., 2010a</xref>). A sub-complex of the β-barrel LptD and lipoprotein LptE resides within the OM and accomplishes the final step of inserting LPS into the outer leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chng et al., 2010b</xref>).</p><p>A recently described <italic>lptE</italic> mutation (<italic>lptE613</italic>) causes defective LPS transport and leads to increased antibiotic sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malojčić et al., 2014</xref>). To better understand the basis of the <italic>lptE613</italic> defect, we isolated spontaneous suppressors that restored antibiotic resistance. One such vancomycin-resistant suppressor mapped to the <italic>waaL</italic> gene, the product of which is an IM glycosyltransferase that attaches O-antigen (O-Ag) oligosaccharides to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ruan et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, the suppressed strain is certainly no more vancomycin sensitive than is the corresponding wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, this suppressor (<italic>waaL15</italic> herein) was not specific for <italic>lptE613</italic> or even for LPS transport defects. The <italic>waaL15</italic> mutation increases vancomycin resistance in strains carrying <italic>bamB</italic> or <italic>bamE</italic> null mutations that disrupt the OM barrier by causing defects in β-barrel protein assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ricci and Silhavy, 2012</xref>). Moreover, <italic>waaL15</italic> also increases vancomycin-resistance even in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The suppressor does not qualitatively improve the OM barrier, since it did not increase resistance against other antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). So, <italic>waaL15</italic> provides a vancomycin-specific resistance mechanism across different strains.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05334.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A mutant O-antigen ligase increases vancomycin resistance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>waaL15</italic> provides a strain-independent increase in vancomycin resistance.

Thus, the WaaL15 mutant O-Ag ligase, which contains an F332S substitution, must have an altered activity. Silver-staining of isolated LPS confirmed that WaaL15 modifies LPS with additional sugars to produce an additional glycoform (LPS*), detected as a higher molecular-weight band that is absent in <italic>waaL</italic><sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). WaaL can use two minor saccharide substrates to modify LPS in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12: enterobacterial common-antigen (ECA) and colanic acid (CA). ECA-modified LPS is a minor constituent of the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmidt et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meredith et al., 2007</xref>). Production of CA is regulated by the Rcs phospho-relay stress response system, and CA-modified LPS (called ‘M-LPS’) is only detectable during severe envelope stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meredith et al., 2007</xref>). Perhaps <italic>waaL15</italic> had improved the utility of one, or both, of these substrates. However, LPS silver-staining revealed that LPS* remained detectable when we inactivated biosynthesis of ECA (<italic>rff</italic>), CA (<italic>cpsG</italic>), or both these polysaccharides (<italic>rff cpsG</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, if we increase the amounts of a competing substrate by introducing the <italic>rcsC137</italic> mutation to activate expression of the genes for CA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gottesman et al., 1985</xref>), we actually observed lowered LPS* abundance at the expense of increased M-LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, the decrease in LPS* correlated with a significant reduction in vancomycin-resistance, providing evidence that LPS* molecules directly mediate the resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, if O-antigen biosynthesis is restored by introducing a wild-type <italic>wbbL</italic> gene, we observe lowered LPS* at the expense of wild-type LPS and vancomycin resistance is reduced. We conclude that WaaL15 is able to use a new substrate and thereby generate a previously uncharacterized LPS glycoform that provides a specific mechanism for vancomycin resistance.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05334.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mutant O-antigen ligase produces a novel form of LPS that is directly responsible for vancomycin resistance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WaaL15 uses a novel substrate to produce a new LPS glycoform.

To test this hypothesis, we performed live cell microscopy using a fluorescent vancomycin-BODIPY. We used a wild-type strain background with an intact OM that prevents the influx of vancomycin, to avoid labeling intracellular sites of PG synthesis. Indeed, <italic>waaL</italic><sup>+</sup> cells could not be fluorescently labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). On the other hand, we readily detected circumferential labeling of <italic>waaL15</italic> bacteria, confirming the presence of accessible D-Ala-D-Ala residues at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Several vancomycin-resistance mechanisms exist in Gram-positive bacteria, including: alterations in peptidoglycan metabolism can produce thicker cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2003</xref>); and transpeptidation can be reduced to leave more free D-Ala-D-Ala residues within the established cell wall structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sieradzki and Tomasz, 1997</xref>). It was not immediately apparent to us that any of these strategies could be employed in <italic>E. coli</italic> since virtually all of the terminal D-Ala residues of DPP are removed either by cross-linking or by the carboxypeptidases. However, we show that the <italic>waaL15</italic> mechanism is comparable since it also increases the number of free D-Ala-D-Ala targets that can tie up vancomycin. Moreover, by displaying D-Ala-D-Ala at the cell surface the <italic>waaL15</italic> mutation titrates vancomycin away from the true drug target, in an altogether different cellular compartment. Therefore, LPS* confers resistance by acting as a molecular decoy for vancomycin. Given that Gram-negative bacteria are inherently resistant to vancomycin this decoy mechanism may not be of clinical significance. However, the increased resistance it does confer clearly demonstrates the tremendous adaptability of bacteria under antibiotic stress.</p><p>The biosynthesis of LPS* is remarkable. Lipid II in <italic>E. coli</italic> is extremely scarce, its steady-state abundance is thought to be only 1000–2000 molecules per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van Heijenoort et al., 1992</xref>). Insertion of new PG is thought to occur via large multiprotein morphogenic complexes: the elongasome and the divisome, responsible for PG synthesis along the lateral cell body and at the septum, respectively. In order to overcome the scarcity of lipid II and limit its diffusion away from sites of PG growth, both complexes are suggested to include at least some of the lipid II biosynthetic enzymes, and the presumed flippases that deliver lipid II from the site of synthesis in the cytoplasm to the site of cell wall assembly in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szwedziak and Löwe, 2013</xref>). In this model, the substrate for PG synthesis would be isolated physically from the LPS assembly pathway. LPS is inserted into the OM of each cell at a rate exceeding 70,000 molecules per minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lima et al., 2013</xref>) and we approximate that one-third of LPS is modified by WaaL15 with lipid II-sourced DPP. Clearly, WaaL15 has ready access to lipid II and this is inconsistent with a model of diffusion-limited lipid II sequestered at the elongasome or divisome complexes. Recent evidence also points to wider lipid II availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sham et al., 2014</xref>). Our data indicate that the re-charging of the lipid carrier with new DPP must also be extremely efficient to maintain such a robust pool of PG precursor.</p><p>WaaL15 drains the available lipid II pool with no apparent detriment to cell wall integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Lipid II limitation can be revealed by synthetic genetic interactions in a strain lacking the elongasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Paradis-Bleau et al., 2014</xref>), but it is not the recharging of lipid II that is limiting, rather it is the biosynthesis of DPP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).</p><p>In many bacteria, LPS is decorated with highly variable O-Ags that are linear polymers of repeating units of 3–6 monosaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kalynych et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic> the multitude of different O-Ags initiate with GlcNAc, ECA also initiates with GlcNAc. In <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 when colonic acid is overproduced M-LPS is made from an intitating Glc residue. The F332S mutation broadens substrate specificity of the WaaL glycosyltransferase allowing it to efficiently accept a significantly more bulky initiating MurNAc with an attached oligopeptide stem. The only other glycosyltransferase that is known to use lipid II as a substrate is PglL from <italic>Neisseria</italic> and the use required overproduction of the enzyme in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Faridmoayer et al., 2008</xref>). It is also remarkable that we detect no OM biogenesis defect in strains carrying <italic>waaL15</italic>, demonstrating that the Lpt system is fully competent for the transport and assembly of LPS* despite the addition of both unnatural sugars and peptide stems. Both LPS and PG are pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that potently activate innate immune responses via distinct pathways, and it seems sensible for Gram-negative bacteria to keep these entities separated. We suggest that the F332S substitution has inactivated an exclusion mechanism that prevents WaaL from utilizing the lipid II pool.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>, respectively.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes an unexpected property of a mutant in the O-antigen ligase <italic>waaL</italic> gene, which specifies a protein that connects the O-antigen with the lipid A core to form the complete LPS molecule. The authors identify an allele of <italic>waaL</italic> that has a different specificity as it can now incorporate a peptidoglycan fragment that can be displayed on the outer membrane of <italic>E. coli</italic>. The strain with the new allele of <italic>waaL</italic> can sequester vancomycin molecules resulting in an increase in resistance to this antibiotic.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The idea that redirecting peptidoglycan to the surface-exposed leaflet of Gram-negative bacteria could be a drug resistance (decoy) mechanism against vancomycin does not seem likely given all Gram-negative bacteria are already incredibly resistant to the drug. Clinically, vancomycin would never be used to treat a Gram-negative bacterial infection. Furthermore, the <italic>E. coli</italic> laboratory strain that this work was performed in has an inactivated O-antigen biosynthetic pathway. Actually, the MIC of their <italic>E. coli</italic> strain for vancomycin is &gt;100 higher than that of vancomycin resistant gram-positive bacterial. Thus, the authors should clarify what the increase in vancomycin resistance means in this particular case.</p><p>2) If the <italic>waaL15</italic> allele is introduced into an <italic>E. coli</italic> that makes a complete O antigen, can WaaL still add PG to LPS?</p><p>3) Can you please elaborate on the mutanolysin result in the context of the enzyme's specificity? Here, the enzyme is not cleaving within a PG chain but instead at the linkage site between DPP and the LPS acceptor and this is a bit surprising to me (although the data is clear). In K-12, the attachment site for O antigen is thought to be an outer core Heptose residue, although it has not been analyzed in detail. From the specificity of K-12 ligase (Ruan, 2012), mutanolysin must be cleaving a <italic>β</italic>-DPP-1,7-<italic>α</italic>-Hep linkage in the current situation. What is known about mutanolysin substrate specificity?</p><p>4) In discussing the flexibility of WaaL (at the end of the Discussion), the authors should comment more directly on the existing specificity of the K-12 ligase. In <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, the O antigen that K-12 used to have is built on GlcNAc (Stevenson et al., 1994, J Bacteriol, 176: 4144) using the same enzyme that initiates ECA. For M-LPS, its range of activity extends to a Glc initiated polymer (Garegg et al., 1971. Acta Chem Scan, 25: 2103). The shift to recognizing MurNAc-pentapeptide is indeed a significant change.</p><p>5) Capture of lipid II by a non-PG glycosylation system has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Faridmoayer et al., 2008</xref>, JBC, 283: 34596). There the authors introduced an oligosaccharyltransferase from Neisseria into K-12 and showed it could glycosylate a pilin protein acceptor with PG subunits. This heterologous system is worth mentioning in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05334.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The idea that redirecting peptidoglycan to the surface-exposed leaflet of Gram-negative bacteria could be a drug resistance (decoy) mechanism against vancomycin does not seem likely given all Gram-negative bacteria are already incredibly resistant to the drug.

We have deliberately not drawn implications of this mutation to clinical resistance. However, to further clarify this issue, we have added the following two sentences: “Given that Gram-negative bacteria are inherently resistant to vancomycin this decoy mechanism may not be of clinical significance. However, the increased resistance it does confer clearly demonstrates the tremendous adaptability of bacteria under antibiotic stress.”</p><p><italic>2) If the</italic> waaL15 <italic>allele is introduced into an</italic> E. coli <italic>that makes a complete O antigen</italic>, <italic>can WaaL still add PG to LPS?</italic></p><p>When we restore O-antigen biosynthesis in our strains (making them <italic>wbbL</italic><sup>+</sup>), <italic>waaL15</italic> remains able to produce LPS* and improve resistance against vancomycin. In these strains the absolute abundance of LPS* is reduced, presumably because O-antigen is both a highly abundant and preferred substrate. The following sentence clarifying this point has been added: “Similarly, if O-antigen biosynthesis is restored by introducing a wild-type <italic>wbbL</italic> gene, we observe lowered LPS* at the expense of wild-type LPS and vancomycin resistance is reduced.”</p><p><italic>3) Can you please elaborate on the mutanolysin result in the context of the enzyme's specificity?
