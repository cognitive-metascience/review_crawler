Here, we used RNA-seq to identify transcriptome changes from late embryonic to adult mouse muscle and demonstrate that alternative splicing developmental transitions impact muscle physiology. The first 2 weeks after birth are particularly dynamic for differential gene expression and alternative splicing transitions, and calcium-handling functions are significantly enriched among genes that undergo alternative splicing. We focused on the postnatal splicing transitions of the three calcineurin A genes, calcium-dependent phosphatases that regulate multiple aspects of muscle biology. Redirected splicing of calcineurin A to the fetal isoforms in adult muscle and in differentiated C2C12 slows the timing of muscle relaxation, promotes nuclear localization of calcineurin target Nfatc3, and/or affects expression of Nfatc transcription targets. The results demonstrate a previously unknown specificity of calcineurin isoforms as well as the broader impact of alternative splicing during muscle postnatal development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>postnatal development</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>calcineurin</kwd><kwd>Nfat</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR045653</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Thomas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005202</institution-id><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG4205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Thomas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL045565</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Thomas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR060733</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Thomas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HL007676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loehr</surname><given-names>James Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HG007538</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA193466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR061370</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodney</surname><given-names>George Gerald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Global transcriptome changes, particularly alternative splicing, are highly dynamic the first 2 weeks after birth, and the example of calcineurin A splicing exemplifies the importance of alternative splicing during skeletal muscle development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is a 50-fold increase in body weight during murine postnatal development, 50% of which is contributed by skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 1979</xref>). Skeletal muscle tissue undergoes dynamic remodeling after birth to transition to the functional requirements of adult tissue. While embryonic development of skeletal muscle and regeneration in adult skeletal muscle has been extensively studied, the physiological transitions of postnatal muscle are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aulehla and Pourquié, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun and Gautel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckingham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubrulle and Pourquié, 2004</xref>). In rodents, as in humans, skeletal muscle at birth is immature with low functionality as illustrated by poor mobility of newborns. After a period of active proliferation of myogenic progenitor satellite cells and fusion to form myofibers during late embryonic development, myofiber number remains constant after birth. Postnatal skeletal muscle growth is primarily by myofiber hypertrophy and fusion of proliferating satellite cells that is limited to within the first few weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ontell et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">White et al., 2010</xref>). Satellite cells make up approximately 11% of muscle nuclei at postnatal day 14, but by week 17, the fraction of satellite cell nuclei drops to 3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ontell et al., 1984</xref>) reflecting their transition from contributing to myofiber growth to quiescent adult muscle stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>). The tibialis anterior muscle cross-sectional area increases seven-fold from postnatal day 1 (PN1) to PN28 in mice with a concomitant five-fold increase in maximal isotonic force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gokhin et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, while the increased isotonic force is due primarily to increased muscle size, there is a six-fold increase in intrinsic mechanical function from PN1 to PN28 that is size-independent. The basis for the increased intrinsic function is not completely understood but correlates best with increased myofibril size, a transition of myosin heavy chain isoforms, and changes in metabolism and calcium handling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gokhin et al., 2008</xref>). T-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum, the cellular structures required for excitation contraction coupling, rapidly mature within the first 3 weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franzini-Armstrong, 1991</xref>). The majority of skeletal muscles in mice switch from slow, type I fibers to fast, type II fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agbulut et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to the differences in metabolism, fast and slow fibers have different cytosolic calcium concentrations of 30 nM and 50–60 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gailly et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>While changes in gene expression are well-established mediators of skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy the role of different protein isoforms generated by alternative splicing in muscle physiology has not been extensively explored. We hypothesize that there is a substantial role for protein isoform transitions produced by coordinated alternative splicing in the transition to adult skeletal muscle physiology. Alternative splicing generates proteome diversity including isoforms with tissue specific or developmental stage-specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giudice et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalsotra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>). Ninety-five percent of human intron-containing genes are alternatively spliced; however, opinions differ with regard to the extent to which this huge diversity is regulated to provide a functional outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tress et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pickrell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonzàlez-Porta et al., 2013</xref>). Several studies have shown that the majority of alternative splicing is not conserved; however, alternative exons that are tissue-specific or regulated during periods of physiological change show high levels of conservation of the variable protein segment, suggesting functional importance; functionality is further supported when the timing of the splicing transition is also conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalsotra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ellis et al., 2012</xref>). For example, alternative splicing transitions during postnatal development of both brain and heart have been associated with functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giudice et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dillman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While a number of alternative splicing transitions during skeletal muscle postnatal development have been identified, little is known regarding the functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grande et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohsawa et al., 2011</xref>). Recent reports demonstrate functional consequences using knock out of alternative exons to force expression of specific isoforms of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 or titin resulting in reduced contractile force and substantial histopathology, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sultana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charton et al., 2016</xref>). Simultaneous reversion to fetal splicing patterns of four vesicular trafficking genes in adult mouse skeletal muscle demonstrated the requirement for the adult isoforms in myofiber structure and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giudice et al., 2016a</xref>). Reversion to fetal splicing patterns in skeletal muscle is a hallmark of myotonic dystrophy and results in altered function including myotonia due to failure to express the adult isoform of the <italic>CLCN1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mankodi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charlet-B et al., 2002</xref>). The full extent to which alternative splicing contributes to normal postnatal muscle development remains unknown since its role has not been systematically examined on a genome-wide scale.</p><p>Among a large number of RNA-binding proteins that regulate alternative splicing, the Muscleblind-like (MBNL) and CUG-BP Elav-like family (CELF) families are the best characterized for regulating splicing transitions during postnatal development in heart and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giudice et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalsotra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2006</xref>). Disruption of MBNL and CELF RNA processing activities by the repeat containing RNAs expressed from microsatellite expansions cause the pathogenic effects in myotonic dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Cooper, 2009</xref>). MBNL and CELF families regulate separate as well as overlapping subsets of alterative splicing events and most often show antagonistic regulation of the shared splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We performed a systematic analysis of genome-wide gene expression and alternative splicing transitions in mouse gastrocnemius muscle by RNA-seq of five time points between embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) and adult. The results show extensive regulation of both gene expression and alternative splicing that is particularly active within the first 2 weeks after birth. Of the transitions that occur between E18.5 and adult, 55% and 56% of genes that undergo alternative splicing or differential expression, respectively, occur between postnatal day 2 (PN2) and PN14. Interestingly, 58% of the splicing transitions that occur between PN2 and PN14 show little change before and after these time points identifying a subset of splicing transitions that are not contiguous with ongoing fetal transitions, but rather are limited to the first 2 weeks after birth. The genes that undergo differential gene expression and alternative splicing show minimal overlap suggesting independent mechanisms of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Differentially expressed genes were enriched for mitochondrial functions while genes that undergo alternative splicing transitions were enriched for calcium handling, cell-cell junction, and endocytosis. We show that more than 50% of the splicing transitions tested were conserved between mouse and human with regard to the direction and timing of the transition strongly suggesting functional significance. We used morpholino oligonucleotides to re-direct splicing of all three calcineurin A genes (<italic>Ppp3ca</italic>, <italic>Ppp3cb</italic>, and/or <italic>Ppp3cc</italic>) to the fetal isoforms in adult mouse flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle and differentiated C2C12 myotubes. Ex vivo analysis of FDB muscle demonstrated an effect on contractile properties and calcium handling. Redirected splicing to the fetal isoforms of calcineurin A in differentiated C2C12 myotubes caused nuclear localization of Nfatc3. These results identify protein isoform transitions that occur during postnatal skeletal muscle development and demonstrate previously unknown isoform-specific functional requirements for activation of calcineurin A transcriptional targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptome changes predominate within the first 2 weeks of postnatal skeletal muscle development</title><p>To identify changes in gene expression and alternative splicing during postnatal skeletal muscle development, we performed RNA-seq using RNA from gastrocnemius muscle at E18.5, PN2, PN14, 28, and adult (22 weeks) including a biological replicate for PN14.

The RNA-seq data show that the expression of markers of activated satellite cells is relatively low even at PN2 while the changes in expression of myofiber markers (<italic>Myog</italic>, <italic>Des</italic>, and <italic>Myh4</italic>) are robust (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results are consistent with the contention that the dynamic transcriptome changes reflect transitions within established myofibers with minimal contributions from a changing satellite cell population.</p><p>To identify the timing of splicing transitions, we compared ΔPSIs of the four developmental intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, 67% of the splicing events with a ΔPSI ≥ 15% undergo a transition during only one time interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similar to differential gene expression, the interval between PN2 and PN14 has the largest number of splicing transitions. Of the 768 splicing events that occur between E18.5 and adult, 32% occur specifically between PN2 and PN14 while only 13% occur between E18.5 and PN2, 5% occur specifically between PN14 and PN28, and 16% occur specifically between PN28 and adult. These results indicate that there is enrichment for alternative splicing changes within the first 2 weeks after birth, 77% of which are cassette exons from PN2 to PN14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>While there are large numbers of transitions for both alternative splicing and gene expression between PN2 and PN14, there is little overlap in the genes that undergo these transitions. Of the genes that undergo alternative splicing transitions between PN2 and PN14, only 18% also showed differential gene expression indicating that the majority of alternative splicing changes are within genes that do not significantly change expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Of the 768 differential splicing events that change between E18.5 and adult, 31% do not exhibit differential gene expression between ED18.5 and adult and 58% of differential alternative splicing events are within genes that show differential expression in a different and single time interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This indicates that differential gene expression and alternative splicing are both dynamic throughout postnatal development, but affect different sets of genes or, interestingly, affect the same genes at different developmental periods. Since the majority of splicing changes are within open-reading frames (ORFs) (see below), for many genes there is a major impact on protein isoform transitions rather than a change in gene output.</p><p>To determine the level of conservation of validated splicing transitions, we performed RT-PCR using RNA from PN2 and PN28 mouse skeletal muscle and human skeletal muscle RNA from 22 weeks gestation and adult. The alternative splicing events selected to test for conservation in humans were enriched for cassette exons found in calcium-handling genes since this functional category was strongly enriched (see below). Alternative splicing events were considered to be conserved if both the mouse and human had a ΔPSI of 15% or greater in the same direction. Of the 17 splicing events tested, 11 (65%) underwent a transition that was conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Since all 11 events involved cassette exons that inserted or removed in-frame peptides, the results suggest that the different protein isoforms that result from the alternative splicing transitions have conserved physiological functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In-frame alternative exons predominate in the ORF while out-of-frame alternative exons contain coding and untranslated regions</title><p>To determine the impact of alternative splicing on the protein isoforms expressed during postnatal development, we examined the distribution of cassette alternative exons within the spliced mRNAs and the effect of regulated splicing on the reading frame. For alternative exons with a ΔPSI of 15% or greater from PN2 to PN28 and in genes that contain at least three constitutive exons (223 exons), the relative position of the alternative exon along the length of mRNA was determined by dividing the exon number of the alternative exon by the total number of exons then multiplying by 100 to derive the exon order relative to the mRNA 5’ end (percent from the 5’ end). Alternative exons were also separated based on whether or not they are a multiple of three nucleotides since the latter change the reading frame. Alternative exons that are a multiple of three were predominantly found to maintain the ORF (129 exons of 135 considered) causing either an internal insertion or deletion of amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Six exons either created translation start or stop codons or altered the 5’ UTR. Alternative exons that are not a multiple of three (88 exons) were enriched near the 5’ or 3’ ends of the mRNA either exclusively within the UTRs (22 exons) or affecting the ORF to produce alternative N- or C-termini (66 exons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Therefore, the majority of alternative splicing transitions produce fetal and adult protein isoforms differing by internal peptide segments. Less common, but still prevalent, are transitions that produce different N- or C-termini. The least common are alternative exons that affect untranslated regions without affecting the reading frame.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27192.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Distribution of cassette alternative exons within mRNAs.</title><p>The graphs display the number of genes and the relative position of the alternative cassette exon from the 5’ end of the spliced mRNA.

Seventy-nine percent of genes that undergo postnatal splicing transitions do not show significant changes in gene expression within the same time interval indicating a separation of regulated splicing and the regulation of mRNA steady state levels. That different gene sets are regulated at the level of splicing and mRNA levels has been found during other periods of physiological change including T cell activation, muscle differentiation and heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giudice et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ip et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>). These results support a mechanism of regulation that involves transitions of fetal to adult protein isoforms rather than a change in total gene output for a relatively large subset of genes. Genes regulated by differential expression or alternative splicing were enriched for different functional categories: mitochondrial function for differentially expressed genes and calcium handling, endocytosis, and cell junctions for genes that undergo alternative splicing transitions. The results for alternative splicing during postnatal skeletal muscle development are similar to postnatal heart development in which vesicular trafficking genes were enriched among those regulated by alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giudice et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalsotra et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Calcium regulates signal transduction, muscle contraction, and cellular homeostasis. Our results indicate that calcium channels, calcium-dependent phosphatases, and calcium-dependent kinases are alternatively spliced soon after birth. Several calcium handling genes have been established as alternatively spliced such as Serca1 (<italic>Atp2a1</italic>) and the ryanodine receptor 1 (<italic>Ryr1</italic>) while most, such as calcineurin A, have not been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kimura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Periasamy and Kalyanasundaram, 2007</xref>). We show that all three calcineurin A genes (<italic>Ppp3ca</italic>, <italic>Ppp3cb</italic> and <italic>Ppp3cc</italic>) undergo fetal to adult protein isoform transitions within the first 2 weeks after birth. Redirected splicing to the fetal patterns demonstrate that the fetal protein isoforms do not fulfill the functional requirements of adult skeletal muscle tissue in that both a significant increase in time to relaxation and a physiologically sizable, although not statistically significant, increase in peak force and calcium. Calcium activates muscle contraction and the peak isometric force is dictated by the peak amplitude of the calcium transient. Therefore, the increased peak calcium upon redirected splicing would lead to the observed increase in peak isometric force. We propose that the mechanisms of altered adult muscle function are due at least in part to altered regulation of Nfatc proteins by calcineurin A. We show that redirected splicing of <italic>Ppp3ca</italic> and <italic>Ppp3cb</italic> pre-mRNA in differentiated C2C12 myotubes leads to nuclear localization of Nfatc3, two of the three Nfatc proteins expressed in these cultures. Our results are consistent with previous results showing that calcineurin overexpression in C2C12 causes nuclear localization of Nfatc3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delling et al., 2000</xref>). Calcineurin-dependent nuclear localization of Nfatc activates slow-fiber-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delling et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2001</xref>). We found that redirected splicing of the three calcineurin genes upregulated <italic>Myh1</italic> in FDB muscle and knock down of Nfatc3 in differentiated C2C12 cultures resulted in down-regulation of <italic>Myh1</italic>. Two sequences similar to the predicted NFATC consensus site are found in the promoter of MyHC IIx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chin et al., 1998</xref>). and our results are consistent with up regulation of <italic>Myh1</italic> by increased Nfatc activity. Overall, however, redirected calcineurin splicing had a modest effect on Nfat transcription targets in vivo. A possible explanation is that NFATC proteins do not act alone but rather regulate transcription in combination with multiple factors. We forced expression of the endogenous calcineurin fetal isoforms in an otherwise adult transcriptional environment and it is likely that co-regulators and other factors required for full NFATC activity are either not expressed or are not in the appropriate active state. Overall, our results support a model in which the fetal calcineurin isoforms have higher intrinsic phosphatase activity on NFATC3 thereby promoting its activation.</p><p>Protein segments encoded by conserved tissue specific alternative exons are enriched for disordered domains more likely to affect protein-protein interactions and contain post-translation modification (PTM) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ellis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buljan et al., 2012</xref>). Affecting protein-protein interactions or PTMs could be a means by which calcineurin splicing events affect calcineurin activity or stability. The alternative exons could affect the ability of calcineurin A to be regulated by calmodulin or through auto-inhibition. A splice variant, calcineurin Aβ1, has a C-terminal truncation so that the auto-inhibitory domain is missing. Overexpression of this splice variant improved cardiac function in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Felkin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gómez-Salinero et al., 2016</xref>). Calcineurin Aβ1 was not abundant in our RNA-seq analysis of skeletal muscle development, but it does give insight to functional consequences of an alternative isoform.</p><p>We also investigated the mechanisms that regulate a subset of the dramatic splicing transitions during postnatal development. We identified abrupt changes in CELF and MBNL protein levels during postnatal skeletal muscle development that temporally correlate with the splicing transitions that occur by PN14. We used hCELF1 overexpressing and <italic>Mbnl1</italic> knockout mice to show that 72% of the calcium handling genes tested that exhibit alternative splicing transitions respond to these proteins and are likely regulated by the natural transitions in CELF and MBNL activity that occur during postnatal development. Investigations using <italic>Celf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice identified a network of CELF1-dependent splicing that correlate with heart defects in early postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giudice et al., 2016b</xref>). CELF1 is also likely to be important for muscle regeneration as CELF1 protein increases after muscle injury and Celf1 splicing targets revert to fetal splicing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orengo et al., 2011</xref>). MBNL proteins negatively regulate embryonic stem cell-like patterns of alternative splicing, and overexpression of MBNL1 in embryonic stem cells produces a differentiation-like cell alternative splicing pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Although MBNL1 and MBNL2 protein levels decrease postnatally, the activity of at least MBNL1 is proposed to increase due to nuclear localization during postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2006</xref>). While we have identified splicing events that respond to changes in CELF1 and MBNL1 protein abundance, these events are not necessarily direct targets for these two RNA-binding proteins. In addition the responsiveness of these splicing events to Celf1 and Mbnl1 does not rule out regulation by other RNA-binding proteins.</p><p>A growing number of global RNA-seq analyses are revealing the extent to which conserved alternative splicing transitions are critical for tissue function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giudice et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buljan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kroeze et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vernia et al., 2016</xref>).

After 2 hr, morpholino ASOs (80 μg <italic>Ppp3ca</italic> ex13 3’ss, 20 μg <italic>Ppp3cb</italic> ex10a 3’ss, 20 μg <italic>Ppp3cb</italic> ex13 5’ss, and 80 μg <italic>Ppp3cc</italic> ex 10a 3’ss or 200 μg of standard control, 15 μl) (Gene-Tools, sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>) were injected followed by electroporation. Electroporation parameters were 150 V, 20 s duration, no delay, 1 Hz, train 0.5, and duration 400. Mice were assayed for splicing redirection by RT-PCR and other downstream assays 3 weeks after injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In vitro calcium and force assays</title><p>FDB lateral and medial muscle bundles were dissected away leaving the central muscle bundle and tendon. The central muscle bundle tendon was attached to a fixed hook and the other to a force transducer. The muscle was placed in physiological saline solution, continuously gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 25°C, and loaded with 5 µM Fura 4 F AM (Invitrogen). After 30 min, samples were rinsed with fresh solution and then allowed to de-esterify for 30 min. The optimal muscle length (L<sub>o</sub>) and voltage (V<sub>max)</sub> were adjusted to induce maximum twitch force. Twitch and tetanic force were measured at 1 and 150 Hz with pulse and train durations of 0.5 and 250 ms, respectively. Fura 4 F AM excitation (360/380 nm) and emission (510 nm) were monitored simultaneously with force-frequency characteristics. After stimulation, muscle length was measured and fiber bundles were trimmed of excess muscle and connective tissue, blotted dry, and weighed. Muscle weight and L<sub>o</sub> were used to estimate cross sectional area and to calculate absolute forces expressed as N/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Close, 1972</xref>). To determine intracellular calcium changes during FDB stimulation, the 360/380 nm ratio was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell culture</title><p>C2C12 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS in six-well tissue culture plates. To differentiate cells, cultures were grown to 100% confluency, and media was changed to DMEM with 2% horse serum. To redirect splicing in C2C12, 9–15 μM morpholinos were delivered by Endo-Porter (Gene-Tools) at 50% confluency. Morpholinos and Endo-Porter were added to differentiation media after cells reached 100% confluency. Differentiated C2C12 myotubes were collected at day 4. For one biological replicate, three separate wells of control ASO and calcineurin ASOs (total of six wells) were collected for downstream experiments. Cell culture experiments were performed in at least three biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Undifferentiated or differentiated C2C12 cells were grown in six-well tissue culture plates containing glass coverslips. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed with PBS 2x and permeabilized using 0.2% triton-X in PBS for 10 min. Cells were then blocked in 5% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 1 hr and incubated overnight in primary antibody in 5% BSA in PBS at 4°C. The cells were washed 3x with PBS followed by Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody incubation for 1 hr, washed 3x with PBS, DAPI stained for 5 min, and washed 3x with PBS. Deconvolution microscopy was performed by GE Healthcare Inverted Deconvolution/Image Restoration Microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>For statistical analysis, at least three samples were pooled together to determine average and variance. Error bars represent the standard deviation, and student T-test was used determine significant with p&gt;0.05. With sample size indicated in figure legends, it was confirmed experimental sample size gave at least power of 0.80 with an α of 0.05. Biological replicates refer to individual mice or separate wells for cell culture. Technical replicates refer to RT-PCR replicates from the same cDNA or RNA.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jimena Giudice (UNC) for her advice on

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Extensive alternative splicing transitions during postnatal skeletal muscle development are required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, the authors investigate transcriptomic changes that accompany post-natal muscle development. Using RNA-seq to profile five developmental stages, the authors identify large numbers of gene expression and alternative splicing changes that accompany muscle development. In both instances, the most pronounced changes occur during the first two weeks after birth. Similar to what has been demonstrated for other developmental processes, the authors show that the events that change at the level of expression and splicing are largely non-overlapping and affect distinct GO categories. Interestingly, alternative splicing appears to target multiple genes involved in calcium handling. To assess the implications for muscle function, the authors focus their attention on four alternative exons located in three calcineurin A genes (<italic>Ppp3ca, Ppp3cb</italic>, and <italic>Ppp3cc</italic>). The authors show that reverting calcineurin A splicing to fetal-like patterns using antisense oligos leads to changes in Nfatc cellular localization in C2C12 cells. They conclude that the corresponding transcriptional changes are responsible for the altered FDB muscle relaxation times they observe in mice.</p><p>Understanding the functional consequences of developmental splicing changes is of considerable interest. Given the central role of calcium in muscle function, the concentration of splicing events in diverse calcium-handling genes identified in this study may thus critically affect muscle function through a variety of mechanisms. The authors provide initial evidence suggesting that alternative splicing in calcineurin impacts Nfatc localization and thus, transcription of Nfatc-target genes. The authors are asked to further support these conclusions, as well as to address additional concerns listed below, prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors conclusions are based on bringing together results from two separate experiments performed in two independent systems: they observe changes in Nfatc localization in C2C12 cells following splicing reversion of two calcineurin exons and they observe changes in Nfatc-dependent gene expression in mice following splicing reversion of all four calcineurin exons. Although the effects on Nfatc3 localization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref> appear dramatic, the quantification indicates that the increase in the nuclear fraction of Nfatc2 and Nfatc3 following ASO treatment is only ~2 and 3%, respectively. It is unclear if these changes are sufficient to impact Nfatc-dependent gene expression. As such, it is recommended that the authors test expression of Nfatc targets specifically in this system to determine whether these changes are sufficient. Also, while the 10a exons do not change during C2C12 differentiation, it is possible that forcing their skipping in this system in addition to exons 13 would increase the magnitude of the observed effect. The complementary experiment would be to assay Nfatc localization in mice treated with ASOs.</p><p>2) While the authors conclude that alternative splicing leads to changes in Nfatc-dependent transcription in mice, they report significant transcriptional changes in only one Nfatc-target gene (MyHC IIx) of 9 genes tested. The authors do not provide an explanation for why they think only one Nfatc gene is affected. It is recommended that they determine whether the observed change is Nfatc-dependent by repeating the experiment in the context of Nfatc knockdown (perhaps more feasible in C2C12 cells).</p><p>3) The role of CELF and MBNL proteins in the P2-P14 alternative splicing changes should be clarified. The correlation between expression of CELF1, CELF2, MBNL1 and MBNL2 and the identified splicing changes could be explained better. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> indicates that the levels of these RBPs decrease sharply after P7 and remain low into the adulthood. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, what are the ages of mice used for P2-P14 samples? Are these samples from several mice? If the data are divided further into P2-P7 vs. P8-P14, are bigger splicing differences observed? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the data could be better explained, at least in legends. What are the events shown in the bottom part, changes observed in multiple stages? Also, what is the fraction of the alternative splicing events shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for P2-P14 (top half of the diagram) that have binding sites of CELF and MBNL in their pre-mRNAs? What about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>? The question is whether these RBPs are directly involved in regulating the splicing events. There are also two concerns regarding data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. First, what is the rationale of decreasing MBNL1, as its level also decreases after P7? Second, the protein levels of the over-expression and gene deletion experiments should be shown in this study. The authors cited their own paper for the over-expression study and a paper on gene deletion from the Swanson laboratory. It is important to know the protein levels in the experiments in the current study. Is calcineurin a target of CELF or MBNL? Are there binding sites for these proteins?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27192.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) The authors conclusions are based on bringing together results from two separate experiments performed in two independent systems: they observe changes in Nfatc localization in C2C12 cells following splicing reversion of two calcineurin exons and they observe changes in Nfatc-dependent gene expression in mice following splicing reversion of all four calcineurin exons.

Given the discrepancy between the clear shift of Nfatc3 compared to Nfatc2, we re-evaluated the details of the experiment and conclude that we do not have sufficient confidence in the microscopy quantitation to present it for publication. Nfatc2 and Nfatc3 localization was quantified comparing nuclear to cytoplasmic signals in five to six randomly selected images. The analysis was of all nuclei in the field including multinucleated myotubes (the cells of interest) and residual undifferentiated mononucleated cells. This raises one issue of background from non-differentiated cells. The Nfatc3 antibody was validated by siRNA knock down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) so we are confident of the Nfatc3 reagent. Our RNA-seq data [<italic>Mol. Cell</italic> 55, 592–603 (2014)] shows that Nfatc2 mRNA levels are very low in our C2C12 cultures and our RNA-seq data also shows that Nfatc1 is 2.7 times lower than Nfatc3. Therefore, it is very likely that Nfatc3 is by far the major Nfatc isoform expressed in our differentiated C2C12 cultures and its nuclear localization is strongly affected by redirected splicing of the calcineurin splicing events. We have therefore focused on the clear shift to nuclear accumulation of Nfatc3 presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>.</p><p><italic>It is unclear if these changes are sufficient to impact Nfatc-dependent gene expression. As such, it is recommended that the authors test expression of Nfatc targets specifically in this system to determine whether these changes are sufficient.</italic></p><p>The same suggestion to assay Nfatc targets after a Nfatc knock down was also raised below in point #2 and we agree that this is an important test. We performed knocked down of Nfatc3 in differentiated C2C12 cultures followed by analysis of Nfatc transcriptional targets to “determine whether the observed change is Nfatc-dependent” as suggested in point #2. We focused on MyHC IIx, MyHC IIb, and MyHC fetal as Nfatc targets in C2C12 since the mRNA levels of these genes were significantly affected or trended toward significant change in response to ASO redirected splicing in mouse FDB muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Nfatc3 knock down showed a significant down regulation of MyHC fetal mRNA levels and trending down regulation of MyHC IIx (p = 0.11). These new results are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>.</p><p>To summarize, we saw down regulation of MyHC IIx (trending) and MyHC fetal (significant) in Nfatc3 knock down in C2C12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) and we saw up regulation of MyHC IIx (significant) and MyHC fetal (trending) when calcineurin splicing is redirected in FDB muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Therefore, our in vivo and in vitro results are wholly consistent with a model in which redirected calcineurin splicing results in activation and nuclear localization of Nfatc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) correlating with increased expression of Nfatc targets.</p><p><italic>Also, while the 10a exons do not change during C2C12 differentiation, it is possible that forcing their skipping in this system in addition to exons 13 would increase the magnitude of the observed effect.</italic></p><p>Of the three calcineurin genes, <italic>Ppp3ca</italic> does not have an alternative exon 10a and the level of inclusion of exons 10a in <italic>Ppp3cb</italic> and <italic>Ppp3cc</italic> remain low in differentiated cultures compared to exon 13 (RT-PCR analysis for splicing of these exons is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> as suggested by reviewers, below). While there could be a small effect of forcing exon skipping of exon 10a in <italic>Ppp3cb</italic> and <italic>Ppp3cc</italic> in C2C12, we felt that this would not substantially add to the dramatic effect of Nfatc3 nuclear localization shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>.</p><p><italic>The complementary experiment would be to assay Nfatc localization in mice treated with ASOs.</italic></p><p>While this result would add another connection between in vitro and in vivo experimental systems, we were unable to perform the experiment due to technical and timing issues. However, our new results show that knock down of Nfatc3 in differentiated C2C12 cultures affects the same targets that are affected by redirected splicing in mouse FDB muscle. The specificity of the result is worth highlighting: redirected splicing of only 4 exons in 3 endogenous calcineurin genes in muscle tissue correlates with increased expression of two Nfatc target genes in the tissue. These same genes are also down regulated by knock down of Nfatc3 in differentiated C2C12 cultures. Furthermore, redirected splicing of calcineurin genes in C2C12 produces nuclear localization of Nfatc3 consistent with the observed up-regulation of the Nfatc targets in FDB muscle in which calcineurin splicing is redirected. We believe that these results strongly support the role for Nfatc activation in response to calcineurin splicing both in the vivo and in vitro experimental systems.</p><p> <italic>2) While the authors conclude that alternative splicing leads to changes in Nfatc-dependent transcription in mice, they report significant transcriptional changes in only one Nfatc-target gene (MyHC IIx) of 9 genes tested. The authors do not provide an explanation for why they think only one Nfatc gene is affected.</italic></p><p>One explanation for the low number of Nfatc transcription targets affected is the fact that Nfatc transcription factors function in combination with multiple factors. We forced expression of the endogenous calcineurin fetal isoforms in an otherwise adult transcriptional environment and it is likely that co-regulators and other factors required for full Nfatc activity are either not expressed or are not in the appropriate active state. We have briefly mentioned this point in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>It is recommended that they determine whether the observed change is Nfatc-dependent by repeating the experiment in the context of Nfatc knockdown (perhaps more feasible in C2C12 cells).</italic></p><p>As discussed above, we have performed this experiment and the results have strengthened our conclusions. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><p> <italic>3) The role of CELF and MBNL proteins in the P2-P14 alternative splicing changes should be clarified. The correlation between expression of CELF1, CELF2, MBNL1 and MBNL2 and the identified splicing changes could be explained better.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for pointing out the lack of clarity. We reworded the section and also found that we had cited the wrong supplementary figure that likely added to the confusion.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> indicates that the levels of these RBPs decrease sharply after P7 and remain low into the adulthood. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, what are the ages of mice used for P2-P14 samples? Are these samples from several mice? If the data are divided further into P2-P7 vs. P8-P14, are bigger splicing differences observed?</italic></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the samples designated as P2-P14, for example, means that RNA-seq data from one time point (PN2) was compared to RNA-seq data from a second time point (PN14) so each RNA-seq sample is from one time point and not a pool of different time points. The details for the numbers and genders of mice used for each time point are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and the text and Figure legend now makes this designation clear and clarifies that the RNA-seq data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is from samples shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Analysis was not further divided to compare PN2 to PN7 and PN7 to PN14 since there was not a PN7 time point used for RNA-seq.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the data could be better explained, at least in legends. What are the events shown in the bottom part, changes observed in multiple stages?</italic></p><p>In panels A, B and C of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the designation E18.5 to PN2 or PN2 to PN14, as examples, refers to comparisons of RNA-seq data collected at two different time points (e.g., 18.5, PN2, PN14, PN28 and adult). This designation does not reflect pooled samples of different stages. We have clarified this in the figure legend and in the description of the data in the text.</p><p><italic>Also, what is the fraction of the alternative splicing events shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for P2-P14 (top half of the diagram) that have binding sites of CELF and MBNL in their pre-mRNAs? What about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>? The question is whether these RBPs are directly involved in regulating the splicing events.</italic></p><p>We analyzed CLIP data for CELF1 and MBNL1 from mouse skeletal muscle and differentiated C2C12 [<italic>Cell</italic> 150, 710–724 (2012), <italic>Genome Res.</italic> 25, 858–871 (2015)]. We analyzed CLIP data for CELF1 from adult mouse skeletal muscle and for MBNL1 from differentiated C2C12 cultures since the MBNL1 data from C2C12 was much better than from muscle. We searched for CELF1 and MBNL1 binding sites within 100, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000nt of the regulated exons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B (203</xref> cassette exons that change at least ∆PSI 20 percentage points between PN2 and PN14). We found that of the 203 cassette exons, 39 and 52 exons were enriched for local CELF1 or MBNL1 binding sites, respectively within 1000 nt of the exon.</p><p>With regards to 18 genes listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, two of the six genes significantly responsive to CELF1 were associated with CELF1 CLIP tags and three of the nine genes responsive to loss of Mbnl1 were associated with Mbnl1 CLIP tags. There were also several genes that contained CELF1 and/or MBNL1 CLIP tags that were not responsive to either protein.</p><p>While it is gratifying that there is enrichment for CLIP tags for both CELF1 and MBNL1 among postnatally regulated cassette exons, we feel this does not substantially add to the manuscript. The data is consistent with the proposal that, analyzed as a group, a subset of exons that transition during postnatal development are direct targets but it is difficult to go beyond this general statement without direct functional validation of individual genes. In particular, with regards to the 18 genes listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, the general lack of correlation between binding sites and responsiveness is fraught with possible false positives and false negatives and might not be truly reflective of direct versus indirect effects. We have included this CLIP data for the reviewers in our response as excel file (CLIP_CELF1_MBNL1.xlsx) showing the number and positions of CLIP tags. Which of the splicing events that respond to changes in CELF or MBNL activities are direct targets is certainly of interest, but the main point for us is that there are substantial changes in the activities of the CELF and MBNL families during postnatal muscle development and there are resultant splicing consequences that have the potential to impact tissue physiology.</p><p><italic>There are also two concerns regarding data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. First, what is the rationale of decreasing MBNL1, as its level also decreases after P7?</italic></p><p>Immunofluorescence results in mouse skeletal muscle from Charles Thornton’s lab showed that Mbnl1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after birth [Lin, X. <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006]. Therefore, while we show reduced Mbnl1 protein expression in adult compared to early postnatal muscle, Mbnl1 nuclear activity is likely to increase postnatally. In addition, Mbnl1 protein is low but readily detectable in adult and furthermore loss of Mbnl1 in the Mbnl1 knock out line used for our molecular analysis has phenotypes produced by splicing abnormalities including myotonia due to failure to express the adult splicing pattern of the muscle specific chloride gene. Therefore, the level of Mbnl1 in adult muscle is functionally relevant.</p><p><italic>Second, the protein levels of the over-expression and gene deletion experiments should be shown in this study. The authors cited their own paper for the over-expression study and a paper on gene deletion from the Swanson laboratory. It is important to know the protein levels in the experiments in the current study.</italic></p><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have included western blots showing the level of CELF1 protein overexpression in induced transgenic compared to control muscle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>. The protein extracts for the western blots are from the same tissues from which RNA was extracted for the RT-PCR results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. This figure also includes western blots for Mbnl1 that did not detect protein in the homozygous knock out animals. As previously demonstrated by our lab [<italic>Hum. Mol. Genet.</italic> 19, 3614–3622 (2010)], CELF1 was overexpressed approximately 8-fold in animals induced using the same conditions as was used for our studies and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><p><italic>Is calcineurin a target of CELF or MBNL? Are there binding sites for these proteins?</italic></p><p>All three calcineurin genes responded to CELF1 overexpression and only <italic>Ppp3cc</italic> responded to loss of Mbnl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The CLIP analysis noted above found CELF1 CLIP tags near the exons 13 of <italic>Ppp3cb</italic> and <italic>Ppp3ca</italic>. While <italic>Ppp3cb</italic> exon 13 showed a trend in response to CELF1 overexpression the change did not reach statistical significance. <italic>Ppp3ca</italic> had one MBNL1 CLIP tag within 500 nucleotides of exon 13 that did not respond to Mbnl1 knock out. Therefore, there is not a strong correlation between binding detected by CLIP analysis in adult muscle and responsiveness of calcineurin splicing. However, as noted above, CLIP analysis is informative for a survey of a large number of genes but requires additional analyses when investigating the question of direct regulation for individual genes. We conclude that the results are too preliminary to rule out direct regulation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
