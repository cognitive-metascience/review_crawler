How these signals are coordinated at the molecular level to ensure coherent cellular responses remains unclear. In this study, we illustrate a molecular circuit that integrates all major growth-regulating signals, including auxin, brassinosteroid, gibberellin, light, and temperature. Analyses of genome-wide targets, genetic and biochemical interactions demonstrate that the auxin-response factor ARF6, the light/temperature-regulated transcription factor PIF4, and the brassinosteroid-signaling transcription factor BZR1, interact with each other and cooperatively regulate large numbers of common target genes, but their DNA-binding activities are blocked by the gibberellin-inactivated repressor RGA. In addition, a tripartite HLH/bHLH module feedback regulates PIFs and additional bHLH factors that interact with ARF6, and thereby modulates auxin sensitivity according to developmental and environmental cues. Our results demonstrate a central growth-regulation circuit that integrates hormonal, environmental, and developmental controls of cell elongation in Arabidopsis hypocotyl.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03031.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03031.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03031.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants can grow by making more cells or by increasing the size of these existing cells.

Complex interplays among these signals have been observed at the genetic and physiological levels, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions are not fully understood. Recent studies have shown integration of the light, temperature, BR and GA pathways through direct interactions between their target transcription regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallego-Bartolome et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2012b</xref>). However, the relationship of the major growth hormone auxin with the other signals remains unclear at the molecular level.</p><p>Auxin is the dominant plant growth hormone that plays key roles in nearly all developmental processes including patterning and growth responses to the environment. Auxin is essential for cell elongation responses to shade, warm temperature, and the circadian clock as well as tropic growth responses to light and gravity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stewart and Nemhauser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Del Bianco and Kepinski, 2011</xref>). While regulation of auxin level and distribution is an important aspect of its function, the ability of auxin to regulate cell elongation also depends on developmental context and the status of other hormonal and environmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stewart and Nemhauser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Del Bianco and Kepinski, 2011</xref>). For example, auxin and brassinosteroid (BR) are known to be interdependent and show synergistic interactions in promoting hypocotyl elongation, and they induce highly overlapping transcriptional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nemhauser et al., 2004</xref>). Normal auxin response also requires another growth-promoting hormone gibberellin (GA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapman et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, both auxin level and sensitivity are modulated by light, temperature, and circadian rhythm, through the phytochrome-interacting factor (PIFs) family of bHLH transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Covington and Harmer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nozue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franklin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nozue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hornitschek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2012a</xref>). The mechanisms for regulation of auxin levels and distribution through metabolism and polar auxin transport have been studied extensively, however, little is known about direct interaction between the signal transduction pathways of auxin and other signals at the molecular level.</p><p>Auxin signaling induces ubiquitination and degradation of the AUX/IAA family proteins to release their inhibition of the auxin response factor (ARF) family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapman and Estelle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vernoux et al., 2011</xref>), but target genes of ARFs remain largely unknown and thus the mechanisms linking ARF activation to context-specific cellular responses remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Del Bianco and Kepinski, 2011</xref>). By contrast, BR acts through a receptor kinase pathway to inhibit BIN2/GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of the brassinazole resistant (BZR) family of transcription factors, leading to their accumulation in the nucleus and regulation of thousands of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Cross regulation between auxin and BR has been observed at several levels, including auxin activation of BR biosynthetic genes, BR regulation of the expression levels of auxin transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mouchel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshimitsu et al., 2011</xref>)<italic>,</italic> and BIN2 phosphorylation of ARF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vert et al., 2008</xref>). However, these cross regulation mechanisms appear insufficient to explain the mutual interdependence between BR and auxin. There has been evidence that both BZR2 (also named BES1) and ARF5 bind to the promoter of the auxin- and BR-activated <italic>SAUR15</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walcher and Nemhauser, 2012</xref>). The functions of such interactions in the auxin-BR co-regulation of genome expression and cell elongation, however, remain unclear. Much less is known about direct interactions between auxin and the phytochrome or GA pathways. While recent studies demonstrated convergence of the BR, light, and GA pathways through interactions between PIF4, BZR1 and the GA-inactivated repressor DELLA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Lucas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallego-Bartolome et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2012b</xref>), the current models suggest that auxin interacts with other signals mainly through modulation of hormone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mouchel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franklin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshimitsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2012a</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we performed genome-wide analyses of target genes of an auxin response factor (ARF6) that regulates hypocotyl elongation, and we demonstrate that the majority of ARF6 target genes are also targets of BZR1 and/or PIF4. Genetic and biochemical assays further demonstrate that these factors interact directly and bind to shared target genes cooperatively. Furthermore, the DELLA protein RGA interacts with ARF6 and blocks its DNA binding. Our study elucidates a central growth regulation circuit that explains how auxin, BR, GA, light, and temperature act together in regulating hypocotyl cell elongation and how the hormone sensitivities are modulated by environmental signals and developmental programs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ARF6 shares genomic targets with BZR1 and PIF4</title><p>ARF6 and its closed homolog ARF8 were previously shown to redundantly regulate hypocotyl elongation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nagpal et al., 2005</xref>).

An ARF6-Myc fusion protein was expressed from the <italic>ARF6</italic> promoter in transgenic <italic>arf6-2;arf8-3</italic> plants, and rescued the short-hypocotyl phenotype of the <italic>arf6;arf8</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). ChIP-Seq analysis using anti-Myc antibody identified 2037 ARF6-binding sites in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. Most of the ARF6 binding sites were in the gene promoter regions consistent with its molecular function as a transcription regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The 2037 binding sites were linked to 2675 neighbor genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1A</xref>), which were considered ARF6 binding target genes. The ARF6 binding targets include 40 of the 49 early auxin-induced genes in the hypocotyl tissues after 30 min of auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapman et al., 2012</xref>), but only 1 of the 16 immediate auxin-repressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

ChIP-reChIP assays showed that two common targets, <italic>SAUR15</italic> and <italic>IAA19</italic>, were recovered by sequential immunoprecipitation in plants expressing both BZR1-YFP and ARF6-Myc, but not in plants expressing ARF6-Myc only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that ARF6 and BZR1 co-occupy these promoters.</p><p>Cis-element analysis identified two types of E-box motifs, the G-box (CACGTG), and the Hormone Up at Dawn (HUD, CACATG) motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michael et al., 2008</xref>), that are highly enriched in the ARF6 binding regions associated with the auxin-activated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

The E-box motifs tend to be located close to the core AuxRE, mostly within 20 base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Furthermore, the ARF6 binding regions having both AuxRE and E-box motifs were significantly more frequently associated with auxin-activated genes than binding regions having only AuxRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Consistent with cis-elements clustering, the ARF6 targets shared by BZR1 and PIF4 had higher percentage of auxin-activated genes than the targets of ARF6 alone, and a higher percentage of BR-activated genes than genes that are targets of BZR1 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Furthermore, the GA-activated genes and light-repressed genes were also highly enriched among the common targets of BZR1, PIF4 and ARF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).

The level of such ability that has evolved for the cellular control systems of plants remains unclear. While cell elongation, as the major growth process in plants, is the target of many signaling pathways that have evolved to provide the high level of developmental plasticity in higher plants, it has been unclear whether these pathways act on independent cellular machineries involved in elongation or they are processed by a central control system into a coherent cellular decision. Although physiological synergism and genetic interdependency suggested signal integration, the essential molecular connections between the signaling pathways, particularly with the auxin pathway, have been elusive. Our findings of the BZR-ARF-PIF/DELLA (BAP/D) module illustrate an elegant model of signal integration, which explains the synergistic or antagonistic interactions between auxin and the other signaling pathways. Our study demonstrates that hypocotyl cell elongation is controlled by major hormonal and environmental pathways through a central circuit of interacting transcription regulators.</p><p>A close relationship between auxin and BR has been suggested by their synergistic physiological effects, genetic interdependence, and overlapping genomic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nemhauser et al., 2004</xref>). Several possible mechanisms have been proposed for the auxin-BR interdependence, including BIN2–ARF interaction, and co-regulation of gene expression by BZR and ARF factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walcher and Nemhauser, 2012</xref>). Our genetic analysis demonstrated that BZR1 plays a major role in potentiating auxin responses. Consistent with our genetic data and previous analysis of BR-auxin co-regulation of the <italic>SAUR15</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walcher and Nemhauser, 2012</xref>), our genomic and biochemical experiments showed direct interaction between BZR1 and ARF6 at the promoters of a large set of genomic targets, demonstrating that the auxin and BR pathways mainly converge through BZR–ARF interaction at shared target promoters.</p><p>Light antagonizes auxin, BR, and GA to inhibit hypocotyl elongation and promote photomorphogenesis. Light signaling mediated by phytochromes induces degradation of PIFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leivar and Quail, 2011</xref>). In this study, we show that ARF6 shares most of its binding target genes with PIF4 and they interdependently activate shared target promoters, which explains the requirement of PIFs for auxin responsive gene expression and hypocotyl elongation and the requirement of auxin for skotomorphogenesis. The incomplete overlap between targets of BZR1, ARF6, and PIF4 suggests that their interactions are selected and/or facilitated by specific promoters to allow co-regulation of hypocotyl elongation and photomorphogenesis, while each pathway or combination of two pathways may regulate other gene sets and developmental processes. ARF6 showed a higher level of target overlap with PIF4 than with BZR1, suggesting a tighter integration between the environmental signal and hormonal signal than between different hormones.</p><p>PIFs are considered a central hub for integrating environmental and developmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leivar and Quail, 2011</xref>). In addition to light, temperature and the circadian clock transcriptionally regulate members of PIF family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nozue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koini et al., 2009</xref>), and consequently alter auxin synthesis as well as auxin sensitivity through the BAP module. The integral role of PIFs in hormone-responsive gene expression is also consistent with the finding of the HUD element, a potential binding site of PIF4/5, associated with the morning-specific phytohormone gene expression program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nozue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michael et al., 2008</xref>). The DNA-binding activities of PIFs are also modulated by the tripartite HLH/bHLH module, in which the PRE family of non-DNA binding HLH factors sequesters another class of HLH factors (including IBH1 and PAR1), which otherwise inhibit DNA-binding of bHLH factors including HBI1 and PIFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2012a</xref>). The HLH/bHLH module has a major effect on plant sensitivity to auxin, BR and GA, presumably by controlling PIF4 and HBI1, which both interact with ARF6. Considering that GA, BR, auxin, and PIF4 increase the transcription levels of several <italic>PRE</italic> members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2012b</xref>), the HLH/bHLH modules appear to form positive feedback loops, which potentially re-enforce the activation of the BAP module and help maintain the growing condition in the dark or in young developing organs. The increase of <italic>IBH1</italic> expression appears to mediate, at least partly, inactivation of hormone responses in mature organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), whereas a decrease of <italic>HBI1</italic> expression mediates growth arrest and defense activation in response to pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Malinovsky et al., 2014</xref>). As such, the HLH/bHLH module also provides additional nodes for input and output.</p><p>GA has been shown to promote hypocotyl elongation by removing DELLA repression of BZR1 and PIF4. Physiological studies supported additive effects of auxin and GA, while a recent study suggested that auxin regulates GA biosynthesis to release DELLA-dependent growth repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapman et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we show that GA promotion of hypocotyl elongation also requires auxin activation of ARFs, as the <italic>iaa3</italic> and <italic>arf6,arf8</italic> mutants show severely reduced GA response in hypocotyl elongation. Similar to DELLA inhibition of BZR1 and PIFs, DELLA also inhibits DNA-binding of ARF6. In contrast to the cooperative interactions among BZR1, ARF6, and PIF4, the DELLA protein RGA inhibits ARF6–PIF4 interaction. As such, DELLA inhibits both protein–DNA and protein–protein interactions of the BAP module, providing presumably coordinated and coherent control of all three components of the BAP module. Together, our study illustrates that the major growth-regulation pathways, auxin, BR, GA, and phytochrome, converge at the BAP/D module to control hypocotyl cell elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We propose that the BAP/D module coupled with the HLH/bHLH module forms the central growth regulation network that integrates hormonal, environmental, and developmental inputs into the decisions about hypocotyl cell elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03031.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Diagram of the central growth regulation circuit.</title><p>In the diagram, solid lines indicate protein–protein interaction or post-translational modification, and dashed lines indicate transcriptional regulation.

In the BAP module, all three transcription factors, BR-regulated BZR1, auxin-regulated ARF6, and light/temperature-regulated PIF4, interact with each other and cooperatively regulate shared target genes and hypocotyl cell elongation. GA-regulated DELLA interacts with all BAP transcription factors and inhibits their DNA binding. Downstream of BAP module, the HLH/bHLH module, consisting of PRE1, IBH1/PAR1 and HBI1/PIF, modulates BAP activities through HLH–bHLH interactions. The BAP transcription factors positively regulate PRE1 in the HLH/bHLH module forming positive feedback loops. Development and pathogen signals are integrated into the central growth regulation network through PRE1/IBH1 and HBI1, respectively.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03031.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03031.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03031-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>In different developmental contexts, auxin induces distinct cellular and developmental responses, such as cell division, differentiation, elongation, and organogenesis. Whether the BAP/D network or similar transcription factor modules contribute to other auxin signaling outputs remains to be elucidated by future studies. The lack of interaction of BZR1 and PIF4 with ARF7 or ARF1 indicates a level of specificity of signal integration through ARF6 and ARF8 for regulation of hypocotyls and other shoot organs where ARF6 and ARF8 play important roles. Recent studies showed that auxin also acts through a receptor kinase-mediated signaling pathway to regulate cell morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 2014</xref>); the details of this new auxin pathway and its relationships with the ARF-mediated auxin pathway and other hormonal and environmental signaling pathways are yet to be elucidated by future studies. Apparently, hormone interactions are complex and vary with developmental context. While the BAP/D module explains how auxin, BR, GA, light, and temperature coordinately regulate cell elongation of the hypocotyl, and likely other shoot organs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, mechanisms of signal integration in other developmental contexts might be different and thus remain be elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>All the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants used in this study were in Col-0 ecotype background, except <italic>gai-1</italic> and <italic>della</italic>, which were in the Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> ecotype background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Sheila McCormick, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and one of whom, Enamul Huq, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>You have previously reported how light and BR signaling converge to regulate hypocotyl elongation. Here you provide substantial evidence to add auxin to the mix, and in addition you demonstrate how GA signaling inhibitors, DELLA proteins, repress these signals by directly interacting with ARF6, BZR1, and PIF4. The manuscript is very comprehensive, the data are largely convincing, and the in vitro interactions are confirmed by genetic analysis and/or ChIP experiments. Your manuscript therefore adds substantially to our knowledge of how these diverse growth pathways interact. We have listed below the major points that must be addressed in the revision.</p><p>1) It is important to address whether ARF8 also interacts with PIF4 and BZR1, as ARF6 and 8 are redundant in hypocotyl elongation; Y2H or other in vitro data would be sufficient. Additionally, the reasons why ARF6 was chosen should be more explicitly explained.</p><p>2) Does the same ARF domain mediate interactions with RGA and BZR1 and/or PIF4, and does RGA disrupt the ARF6-BZR1 or ARF6-PIF4 interaction? Is this a competitive interaction?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, you compared the phenotypes of iaa3 mutants to the arf6,8 mutants. Although the generic model posits that IAA proteins inhibit ARF function, the effect of iaa3 can't be explained as a defect in arf6/8. You should cite a reference or establish that IAA3 functions through ARF6/8.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> and the Results section, you conclude that BZR1 is more active in young tissues. However, there is no direct evidence that the activity of BZR1 is enhanced. In fact, the protein level is higher in young tissues as opposed to its activity. This contention needs experimental support.</p><p>5) The quality of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> needs improvement, as it is and not very convincing support for the RGA-ARF6 interaction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> requires genetic evidence, such as analysis of della mutants, to support the model. The conclusions are solely based on GA treatment.</p><p>6) In the Discussion section, you conclude that the BIN2-ARF connection is less important, but this statement is premature given that the phenotypes were not compared in the same assay. This should be addressed experimentally or the statement must be tempered.</p><p>Although not required, it would be conceptually interesting if you can provide information as to how ARF6 interacts with both PIF4 and BZR1, e.g., do the proteins form a trimeric complex?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03031.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It is important to address whether ARF8 also interacts with PIF4 and BZR1, as ARF6 and 8 are redundant in hypocotyl elongation; Y2H or other in vitro data would be sufficient. Additionally, the reasons why ARF6 was chosen should be more explicitly explained</italic>.</p><p>We have conducted a yeast two-hybrid assay with ARF8. The results clearly show that ARF8 interacts with both PIF4 and BZR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>). We have added a sentence at the beginning of Results to clearly explain why we selected ARF6 for further analyses as follows.</p><p>“ARF6 and its closed homolog ARF8 were previously shown to redundantly regulate hypocotyl elongation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nagpal et al., 2005</xref>).”</p><p><italic>2) Does the same ARF domain mediate interactions with RGA and BZR1 and/or PIF4</italic>, <italic>and does RGA disrupt the ARF6-BZR1 or ARF6-PIF4 interaction? Is this a competitive interaction?</italic></p><p>To address this question, we have first performed yeast two-hybrid assays. The results show that the middle domain and, to a lesser extent, the DNA binding domain of ARF6 mediate the ARF6-RGA interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). Since the middle domain of ARF6 is required for the ARF6-PIF4 and ARF6-BZR1 interactions, it is likely that RGA and PIF4/BZR1 competitively interact with ARF6. We then performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using mesophyll protoplasts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>, the ARF6-PIF4 interaction was reduced by co-transfection with rga (stabilized RGA due to lack of DELLA domain) indicating that RGA disrupts the ARF6-PIF4 interaction.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>, you compared the phenotypes of iaa3 mutants to the arf6/8 mutants. Although the generic model posits that IAA proteins inhibit ARF function, the effect of iaa3 can't be explained as a defect in arf6/8. You should cite a reference or establish that IAA3 functions through ARF6/8</italic>.</p><p>AUX/IAA proteins like IAA3 inhibit ARF functions through directly interacting with ARFs. To show activities of ARF6 and ARF8 are regulated by IAA3, we have performed yeast two-hybrid assays. The results show that IAA3 interacts with both ARF6 and ARF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). We also cited a paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vernoux et al., 2011</xref>) reporting IAA3-ARF6 and IAA3-ARF8 interactions.</p><p><italic>4) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5H</italic></xref> <italic>and the Results section, you conclude that BZR1 is more active in young tissues. However, there is no direct evidence that the activity of BZR1 is enhanced. In fact, the protein level is higher in young tissues as opposed to its activity. This contention needs experimental support</italic>.</p><p>The phosphorylation of BZR1 have been shown to regulate BZR1 activity in many ways including destabilizing BZR1 protein and inhibiting BZR1 nuclear localization and DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ryu et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gampala et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, BZR1 activity can be inferred from its phosphorylation status. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, BZR1 accumulated more and is less phosphorylated in the young stem than in the mature stem. The result suggests that BZR1 is more activated in the young stem.

The auxin response (hypocotyl elongation) was compromised in <italic>gai-1</italic> and on the PAC medium (high DELLA condition), but the reduced auxin sensitivity on the PAC medium was restored in <italic>della</italic> (low DELLA condition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) indicating that DELLA inhibits the auxin promotion of hypocotyl elongation. We believe these genetic data further support our model of DELLA inhibiting ARF activities.</p><p><italic>6) In the Discussion section, you conclude that the BIN2-ARF connection is less important, but this statement is premature given that the phenotypes were not compared in the same assay.

If BZR1 and PIF4 compete with each other for interaction with ARF6 (no trimeric complex), BZR1 would disrupt the ARF6-PIF4 interaction. On the other hand, if BZR1, PIF4 and ARF6 form the trimeric (or bigger) complex, BZR1 would either enhance the ARF6-PIF4 interaction or have no effect on the ARF6-PIF4 interaction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, the ARF6-PIF4 interaction is increased by bzr1-1D, indicating that BZR1 enhances the ARF6-PIF4 interaction, most likely through trimeric interaction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
