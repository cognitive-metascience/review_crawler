of experimentally accessible systems. We here demonstrate that cardiac lymphatic vessels develop in young adult zebrafish, using coronary arteries to guide their expansion down the ventricle. Mechanistically, we show that in <italic>cxcr4a</italic> mutants with defective coronary artery development, cardiac lymphatic vessels fail to expand onto the ventricle. In regenerating adult zebrafish hearts the lymphatic vasculature undergoes extensive lymphangiogenesis in response to a cryoinjury. A significant defect in reducing the scar size after cryoinjury is observed in zebrafish with impaired Vegfc/Vegfr3 signaling that fail to develop intact cardiac lymphatic vessels. These results suggest that the cardiac lymphatic system can influence the regenerative potential of the myocardium.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human hearts have coronary vessels that supply oxygen and essential nutrients to the heart. When this supply is interrupted, a heart attack can occur. After a heart attack, scar tissue forms that impairs the heart’s ability to pump blood around the body. The heart also has lymphatic vessels that drain excess fluid and remove waste products and damaged cells from the heart. Less is known about the lymphatic vessels and their role in heart disease.</p><p>Unlike human hearts, which scar easily, the zebrafish heart can regenerate after injury. Because of this, scientists often study zebrafish to try to find ways to improve healing of heart injuries in humans.

Further experiments showed that, when the heart was injured by briefly freezing part of it, extra lymphatic vessels grew, but this did not happen when a part of the heart was removed via surgery. This may be because the cold-induced injury causes inflammation, which can trigger the growth of lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic vessels then help battle inflammation, allowing regeneration to proceed. Using genetically engineered zebrafish, Harrison et al. were then able to turn the genes that control lymphatic vessel growth on and off. They showed that zebrafish lacking lymphatic vessels in the heart are less efficient at regenerating heart tissue and develop more scar tissue after injury.

Arteries and connected capillaries transport oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood to the myocardium. Cardiac veins drain the blood back into the systemic circulation, and excess fluid and nutrients from the blood are hydrostatically released into tissue during this process. This interstitial fluid, immune cells, debris and waste products are then drained via the cardiac lymphatic vessels. The heart critically requires this continuous cycle through the myocardium for optimal function and interruption has pathological results including myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac lymphedema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aspelund et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karunamuni, 2013</xref>). Not only are the cardiac vessel systems required for heart function, but they are also likely to have active roles in disease resolution, at least helping to provide a permissive environment for regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marín-Juez et al., 2016</xref>). This has yet to be successfully leveraged clinically in part due to the lack of effective therapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taimeh et al., 2013</xref>). A more detailed understanding of these systems, their formation, regeneration and promotion of positive disease environments are critically required.</p><p>Zebrafish represent a simple coronary vessel system, many features of which are conserved in the mammalian system. However, unlike mammals, the coronary structure in zebrafish starts to develop relatively late at juvenile stages when endocardial cells that give rise to coronary vessels sprout from the atrioventricular (AV) canal region of the heart to vascularize the ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>). The existence and development of a cardiac lymphatic system to complement this coronary system has yet to be described in zebrafish.</p><p>Extensive work using zebrafish embryonic models has yielded much of our understanding of embryonic lymphatic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hogan and Schulte-Merker, 2017</xref>). During trunk angiogenesis, lateral plate mesoderm-derived angioblasts from the ventral side of the posterior cardinal vein (PCV) migrate to the dorsal myoseptum, lose their connection with the PCV and become lymphangioblasts known as parachordal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hogan et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nicenboim et al., 2015</xref>). These cells then migrate from the midline along arteries under the guidance of Cxcl12b-Cxcr4a/b chemokine signaling to form lymphatic vessels, including the thoracic duct between the dorsal aorta and PCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cha et al., 2012</xref>). This thoracic duct is connected to a continuous dorsal longitudinal lymphatic vessel via intersegmental lymphatic vessels, which align along the same intersegmental arteries that provided guidance during their formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bussmann et al., 2010</xref>). This process of trunk lymphangiogenesis is completely blocked in embryos with mutations in genes encoding the secreted vascular endothelial growth factor C (<italic>vegfc</italic>) or its receptor <italic>flt4</italic>/<italic>vegfr3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hogan et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Villefranc et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Vegfc is similarly required for the sprouting of lymphatic endothelial cells in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karkkainen et al., 2004</xref>) and, as in zebrafish embryos, these lymphatic endothelial cells are derived primarily from venous endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hägerling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2012</xref>) with some contribution from non-venous sources to specific lymphatic vasculature beds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ulvmar and Mäkinen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eng et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of mouse cardiac lymphatic system, there is an additional contribution to the lymphatic vasculature from yolk sac endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>). Together with venous-derived lymphatic endothelial cells, they invade the embryonic heart at embryonic day (E) 12.5 from an extra-cardiac source to populate its base via the sinus venosus and outflow tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flaht et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>). This lymphatic endothelium then continues to sprout over the surface of the ventricle along Emcn-expressing cardiac veins. Vessels expressing lymphatic endothelial marker genes Lyve-1, Prox1 and Flt4 are identifiable specifically along the side of the cardiac veins by birth and continue expanding over the ventricle until postnatal (P) day 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>). After a myocardial injury, the cardiac lymphatic vasculature is reactivated. Despite this expansion of the lymphatic network after myocardial infarction, the mammalian heart still scars rather than regenerates functional tissue. However, a reduction in this scarring can be observed when Vegfc is induced to further enhance lymphangiogenesis in injured adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The cardiac lymphatic system is thought to regulate fluid homeostasis and provide immune system surveillance and clearance which may have important implications for cardiac tissue recovery after insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vieira et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to the mammals, the zebrafish has retained a remarkable capacity to regenerate cardiac tissue after tissue damage or resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gamba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poss et al., 2002</xref>). After resection or moderate cryoinjury to the apex or ventral wall of the ventricle, fully functional cardiac tissue is regenerated within 30–90 days and there is little or no detectable scar in the majority of injured zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chablais et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">González-Rosa and Mercader, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poss et al., 2002</xref>). The regenerated tissue is also vascularized by blood vessels by this time and this vascularization supports the function of this regenerated tissue as well as the repair process itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marín-Juez et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Historical anatomical descriptions of lymphatic vessels surrounding the fish heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hewson and Hunter, 1769</xref>) suggest that these vessels constitute an ancient feature of jawed vertebrates, but the functional overlap of this vasculature with that of mammalian lymphatic vessels has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vogel and Claviez, 1981</xref>). As such the existence and function of the cardiac lymphatic vasculature in zebrafish and its potential implication for normal tissue homeostasis as well as natural regeneration remains an open question of significant clinical interest.</p><p>We here characterize of the development of zebrafish cardiac lymphatic vasculature, describe its functions and analyze lymphangiogenesis during heart regeneration. Our results suggest that cardiac lymphatic vessels should be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of heart disease and may help modulate a pro-regenerative immune response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lymphatic vessels develop along coronary arteries of adult zebrafish</title><p>To begin to investigate the subtype identity of the cardiac lymphatic vasculature in the adult zebrafish, we used the <italic>flt4:mCitrine</italic> transgenic line that is expressed in both venous and lymphatic endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gordon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Impel et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>flt4:mCitrine</italic> endothelial expression is detected at either systemic pole of the heart in the sinus venosus (SV) and on the surface of the bulbus arteriosus (BA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The population of endothelial cells on the outside of the BA was of particular interest given that they cover the entire BA, but do not extend down on the ventricle until adult stages (after 90dpf; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). In young adult fish, <italic>flt4:mCitrine</italic>-positive cells bud from this BA population and appear to migrate down on the ventricle to form a vessel that extends to the apex of the ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). To determine if this vasculature is venous or lymphatic we used the <italic>prox1:Gal4-UAS:RFP</italic> transgenic line that is not expressed in venous endothelium, but in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Impel et al., 2014</xref>). Expression in the BA population suggests that this is lymphatic endothelium unlike the <italic>flt4:mCitrine</italic>-positive, <italic>prox1:Gal4-UAS:RFP</italic>-negative cells of the sinus venous, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). The lack of markers exclusively specific to lymphatic endothelial cells has been one of the precluding factors for their visualization and study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2017</xref>). We confirmed the lymphatic identity of this endothelium with four additional reporter lines known to be expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells: <italic>lyve1b:GFP</italic>, <italic>lyve1b:DsRed</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okuda et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>stab1:YFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hogan et al., 2009a</xref>) and <italic>mrc1a:GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-F</xref>). As such the cardiac lymphatic system is identifiable in adult zebrafish and appears to extend from a BA population in older zebrafish. We next addressed the stage at which the BA population develops relative to coronary vessel development at juvenile stages.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Prolonged development of the cardiac lymphatic system in juvenile and young adult zebrafish.</title><p>Whole-mount confocal imaging of non-cleared (<bold>A-D, F-I</bold>) and cleared (<bold>E,J</bold>) adult (<bold>A-F</bold>) and juvenile (<bold>G-J</bold>) transgenic zebrafish hearts expressing the pan-endothelial marker fli1a:GFP (Green), venous/lymphatic endothelial marker flt4:mCitrine (blue: <bold>A-F</bold>) and lymphatic endothelial marker prox1:Gal4-UAS:RFP (red: <bold>E-J</bold>). (<bold>A</bold>) Through juvenile and young adult stages, <italic>flt4:mCitrine</italic>-expressing endothelial cells are restricted to the surface of the BA.

In rodent models, cardiac lymphatic vasculature on the ventricle is observed in embryos by E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>). However in zebrafish we found that the lymphatic endothelium is first established on the BA post-embryonically, before the development of the coronary vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). The lymphatic endothelium extends to the base of the BA into the cleft between the BA and the ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Within this cleft the lymphatic endothelial cells sprout along coronary vessels to extend back up out on the ventricle side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). The sprouting lymphatic cells extend along the coronary arteries and track them as they progress down the ventricle towards the apex of the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>). As the cells extend towards the apex they expand and flatten around the artery to form a vessel.

Given the strong lymphangiogenic response to cryoinjury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we decided to investigate the immunological role of the cardiac lymphatic system after a mild cryoinjury. Following injury, macrophages migrate to the wound site and are joined by a large number of neutrophil cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Clearance of these cells is known to be a key step in the process of regenerating heart tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vieira et al., 2018</xref>). We find lymphatic vessels may provide a conduit for this clearance during zebrafish heart regeneration. After 1 and 7dpc (mild cryoinjury) mpx-positive neutrophil cells and debris became highly enriched within or on the cardiac lymphatic vessels on the BA, a location relatively distant from the more apex ventricular wound site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–G</xref>). Despite weak expression on the ventricle of <italic>lyve1:GFP</italic> that precluded antibody detection above background, Mpx-positive cells were observed to align up along the optically dense blood vessels on the ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> insert) consistent with their association and uptake into lymphatic vessels. Immune cells were observed within the labeled BA cardiac lymphatic vessels after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video2">Figure 5—videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video5">5</xref>). This suggests these cells can be taken up by the cardiac lymphatic vasculature at or near the wound site after injury and then transported away from the heart via the lymphatic vasculature on the aorta.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Vegfc promotes the formation of cardiac lymphatic vasculature after the initiation of coronary vessel development</title><p>Given Vegfc’s well established role in lymphatic vasculature development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aspelund et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joukov et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaipainen et al., 1995</xref>) and its potential role after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) we decided to test if it was utilized during cardiac lymphatic system development. We inactivated the Vegfc ligands by induced expression of a soluble version of the Flt4/Vegfr3 receptor (serving as a ligand trap; sFlt4) in transgenic juvenile zebrafish during the formation of the ventricular cardiac vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsuoka et al., 2017</xref>). Unexpectedly, in heat shocked non-transgenic control zebrafish we observed an increase in lymphatic vessels on the heart relative to non-heat shocked controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B,D</xref>). This increase in cardiac lymphatic vessels is not attributable to an increase in body size, in fact, heat shocked zebrafish showed a slight reduction in the overall length compared to non-heat shocked zebrafish at the same stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In stark contrast, the induced transgenic zebrafish that expressed sFlt4 from 35dpf had few or no LECs on the ventricle and no cardiac lymphatic vessels on the ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). This was also the case with sFlt4 induction during and after coronary vessel induction in older juvenile (from 71dpf) and adult zebrafish respectively (from 91dpf; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G–J</xref>). Induction of sFlt4 from 35, 71 or 92dpf did not overtly affect the development of the coronary vasculature, nor did we observe overt edema or malformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C, F, G-N</xref>).

This suggests that functional post-embryonic Vegfc signaling is specifically critical for the formation of this relatively late developing structure. We next used these zebrafish that lacked cardiac lymphatic vessels in the presence of coronary arteries to specifically test the effect of this system on cardiac regeneration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Cardiac lymphatic development requires Vegfc signaling and helps reduce scar volume in response to cryoinjury.</title><p>Whole-mount confocal imaging of adult transgenic zebrafish hearts expressing the pan-endothelial <italic>fli1a:GFP</italic> (green: <bold>A</bold>), Arterially and endocardially enriched endothelial marker <italic>kdrl:GFP</italic> (green: <bold>B, C</bold>), lymphatic endothelial marker <italic>lyve1:RFP</italic> (Red: <bold>A-C</bold>).

Scoring these scars on the basis of severity we found large deposits of scar tissue in the transgenic fish (5/5, large scar,&gt;0.005 mm<sup>3</sup>), in comparison to that of non-transgenic siblings, where the majority of scarring was relatively small (3/5, minimal scar,&lt;0.005 mm<sup>3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Comparison of heart tissue scaring levels shows a significant increase in scarring severity with a reduction in the cardiac lymphatic vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Hearts lacking ventricular cardiac lymphatic vessels have a significantly larger scar volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This increase in scar volume could not be attributed to an observable defect in the coronary vasculature or a loss of coronary vessel angiogenesis at the wound site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C, G-J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B-E</xref>).</p><p>To test if the induction of <italic>vegfc</italic> after injury supported this function we inactivated the Vegfc ligands by induced expression of sFlt4/Vegfr3 receptor 2 days prior to and then after cryoinjury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). As is the case with induction of sFlt4 during cardiac lymphatic development, we observed only moderate non-significant effects on contrary vessel regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B-G</xref>) and no relative difference in post-injury heart morphology or size with sFlt4 post-injury induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3H-K</xref>). Despite the lack of significant extension into the wound site at this stage, an increase in Mpx-positive neutrophils was observed at the 14dpc wound site with post injury induction of sFlt4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–K</xref>), suggesting that blocking Vegfc-signal could prolong the inflammatory response, potentially by limiting the removal of Mpx-positive cells and debris from the wound site. Indeed, some sFlt4-induced hearts still showed elevated neutrophil levels at later stages of regeneration (Developmental induction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F-H</xref>; Post-injury induction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A-C</xref>).</p><p>Post-injury induction to block the response of the cardiac lymphatic vasculature did result in a reduction in the regeneration of the cardiac wall and resulting internalization of the scar tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4D-J</xref>). However the scar area itself showed no significant increase in these zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4D-J</xref>). There appears to be no inhibition of the induction of cardiomyocyte proliferation or epicaridal activation following injury with overexpression of sFlt4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4K-P</xref>), suggesting instead that during regeneration the lack of ventricular cardiac lymphatic vessels, or perturbing their response to injury, shifts the balance of the wound site from pro-regenerative to pro-fibrotic. Consistent with this hypothesis we observed an inability of zebrafish that lack cardiac lymphatic vessels to modulate the wound environment and to resolve scar specifically after cryoinjury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The majority of amputation-injured heat shocked transgenic <italic>hsp70l:sflt4</italic> zebrafish had only minimal scaring after 30 days (30dpa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>). The amount of scar tissue in those zebrafish with detectable scars at 30dpa was relatively small and also observed in amputated control zebrafish, suggesting the role of cardiac lymphatic vessels is less critical for regeneration following resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A–G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We here show that during zebrafish post-embryonic stages, there is a sequential development of blood vessel network and the cardiac lymphatic system as occurs embryonically in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flaht et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>). The juvenile zebrafish heart undergoes significant morphological change and expansion due to the physiological demands of increasing body size on heart output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta and Poss, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>). This expanded myocardium likely requires auxiliary oxygenated blood supply and lymph clearance to function optimally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). By contrast, in mammals the evolution of the pulmonary system has permitted a much elevated systemic blood pressure and metabolic rate that requires a greater cardiac output from birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bettex et al., 2014</xref>). As such, the needs of the post-natal compact myocardium have driven the timing of cardiac blood and lymphatic vasculature development embryonically.</p><p>The sequential development of cardiac blood and lymphatic vasculature is conserved between mammals and fish and has also been reported within the embryonic zebrafish trunk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bussmann et al., 2010</xref>). However, as in the zebrafish heart, intersegmental arteries, not veins, provide a scaffold for the extension of lymphatic vessel sprouts and are required for their formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bussmann et al., 2010</xref>). We have identified a population of LECs that migrate down the arteries in the zebrafish heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) and a similar interaction of developing cardiac lymphatic vessels with arteries has been described in the human fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kampmeier, 1928</xref>). This is in contrast to mice in which the cardiac lymphatic vessels track cardiac veins rather than coronary arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>). In humans, like zebrafish, large arteries (and to lesser extent veins) are located subepicardially; in contrast the mouse heart has subepicardial veins, but deeper intramyocardial arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). Zebrafish lymphatic development may represent the ancestral mechanism of lymphatic guidance which has been entirely conserved or diverged to different degrees across the mammalian class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ratajska et al., 2014</xref>). In each case, the cardiac lymphatic vessels appear to follow the more superficial blood vasculature on the ventricle and our data suggest this is required for or promotes their extension over the heart.</p><p>We have demonstrated that loss of the coronary artery scaffold results in a failure of these vessels to extend down the ventricle in <italic>cxcr4a</italic> mutants that lack coronary arteries. Although Cxcr4-Cxcl12 signaling has been implicated in the arterial association of LECs in the zebrafish trunk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cha et al., 2012</xref>), we do not observe <italic>cxcr4a:mCitrine</italic> expression in lymphatic endothelial cells, but do not rule out that a similar direct signaling pathway, for example through Cxcr4b, could also occur in the cardiac system and that this may be compromised in <italic>cxcr4a</italic> mutants.</p><p>We have however identified a signaling pathway required for the development of the cardiac lymphatic system in zebrafish. Vegfc/Flt4 signaling has been shown to have important roles in embryonic and perinatal angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hogan et al., 2009a</xref>), lymphangiogenesis, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Küchler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nurmi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yaniv et al., 2006</xref>) and maintenance of mature intestinal lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nurmi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tammela et al., 2008</xref>). We here show that Vegfc is critical for the outgrowth of cardiac lymphatic vessels along the arteries of the ventricles in adult zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments also demonstrate that regular heat shock treatment of zebrafish actually promotes cardiac lymphatic development in non-transgenic control zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Such positive effect on lymphatic development is likely due to the induced stress response and associated demand on cardiac output that is observed during heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sallin and Jaźwińska, 2016</xref>). It also suggests that the natural expansion in adult zebrafish is regulated in part by physiological demands of the cardiac tissue to respond to the increasing body size of the fish. In much the same way, in juvenile hearts we see a requirement for a second source of blood vasculature as the myocardium expands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>). With increased vasculature and heart mass comes increased extravascular fluid and cellular waste products such that the increased interstitial fluid may need an auxiliary conduit from the heart back to the circulation. The cardiac lymphatic system in zebrafish appears to have the capacity to clear fluid and debris from the myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Only moderate lymphangiogenesis is observed after amputation and the majority of the vasculature in the wound site is blood vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our analyses have demonstrated that there is a marked effect on the vascular response injury after extensive tissue damage (cyroinjury). Upon cryoinjury, there is a significant amount of lymphangiogenesis in and around the regeneration site that is not observed after amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Both injury models lead to increased <italic>vegfc</italic> levels, although this expression is more prolonged after cyroinjury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Coupled with a strong immune response to cryoinjury that could utilize the cardiac lymphatic system for the removal of cell debris and immune clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) we postulate that this response can avoid a prolonged inflamed wound site and aid regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vieira et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this we see large scar tissue volume following severe cryoinjury of zebrafish ventricles that lack lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Scar tissue is detectable in control ventricles at 60dpc, but the size and severity of this scar tissue is less than that observed in <italic>hsp70l:flt4</italic> zebrafish without cardiac lymphatic vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We also observe significantly more neutrophils at the 14dpc wound site with post-injury induction sFlt4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is early in the response of the lymphatic vessels to injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), but suggests compromised ability of the ventricular cardiac lymphatic vessels to remove the influx of neutrophils to the woundsite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai et al., 2017</xref>) with blocking Vegfc-signaling. We cannot rule out a direct effect on elevating the immune response with blockade of Vegfc-signal, but the resulting shift has a potent negative effect on the continuing regenerative environment of the tissue, while not directly effecting cardiomyocyte proliferation, epicardial activation, coronary vessel revascularization or heart structure and morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Consistent with our studies using sFlt4, recently it has been reported that a <italic>vegfd</italic>-mutation in a <italic>vegfc</italic>-hypermorphic background can also limit the extension of the cardiac lymphatic vessels down the ventricle while not affecting coronary vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vivien et al., 2019</xref>). Further, almost half of the <italic>vegfc/d</italic> mutant zebrafish surviving to adulthood fail to complete regeneration by 180dpc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vivien et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, these zebrafish also show cardiac hypertrophy, which we did not observe after induction of <italic>sflt4</italic> at juvenile stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). It remains to be determined if <italic>sflt4</italic> induction during embryonic stages results in cardiac hypertrophy. Nonetheless our results suggest that disruption of the cardiac lymphatic system impacts the hearts response to injury, rather than the enlargement of the myocardium.</p><p>Shifting the regenerative balance in human hearts for patients that have suffered acute myocardial infarct or insult and related sequelae will likely require the priming of a number of component systems in the heart including that which supplies blood to the injured tissue and removes fluid and debris. Key for this is a detailed understanding of the development of these systems and their interaction in a regenerative environment, which will ultimately help us understand what changes to modulate in patients and how this might be done. Zebrafish has provided an excellent system to understand the development of these systems from a deeper evolutionary understanding through to the ability of these systems to regenerate and play important roles in promoting the regenerative response of adult cardiac tissue to injury.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish lines</title><p>The following zebrafish lines were raised and maintained at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) under standard conditions of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleström et al., 2019</xref>) and with CHLA IACUC oversight.

Cryoinjury was carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">González-Rosa and Mercader, 2012</xref>), but with the modification for two injuries: a severe cryoinjury using a 0.8 mm diameter spherical probe and mild cryoinjury using a 0.6 mm dia spherical probe (10160–13, Fine Scientific Tools). Both are cooled in LN<sub>2</sub> prior to application to the ventricle for 7–10 s after which the probe was warmed with water and removed, the post-surgery fish were returned to system water to recover. At least five zebrafish were injured per observation/group to allow for potential variability of the wound response within a single experiment. For comparative studies sibling zebrafish were used when possible and randomly assigned into different injury groups.</p><p>Estimation of lymphatic vessel coverage after the injury was calculated in a fixed 600 μm<sup>2</sup> square section centered on the wound site or uninjured apical region. Using thresholding of the 514 nm channel in ImageJ area of the lymphatic vessel was calculate and results presented as percentage coverage of the fixed area of measurement. To quantify the relative level of branching after injury, vessels were traced and total length calculated in ImageJ, then total number of bifurcations over the ventricle counted to give normalized bifurcations per unit length of vessel. For cyroinjury scar volume calculations, whole ventricle and scar (collagen and fibrin) regions were traced as regions of interest in imageJ. Intensity thresholding was used to select tissue to calculate the area without the inclusion of intertrabecular space. This area measurement was repeated on every 9<sup>th</sup> 7 μm consecutive section through the entire heart. The individual area measurements were then multiplied by 63 μm and subsequently added together to give a total estimated volume. Hearts were grouped based on the volume of this scar tissue with a cut off set at 0.05 μm<sup>3</sup> above which was defined as large scar. For amputation, hearts were grouped on the basis of collagen and fibrin levels. Hearts with or less than a thin layer of collagen (blue) on the inside of the thickened regenerated tissue were classed as ‘minimally scared’. Fibrin deposition at the wound site (red) was considered indicative of scar tissue presence. Level of regeneration of the cardiac tissue or level of myocardial wall thickening at the wound site was not considered in scar severity assessments. For quantification of regenerated tissue, thickened myocardial wall proximal to the scar was traced and area calculated for the section though the middle of the scar (largest scar area). For estimation of scar internalization the minimal distance of scar tissue from the edge of the tissue (epicaridum) was measured in ImageJ. Scar area was calculated as volume, but in a single section with the largest scar area.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

regeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Anna Jazwinska (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Harrison and colleagues describes the development and response to injury of the cardiac lymphatic vasculature in zebrafish. The authors document the initial formation of lymphatics in the heart at surprisingly late stages, ie in young adults (90dpf), utilising multiple transgenic lines expressing flt4- (vegfr3) and prox1- driven citrine and RFP reporters, and confirmed lymphatic endothelial cell identity with additional lyve-1 and mrc1a reporters plus exclusion of the blood endothelial cell marker kdl. They revealed a close association of the forming lymphatics with coronary blood vessels (arteries) and confirmed similar findings in a comparative study of the lymphatics in human embryonic hearts. They demonstrated that normal coronary vessel formation is a pre-requisite for the extension of the lymphatics from the bulbus cordis down into the ventricle by studying cxcr4 mutant fish with impaired coronaries. The authors then went on to map the response of the lymphatics to heart injury and during regeneration; they initially confirmed the angiogenic response of the coronary blood vasculature, as previously reported, and determined that lymphatics did not sprout into the wound area following ventricular amputation. In contrast, they observed a marked increase in lymphatics around the wound site following cryo-injury suggesting a requirement for necrosis and scarring to induce lymphangiogenesis. Functionally the newly formed lymphatics appeared to take up quantum dots, suggesting fluid clearance arising from the injury may be one of the lymphatic functions and there was a close association with neutrophils and macrophages, suggesting the lymphatics may also traffic immune cells as has recently been shown in mouse. Finally, the authors tested a requirement for vegfc in transgenic fish, with heat-shock induction of soluble flt4/vegfr3 receptor, which led to significantly fewer LECs, no lymphatics within the ventricle and correlated with increased severity of scarring in cryo-injured fish.</p><p>This is an interesting and novel study, as the first to describe the development and response to injury of the cardiac lymphatics in zebrafish. The data, and in particularly the cleared tissue/whole mount imaging, is of a high standard. The findings are timely, given the recent significant interest in the development and injury-response of organ-based lymphatics across model organisms, as illustrated by several high impact studies. In particular, understanding the response of the cardiac lymphatics to injury is clinically important and the benefit of utilising the zebrafish here is in determining a requirement for lymphatics to facilitate scar resolution and heart regeneration.</p><p>That said, there are aspects of the study which have not been developed in sufficient depth to fully support the conclusions and several issues which should be addressed:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the relationship of the emerging lymphatics with the coronary vessels, it was not clear whether these were coronary arteries or veins from the images/marker sets utilized. This needs clarifying.</p><p>2) The study of human embryos appears somewhat preliminary and superficial relative to the rest of the detailed focus on zebrafish. A suggestion would be to omit the human data here and develop this as a separate study.</p><p>3) In the cxcr4 mutant studies, coronary vessels are mis-patterned but clearly still form, as demonstrated by Fli1a staining in Figure 3B. The authors should quantify the density of coronary vessels in these cxcr4a mutants and determine their identity (arterial or venous?). The complete absence of any lymphatics emerging into the ventricle is surprising given the apparent incidence of coronaries. This may reflect the fact that cxcr4 signalling is directly required for LEC guidance as opposed to acting through the coronary vessels. At present the suggestion that the coronaries act as a guide/scaffold for the lymphatics is only correlative; statements such as &quot;lymphatic development requires a coronary artery scaffold&quot; and in the abstract &quot;Zebrafish cardiac lymphatic vessels require coronary arteries to guide their expansion&quot; are not supported by the data. These need to be toned down or further supported by functional data showing either that coronaries are sufficient to provide guidance or that cxcr4 is in fact required more directly to guide the forming lymphatics.</p><p>4) Figure 4, the analysis of the angiogenic response to injury is essentially confirming prior work (Marin-Juez et al., 2016) and is largely redundant here. It would be better to focus on the lymphatics, albeit alongside blood vessels, in response to injury. A suggestion would be to omit Figure 4, and the corresponding supplementary figure, and to focus on the lymphatics with further images of sprouting lymphatics into the wound area (alongside the blood vasculature).</p><p>5) Some additional analyses of the responding lymphatics would be highly informative, to determine whether the newly forming vessels are different (marker profile, anatomy, organisation) from the pre-existing lymphatics.</p><p>6) A more detailed time course of the lymphangiogenic response to injury is required. Analysis at a single time point, of 54 dpa or 60 dpc, as presented fails to address important questions such as, when do the lymphatics first respond and/or is there a transient or delayed response following resection (amputation)?</p><p>7) The functional studies in Figure 6 are somewhat premature and insufficient to support the conclusions. The presence of Qdots within lymphatics needs demonstrating unequivocally by improved orthogonal imaging to assess whether the dots are actually within the vessel lumen. In addition, a demonstration of clearance of Qdots to sites outside of the heart (analogous to draining lymph nodes in mammals) would be informative regarding function. If these additional analyses are deemed challenging. then it would be preferable not to include the Qdot data and to omit conclusions on attributing a clearance function to the cardiac lymphatics.</p><p>8) For the immune cell studies, it is not clear how the authors can claim that neutrophils are in lymphatic vessels given the reliance on Fli1a:GFP as a marker (Figure 6G); this labels all endothelial cells and ought to be replaced with a lymphatic-specific reporter. The evidence that Mpx+ neutrophils are actually within lymphatic vessels requires more detailed orthogonal imaging and other important immune cell types should be assessed, most notably macrophages which dominate the wound healing response to injury can be marked by Mpeg. Improved imaging of both Mpx+ and Mpeg+ cells should be carried out, with quantification of cell numbers that are correlated with the extent of lymphangiogenesis. A suggestion for optimal quantification is to apply FACS, making use of available Mpx and Mpeg reporter fish (Renshaw et al., 2006; Ellet et al., 2011).</p><p>9) In the inducible soluble flt4 (sFlt4)/vegfr3 transgenic fish the authors should analyse the mutant heart phenotype(s). Do these hearts have any local oedema? Are they malformed? Are the blood vessels of the coronary vasculature quantitatively normal (they look abnormal or different from controls in the images provided)? A careful and thorough description of these hearts is needed because the reduced ability to recover from injury may be secondary to phenotypes caused by the earlier absence of lymphatics, or due to other roles for Flt4 on blood vessels, rather than an acute requirement for lymphatic function during repair. In addition, the lack of lymphangiogenesis following cryoinjury in the sFlt4 mutants suggests that vegfc is probably driving the response; however, there is no expression data shown for vegfc or other lymphangiogenic factors following injury. The authors should analyse vegfc mRNA levels (by combined qPCR and section in situ hybridisation) following cryo-injury versus resection.

Quantification of the blood vessels should be provided across experimental groups, as the reduced regeneration could be due to a blood vascular phenotype and may be related to heat shock rather than the flt4/vegfc signalling. Why do the authors think the heat-shocked controls mounted a lymphatic response? This should be commented on further in the text.</p><p>10) The assessment of the effect of sFlt4 (impaired lymphangiogenesis) on scarring, as shown in Figure 7, requires a time course to determine whether the effect is with respect to initial scar deposition versus subsequent scar resolution and how this relates to regeneration per se.

This needs clarifying.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out that this is not to sufficiently clear. We have added additional analysis of markers to help address this. We have shown lymphatic formation along vessels expressing dll4<sup>high</sup> (Figure 2) cxcr4a (Figure 3), flt1<sup>enh</sup> (Figure 2) and Kdrl<sup>high</sup> (Figure 2). We also show that cxcr4a overlaps with flt1<sup>enh</sup> expression (Figure 2) and have previously shown this expression overlaps with dll4<sup>high</sup> and is consistent with the expression of these markers in thearteries of the fins (Harrison et al., 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The study of human embryos appears somewhat preliminary and superficial relative to the rest of the detailed focus on zebrafish. A suggestion would be to omit the human data here and develop this as a separate study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the suggestion and have removed the human embryo data at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the cxcr4 mutant studies, coronary vessels are mis-patterned but clearly still form, as demonstrated by Fli1a staining in Figure 3B. The authors should quantify the density of coronary vessels in these cxcr4a mutants and determine their identity (arterial or venous?). The complete absence of any lymphatics emerging into the ventricle is surprising given the apparent incidence of coronaries. This may reflect the fact that cxcr4 signalling is directly required for LEC guidance as opposed to acting through the coronary vessels. At present the suggestion that the coronaries act as a guide/scaffold for the lymphatics is only correlative; statements such as &quot;lymphatic development requires a coronary artery scaffold&quot; and in the abstract &quot;Zebrafish cardiac lymphatic vessels require coronary arteries to guide their expansion&quot; are not supported by the data. These need to be toned down or further supported by functional data showing either that coronaries are sufficient to provide guidance or that cxcr4 is in fact required more directly to guide the forming lymphatics.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment, and have accordingly toned down the use of “require” (subsection “Development of a cardiac lymphatic system is incomplete in the absence of a coronary artery scaffold”). We are also interested in the potential role of cxc-signaling in the extension of the lymphatics and their association with arteries and agree that this is still a possibility. The fact that this signaling could be more broadly affected in the mutant has been noted in the text regardless of any effect on the lymphatic endothelial cells directly (Discussion section).</p><p>We have looked in more detail at the correlation of between kdrl<sup>high</sup> and lymphatic marker expression/coverage, both of which vary within the WT population and between heart sides within individual zebrafish (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). There is a highly significant correlation suggesting the former is required or promotes the extension of lymphatics, but we agree this is a suggestion that needs more independent verification and have reflected this in the text (subsection “Development of a cardiac lymphatic system is incomplete in the absence of a coronary artery scaffold”).</p><p>We are also currently looking at other markers of coronary vessel identity in the cxcr4a mutant background, but this work could not be completed within the revision timeframe. However, we have studied higher numbers of mutant and control fish and now provide more quantification of these vessels and the variation observed in older cxcr4a mutant fish (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). We believe this clarifies the point we are making with respect to abnormal (arterial) coronary development, while not precluding a more direct role for cxc-signaling in lymphatic development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4, the analysis of the angiogenic response to injury is essentially confirming prior work (Marin-Juez et al., 2016) and is largely redundant here. It would be better to focus on the lymphatics, albeit alongside blood vessels, in response to injury. A suggestion would be to omit Figure 4, and the corresponding supplementary figure, and to focus on the lymphatics with further images of sprouting lymphatics into the wound area (alongside the blood vasculature).</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the coronary data and instead focused on the lymphatogenesis response in particular the marker profile (5) and time course (6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Some additional analyses of the responding lymphatics would be highly informative, to determine whether the newly forming vessels are different (marker profile, anatomy, organisation) from the pre-existing lymphatics.</p></disp-quote><p>We have characterized the expression of Lyve1:DsRed, Flt4:mCitrene, Mrc1a:GFP, kdrl:mTurquiose and Prox1:RFP in regenerated lymphatic vessels and quantified the branching organization observed in Flt4:mCitrene fish (Figure 4). We now also provide a better description of the responding lymphatics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A more detailed time course of the lymphangiogenic response to injury is required. Analysis at a single time point, of 54 dpa or 60 dpc, as presented fails to address important questions such as, when do the lymphatics first respond and/or is there a transient or delayed response following resection (amputation)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed the lymphangiogenesis response earlier with both injury models finding no such transient response to amputation and overt lymphangiogenesis observed by 28dpc, with more subtle changes observed earlier (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The functional studies in Figure 6 are somewhat premature and insufficient to support the conclusions. The presence of Qdots within lymphatics needs demonstrating unequivocally by improved orthogonal imaging to assess whether the dots are actually within the vessel lumen. In addition, a demonstration of clearance of Qdots to sites outside of the heart (analogous to draining lymph nodes in mammals) would be informative regarding function. If these additional analyses are deemed challenging. then it would be preferable not to include the Qdot data and to omit conclusions on attributing a clearance function to the cardiac lymphatics.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that showing clearance to remote sites outside the heart would be informative and we thank the reviewers for the suggestion, however given the uncertain anatomy this has proved difficult for this current study.</p><p>It appears that flow in the cardiac lymphatic vessel is up the aorta and joins collection from the gills (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) to extend toward the facial lymphatics. However, imaging this extracardiac region is difficult and so we instead decided to remove this analysis, but include clearer imaging of earlier uptake of the Qdots on the ventricle. In doing so we make a simpler point that the ventricular lymphatics form a functional vessel capable of Qdot uptake (Figure 5). We have made the necessary changes to the text to reflect this conclusion subsection “Cardiac lymphatic vasculature functionally supports the heart during regeneration and homeostasis.” and Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) For the immune cell studies, it is not clear how the authors can claim that neutrophils are in lymphatic vessels given the reliance on Fli1a:GFP as a marker (Figure 6G); this labels all endothelial cells and ought to be replaced with a lymphatic-specific reporter. The evidence that Mpx+ neutrophils are actually within lymphatic vessels requires more detailed orthogonal imaging and other important immune cell types should be assessed, most notably macrophages which dominate the wound healing response to injury can be marked by Mpeg. Improved imaging of both Mpx+ and Mpeg+ cells should be carried out, with quantification of cell numbers that are correlated with the extent of lymphangiogenesis. A suggestion for optimal quantification is to apply FACS, making use of available Mpx and Mpeg reporter fish (Renshaw et al., 2006; Ellet et al., 2011).</p></disp-quote><p>Lymphatic vessels we identified based on morphology and position, but we agree this is not ideal and so have repeated the experiment with Lyve1GFP zebrafish and in addition carried out higher resolution orthogonal imaging (Figure 5).</p><p>Unfortunately we do not have the suggested Mpx or Mpeg zebrafish in our stocks to carry out the experiment as suggested and crossing these fish to lymphatic reporter lines will need more time than the revision allows, but we did successfully used Isolectin B4 conjugate to identify macrophage population in wholemount hearts and included this analysis. We used both markers to determine if there was a prolonged or heightened immune response in the absence of cardiac lymphatic extension/post-injury lymphatogenesis, finding a significant increase of Mpx-cells at the 14dpc wound site (Figure 6), an elevated but not significant increases later at 56dpc (post-injury, Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and 60dpc (developmental extension, Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We have discussed the implications of this (Discussion section) in the context of lymphatic function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In the inducible soluble flt4 (sFlt4)/vegfr3 transgenic fish the authors should analyse the mutant heart phenotype(s). Do these hearts have any local oedema? Are they malformed? Are the blood vessels of the coronary vasculature quantitatively normal (they look abnormal or different from controls in the images provided)? A careful and thorough description of these hearts is needed because the reduced ability to recover from injury may be secondary to phenotypes caused by the earlier absence of lymphatics, or due to other roles for Flt4 on blood vessels, rather than an acute requirement for lymphatic function during repair. In addition, the lack of lymphangiogenesis following cryoinjury in the sFlt4 mutants suggests that vegfc is probably driving the response; however, there is no expression data shown for vegfc or other lymphangiogenic factors following injury. The authors should analyse vegfc mRNA levels (by combined qPCR and section in situ hybridisation) following cryo-injury versus resection.

Why do the authors think the heat-shocked controls mounted a lymphatic response? This should be commented on further in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers make a number of valid points here. Interestingly we did not find overt edema at 6 months, but it is possible this develops in older adults – we have commented on this and the histology of the sFlt4 hearts (subsection “Vegfc promotes the formation of cardiac lymphatic vasculature after the initiation of coronary vessel development”).</p><p>We agree that any effect on coronary vessels should be analyzed more closely. We see only transient expression of Flt4 in the angiogenic sprouts emerging from the AVC, but not after when they extend over the ventricle and when sFlt4 induction was initiated. We have included here that developmental induction from 1mpf (after initial coronary vessel development had begun) appears to not overtly affect the kdrl+ coronary vasculature (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and certainly not the arterial structure that we believe vital for ventricle lymphatic vessel extension.</p><p>We have tested if vegfc is driving the lymphangiogenesis response, both by analyzing expression and inducing sFlt4 specifically after injury (Figure 4, see point 10 below).</p><p>We agree that it is interesting that heat shocked zebrafish mount a lymphatic response. It is likely in response to the stress placed on heart during heat shock, including increased heart output and the repercussions of this on myocardial energy/waste production. We have discussed this further in the text and think it is an interesting avenue of investigation (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The assessment of the effect of sFlt4 (impaired lymphangiogenesis) on scarring, as shown in Figure 7, requires a time course to determine whether the effect is with respect to initial scar deposition versus subsequent scar resolution and how this relates to regeneration per se.

However, raising these fish took 6 months and the length subsequent post-injury analysis has prevented this work from completion in the revision time period. We instead followed reviewer’s suggestion that post-injury blockade of VEGFC-signal may cause a lack of lymphangiogenesis following cryoinjury in the sFlt4 fish. We have found that post-injury induction sflt4 to block the lymphangiogenic response does inhibit regeneration, but such effects are more subtle (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). In addition, we see no difference in scar size (or tissue regeneration) in sFlt4induced fish at 14dpc, suggesting collagen deposition is not elevated.</p><p>We have evaluated the effect of sFlt4 induction on cardiomyocyte proliferation and activation of the epicardium (Figure 6—figure supplement 3). Further we have quantified immune cell number at the wound site in both post-injury and developmentally induced fish to observe is prolonged elevated inflammation in these fish (Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2). We think this provides an interesting and informative complement to the data previously submitted and have discussed these trends more fully in the text (Discussion section).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been significantly improved, but there are a couple of remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Some further data is required to demonstrate the specificity of the cardiac phenotype following the transgenic loss of lymphatics after injury and to establish rigorously that the cardiac lymphatics are required for heart regeneration.

Together this suggests that sFlt4 overexpression does not affect angiogenesis of coronary vessels.</p><p>Indeed, for sFlt4 induction during development, we have induced the transgene at 71 and 92dpf (Fig6—figure supplement 1) to ensure that sFlt4 is only over-expressed late in or after the completion of coronary vessel development and this is still sufficient to strongly inhibit the formation of the cardiac lymphatic vessel. This further suggests the observed sFlt4 phenotype is indeed a specific effect on the flt4-expressing cardiac lymphatic endothelial cells and not explained by a repercussion of sFlt4 induction affecting the coronary vasculature.</p><p>This finding is consistent with a recent publication by Vivien et al., in npj Regenerative Medicine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The role of the lymphatics in immune cell trafficking and specifically the data on neutrophils is correlative at this stage.

However, we agree with the reviewers that we observed more macrophages than neutrophils clearly residing within the lumen of the lymphatic vessels, while some of the neutrophils maybe along or enveloped within the vessel membrane. Therefore, we have revised the results as “mpx+ neutrophils associated with cardiac lymphatic vessels” (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and toned down the conclusions relating to this throughout the manuscript (Abstract, Introduction, subsection “Cardiac lymphatic vasculature functionally supports the heart during regeneration and homeostasis.”, subsection “Vegfc promotes the formation of cardiac lymphatic vasculature after the initiation of coronary vessel development”, Discussion section and subsection “Zebrafish lines”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
