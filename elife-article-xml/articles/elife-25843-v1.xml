We show that iuGC-rats have long-lasting changes in cholinergic markers in the LDT, together with a decrease in LDT basal neuronal activity. Interestingly, upon LDT stimulation, iuGC animals present a decrease in the magnitude of excitation and an increase in VTA inhibition, as a result of a shift in the type of cells that respond to the stimulus. In agreement with LDT-VTA dysfunction, we show that iuGC animals present motivational deficits that are rescued by selective optogenetic activation of this pathway. Importantly, we also show that LDT-VTA optogenetic stimulation is reinforcing, and that iuGC animals are more susceptible to the reinforcing properties of LDT-VTA stimulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>ventral tegmental area</kwd><kwd>laterodorsal tegmentum</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD scholaships -FCT investigator position</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coimbra</surname><given-names>Bárbara</given-names></name><name><surname>Soares-Cunha</surname><given-names>Carina</given-names></name><name><surname>Borges</surname><given-names>Sónia</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodrigues</surname><given-names>Ana João</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Projeto Estratégico -

Importantly, this activity is tightly modulated by cholinergic projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Omelchenko and Sesack, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Omelchenko and Sesack, 2006</xref>), with an additional contribution of glutamatergic projections, arising from the LDT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cornwall et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oakman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>). This input is vital for the activity of dopaminergic cells in the VTA, facilitating dopamine-related behaviors involved in reward signaling or encoding reward prediction signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lodge and Grace, 2006</xref>). In agreement, recent studies have shown that optogenetic stimulation of LDT neurons that project to the VTA enhances conditioned place preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>) and operant responses in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steidl and Veverka, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Notably, different labs have shown that the mesolimbic system is particularly vulnerable to the effects of prenatal stress/high levels of glucocorticoids (GCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matthews, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boksa and El-Khodor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McArthur et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leão et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodrigues et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borges et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soares-Cunha et al., 2014</xref>).

Surprisingly, very few studies have focused on the impact of stress/GCs in the cholinergic system. This is particularly intriguing because GCs can induce acetylcholine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finkelstein et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilad et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imperato et al., 1989</xref>) and bind to GC-responsive elements of cholinergic enzymes, namely choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) to control their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berse and Blusztajn, 1997</xref>). In accordance, we have previously shown that prenatal GC exposure induces a long-lasting hyperanxious state associated with an increase in the recruitment of cholinergic cells from the LDT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borges et al., 2013b</xref>), suggesting that GCs are able to <italic>program</italic> the LDT, which prompted us to evaluate the impact of prenatal GC in the LDT-VTA circuitry and its impact in reward-related behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sustained cholinergic dysfunction in iuGC animals</title><p>Previous data from our team suggested that LDT cholinergic cells were differentially recruited in response to an adverse stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borges et al., 2013b</xref>) in a model of <italic>in utero</italic> GC (iuGC) exposure at gestation days 18 and 19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blaha and Winn, 1993</xref>).

These cholinergic changes observed in iuGC group are more likely to derive from a new equilibrium set <italic>in utero</italic> by GC exposure rather than by changes in the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, since in adulthood iuGC animals present normal basal levels of corticosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blaha and Winn, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, this GC <italic>programming effect</italic> in gene expression has been previously demonstrated for other circuits.

These results show that a brief exposure to GC during critical developmental periods may induce persistent effects in specific genes, which may contribute for the increased vulnerability for emotional disorders observed in early life stress models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borges et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borges et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Piazza and Le Moal, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murgatroyd et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We also found that the LDT presents decreased basal neuronal activity, and that LDT electrical stimulation produces a differential response in the VTA of iuGC animals. Indeed, iuGC group presented a decrease in the magnitude and duration of excitatory responses in the VTA, and inversely, the inhibitory response was increased, suggesting that the function of the LDT-VTA pathway was compromised. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing electrophysiological differences in the LDT-VTA circuitry induced by GCs. The latency of excitatory responses in the VTA upon LDT electrical (or optogenetic) stimulation in control animals was remarkably low, but we were unable to find any electrophysiological studies to compare to.</p><p>Importantly, the latency of VTA excitatory responses to LDT electrical stimulation was substantially increased in iuGC animals. A combination of pre- and post-synaptic iuGC-induced changes may contribute for this phenomenon, however, because this delay is not observed upon optical excitation of LDT-VTA terminals, it pinpoints to changes in axonal conductivity. Additional studies are now needed in order to understand how GC induces these long-lasting electrophysiological changes.</p><p>The VTA contains around 65% of DAergic neurons and 35% of non-DAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nair-Roberts et al., 2008</xref>), being the latter mainly GABAergic, though subpopulations of glutamatergic neurons as well as dopamine/glutamate co-releasing neurons have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yamaguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hnasko et al., 2012</xref>). Considering this, we sub-divided the VTA recorded cells into putative DAergic and GABAergic neurons based on their waveform pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ungless et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ungless and Grace, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Totah et al., 2013</xref>), yet, it is important to refer that there is still some controversy regarding this categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Margolis et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, Omelchenko and colleagues suggested that the LDT mediates a divergent excitation/inhibition influence on mesoaccumbens neurons that is likely to excite DAergic cells and inhibit GABA neurons of this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Omelchenko and Sesack, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Omelchenko and Sesack, 2006</xref>); which is in accordance with our data in control animals.</p><p>The LDT provides the tonic input necessary for maintaining burst firing of DAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lodge and Grace, 2006</xref>) and dopamine release to the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaha et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forster and Blaha, 2000</xref>), contributing to reward behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steidl and Veverka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, phasic activation of VTA DAergic neurons can induce behavioral conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>) and facilitate positive reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamantidis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Witten et al., 2011</xref>). Conversely, VTA GABAergic neurons provide local inhibition of DAergic neurons (but also long-range inhibition of projection regions, including the NAc), and their activation disrupts reward consummatory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Zessen et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, in iuGC animals we observe a shift in the LDT-VTA evoked responses: an increase of inhibition of DAergic neurons and simultaneous decrease of inhibition of GABAergic neurons. This suggests that VTA DAergic neurons are less active, which is in accordance with the observed decreased basal levels of dopamine in the NAc of iuGC animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leão et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rodrigues et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Confirming the functional relevance of the abovementioned electrophysiological data, we have previously shown that iuGC animals exhibited impaired cue-driven motivational drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soares-Cunha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Soares-Cunha et al., 2016</xref>). In line with this, we found that iuGC animals presented significant motivational deficits in the PR test. Remarkably, brief optogenetic activation of LDT-VTA terminals during cue exposure was sufficient to rescue the motivation of iuGC animals, with no major impact on control animals, proving that iuGC exposure induces changes in this circuit that are translated into motivational deficits. However, when LDT-VTA stimulation was done during the time-out period of the test, it did not induce any behavioral effect, reinforcing the importance of specific time windows for the stimulation. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing a role of the LDT-VTA circuit in the control of cue-induced motivation. It is important to refer that we decided to use a strategy that activates all LDT inputs because although the majority of its neurons are cholinergic, there are also glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the LDT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang and Morales, 2009</xref>), and each provide parallel sources of input to the VTA. Certainly, additional studies are needed to dissect and evaluate the contribution of each LDT neuronal population for this type of behaviors.</p><p>To further understand the role of LDT-VTA in reward behaviors, we tested the animals in two different conditioning paradigms, the non-contingent CPP and the contingent RTPP. Activation of LDT-VTA specific projections shifts animal’s preference for the stimulus-associated chamber in both tests. However, iuGC animals seem more susceptible to these reinforcing effects because a <italic>lower stimulation</italic> protocol (30 pulses of 15 ms at 20 Hz) was able to shift iuGC group preference but had no effect in control animals. Importantly, this vulnerability to rewarding/reinforcing stimulus is in accordance with previous data from our team showing that iuGC animals presented increased morphine-associated CPP in comparison to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rodrigues et al., 2012</xref>). It is thus tempting to speculate that the increased vulnerability of iuGC animals to the effects of LDT-VTA stimulation is due to an imbalance in the excitation-inhibition responses in the VTA triggered by LDT inputs.</p><p>In summary, iuGC exposure leads to long-lasting molecular and physiological alterations in the LDT-VTA circuit in parallel with prominent motivational deficits, which were rescued by optogenetic activation of the LDT-VTA terminals. Moreover, we showed that activation of LDT-VTA inputs is reinforcing and that iuGC animals appear to be more vulnerable to the reinforcing properties of this stimulus. Further studies are now needed to identify how GCs lead to functional changes in vulnerable regions such as the LDT and how this translates into altered behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and treatments</title><p>Pregnant Wistar rats were individually housed under standard laboratory conditions (light/dark cycle of 12/12 hr; 22°C); food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

Neurons showing a firing rate increase or decrease by more than 20% from the mean frequency of the baseline period were considered as responsive, as previously reported by Benazzouz and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benazzouz et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>At the end of each electrophysiological experiment, all brains were collected and processed to identify recording region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optogenetics constructs</title><p>AAV5–EF1a–WGA–Cre–mCherry, AAV5–EF1a–DIO–hChR2–YFP and AAV5–EF1a–DIO–YFP were obtained directly from the Gene Therapy Center Vector Core (UNC) center (vectors kindly provided by Karl Deisseroth, Stanford University). AAV5 vector titers were 2.1–6.6 × 10<sup>12</sup> virus molecules ml<sup>-1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Surgery and cannula implantation</title><p>Rats designated for behavioral experiments were anesthetized with 75 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> ketamine (Imalgene, Merial) plus 0.5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> medetomidine (Dorbene, Cymedica). One μl of AAV5–EF1a–WGA–Cre–mCherry was unilaterally injected into the VTA (coordinates from bregma, according to Paxinos and Watson: −5.4 mm anteroposterior, +0.6 mm mediolateral, and −7.8 mm dorsoventral) and 1 μl of AAV5–EF1a–DIO–hChR2–YFP was injected in the LDT (coordinates from bregma: −8.5 mm anteroposterior, +0.9 mm mediolateral, and −6.5 mm dorsoventral) in both CTR and iuGC groups (CTR-ChR2 and iuGC-ChR2). We had two additional groups: a control group (CTR) that was injected only with 1 μl AAV5–EF1a–DIO–hChR2–YFP in the LDT; and CTR-YFP animals which were injected with 1 μl AAV5–EF1a–WGA–Cre–mCherry in the VTA and 1 μl AAV5–EF1a–DIO–YFP in the LDT. Rats were then implanted with an optic fiber (200 μm core fiber optic; Thorlabs, NJ, USA) with 2.5 mm stainless steel ferrule (Thorlabs, NJ, USA) using the injection coordinates for the VTA (with the exception of dorsoventral: −7.7 mm) that were secured to the skull using 2.4 mm screws (Bilaney, Germany) and dental cement (C and B kit, Sun Medical). Rats were removed from the stereotaxic frame and sutured. Anaesthesia was reverted by administration of atipamezole (1 mg/kg). After surgery animals were given anti-inflammatory (Carprofeno, 5 mg/kg) for one day, analgesic (butorphanol, 5 mg/kg) for 3 days, and were let to fully recover before initiation of behavior. Optic fiber placement was confirmed for all animals after behavioral experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Animals that were assigned for electrophysiological experiments were not implanted with an optic fiber.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavior</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement</title><p>Rats were placed and maintained on food restriction (≈7 g/day of standard lab chow) to maintain 90% free-feeding weight. Behavioral sessions were performed in operant chambers (Med Associates, IL, USA) containing a central magazine that provided access to 45 mg food pellets (Bio-Serve), two retractable levers located on each side of the magazine with cue lights above them. A 2.8W, 100mA house light positioned at the top-centre of the wall opposite to the magazine provided illumination. A computer equipped with Med-PC software (Med Associates, IL, USA) controlled the equipment and recorded the data.</p><p>The behavioral protocol was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Soares-Cunha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wanat et al., 2013</xref>). Animals were first trained on continuous reinforcement (CRF) schedule: a single lever press yields one pellet. Side of the active lever was alternated between sessions. Rats were then trained in a fixed ratio (FR) schedule comprising 50 trials with both levers presented, but the active lever signalled by the illumination of the above cue light. When achieving the correct number of lever presses, a pellet was delivered, levers retracted and the cue light turned off for a 20 s inter-trial interval (ITI). Following up, rats were trained using an FR4 reinforcement schedule for 4 days and a FR8 for one day, for both levers. Rats were then exposed to the following schedule: day 1 – FR4 (left lever); day 2- PR (left lever); day 3- FR4 (left lever); day 4 – FR4 (right lever); day 5 – PR (right lever). Food rewards were earned on an FR4 reinforcement schedule during FR sessions. PR sessions were similar to FR4 sessions except the operant requirement on each trial (T) was the integer (rounded down) of 1.4<sup>(T–1)</sup> lever presses, starting at 1 lever press. PR sessions ended after 15 min without completion of the response requirement in a trial.</p><p>Before the PR session began, rats were connected to an opaque optical fiber in the VTA through previously implanted fiber optic cannula. The optical fiber was connected to a 473 nm DPSS laser (CNI Laser), controlled using a pulse generator (Master-8; AMPI). At the beginning of each trial of the PR session – when the cue light was turned on – animals received an optical stimulation, which consisted in 30 pulses of 15 ms at 20 Hz (473 nm; 10 mW of light at the tip of the optic fiber). In a second set of animals, the number of pulses was increased to 80 pulses of 15 ms at 20 Hz during each cue exposure. CTR, CTR-YFP, CTR-ChR2 and iuGC-ChR2 received this optical stimulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Conditioned place preference – CPP</title><p>The CPP protocol was adapted from a previously published report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ungless and Grace, 2012</xref>). Briefly, on day 1, individual rats were placed in the centre chamber and allowed to freely explore the entire apparatus for 15 min (pre-test). On day 2, rats were confined to one of the side chambers for 30 min and paired with optical stimulation, ON side; in the second session, rats were confined to the other side chamber for 30 min with no stimulation, OFF side. Conditioning sessions were counterbalanced. On day 3 rats were allowed to freely explore the entire apparatus for 15 min (post-test). Optical stimulation consisted of 30 pulses of 15 ms at 20 Hz, every 60 s. In a second set of animals optical stimulation was increased to 80 pulses of 15 ms at 20 Hz, every 15 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Real-time place preference – RTPP</title><p>RTPP test was performed in a custom-made black plastic arena (60 × 60 × 40 cm) comprised by two indistinguishable chambers, for 15 min. One chamber was paired with light stimulation of 15 ms pulses at 20 Hz during the entire period that the animal stayed in the stimulus-paired side. The choice of paired chamber was counterbalanced across rats. Animals were placed in the no-stimulation chamber at the start of the session and light stimulation started at every entry into the paired chamber. Animal activity was recorded using a video camera and time spent in each chamber was manually assessed. Results are presented as total time spent in each chamber.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunofluorescence (IF)</title><p>Animals were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (Eutasil, Lisbon, Portugal) and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Eric Dumont (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers find the work interesting and relevant but raise a few important points that should be addressed. Attached are the point-by-point comments of the reviewers, but below are the more relevant issues to be addressed.</p><p>– In the optical stimulation experiments, there should be controls for Cre expression and viral expression. The use of a Cre dependent virus expressing GFP would be advisable.</p><p>– The article would benefit from a more detailed description and a more specific use of statistics. For example, a two-way ANOVA with age and glucocorticoid treatment as factors, followed by post-hoc tests seem more appropriate than individual t-test or Mann-Whitney tests for every age. Also, the rationale for the use or not of specific statistical tests, multiple comparison corrections, etc. should be provided.</p><p>– Are there differences in GR expression levels in the LDT or corticosterone levels in these animals at different developmental stages that accompany the observed effects on the expression of cholinergic enzymes? Is the observed effect the result of a new equilibrium set after the in-utero treatment, or is it perpetuated through differences in GR expression or corticosterone levels?</p><p>– The authors should specify how the loading controls were done for the Westerns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, or provide appropriate loading controls.</p><p>– The authors should provide more details about the physiology with representative examples, showing recording and stimulation sites, and a few more suggested analyses.</p><p>In general, more details are needed in the Materials and methods, such as the volume of injected virus, representative example of microinjections the rationale for using a 20% cut-off for excitation or inhibition should be provided, etc.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This study investigates the role of prenatal glucocorticoids (GCs) on the LDT-VTA circuitry and its impact on reward-related behavior. In their study, the authors use a rat model of in utero GC (iuGC) exposure at gestation days 18 and 19, which shows long-lasting changes in the cholinergic system (i.e., increased number of ChAT<sup>+</sup> cell density and altered transcript and protein levels of the markers ChAT and AChE) in the LDT. Notably, the study stems from previous findings from the same group published in 2013 (Borges et al., 2013) where, similarly, they reported differences in ChAT<sup>+</sup> cell density in LDT induced by the same glucocorticoid treatment. Here, AChE expression analysis was added, as well as analyses performed at different time points and expression at the mRNA and protein levels. The characterization of the LDT-VTA circuit with in vivo electrophysiology revealed a decreased basal neuronal activity of the LDT, but not VTA, in iuGC animals. LDT stimulation showed a decreased magnitude of excitation and an increase in VTA inhibition, likely resulting from a shift of the cell-types that respond to the stimulus. Accompanying these described LDT-VTA dysfunctions, the authors demonstrate that iuGC rats exhibit motivational deficits in the willingness to work for food, which were rescued by optogenetic activation of the LDT-VTA pathway. Furthermore, iuGC animals are more susceptible to the reinforcing properties of LDT-VTA stimulation (rats exposed to glucocorticoids in utero were more sensitive to optogenetic stimulation of LDT-VTA projections to develop conditioned place preference). The authors conclude that iuGC exposure affects the LDT-VTA circuit and results in motivational deficits.</p><p>The work is interesting and the findings relevant. Nevertheless, there are issues and concerns that require clarification:</p><p>1) It is not clear why the work does not follow up on the identified changes on ChAT and AChE directly, as no specific manipulation assessed the role of cholinergic projections from the LDT to the VTA.</p><p>2) As raised by the authors themselves, they have carried out their rescue experiments by activating all LDT inputs and not distinguishing between cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the LDT. The authors mention in the introduction that there are contributions of glutamatergic projections from the LDT to the VTA; it would make sense to study glutamatergic markers as well to assess whether the effect of prenatal glucocorticoid exposure is specific to the cholinergic input from LDT to VTA or not and bridge the different parts of the work.</p><p>3) A two-way ANOVA with age and glucocorticoid treatment as factors, followed by post-hoc tests seem more appropriate than individual t-test or Mann-Whitney tests for every age.</p><p>4) Key questions not answered by the study: Are there differences in GR expression levels in the LDT or corticosterone levels in these animals at different developmental stages that accompany the observed effects on the expression of cholinergic enzymes? Is the observed effect the result of a new equilibrium set after the in utero treatment, or is it perpetuated through differences in GR expression or corticosterone levels?</p><p>5) In the optical stimulation experiments, control rats were treated only with an AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2-YFP virus. How did the authors check for proper viral injection? In addition, there seems to be no control for any effects Cre expression alone might have. The best control would be treatment with the same Cre-expressing virus in the VTA expressing only GFP in the LDT.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, a</xref> representative immunoblot of ChAT and AChE in the LDT is represented followed by quantification of the bands. Why only one GAPDH loading control? Did the authors run an immunoblot for both proteins and then strip their membrane, which would explain one GAPDH control, or did they use two independent membranes for ChAT and AChE? In the latter case, they should please provide also a GAPDH loading control for their second membrane, which they used for the quantification plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>. Please provide this information in material and methods.</p><p>7) The article would benefit by providing (molecular) background regarding the rationale to analyze cholinergic markers in iuGC animals.</p><p>8) The article would benefit from a more detailed description about the statistical tests used for the experiments.

They presented evidence about an increased number of Chat neurons (and an increase in Chat RNA or protein levels) in the LDT from adult rats. They performed recordings in the LDT and VTA to measure the basal level of activity, electrically stimulated in the LDT to record its effect in the VTA, optogenetic stimulated the LDT-&gt;VTA terminals in the VTA evaluating the excitation/inhibition responses of VTA.

The use of a Cre dependent virus expressing GFP would be advisable.</italic> </p><p>We have performed an additional experiment, including a new control group which consists in the injection of AAV5–EF1a–WGA–Cre–mCherry in the VTA and AAV5–EF1a–DIO–YFP in the LDT – please check answers to reviewers below.</p><p> <italic>– The article would benefit from a more detailed description and a more specific use of statistics.

Also, the rationale for the use or not of specific statistical tests, multiple comparison corrections, etc. should be provided.</italic> </p><p>We have taken this comment into consideration.</p><p> <italic>– Are there differences in GR expression levels in the LDT or corticosterone levels in these animals at different developmental stages that accompany the observed effects on the expression of cholinergic enzymes? Is the observed effect the result of a new equilibrium set after the in-utero treatment, or is it perpetuated through differences in GR expression or corticosterone levels?</italic> </p><p>Most likely due to a new equilibrium set after the in-utero treatment, as we discuss below in response to reviewer 1.</p><p> <italic>– The authors should specify how the loading controls were done for the Westerns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, or provide appropriate loading controls.</italic> </p><p>Done – please check answers to reviewers below.</p><p> <italic>– The authors should provide more details about the physiology with representative examples, showing recording and stimulation sites, and a few more suggested analyses.</italic> </p><p>We believe we have addressed all of the reviewer comments.</p><p> <italic>In general, more details are needed in the Materials and methods, such as the volume of injected virus, representative example of microinjections the rationale for using a 20% cut-off for excitation or inhibition should be provided, etc.</italic> </p><p>We have added the volume of injected virus (Discussion section); and the reference paper supporting the 20% cut-off decision for electrophysiological recordings (Discussion section).

We decided to activate all inputs because we observed an effect of iuGC exposure in both excitatory and inhibitory VTA responses elicited by LDT electrical activation, suggesting that different neurotransmitters systems could be involved.</p><p>We have now added this information in subsection “Optogenetic activation of LDT terminals in the VTA elicits distinct responses in control and iuGC animals <bold>“</bold>of the revised manuscript.</p><p> <italic>2) As raised by the authors themselves, they have carried out their rescue experiments by activating all LDT inputs and not distinguishing between cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the LDT. The authors mention in the introduction that there are contributions of glutamatergic projections from the LDT to the VTA; it would make sense to study glutamatergic markers as well to assess whether the effect of prenatal glucocorticoid exposure is specific to the cholinergic input from LDT to VTA or not and bridge the different parts of the work.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is interesting to study the impact of iuGC in other neuronal populations of the LDT. Thus, we have now included gene and protein expression data of glutamatergic and GABAergic markers in the LDT in the revised manuscript (subsection “Sustained cholinergic dysfunction in iuGC animals “; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We found no major effect in the expression levels of EAAC1, GAD1, GAD2, GAD65 and GAD67.</p><p> <italic>3) A two-way ANOVA with age and glucocorticoid treatment as factors, followed by post-hoc tests seem more appropriate than individual t-test or Mann-Whitney tests for every age.</italic> </p><p>Considering this comment, we believe that the way we presented these results was not clear enough, thus we decided to separate data according to ages. We presented individual t-test or Mann-Whitney tests for every age, since gene or protein expression (RT-PCR plates or Western Blot membranes) were performed on distinct animals (not repeated measures). Please check new graphs.</p><p> <italic>4) Key questions not answered by the study: Are there differences in GR expression levels in the LDT or corticosterone levels in these animals at different developmental stages that accompany the observed effects on the expression of cholinergic enzymes? Is the observed effect the result of a new equilibrium set after the in utero treatment, or is it perpetuated through differences in GR expression or corticosterone levels?</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is an interesting point. Previous data from our group has shown no major differences in corticosterone levels in these animals (Oliveira et al., 2006); only when we challenged these animals we observe differences in corticosterone secretion – such as for example in dexamethasone suppression test (Oliveira et al., 2006).</p><p>Regarding GR expression, we have performed RT-PCR and western blotting against GR, which presented no significant differences between controls and iuGC animals (Results section; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3J</xref>–L, T–V).</p><p>As the reviewer pinpoints, we believe that early life exposure to GCs reprograms the circuit, setting a new equilibrium in the inputs from the LDT to the VTA. We have now included a sentence about this in the Discussion section.</p><p> <italic>5) In the optical stimulation experiments, control rats were treated only with an AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2-YFP virus. How did the authors check for proper viral injection? In addition, there seems to be no control for any effects Cre expression alone might have.

Previous results by our group have shown an increase of LDT cholinergic cells recruited after an adverse stimulus (Borges et al., 2013). This led us to evaluate when these cholinergic changes occurred and the functional relevance of such alterations.</p><p>We have now included the following text (subsection “Sustained cholinergic dysfunction in iuGC animals“): “Previous data from our team suggested that LDT cholinergic cells were differentially recruited between in response to an adverse stimulus in a model of in utero GC (iuGC) exposure at gestation days 18 and 19. Considering this, we first evaluated the impact of GCs on the cholinergic circuitry of iuGC animals.”.</p><p> <italic>8) The article would benefit from a more detailed description about the statistical tests used for the experiments.

So far, we have no data supporting any explanation for this observation. Our data suggests that both LDT and VTA neurons are changed by iuGC exposure (we see a reduction in TH staining in VTA for example – Leao et al., 2007). Both presynaptic (less acetylcholine being released for example?) and postsynaptic mechanisms (less receptors in VTA dendrites?) can contribute for the increased latency of response. However, because we do not have enough data to support either hypothesis, we decided not to discuss it in detail. However we added the following text (Discussion section): “Another remarkable finding was that the latency of excitatory responses in the VTA upon LDT electrical stimulation was substantially increased in iuGC animals, though so far we do not have any valid explanation for this. A combination of pre- and post-synaptic iuGC-induced changes may contribute for the observed increased latency in excitatory responses, thus more studies are needed in order to dissect this phenomenon.”</p><p>Does the reviewer have any ideas/suggestions?</p><p><italic>About the statement citing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: Altogether, these data demonstrated an imbalance in the excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the LDT.

Now when reviewing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> it is clear what criteria was used, however, it is not clear why there are few blue points (pDAergic) overlapping with the category &quot;other&quot; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is completely right; there was a mistake in the categorization of 4 cells that should have been considered as “other” instead of DAergic. These cells presented a firing rate below 10Hz (firing rate of cell 1: 5.32; cell 2: 5.46; cell 3: 5.53; cell 4: 5.57) and waveform duration below 1.5 ms (duration of cell 1: 0.8; cell 2: 1.2; cell 3: 1.32; cell 4: 1.37). We have now reanalyzed all the electrophysiological data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and corrected the figures and associated statistics.

We have now re-confirmed all the electrophysiological data, corrected cell categorization, and calculated new percentages of response. A correct version of the graph is now provided, please see figure and associated legends and text (subsection “Activation of LDT terminals in the VTA rescues motivational deficits of iuGC animals”).</p><p> <italic>[…] The point was that the optogenetic stimulation of the LDT terminals is not specific to normalize the breakpoint of iuGC animals, since activating this terminal using a stronger protocol also increase the break point in either control or iuGC animals.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the word “normalize” to “revert” as the reviewer suggests – please see subsection “Surgery and cannula implantation”. We did not place the graphs with stronger optogenetic stimulation in main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> because this figure is already very busy with behavioral data.</p><p> <italic>[…] When stating: Moreover, no effects in locomotion were observed using the same stimulation parameters in either group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). This conclusion arises from the analysis performed (one point measured every tens of milliseconds) however an immediate effect on locomotion cannot be discharged (in the range of milliseconds). I previously pointed to the DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0033612 because it was one of the few papers at that time recognizing that there are motor modulations when manipulating VTA Dopaminergic cells activity. Please perform a smaller bin analysis of the data evaluating the manipulations on locomotion.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for explaining this point in more detail. Unfortunately, we are not able to perform a smaller bin analysis of the locomotion data. The data output depends on the parameters chosen <italic>a priori</italic> during the behavior task, i.e. if data is selected to be collected at each second; we cannot analyze a smaller period than that.</p><p>Nevertheless, with the stimulation used in this study, we believe that we should not observe major effects in locomotion based on current bibliography: as elegantly showed in a study by Xiao and colleagues (Xiao et al., 2016), only when targeting the pedunculopontine nucleus, but not the LDT cholinergic projections specifically, they were able to see an effect on locomotor behavior. Additionally, in a previous study (Lammel et al., 2012), authors reported no effect of optical stimulation of all inputs from the LDT to the VTA in locomotion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
