which animals make rhythmical body, head, and bilateral forearm as well as skilled hand movements to spontaneously reel in a string. Typical analysis includes kinematic assessment of hand movements done by manually annotating frames. Here, we describe a Matlab-based software that allows whole-body motion characterization using optical flow estimation, descriptive statistics, principal component, and independent component analyses as well as temporal measures of Fano factor, entropy, and Higuchi fractal dimension. Based on image-segmentation and heuristic algorithms for object tracking, the software also allows tracking of body, ears, nose, and forehands for estimation of kinematic parameters such as body length, body angle, head roll, head yaw, head pitch, and path and speed of hand movements. The utility of the task and software is demonstrated by characterizing postural and hand kinematic differences in string-pulling behavior of two strains of mice, C57BL/6 and Swiss Webster.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>string-pulling</kwd><kwd>biomechanics</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor integration</kwd><kwd>hand kinematics</kwd><kwd>matlab toolbox</kwd><kwd>swiss webster c57bl/6</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>390930</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohajerani</surname><given-names>Majid H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>40352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohajerani</surname><given-names>Majid H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009192</institution-id><institution>Alberta Innovates</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>43568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohajerani</surname><given-names>Majid H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alberta Alzheimer Research Program Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PAZ15010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohajerani</surname><given-names>Majid H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alberta Alzheimer Research Program Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PAZ17010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohajerani</surname><given-names>Majid H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000143</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer Society of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>43674</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohajerani</surname><given-names>Majid H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis methods for video data of rodents engaged in string-pulling behavior have been developed and used to highlight differences in motion profiles of Swiss Webster and C57Bl/6 mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>String-pulling is a proto-tool behavior in which an animal pulls on a string to obtain a reward. Variations of the behavior are observed in over 160 species of animals including birds, bees, rodents and primates and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jacobs and Osvath, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). The task has been used to assess cognitive function, motivation, brain and spinal cord injury and disease consequences and work/reward relations in animals and as a therapy and exercise tool in humans. If animals are presented with an overhanging string, they adopt a standing or sitting posture and use hand-over-hand movements to reel in the string (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackwell et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackwell et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackwell et al., 2018c</xref>). Mice will even spontaneously reel in a string, but the behavior becomes more reliable when reinforced by a food reward attached to the string (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laidre, 2008</xref>). The movement is an on-line act, guided by sensory information from snout vibrissea, and features four hand shaping movements for grasping and releasing the string, and five arm movements for retreiving and advancing the string that are similar in mice, rats, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackwell et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Singh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The reaching/grasping movements of string-pulling resemble the movements of reach-to-eat movements displayed by rodents in other tasks, including the staircase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunnett, 2010</xref>) and the single-pellet reaching task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Whishaw, 1996</xref>) but additionally both hands can be assessed concurrently and many reach movements can be collected rapidly. The organized structure of string-pulling makes the task useful for investigating sensory, motor, cognitive and social learning, as well as studying pathophysiology of motor deficits in animal models of motor disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackwell et al., 2018c</xref>). The string-pulling task for mice has promise as an unconditioned motor task for phenotyping the growing number of transgenic mouse models of neurological and other diseases but requires an analytical method for its systematic analysis. Although most of the work of advancing the string by a mouse is done with the arms and hands, the movements rely on online sensory control and appropriate postural support. Associated with strain differences or neurological impairment, any of these aspects of behavior may be impaired and compensated for by a variety of sensorimotor adjustments in not just the hands but by the entire body. Thus, the analysis of complex changes in behavior require sophisticated whole-body behavioral analysis in addition to the analysis of skilled hand movements. Currently, most of the analysis is carried out with manual annotation of frames leading to low yield of experiments. Automated analysis of mouse string-pulling is useful way for obtaining an objective kinematic assessment of movements, for identifying the contributions of different body parts to string-advancement, and for gaining insights into inter hand coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Whishaw, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunnett and Brooks, 2018</xref>). The objective of the present paper is to describe a state-of-the-art method for analyzing mouse string-pulling.</p><p>We present a Matlab-based toolbox to facilitate the analyses of video data of different strains of intact or neurologically compromised mice engaged in string pulling. The toolbox features a graphical user interface for video data analysis and follows the analysis framework with two major components, a global assessment of whole-body position and speed and fine kinematic assessment of movements of body, ears, nose, and hands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As a first step, the user can run optical flow analysis on video data (image sequence) to estimate velocity vector fields and speed frames. Next using descriptive statistics and temporal measures of Fano factor, entropy, and Higuchi fractal dimension, the user can characterize whole-body position, speeds, and their temporal variability. With principal and independent component analyses of the image sequence and speed frames, the user can assess global position and speed patterns to observe regions of significant motion. Additional spatial measures of entropy, sharpness, and Hausdorff fractal dimension allow the user to quantify randomness, edges, and geometrical complexity respectively and use these quantifications to statistically compare groups of animals. We demonstrate that with the whole-body measures mentioned above, we can detect overall differences in position and motion patterns of two different strains of mice, C57BL/6 (Black) and Swiss Webster Albino (White). Furthermore, using color-based image segmentation and heuristic algorithms, the software allows detailed automatic tracking of body, ears, nose, and hands for kinematic analysesÂ (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The software also allows the user to manually curate and correct automatic tagging of body parts. Finally, the user can either utilize Matlab scripts provided with the software for comparison of groups of mice or export data to Microsoft Excel for further flexible data analyses. A modular approach has been used to build the toolbox, allowing users to add additional analytical probes.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>String-pulling video analysis framework.</title><p>Characterization of whole-body position and speed and their temporal variability is assessed with descriptive statistics, Fano factor, entropy, and Higuchi fractal dimension.

By observing the mean, median, and mode frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>), one can infer the average to most frequent positions of the mouse during string-pulling. These frames of the representative Black and White mice show sitting and standing positions, respectively. For statistical comparison of these frames between groups of Black (NÂ =Â 5) and White (NÂ =Â 5) mice, spatial entropy, sharpness, and Hausdorff fractal dimension (HFD) measures were calculated and compared using Studentâs t-tests. Spatial entropy is measured from 1D projection of the frames while sharpness and HFD operates directly on a 2D frame. Spatial entropy, sharpness, and HFD quantify randomness, edges, and complexity of a frame, respectively. The measures were similar for both groups except that the spatial entropy of the mean frames was larger for White compared to Black mice (p=0.0092, effect sizeÂ =Â 2.157, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This suggests that the mean frame of White mice had more random values as compared to Black mice owing to larger number of distinct positions.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of whole-body position using central-tendency descriptive statistics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative subset of image frames of a string-pulling epoch of a Black mouse.

The standard deviation frame shows a summary of spatial variation of the mouse position over time forÂ example how the body of the representative Black mouse was in a sitting as well as standing position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Conversely, the White mouse remained in a standing position and moved its head left and right thatÂ is yaw motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The skewness and kurtosis frames conveyed similar information and captured rare events such as positions of theÂ string in relation to the mouse body. Both skewness and kurtosis had large values around the mouse body. Like the standard deviation frame, the Fano factor frame also showed change in position over time but with respect to the mean position. Fano factor frame highlighted the changes more than the standard deviation frame; forÂ example for both representative Black and White mice, there is large variation at the top of the head region where the ears are. The temporal entropy of the image sequence quantified randomness of the time series of individual pixels and hence could also be translated to the change in position thatÂ is quantity of motion at the individual pixel location. For the representative Black mouse, it is largest around the boundary of the mouse (note the thin red layer near body edge in the Entropy frame). For the lower half of the body, the thickness of the red band, signifying value, is thin whereas it is large in the upper half of the body where it captured the change in mouseâs sitting to standing posture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For the White mouse, the temporal entropy value was quite large within the mouseâs body depicting large motion of the body. In the upper half of the body, it also revealed a yaw motion of the head. The Higuchi fractal dimension (HiFD) quantified the complexity of the time series of individual pixels in the image sequence. For the representative Black and White mice, HiFD captured changing positions of the string with larger values (hot regions) outside the mouse body. Within the mouse body, it also captured the position of hands which were colocalized with the string in most of the frames (at least one of the hands). The smaller HiFD values (colder regions) for the Black mouse depict the gradual transition in mouse positions from sitting to standing while for the White mouse, they depict its headâs yaw motion.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Characterization of changes in position with variability descriptive statistics, Fano factor, entropy, and Higuchi fractal dimension.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative variability descriptive statistics â standard deviation (Std.

The values of parameters were obtained from their respective frames (e.g. values of HiFD from the HiFD frame) using a mask obtained from the mean frame (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods) depicting average location of the mouse. The outline of this mask for the representative Black mouse is shown in the mean frame in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (for White mouse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). For each animal, the probability density function (PDF) of the values of a parameter were estimated using Gaussian Kernel density estimation. The cumulative density function (CDF) was then determined from PDF. The MeanÂ Â±Â SEM CDFs from 5 Black and 5 White mice are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3CâH</xref>: standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, Fano factor, temporal entropy, and HiFD respectively. Alongside the CDF curves, means over animals are also shown that were obtained by first finding a mean (single value for each animal) of the distribution of a parameter. The means of skewness, temporal entropy, and HiFD were significantly larger for White compared to Black mice (individual Studentâs t-tests, p&lt;0.001, p=0.008, and p=0.007 with the following effect sizes: 4.035, 2.219, and 2.737,Â respectively). The opposite was the case for Kurtosis values (p=0.009, effect sizeÂ =Â 2.138). Together, these significant differences highlight the differences underlying dynamics of pixel intensities that depict changes in positions of Black and White mice forÂ example more negative skewness and smaller temporal entropy and HiFD values for Black mice show more stable and gradual changes in positions.</p><p>We also calculated the spatial measures of entropy, sharpness, and Hausdorff fractal dimension for all the individual frames depicting variability and then used individual Studentâs t-tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Note that these measures are for the whole frames in contrast with above-mentioned analysis where values of parameters forÂ example temporal entropy and HiFD were extracted using a mask representing average position of mouse. Thus, these measures take into account motion of string along with that of mouse. The measures of spatial entropy and sharpness for the standard deviation frames were significantly larger for the White compared to Black mice (p=0.023 and p=0.017 with the following effect sizes: 1.825 and 1.910, respectivelyÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). The spatial entropy of HiFD frame was significantly larger for the Black compared to White mice (p=0.023, effect sizeÂ =Â 1.776). Finally, the sharpness of the Fano factor, temporal entropy, and HiFD frames was significantly larger for the Black compared to White mice (p=0.007, p&lt;0.001, and p=0.007 with the following effect size: 2.261, 3.305, 2.580,Â respectively). Combined these results suggest larger changes in positions of White compared to Black mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Characterization of speeds with central-tendency descriptive statistics reveals larger speeds of White compared to Black mice</title><p>By using the CLG optical flow algorithm, velocity vector fields were determined for each consecutive pair of image frames and then speed frames were obtained by finding the magnitude of velocity vectors.

The mean speed frame was used because the number of frames in a string-pulling epoch can be different from mouse to mouse. Therefore, normalization is done for comparison purpose. The mask was used to get a better estimate of mouse speeds rather than those of spurious speeds of background pixels. The average cumulative distribution of speeds for White and Black mice is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. The mean speed for White mice was significantly larger than that for Black mice (Studentâs t-test, p=0.003, effect sizeÂ =Â 2.607).

Higher order components captured other dominant features of images forÂ example, positions of head and string.

When applied directly on the image sequence, ICA extracts events that have high spatiotemporal contrast thatÂ is where there are sudden changes in an image. Sudden changes include the appearance and disappearance of a hand or string in a frame. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref> show representative independent components (ICs) of image sequences for the representative Black and White mice, respectively. The heat maps show small regions with red and dark blue colors identifying regions of high spatiotemporal contrast (red and blue colors for positive and negative values respectively indicate appearance and disappearance of objects in frames). The ICs of speed frames were similar in appearance to the ICs of image sequence as they picked events with high spatiotemporal changes in speeds thatÂ is mostly movements of the hands and the string. In order to obtain a global picture of the independent components over time, maximum (Max) and minimum (Min) projections were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>) for ICs of both image sequence and speed frames. For both White and Black mice, Max and Min projections of independent components show regions where the hands and string were located.

If segmented regions are close, they are combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and very small regions are ignored. In data for the Black mouse, only two regions remained after the end of this procedure and they were easily labeled as the right and left ears by finding their centroid location relative to body centroid thatÂ is regions left and right to the body centroid would be right and left ears respectively. However, if multiple regions remain after the intersection procedure, regions overlapping (or closest) to ear regions in a previous frame are chosen. Spatial clustering is also applied to combine fragmented regions that are close together. The centroids of the identified ear regions are used to represent their location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> A7, cyan and magenta dots). Next the nose is identified from the nose mask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> A5). After identifying spatial regions, clustering is first used to combine regions that are close together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and then the region closest to the top of the body ellipse is labeled as the nose region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> A6). An ellipse is fitted onto the nose region and the top of this ellipse is used as a single point to represent nose location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> A7, yellow dot). Head yaw is then estimated as the log of the ratio of distance between the nose and the right ear to the distance between nose and left ear. A head yaw value of 0 indicates 0 head yaw angle which means that the face of mouse is facing the camera. In the representative string-pulling epoch of the Black mouse, head yaw values are initially greater than 0 and gradually reduce to values less than 0, indicating that the mouse is moving its head from left to right (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Head roll angle is estimated by finding the angle of line joining the centroids of the regions representing the right and left ears from the horizontal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> A7, long red line).

However, there seems to be a bias for this mouse to keep its head titled such that the right ear is slightly higher than the left ear. Head pitch is estimated as the perpendicular distance between the nose and line joining the two ear centroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> A7, small red line). Positive and negative values of head pitch correspond to nose position above or below the line joining the ears, respectively. In the sample video, the head pitch stays positive most of the time, as the mouse is moving its nose up for sniffing or using its whiskers to track the string (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Furthermore, as has been previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackwell et al., 2018a</xref>), the nose stays close to the string (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Identification of right and left hands and kinematic measures of hand movement of Black mice</title><p>Since both hands move rapidly and have similar colors, it is a challenge to distinctly identify the right and left hands without using a heuristic-based approach. To make automatic identification simpler, we let the user initialize the location of hands in the starting frame, the first frame of an epoch, where a user manually marks two regions representing right and left hands, respectively. In the subsequent frames, automatic identification of the hands in a frame is achieved by using information of the hand location in the previous frame. Automatic identification uses masks for the hands and finds regions using âregionpropsâ function of Matlab. As a first step, the number of regions is reduced such that regions that most likely would represent the hands are kept; forÂ example regions with very small areas (less than 20 mm<sup>2</sup>) are neglected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> A2 represent selected regions after extra regions were neglected). Close by regions are also combined using spatial clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Once a set of reduced number of regions is obtained, the algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplement 1</xref>) identifies the left and right hands.

These masks were then treated as described above to find regions representing the left and right hands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B3Â andÂ B4</xref>). Both methods of finding hand regions are made available in the graphical user interface using choices that can be made with check boxes.</p><p>Since the automatic algorithm is not deterministic but rather makes estimates using heuristics, it is possible that the algorithm incorrectly labels regions as either the right or left hand.

They can be used to calculate kinematic measures.

In the representative epoch of string pulling for the Black mouse, the stroke length of pulling is initially shorter and gradually grows for both right and left hands. With respect to the common origin, for the vertical motion, the two hands are alternating, whereas for the horizontal motion, the two hands move to the right and left together. From the position plots, the speed of the hands can be found by finding a time derivative. The vertical speed of the hands is about two to three times faster than the horizontal speed. During the whole epoch, there are two bouts of rapid pulling each about two secs long (from 2 to 4 sÂ and from 6 to 8 s). During these bouts, the path shapes of strokes of one hand were similar to each other and to the strokes of the other hand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G</xref>). For each stroke, the rise time thatÂ is motion from point of release of the string (near the bottom) to the point of the grasp (near the top) is smaller than the fall time which is the time mouse is pulling the string downwards (Studentâs t-test, p&lt;0.001, NÂ =Â 21 cycles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10H</xref>).

Whereas the Black mouse gradually stood up, increasing its body length while pulling, the White mouse moved the whole body in a rhythmic fashion up and down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>).

Four separate networks were trained; three for the individual recognition of the ears, nose, and hands and one for the combined recognition of all three in a single step. Since the first three networks for individual recognition had better performance (visually observed), they were used in subsequent analysis. Details of training the network and using it to analyze videos can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>. For training each neuronal network, 54 frames were labelled (18 from three different videos) and used to create the training dataset. For each network, training took about 36 hr on a GPU (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 with 8 GB memory) and on a 64-bit Windows 10 computer with two processors (Intel Xeon CPU E5-2620 v4 @ 2.10 Gz) and 256 GB RAM. Training iterations were 1030000 and the train and test errors were as follows in pixels. For network trained to identify; 1) only hands, errors were 3.3 and 3.94, 2) only nose, errors were 4.19 and 8.74, 3) only ears, errors were 4.76 and 11.85, and 4) all objects, errors were 5.07 and 10.46.</p><p>For the epoch shown in previous figures for the Black mouse, the networks (separate for ears, nose, and hands) faithfully identified the ears, nose, and hands, although with some errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>).

Quantification of the body and head postures is presented using estimates of body length and tilt, and head yaw, roll, and pitch angles while kinematic measures are determined for the hands. Because mice track the string with snout sinus hairs, changes in head posture relative to string motion provides an estimate of sensorimotor integration. Kinematic measures for body and head can also be calculated from the quantifications provided. This toolbox is provided under the GNU General Public Licence v3.0, and is open source, free, and any modifications are allowed as long as this paper is cited when publishing or distributing a modified version. Here, we discuss phenotypic differences in behavior in exemplar mouse strains used for the analysis, characteristics and limitations of the toolbox as well as comparison with other similar software.</p><p>The description of behavior is central to understanding neural organization and function and accordingly behavior is frequently fractionated to describe the contributions of different body parts. The description of motor abnormalities emphasizes the allied contributions in which one body part compensates for impairment of other body parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alaverdashvili and Whishaw, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones, 2017</xref>). For example, in using a hand to reach, detailed descriptions of hand movement also require a description of the contribution of postural adjustments of the body. Optimal string pulling can be envisioned as an act featuring individual arm/hand movements made with respect to a stable base of support featuring little body movement. Any variation of this relationship between the hands and body may be an expression of compensatory adjustment. The present procedure provides an integrated view of a prototool use behavior in which skilled hand movements are described along with the contributions of body movement, posture, and orientation.</p><p>We demonstrate phenotyping differences in the motor behavior of C57BL/6 (Back) and Swiss Webster (White) mice and present findings that White mice have larger variation in positions of the body, larger body speed but smaller reach-cycle time of string-pulling motion as compared to Black mice. The interpretation of this result is that the White mice are displaying an impairment in arm/hand movements relative to Black mice and so use upper arm and body motion for compensation. It is recognized that albino mice display anatomical abnormalities in the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2019</xref>), other physiological processes forÂ example fatty acid uptake and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Seeger and Murphy, 2016</xref>), and recovery after spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Noristani et al., 2018</xref>). There is also evidence that albino strains of laboratory animals display motor system abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">VandenBerg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Whishaw et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it is possible to speculate that abnormalities in motor systems, such as the corticospinal tracts that control the arms and hands, lead to compensatory whole-body movements of string pulling in the White mice, as is reported after motor cortex stroke in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farr and Whishaw, 2002</xref>).</p><p>That the string-pulling procedure captures strain differences in the two exemplar strains of mice that are examined, in which Swiss Wister mice display more body motion relative to C57BL/6 mice, shows that the procedures can be used for phenotyping strain differences more generally. In addition, the behavior of string-pulling is homologous to string-pulling described in many other animal species including humans, suggesting that our method can be exploited for species comparisons and for developing other animal models of human neurological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ryait et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Singh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The whole-body analysis approach</title><p>The whole-body analysis approach developed and presented here provides a generic method for analyzing animal behavior. With this approach, rather than analyzing kinematics of body movements, overall characteristics of the image sequence and derived spatiotemporal signals such as speed frames are assessed within a spatially confined region representing the average position/location of the animal. Thus, the need for pose estimation or tracking of body parts is eliminated. Intuitively, spatiotemporal signals with two spatial dimensions and a temporal dimension can be assessed with spatial and temporal measures and could also be examined using factorization to decompose into simpler components using for example principal and independent component analysis. To obtain a global and spatial summary over time, calculations were first performed in the temporal dimension to obtain single 2D frames forÂ example with temporal measures of central and variability descriptive statistics, Fano factor, entropy, and Higuchi fractal dimension, for quantifying the regularity and variation, dispersion, randomness/disorder, and complexity respectively of the time series of pixel values. After these quantifications, a consistent method is required to compare them across animals and groups of animals.</p><p>The spatial mean values of the above-mentioned parameters over the average position or location of the animal is a reasonable overall spatiotemporal estimation, and as demonstrated above, allowed highlighting statistically significant differences between White and Black mice. Further differences between White and Black mice were evident with spatial measures of entropy, sharpness, and Hausdorff fractal dimension applied on previously obtained single 2D frames for quantifying their randomness/disorder, edges/blurriness, and complexity, respectively. One can envision mouse string pulling as a modification of climbing a string and accordingly, the more erect posture of the White mice uncovers a different strategy relative to strategy of the Black mice. Note that an expert eye might observe speed differences between Black and White mice from raw videos, but the spatiotemporal measurements demonstrated here provide statistical evidence not only for speed differences but also for gauging randomness and complexity of signals. Some of the measurements shown here were not statistically different between Black and White mice. However, for a different set of videos or an increase in sample number the differences might become significant statistically. Therefore, all the measures are included in the toolbox for users to apply and explore in the data at hand.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Robustness and limitations of image segmentation and automatic detection of body parts</title><p>The success of the heuristic approach to detect body parts automatically is crucially dependent upon the quality of masks generated with image segmentation. Therefore, four strategies have been devised to improve image segmentation. First, an interface is provided to select colors of objects where the user can interactively select a region of interest, select a candidate set of colors, and then inspect the mask for accuracy (see methods). This way a narrow range of colors can be selected to represent an object. Second, a âzoom windowâ is used to select a region of frame which encompasses the whole behavioral epoch of interest and therefore allows for fast and improved image segmentation (only look for colors where the user knows they are). An automatic method for detecting zoom window has been implemented where in each frame, the boundaries of the animal are found based on its body set of colors (defined previously). The zoom window found automatically can be inspected and modified as well as can also be defined manually all together. Third, similar to the zoom window, a âhead boxâ is found to define a window containing only the head. Head box is also found automatically, can be later inspected and modified. The use of head box improves the efficiency of detection of ears as the search region is restricted.</p><p>Finally, three different methods for image segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>)Â have been provided (KNN, rangesearch, and a custom algorithm) to allow the user to choose what might work best for the data set at hand. KNN and rangesearch algorithms work similarly to find colors of interest that are closest to the colors of choice based on âEuclidian distanceâ. However, KNN searches for the nearest neighbors while in rangesearch the user predefines the Euclidian distance. For videos with excellent contrast thatÂ is clear separation of colors of body parts from background such as for the illustrative Black mouse shown here (see figures above), rangesearch with a Euclidian distance of 1.5 (default in GUI) works very well. However, KNN works better for frames where more rigorous search of closest colors is required. For poor videos where background has colors like those of body parts, the custom algorithm works best. This algorithm divides the screen using a grid and then uses rangesearch to find colors within each grid cell. Using a manually set threshold, this method eliminates spurious pixels and one gets sparser segments depending upon the size of the grid. Sparser segments allow for more accurate detection of islands that represent a certain body part. An illustrative example of finding masks with three methods is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s1">Figure 15âfigure supplement 1</xref> for the tail-clasped mouse to demonstrate the sparsity of segments found with the custom method. An example of finding all the body parts in a video collected with different illumination conditions, camera angle, and brown-colored table-top is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s2">Figure 15âfigure supplement 2</xref> which illustrates the effectiveness of the above-mentioned strategies of image segmentation.</p><p>Automatic identification of body parts features a heuristics approach which requires consistent input data, thatÂ is the videos be recorded in a consistent manner. The number of pixels in a frame, frame rate, illumination conditions, and overall position of the mouse in video frames, if consistent from video to video, will make processing effective. If these parameters are changed, image segmentation options (see above) and thresholds that are set in the software can be readjusted for improving accuracy. These thresholds are mentioned in the âselectAppropriateRegionsâ function in the toolbox and in individual functions to identify body parts.</p><p>Due to the use of a heuristic approach, sometimes the algorithm fails to correctly identify regions for hands. In cases where a Matlab error occurs while identifying the hands, the user is given the option for manual tagging. Nevertheless, in case of no Matlab error, the algorithm can still incorrectly label a region as a nose rather than a hand. In such a case, the user has to manually observe frames for accurate detection and in case of erroneous tagging, use the manual tagging option provided in the GUI. Furthermore, the erroneous tagging in one frame can continue into subsequent frames because identification of the hands in a frame depends on correct identification in a previous frame. Therefore, the recommendation is to process the 20 frames that are displayed along with GUI together. In the sample data of the Black mouse, less than 2% of frames (6/477) were incorrectly labeled for hands and had to be tagged manually. The other case in which erroneous tagging might happen includes videos in which a mouse is pulling a string when turned sideways. In this case only one ear is visible. Then, when both ears appear again, the algorithm still detects one ear. The user has to again manually initialize the detection of the other non-detected ear for the software to automatically detect the ear in subsequent frames.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Video acquisition strategy to improve accuracy of automatic detection of body parts</title><p>Since, image segmentation and the heuristic algorithms rely on high-contrast image sequence, the choice of colors for background and string can affect the outcome forÂ example if for a White mouse, white background or string is chosen, the software would not be able to distinguish between string and body (fur of the animal). Similarly, if shutter speed of the camera is not high enough, frames in the image sequence will have blurry objects particularly hands as they have high-speed motion. The software will then have difficulty in resolving colors of hands from blurry images.</p><p>Illumination conditions should also be such as to enhance the contrast of acquired images. We recommend using front facing cold light (on the same side as the camera), thatÂ is light is in front of the animal. High resolution of the video is also preferred for better pixel resolution for resolving body parts (HD 1920 x 1080 is recommended). Note that these requirements are important for identifying and tracking body parts in videos but whole-body assessment can still be done on low- to medium-quality videos.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Comparison with artificially intelligent machine learning based software</title><p>Machine learning (ML) based software for pose estimation in videos such as âDeepLabCutâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>) and âAnimal Part Trackerâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>) and for object recognition such as âDeepBehaviorâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arac et al., 2019</xref>) can provide a seamless work flow, but they are computationally intensive initially when training is required.

In comparison, ML-based software require high-end computers ideally with graphical processing units.</p><p>In contrast with DeepLabCut and AnimalPartTracker, our approach for characterizing string-pulling behavior has several advantages. Instead of just pose estimation, it provides direct measurements of relevant parameters that might be used to identify similarities and differences between control and experimental groups of animals forÂ example whole-body analysis, use of optical flow to identify speeds, identification of body length and angle, head posture, and kinematic analysis of body and hand movements. To identify body length with ML based software, one would have to label many points around the body and track them in frames to identify the body boundary. In short, the method imposes a priori an interpretation of the behavior, whereas our segmentation methods is neutral and so is more objective in this respect.</p><p>With body color definition and image segmentation, identification of theÂ body is a breeze, and features almost 100% accuracy. For other body parts as well, ML-based pose estimation would track points, whereas with image segmentation one can track regions/areas which with the former method must be done in a secondary analysis. The approach presented here also has a faster lead time. The user can obtain results the same day after data acquisition as our software does not need any prior training of a neural network (which can take several days), rather one can open videos and start analyzing right away. Depending upon the quality of videos, 2â4 hr might be required to analyze 500 frames. Although, after training a neural network, individual videos might take smaller amount of time for pose estimation, post manual validation and subsequent analysis must be done for characterizing behavior. In the provided toolbox, pdfs of final high-quality figures are made and stored for immediate use and scripts are provided to compare groups of animals. The faster lead time with the current approach would also apply were experimental conditions changed forÂ example animal species or strain, whereas retraining of the neural network would be required.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Data compression for efficient storage of masks</title><p>While writing this software, data compression techniques were used to minimize storage of calculated masks in addition to the provision provided to select a zoom window which uses a subset of frames to process. Since each pixel of a mask is either 1 or a 0, it can occupy a single bit in a 1-byte number. This way individual bits of a byte represent a single pixel of an individual mask while the whole byte can be used to store one pixel for eight masks. Using this methodology, five masks are stored in an array with each element one byte long.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Support and software maintenance, future work, and possible extensions of the toolbox and the string-pulling behavioral task</title><p>A user manual of the software has been provided in the online wiki at the GitHub page along with a video tutorial. Support for issues with the software will be provided via email or through the GitHub support page where other people will be able to view issues and their solutions. The software will be maintained as per need and any further improvements and changes will be updated on the GitHub âreadmeâ and ârevisionsâ page. In case major revisions are made to the software regarding GUI or improvements in detection algorithms, a completely newer version will be provided on GitHub and the users will be redirected to the newer GitHub page. An undisclosed email list serv of the users will be kept by the corresponding authors. Users will be encouraged to contribute toward future development and will be added as contributors to the GitHub page.</p><p>Future development regarding whole-body analysis might include assessing spatiotemporal properties of the phase of velocity vectors which would add directional information to motion measurements. For the tracking of body parts, additional functionality could be added regarding detection of phases of string-pulling movements forÂ example when the hands grasp and release the string. String masks are available in the toolbox to add this functionality. The heuristic algorithms can also be easily modified by changing the appropriate functions. The string-pulling task can also be enriched with sensory, motor, and behavioral complexity. For example, sensory complexity would involve strings with different cross-sections, texture, or coated with odors. Motor complexity would involve adding tension or variable load to the string. Behavioral complexity would involve a paradigm in which the animal has to learn to associate string-pulling with a rewardÂ forÂ example water.</p><p>Social competition or social altruism can also be studied with string-pulling. For example, in a competitive strategy, two animals will pull the string from two ends to obtain reward attached in the middle. The scenario could be presented to study motivation before and after stress. In experiments to study altruism, string pulling of one animal could give the reward to another animal. Motor memory formation and the role of sleep in its consolidation could also be studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inayat et al., 2020b</xref>). We anticipate that this toolbox holds promise for facilitating high-throughput platform for the behavioral screening of drugs that may help in the treatment of Parkinson, Huntington, Alzheimer and similar diseases in addition to brain injuries (i.e. ischemic stroke, spinal cord injury, etc.). In short, the method can reveal the extent to which the hands can be used independently of the body, the asymmetry of hand use, the sensory control of reach guidance, the speed/accuracy of hand use, and compensatory adjustments between the individual measures. Exemplar assessments are relevant to estimating the effects of brain injury and disease, recovery and treatment effects, as well as strain and species differences in string pulling behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>Adult mice 3â6 months old, five male C57 Bl/6J (Black) and five male Swiss Webster Albino (White), were used in this study. No explicit power analysis was used to estimate sample size because in this work our goal was to establish analysis methods. NÂ =Â 5 was chosen for both strains of mice due to limited availability of White mice. We observed a statistically significant effect of genotype for many parameters (see results) with the chosen sample size. To examine magnitude of effect where statistical significance was observed, we also report effect size.</p><p>Animals were kept in a controlled temperature (22Â°C), humidity, and light with a 12:12 light/dark cycle. They were singly housed as they were food restricted to increase the yield of string-pulling behavior. All testing and training were performed during the light phase of the cycle. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care and were approved by the University of Lethbridge Animal Welfare Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>String-pulling task</title><p>The apparatus and training procedure were as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackwell et al., 2018a</xref>). Briefly, the test box consisted of a clear Plexiglas cage (20 cm long, 9 cm wide, and 20 cm high) in which a string was thrown over the center of the front wall so that its end could be reached by the mouse. A video camera was placed in front of the cage and behavior was filmed with a Panasonic camcorder at 60 f/s with a 1/1000 shutter speed and frame resolution of 1920 Ã 1080 pixels. For three White mice, the data was collected with another camera, a Sony Camcorder with 1/750 shutter speed and 60 f/s. Mice would spontaneously pull the string into the cage but were also lightly food restricted so that they were motivated to pull the string to obtain a food reward (pieces of a cashew nut or cheerios) attached to the end of the string.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Analysis platform and preliminary processing</title><p>Matlab R2016 and Microsoft Windows platform was used for the development of the toolbox and analysis of the video record. Later, it was tested and upgraded to work in Matlab R2018b and Matlab 2019b. From the videos, a subset of frames representing string-pulling epoch was selected. The start of the epoch was when the mouse touched the string and started pulling it down while the end of epoch was when the mouse stopped the bout of string-pulling. Furthermore, a subregion of frames was selected for analysis to reduce computation time. In the toolbox, this subregion is called âauto zoom windowâ and is found automatically but is also subject to adjustment.</p><p>In order to do a fair comparison between the performances of Black and White mice with whole-body analysis, the image frames of Black mice were complemented using Matlabâs âimcomplementâ function. To accelerate the processing of whole-body analyses, red, green, and blue (RGB) frames were first resized to one-fourth their original size using Matlabâs âimresizeâ function and then converted to gray scale frames using Matlabâs ârgb2grayâ function. The user can, however, set the image resize value using the provided graphical user interface (see below). For kinematic assessment of movements, body, ears, nose, and hands were tracked in the original frames using color-based image segmentation and heuristic algorithms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Optical flow analysis of image sequence for estimation of velocity vector fields and speed frames</title><p>The Combined Local-Global (CLG) method was used to estimate optical flow in string pulling videos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruhn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afrashteh et al., 2017</xref>). The Matlab implementation of the CLG method provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu, 2009</xref> was used with the following default parameters which the user can modify if required (alphaÂ =Â 0.01, ratioÂ =Â 0.5, minWidthÂ =Â 20, nOuterFPIterationsÂ =Â 7, nInnerFPIterationsÂ =Â 1, nSORIterationsÂ =Â 30). This method was chosen because it provides a better optical flow estimate compared to Horn-Schunck and Temporospatial methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afrashteh et al., 2017</xref>). The chosen parameter values faithfully estimated optical flow, as was validated with visual observation of moving objects in frames. To reduce computational time, image frames in videos were reduced by four times but resizing of image frames did not affect the quality of images or the calculations of optical flow as confirmed with visual observation of velocity vector fields. As the optical flow computes one velocity vector field frame from two video frames, the number of optical flow frames thatÂ is velocity vector fields, is one less than that of video frames.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Descriptive statistics</title><p>The mean, median, mode, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis were calculated for image sequence and speed frames by using respective Matlab functions.

Prior to finding this measure, 'mat2gray' Matlab function was applied on time series to scale maximum and minimum values as 1 and 0, respectively. The Higuchi fractal dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Higuchi, 1988</xref>) frame was also calculated from the time series of individual pixels in a similar way using a function downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/50290-higuchi-and-katz-fractal-dimension-measures">https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/50290-higuchi-and-katz-fractal-dimension-measures</ext-link>. The value of Kmax parameter used to find HiFD was arbitrarily chosen to be 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">SpasiÄ et al., 2005</xref>). The measures of Fano factor, entropy, and HiFD were also calculated in the same way for speed frames.</p><p>To statistically compare the values of the above-mentioned parameters between groups of Black and White mice, values of parameters were extracted from respective frames using the mean position mask (seeÂ above). For example, for comparing entropy, values of entropy were selected from the entropy frame from pixels that had a corresponding value of 1 in the mean position mask. The mean of all these entropy values was chosen as a representative value for the animal.

To apply âfastICAâ on the image sequence or speed frames, the 3D matrix of frames was converted to a 2D matrix with the number of rows equal to HxW and columns equal to N where H and W are the number of height and width pixels while N is the number of frames. Here N was equal to 50% of the original number of frames in the image sequence or speed frames thatÂ is number of independent components was chosen to be 50% of the number of frames in the input sequence. This was done to reduce computational time. After applying the fastICA function, individual component frames were determined by reshaping from 1D scores (HxW) to H rows and W columns. Since, the algorithm to find ICs is iterative, the minimum tolerance set to stop iterations was 5e-5 and the maximum number of iterations was set to 1000. ICs were found before reaching the maximum number of iterations thatÂ is the error went below tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Calculation of spatial measures of entropy, sharpness, and Hausdorff fractal dimension</title><p>For various frames obtained in the previous sets of whole-body analyses; forÂ example mean frame of image sequence or the first principal component frame, spatial entropy, sharpness, and Hausdorff fractal dimension (HFD) were calculated.

This fractal dimension uses the following relationship; HFD = -log (N(Îµ))/log(Îµ) where N is the number of pixels above zeros in a box and Îµ is the box size. In the box counting method, an image is first binarized using an appropriate threshold and then non-overlapping boxes of different sizes (different Îµ values) are overlayed on the image and the number of pixels above zero value are counted to obtain N(Îµ). A line is then fitted for a scatter plot of log(N(Îµ)) and log(Îµ) and the slope of that line provides the fractal dimension (FD). Here, the threshold used to binarize an image was the mean value of all its pixels. For the Black mice, the frames were complemented before the calculation of HFD for comparison with White mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Synthetic data for testing and validation of algorithms</title><p>To test the efficacy of the software, two different types of data sets were generated, 1) empirical: based on experimental values of mouse body position and those of hands, nose, and ears, and 2) modelled: where the movement of hands were calculated by a sinusoidal function. For both data sets, color of fur/body, ears, nose, and hand were chosen from the range of observed values to create elliptical patches of body parts on a rectangular background patch. For empirical data, animal movements were created using the centroid, major- and minor- axis of the ellipse calculated from the real experiments. For modeled data, we observed that x- and y- motion of hands can be modelled using two 180Â° out of phase sinusoidal oscillators, and body tilt is in-phase with the reaching-hand. In general, we observed that one complete reach-grasp-release cycle was completed inÂ ~12 frames (0.2 s). Thus, the 360Â° x- and y- motion was divided into 12 parts to mimic the hand movements. Further, hand movements were linked to the body centre to mimic the changes in hand movements associated with body movements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Color-based image segmentation for gross motion assessment and tracking of body, ears, nose, and hands</title><p>In computer vision, image segmentation is a basic process in which an image is divided into regions based on distinguishing features, such as color and texture. In the current video data, we utilized color-based segmentation of frames for finding regions containing fur, ears, nose, hands, and the string. To define a color, a user first selects a rectangular region around the object of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>) forÂ example, hands. K-means clustering is then used to separate colors in the rectangular region into three clusters. With trial and error, it was found that three clusters were sufficient to separate colors of interest for body and hands while seven clusters were sufficient for separating colors of interest for the string and nose. The number of clusters can be changed with the user interface, however. The user is then allowed to choose the cluster that represents the object of interest forÂ example, cyan cluster in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref> A3 for hands. Using these colors, a mask is then generated and shown to the user for visual inspection. Through the supplied interface, the user can then add or subtract colors until a reasonable mask is generated. The user can then move to the next frame and repeat the process for the new frame. This way, with five to ten frames within an epoch chosen randomly, an appropriate selection of colors for an object of interest is made. All color values in a cluster are stored and later used to find masks. In a similar fashion, the user selects colors for other objects of interest.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig15" position="float"><label>Figure 15.</label><caption><title>Image segmentation based on object colors for finding object masks and gross assessment from descriptive statistics of masks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Color definitions in original frames are semi-automatically made with the userâs assistance for fur, ears, nose, hands, and string.

A rectangular window around the blob is drawn to define a sub region of frames for which masks are then found (A5, representative masks). The determination of rectangular window can also be done automatically and modified later if required.

To save computational time and memory storage, masks are not found for the whole frame, rather for a subset of each frame. The region of a frame for which masks are determined is found such that it includes the mouse body in all frames of an epoch. First, the range of motion of the whole mouse body within an epoch is estimated by finding the edges of a mouseâs body in each frame of an epoch and plotting them together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref> A4). The user then draws a window around the blob of plotted edges, which is then stored as a parameter in âauto zoom windowâ and used to find masks.

normal and neurologically compromised mice. The laboratories of Whishaw and Mohajerani demonstrate algorithms to automate the study of postural and hand kinematics in string-pulling behavior. This adds a new dimension to the routines available for high-throughput, high-volume studies of behavior.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Matlab-based toolbox for characterizing behavior of rodents engaged in string-pulling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two expert and respected peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Kleinfeld as Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and with the Reviewing Editor, and they find considerable merit in your Resources contribution, which addresses quantification of a behavioral paradigm of increasing importance and use in the spinal cord circuit community. However, the reviewers raise a number of strong and legitimate concerns that we ask be addressed. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Coordination of limb movement is a hallmark of spinal cord motor control. Rope pulling, which involves such coordination in addition to proper posture and grasping, is a critical task in the study of spinal circuits. This work describes a set of software tools for the automated characterization of this behavior, and thus provides a valuable tool for the behavioral characterization of spinal circuits and experimental modification of those circuits.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Some of these steps will require new data analysis.</p><p>Please clarify the specifics of your tracking accuracy. &quot;The paper states that &quot;our methods can provide group truth data for validating the results of neural network-based tagging of body parts.&quot; It is not clear how this conclusion is derived.&quot;</p><p>Please address the robust nature of your approach. &quot;It is unclear how robust the segmentation is to variations in the video, such as camera angle relative to the mouse, illumination conditions, and color of the mice. For example, the paws of the white mice could not be reliably tracked, and the authors had to use markers to paint the paws. This suggest variations in the video could strongly affect the outcome.&quot;</p><p>Please simplify the statistics and justify all measures. &quot;â¦ while central-tendency results show large difference in speed between Black and White mice, it is unclear how spatial entropy, sharpness, Hausdorff fractal dimension, Higuichi fractal dimension, Fano Factor, and Entropy support this effect&quot;. Nor is the necessity of bringing these statistical measures made clear.</p><p>Please bring trial-averaged data. As string-pulling is a highly repetitive near rhythmic behavior, it would be useful to see the average cycle of the behavior to understand the stereotypical hand movements. Such response could be computed from the data of Figure 10 and 11 by warping each pull cycle to a common time base. Then &quot;compare descriptive statistics to quantify differences in hand movement trajectories across White and Black mouse groups.&quot;</p><p>Please discuss the generality of your software. It would be useful to see if the software for string pulling could be adapted to &quot;â¦ analyze limb movements during pasta handling, thereby showing general applicability of the software.&quot;</p><p>Please discuss the support and maintenance. Further, the poor documentation must be improved and the associated GitHub must be organized</p><p>Please explicitly spell out the advantages of your approach over related methods. In this regard, address the black-box method of &quot;DeepLabCut&quot; and the &quot;Janelia Animal Part Tracker&quot;.</p><p>Lastly, please make the toolbox available to be downloaded in Matlab 2019b (reviewers were unable to successfully download).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A Matlab-based toolbox for characterizing behavior of rodents engaged in string-pulling&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers would like you to please provide more discussion of the significance of these findings for an average audience. The data show how whole-body measurements could be used to reveal differences in motor kinematics between mouse strains. These analyses suggest that Swiss Webster Albino (white) mice exhibit faster movements that are more localized to the forelimb compared to black 6 mice. What is the significance of these differences? For example, the authors interpret these differences as the white mice using a &quot;more primitive strategy&quot; than the black mice. In addition, the white mice were considered to have &quot;exaggerated compensatory adjustment&quot; and &quot;impaired individualized arm/hand movements&quot;. Please elaborate on how these conclusions were derived and what are the implications for future studies?</p><p>We also noted a number of typos and errors in figure references. Here are some examples:</p><p>â In the first paragraph of the subsection âComparison with artificially intelligent machine learning based softwareâ, Figure 2.11 is likely referring to Figure 12.</p><p>â At the end of the first paragraph of the subsection âRobustness and limitations of image segmentation and automatic detection of body partsâ, the figure is incorrectly referenced.

We describe that with manual validation, frames are found where the algorithm âcorrectlyâ identified a body part and hence accuracy is the percentage of these frames. Furthermore, in the section âNeural networks for identifying ears, nose, and handsâ, we describe that because manual validation is part of the procedure we have developed, our software can be used to generate âground truthâ data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please address the robust nature of your approach. &quot;It is unclear how robust the segmentation is to variations in the video, such as camera angle relative to the mouse, illumination conditions, and color of the mice.

We also demonstrate robustness of image segmentation with mouse tail clasping video which we added to demonstrate the general applicability of the software (please see our fifth response below and Figure 14âfigure supplement 1). Furthermore, in another test video with a camera angle such that the surface of a brown table was visible and shadows of mouse could be seen in the plexiglass box (please see Figure 15âfigure supplement 2), we identified body, ears, nose, and hands with 100, 100, 100, and 95 percent accuracy in the 40 frames that we analyzed for testing.</p><p>It is important to note that with this program, investigators are not prisoners of filming constraints, targets can be colored as with the White mice to enhance filming contrasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please simplify the statistics and justify all measures. &quot;â¦ while central-tendency results show large difference in speed between Black and White mice, it is unclear how spatial entropy, sharpness, Hausdorff fractal dimension, Higuichi fractal dimension, Fano Factor, and Entropy support this effect&quot;. Nor is the necessity of bringing these statistical measures made clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We have updated sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 where more interpretation of results has been provided e.g., how statistical differences between parameters highlight differences in dynamics of pixel intensities and speed signals depicting changes in positions and speeds of Black vs. White mice respectively. We have also added a new Discussion section âThe whole-body Analysis Approachâ where spatial and temporal measures that have been used are explained and justified. We argue that although in the current data set, some of the measures do not show a statistically significant difference between the two groups of mice, Black and White, in different data sets or with increased sample number, one might find significant differences. Therefore, for the sake of completion, we have included all the measures in the toolbox as part of the âwhole-body analysis approachâ which we highlight in Figure 1 summarizing analysis framework.</p><p>We also note that by using the excel data files, an investigator can explore any of a number of task relevant analyses including, independent movement of the hand relative to the body, asymmetry in hand movements, missed grasp vs. successful grasps, compensatory movements of the body relative to hand movement, sensory monitoring of the string using comparisons of snout movement vs. string movement, and so on.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please bring trial-averaged data.

Then &quot;compare descriptive statistics to quantify differences in hand movement trajectories across White and Black mouse groups.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Please see updated Figure 11 where trial averaged data is now shown and compared between Black and White mice. Although the mean amplitude of movement of hands is smaller for White compared to Black mice, it is not statistically significant. We have also performed dynamic time warping and included average cycles of Black and White mice in Figure 11âfigure supplement 1. The amplitudes of Black and White mice were not statistically different.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please discuss the generality of your software.

We have analyzed two videos unrelated to string pulling, 1) in which a human is throwing and catching a ball, and 2) a mouse is clasped from tail and motion of body and hind paws is observed. Raw and tagged videos are included on the online GitHub wiki sample videos section. We have made raw and analyzed data available through the OSF website. In the manuscript Figure 14 and its supplement are included as illustrations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please discuss the support and maintenance.

We have updated âreadmeâ and âSupportâ file on GitHub delineating installation procedure and added a wiki user manual demonstrating usage with illustrations (screen clips) of the software windows and interactions.

We discuss that our approach provides direct measures of relevant parameters to analyze string pulling behavior. Instead of just pose estimation where points are tracked, with image segmentation, regions can be tracked e.g., body whose length and tilt can be measured directly from the identified region. Subsequent analyses show White mice have larger body linear and angular speed. Our approach doesnât require large computation power and lead time is faster because no neural network training is required which can take several days. If experimental conditions are changed, retraining of networks is usually required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, please make the toolbox available to be downloaded in Matlab 2019b (reviewers were unable to successfully download).</p></disp-quote><p>We tested the software with Matlab 2018b and Matlab 2019b and have updated the Materials and methods section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers would like you to please provide more discussion of the significance of these findings for an average audience.
