Preclinical studies allow imaging of cell location and survival. Labelling with nanoparticles enables high sensitivity detection, but cell division and cell death cause signal dilution and false positives. By contrast, genetic reporter signals are amplified by cell division. Here, we characterise lentivirus-based bi-cistronic reporter gene vectors and silica-coated gold nanorods (GNRs) as synergistic tools for cell labelling and tracking. Co-expression of the bioluminescence reporter luciferase and the optoacoustic reporter near-infrared fluorescent protein iRFP720 enabled cell tracking over time in mice. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) showed immediate biodistribution of GNR-labelled cells after intracardiac injection and successive clearance of GNRs (day 1–15) with high resolution, while optoacoustic iRFP720 detection indicated tumour growth (day 10–40). This multimodal cell tracking approach could be applied widely for cancer and regenerative medicine research to monitor short- and long-term biodistribution, tumour formation and metastasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33140.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many scientists are studying the possibility of using human cells to treat diseases. For example, using stem cells to regenerate damaged body parts or genetically engineered immune cells to destroy cancer. Scientists need new tools to track what happens to these cells once they have been injected into a laboratory animal. This will help them understand how they work and make sure these potential treatments are safe. One concern with using cells as a treatment is that they might form cancerous tumors.</p><p>To track these cells in a laboratory animal, scientists need two things: a way to distinguish the treatment cells from the animal’s normal cells and an imaging tool that allows them to see where the cells are in a living animal. One way to differentiate treatment cells from normal cells is to genetically engineer them to make a fluorescent protein called iRFP720. Another way is to fill the cells with gold nanorods. Both, the fluorescent protein and the gold nanorods, absorb light in the infrared range. Scientists can use a technique called multispectral optoacoustic tomography, which transforms infrared light into ultrasound signals to create an image, to see where these markers are in the body.</p><p>Now, Comenge et al. showed that the gold nanorods and multispectral optoacoustic tomography track the cells immediately after injection into the blood stream of a mouse. Most of the injected cells die within a few days, and the nanorods are progressively eliminated from the body through the liver. But some of the injected cells live on, multiply, and form tumors within a month. This was expected because the cells they used were chosen for their ability to sometimes form tumors. Using multispectral optoacoustic tomography to track the cells making iRFP720, Comenge et al. were able to see exactly where the tumors are deep inside the body.</p><p>Together, gold nanorods and iRFP720 could allow scientists to track where the cell-based therapies for cancer or other diseases go in the short and long term. This may help them prove whether these treatments work, and whether they have harmful effects. Comenge et al. are helping other scientists to use these techniques by distributing their tool for making iRFP720-producing cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gold

<italic>in vivo</italic> research include bioluminescence (BLI) and fluorescence as well as photoacoustic/optoacoustic tomography, a technology that has only been developed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deliolanis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Yao, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weber et al., 2016</xref>). These imaging modalities have enabled great progress in the tracking of labelled cells longitudinally over time in animal models of disease, which has become especially relevant for cancer research and cell-based regenerative medicine therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Almeida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">James and Gambhir, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sharkey et al., 2016</xref>). The resolution and sensitivity of optical imaging in animals is limited by autofluorescence, absorption and scattering of excitation and/or emission light, especially in deep tissues. The optimal window for <italic>in vivo</italic> optical imaging lies in the near infrared (NIR) spectrum (~650–900 nm), since absorption through the main endogenous chromophores (oxy-haemoglobin, deoxy-haemoglobin, melanin, water and lipids) are minimal in this spectral range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weber et al., 2016</xref>). For permanent cell labelling and tracking, genetic modification with reporter genes is the method of choice, although fluorescent tags and nanoparticles have been developed recently for sensitive short-term cell tracking over a period of a few cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Comenge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dixon et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Using luciferase reporter genes, bioluminescence constitutes the most sensitive optical modality due to its excellent signal-to-noise ratio, as light emission only occurs in the presence of a functional enzyme and its required co-factors. Firefly, luciferase has become the most widely used reporter as its substrates, D-luciferin or CycLuc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans et al., 2014</xref>), are very well tolerated by animals and, compared to other luciferases, its peak light emission at around 562 nm is closest to the infrared window for in vivo imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Almeida et al., 2011</xref>). Although highly sensitive <italic>in vivo</italic> cell tracking via bioluminescence imaging of firefly luciferase is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Almeida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mezzanotte et al., 2013</xref>), this modality provides poor information about the spatial localisation of cells. Fluorescence has recently gained importance for animal imaging, since novel near-infrared fluorescent proteins (iRFPs) were developed from bacterial phytochrome photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shcherbakova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shcherbakova and Verkhusha, 2013</xref>). Similar to bioluminescence imaging, fluorescence only allows limited spatial resolution due to the high scattering coefficient of photons in tissues.</p><p>On the other hand, photoacoustic imaging is based on the generation of ultrasound waves after absorption of light emitted by a pulsed laser. The sound waves are well transmitted in fluid media and less prone to scattering through tissues than emitted light. In fact, acoustic scattering is three orders of magnitude less than photon scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang and Hu, 2012</xref>), which overcomes deep tissue spatial resolution drawbacks of other optical-based imaging technologies. Interestingly, some iRFPs, such as iRFP720, have an absorption profile in the NIR window, thus enabling their use as reporter genes for photoacoustic imaging, and allowing deep tissue imaging and tumour monitoring in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deliolanis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiguet-Jiglaire et al., 2014</xref>). For example, new iRFPs have been proven to be useful genetic photoacoustic reporters in mammary gland and brain tumour monitoring, which establishes them as dual-modality imaging probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deliolanis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Filonov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krumholz et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, in multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), a rapid multiwavelength excitation allows the distinction between different absorbers simultaneously after applying multispectral unmixing algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tzoumas et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, a number of endogenous (e.g. deoxy- and oxyhaemoglobin) or exogenously introduced targets can be imaged <italic>in vivo</italic> via MSOT, including fluorescent proteins and nanoparticles.</p><p>Since light absorption triggers the photoacoustic response, contrast agents with a high molar extinction coefficient facilitate their distinction from endogenous chromophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lemaster and Jokerst, 2017</xref>). In this regard, GNRs are an attractive choice since the extinction coefficients are in the range of 4–5.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> for longitudinal surface plasmon between 728 and 845 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orendorff and Murphy, 2006</xref>), that is orders of magnitude higher than endogenous absorbers or other types of contrast agents (e.g. AlexaFluor750 and iRFP720 coefficients are 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 9.6 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shcherbakova and Verkhusha, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ntziachristos and Razansky, 2010</xref>]). We recently demonstrated how, after coating GNRs with a 35 nm silica shell, the optical properties of GNRs are maintained even in harsh environments such as the endosomal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Comenge et al., 2016</xref>). This enabled very sensitive photoacoustic imaging of labelled cells, pushing the limits of detection into a range useful for biologically-relevant applications including cell tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang and Jokerst, 2016</xref>). However, cell division and cell death result in a decrease of GNR concentration and therefore a decrease of photoacoustic intensity. Thus, for long-term photoacoustic tracking of cells, adequate reporter genes are required.</p><p>Here, we characterise newly generated lentivirus-based bi-cistronic reporter gene vectors and silica-coated GNRs as synergistic tools for co-labelling of cells and tracking in multiple imaging modalities at different stages after cell administration. The GNR-860 offered an excellent photoacoustic sensitivity that enabled detection of a very low number of cells. Reporter gene vectors mediated co-expression of the most sensitive bioluminescent reporter, firefly luciferase, and the most red-shifted near-infrared fluorescent protein, iRFP720, which also acted as a photoacoustic reporter in MSOT. Whilst GNR-860 enabled early detection of cells by photoacoustic tomography after systemic injection, reporter genes were needed to monitor any potential tumour growth with the same technique. In addition, co-expression of luciferase allowed bioluminescence imaging. Although this modality does not offer the spatial resolution of photoacoustic tomography, it was used here to continuously monitor cell viability as well as for validating the photoacoustic results. The combination of the two cell labelling strategies (nanoparticles and genetic labelling) allowed short-term and long-term multimodal imaging of deep tissues with high spatial resolution without compromising sensitivity. It enabled the non-invasive monitoring of the initial cell biodistribution on a sub-organ level as well as the detection of tumour formation from very early stages, thus opening opportunities for gaining a better understanding of the safety of stem cell therapies, which is required for moving towards clinical translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ankrum and Karp, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gold nanorod synthesis and cell labelling</title><p>Two types of GNRs with distinct optical spectra were prepared following previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nikoobakht and El-Sayed, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ye et al., 2012</xref>). The rationale for evaluating two types of gold nanorods in this study is as follows. First, detection of GNRs at different wavelengths would support the versatility of the approach, for example when combining them with other reporter molecules, that is it is not dependent upon preparing the exact same nanorods as reported here. Second, having two different probes provided us with a powerful control for false positive signals as explained in more detail below in the context of Figure 4. The first batch consisted of GNRs with a longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak at 710 nm (GNR-710). Their core size was 60.0 ± 7.5 nm by 25.7 ± 3.7 nm with an average aspect ratio of 2.3 ± 0.3. The second batch had a LSPR peak at 860 nm (GNR-860). In this case, their size was 93.8 ± 9.3 nm by 25.2 ± 4.4 nm with an average aspect ratio of 3.8 ± 0.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Both GNRs were prepared to have LSPR bands in the NIR to favour their detection deep inside tissues.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33140.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GNR characterization and cell labelling.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) pictures of GNR-710 (top) and GNR-860 (bottom).

Hence, both GNR batches were coated with a silica shell as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Comenge et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, GNR-710 and GNRs-860 nm have a silica shell thickness of 38.7 ± 1.9 nm and 35.7 ± 1.6 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p>A murine MSC line was selected for labelling and tracking, since these cells have the capability to differentiate into mesenchymal derivatives, but can also form tumours occasionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Comenge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuzma-Kuzniarska et al., 2012</xref>). The cells, which had first been transfected with a reporter gene vector (see below), were incubated with different concentrations of GNR-710 and GNR-860 for 24 hr. To provide a better comparison between GNRs of different sizes, we standardize and report the GNR concentrations by the optical density (O.D.) of the peak, because absorption is what triggers the photoacoustic response. For reference, O.D. = 4 corresponds to ~100 pM GNR-710 and ~72.5 pM GNR-860 (calculated by relating the absorbance at 400 nm of GNRs before silica coating to concentrations of molecular gold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pastoriza-Santos and Liz-Marzán, 2013</xref>).</p><p>To characterize their uptake, cells were incubated with GNRs at 0.D. = 3 for 24 hr.

In line with our previous report, the optical properties of GNRs were largely preserved after cell uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>).

These results are in agreement with our previous work, in which we showed that silica-coated GNRs did not affect cell viability, proliferation or differentiation potential of the mMSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Comenge et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Generation of iRFP720-Luciferase bi-cistronic lentivirus reporter gene vectors and characterisation of labelled cells</title><p>To combine the sensitivity of bioluminescence imaging with the spatial resolution of MSOT, we generated bi-cistronic lentivirus vectors for expression of firefly luciferase and iRFP720 from the general eukaryotic EF1α promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We compared vectors containing either an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hellen and Sarnow, 2001</xref>) or a self-cleaving 2A element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Szymczak and Vignali, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szymczak et al., 2004</xref>), to determine the most efficient method of translating the second open reading frame (ORF; encoding luciferase) from a single mRNA. Following transfection with lentivirus vectors, the mMSCs were selected by FACS for iRFP720 fluorescence, to obtain a pure IRES-vector and a pure E2A-vector transfected cell population, respectively, with similar levels of expression of the first ORF protein (iRFP720) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Co-expression of iRFP720 and luciferase in individual cells was confirmed by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), which also indicated that, in contrast to luciferase, iRFP720 was preferentially localised in the nucleus. To compare the levels of expression of luciferase from the IRES-vector and E2A-vector transfected cells, fluorescent and bioluminescent signals were quantified in cell suspensions using an IVIS Spectrum imager. For both types of reporter cells (IRES-vector and E2A-vector transfected), the fluorescence signal intensity for iRFP720 was the same, but the E2A-vector-transfected cells showed a five times higher luciferase bioluminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e</xref>). These data indicate that in the context of our bi-cistronic lentivirus vectors, a superior translation efficiency of the second ORF from a single mRNA was achieved via an E2A element as compared to an IRES element. We therefore used the pHIV-iRFP720-E2A-Luc vector in all further experiments described herein.

Similar proof of principle of the utility of nanoparticles as contrast agents for photoacoustic cell detection has often been obtained by imaging labelled cells implanted locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jokerst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nam et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we address the much more challenging case of a systemic injection where cells spread through the body and the signal, therefore, becomes diluted. Specifically, 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> mMSCs transduced with the iRFP720-E2A-Luc lentivirus and labelled with GNRs were administered via ultrasound-guided intracardiac injection into the left ventricle. Left ventricle administration was chosen for cells to enter the arterial circulation rather than the venous. This allows cells to pass through all organs before returning to the right ventricle and subsequently lungs, where they become sequestered in the pulmonary microvasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kean et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fischer et al., 2009</xref>). To provide a detailed assessment of cell localisation, we combined photoacoustic tomography imaging at 1 mm steps with bioluminescence detection. While bioluminescence imaging provides excellent sensitivity, its anatomical resolution is poor, mainly due to the high scattering of photons by tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patterson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ntziachristos et al., 2005</xref>). By contrast, photoacoustic imaging provides superior spatial resolution (150 µm in our system) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ntziachristos and Razansky, 2010</xref>). To demonstrate the potential of this multimodal approach to precisely determine the localisation of distributed nanorod-labelled cells, we show the correlation between bioluminescence imaging and MSOT imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Cell localisation in the head, liver and kidney regions was clearly observed with both imaging modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>), and the cell presence within organs was confirmed in the photoacoustic scans through the respective regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). This distribution is in agreement with other, different types of assessments in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basse et al., 1988</xref>). The presence of cells in the brain region is probably due to cell trapping in small capillaries, as reported also in other studies after intracardiac injection of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heyn et al., 2006</xref>). As shown in our parallel work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scarfe et al., 2017</xref>), the mMSCs remain in the lumen of the brain capillaries and do not cross the blood-brain barrier. It should be noted here that there was no difference in the bioluminescence signal biodistribution when cells with or without gold nanorods were injected, indicating that GNR uptake does not affect the overall behaviour of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33140.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Initial biodistribution of GNR-860-labelled cells after intracardiac administration.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Bioluminescence imaging in dorsal (top panel) and ventral (bottom panel) position after cell administration.

First, following the same imaging protocols, we observed a similar biodistribution pattern for mice injected with either GNR-710 or GNR-860-labelled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Second, when we applied the unmixing algorithm with the ‘wrong’ spectrum (i.e. the GNR-710 spectrum to an animal injected with GNR-860-labelled cells, and vice versa), no GNR-specific signals were detected in photoacoustic images pre- and post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Third, when the photoacoustic spectra of regions of interest before and after injection of cells were extracted, an increase in the photoacoustic intensity was only observed in the range of wavelengths in which corresponding GNRs have the higher absorbance, while intensity in the other wavelengths remained similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). It has to be noted that in some cases there were regions with an endogenous absorbance similar to GNRs (e.g. food in the intestines has similar spectra as GNR-710), which can lead to misinterpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). For this reason, a scan was performed before cells were injected, which allowed detection of any potential endogenous interference with the GNR signal. Using a multimodal imaging approach (in this case luminescence and photoacoustic) also assisted in discounting any false positive signals. As expected, the photoacoustic signal provided by iRFP720 expression was not strong enough to detect the cells immediately after injection by means of photoacoustic imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33140.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Specificity of the multispectral unmixing.</title><p>Signal before and after treatment with GNR-710-labelled cells (upper panel) and GNR-860-labelled cells (bottom panel) in transverse sections at the level of the kidney region of the corresponding mouse.

A similar degree of cell death was observed with cells not labelled with GNRs, indicating that cell loss in vivo was not caused by GNR labelling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Interestingly, after 24 hr, the bioluminescence signal and the photoacoustic signal for GNRs were no longer localised in the same regions/organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref>), indicating that the vast majority of GNRs followed a different fate than the remaining luciferase-expressing cells. Specifically, although the luminescence intensity had decreased substantially by 24 hr, the distribution of the signal remained the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). By contrast, the MSOT signal for GNR-860 increased dramatically in the liver over the same timescale, but was substantially reduced in regions such as the kidneys and head where it had been predominant immediately after cell injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,c</xref>). Whilst luminescent signal is based on living cells, photoacoustic signal can be produced from GNRs independently, irrespective of whether they are within cells, or if the cells are viable. Thus, these data suggest that the liver plays an important role in the clearance of GNRs and potentially associated cell debris following the massive loss of cells during the first 24 hr after injection, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eggenhofer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khabbal et al., 2015</xref>).

However, we now observed BLI signals from cells that had settled in different locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The signal intensity increased over the following weeks as cells grew into tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since the mMSC cell line had been reported to form osteoid structures in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuzma-Kuzniarska et al., 2012</xref>), and recent results from our group have revealed the capacity of the cells to form osteosarcomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scarfe et al., 2017</xref>), we anticipated the possibility of tumour development. In other studies, this process has been typically monitored by bioluminescence imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jenkins et al., 2005</xref>), which allows the intensity of the signal to be correlated with the number of living cells. However, bioluminescence is limited by the poor spatial resolution at depths beyond 1 mm due to photon scattering. We therefore evaluated the potential of MSOT to determine the precise localisation of internal tumours as well as their size and shape. We used the constitutive expression of iRFP720 for the long-term monitoring of tumour growth by means of photoacoustic imaging.

Only some tumours growing in very peripheral positions of the animal could not be monitored due to technical or procedural limitations of the MSOT imaging system. For example, the nose could not be imaged as it was placed in the nose cone for air and anaesthesia supply during the imaging process. Also, since the animal was placed on its back, it was very difficult to avoid an air layer being trapped between the legs and the main body, which impaired sound propagation. Abundant use of ultrasound gel in this region minimised this effect and allowed data to be obtained as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (tumour 6), although the quality of the image was not as good as in other regions of the body. Any tumours in the lungs could not have been monitored with photoacoustic imaging due to a different sound propagation in air. However, the presence of tumours in the lungs could be ruled out from the bioluminescence images.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrate here a multimodal imaging approach, which utilises a combination of GNRs and reporter genes to track cells immediately after systemic injection and longitudinally over time during the development of tumours. We show that multispectral optoacoustic tomography achieves high spatial resolution of the initial cell distribution through analysis of the GNR signal. Whilst expression of iRFP720 is initially undetectable, due to the scattered distribution of cells, it provides long-term tumour monitoring capability in MSOT as clustered iRFP720-positive cells lead to a stronger photoacoustic signal. Additionally, bioluminescence imaging of luciferase allowed for the most sensitive detection of live cells for comparison and validation of the MSOT results.</p><p>The silica-coated GNRs provided the excellent photoacoustic sensitivity required to monitor the broad distribution of labelled cells shortly after systemic intra-cardiac injection. Because the GNRs maintained their optical signature when taken up by the cells, spectral unmixing could be applied in MSOT, which allowed GNR signals to be distinguished from other reporters (e.g. iRFP720) and endogenous absorbers, resulting in highly specific cell detection. Over the medium term, that is several days post-injection, photoacoustic GNR signals and luciferase bioluminescence signals became separated, indicating nanoparticle clearance and surviving cells, respectively. The GNR signal became localised to the liver, which is in line with the known clearance pathway of nanoparticles and associated cell debris through the hepato-biliary system.</p><p>Using the genetic reporters, longitudinal monitoring of surviving cells and tumour formation was achieved via luciferase bioluminescence and iRFP720 photoacoustic tomography. Compared to other optical-based imaging technologies, the superior deep-tissue spatial resolution of MSOT provided precise information about anatomical localisation and morphology of tumours from very early stages (&lt;1 mm diameter).</p><p>Beyond the specific study of the biodistribution and tumour development of an exemplary mesenchymal cell line performed here, we emphasise the technological potential of these labelling tools for non-invasive <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging and cell tracking. In particular, research fields such as cell-based regenerative medicine therapies and cancer biology might find new applications using these labelling reagents and imaging approaches for cell monitoring and safety studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th colspan="2">Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SCID hairless outbred <break/>(SHO) mice</td><td colspan="2">mice</td><td>Charles River <break/>Laboratories</td><td><italic>ID_Crl:SHO-Prkdc<sup>scid</sup>Hr<sup>hr</sup></italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Mouse mesenchymal <break/>stem cell line</td><td colspan="2">mMSC</td><td>ATCC</td><td><italic>ID_ATCC:CRL-12424</italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Lentivirus vector</td><td colspan="2">pHIV-iRFP720-E2A-Luc</td><td>this paper</td><td><italic>ID_GenBank:MF693179;</italic> <break/> <italic>ID_Addgene:104587</italic></td><td>lentivirus vector for bi-cistronic <break/>expression of iRFP720 and firefly <break/>luciferase</td></tr><tr><td>Gold nanorods</td><td colspan="2">GNR</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>gold nanorods were produced at the <break/>Department of Chemistry, University <break/>of Liverpool</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>The following chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, UK).

After acclimatisation for 10 min inside the water bath, a whole-body scan was performed on the mouse with 1 mm steps and the following wavelengths for acquisition: 660, 670, 680, 690, 700, 705, 710, 715, 720, 725, 735, 750, 765, 780, 795, 810, 820, 830, 840, 850, 860, 870, 880, 890, 900, 910, 920, 930, 940, 1025, 1050, 1075, and 1100 nm. Heavy water was used in the water bath due to its low absorbance at wavelengths &gt; 910 nm (contrary to regular water). Linear-mode-based reconstruction and guided ICA multispectral processing were applied using viewMSOT software v3.6 (iThera Medical GmbH).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Joseph Zeguer and Danielle Vaughan for contributions to the lentivirus vector work, the Biomedical Services Unit, the Biomedical Electron Microscopy Unit and the Centre for Preclinical Imaging at The University of Liverpool for technical support.

decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Multimodal cell tracking from systemic administration to tumour growth by combining gold nanorods and reporter genes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jesse Jokerst (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript submitted to <italic>eLife</italic>, Comenge et al. describe a new way of combining genetic reporters and optoacoustic tomography to track grafted tumour-forming cells in mice. Their experimental system uses a viral vector which expresses both luciferase and a near infrared fluorescence protein, and they co-label these cells with gold nanorods (GNR). The GNRs allow the detection of small numbers of cells soon after grafting, whereas the fluorescent reporter signal becomes stronger with increasing cells numbers and enables Comenge et al. to track grafted cells by MSOT with a resolution superior to bioluminescence. The authors demonstrate the feasibility of their technology in mice injected with a mesenchymal stem cell line, which develops detectable tumours 2-3 weeks post-injection.</p><p>The study is of high technical quality, and the technical tools and methods reported here could be very useful for several research areas that use in vivo imaging, such as experimental cell therapy. The dual reporter strategy expands the time window for graft detection, and combines sensitivity of GNRs with the persistence of a genetic reporter. The findings are novel and validated by the well-established bioluminescence imaging technology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors are encouraged to do a subcutaneous injection. This would decouple imaging issues from delivery issues. In addition, from Figure 3A it looks as though most of the injected cells go to the brain. This is confusing – the authors should explain why the cells did not go to the liver or lung and whether they cross the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) Figure 2A: The genetic map of the reporter constructs lacks a scale bar and does not seem to be drawn to scale. ORFs should be represented such that they are distinguishable from promoters and other genetic elements.</p><p>2) Figure 2C: The authors should add a DNA staining such as DAPI, otherwise it is hard to judge cytoplasmic vs. nuclear localization of iRFP720 and luciferase.</p><p>3) &quot;Hence, both GNR batches were coated with a silica shell as previously described.&quot; Please add reference.</p><p>4) The rationale for two types of GNRs is not clear and should be explained.</p><p>5) What was the efficiency of transfection with the iRFP construct?</p><p>6) &quot;Interestingly, from this stage onwards the bioluminescence images no longer correlated with the photoacoustic imaging (Figure 5A-C).&quot; What do you mean by this point?

This would decouple imaging issues from delivery issues.</p></disp-quote><p>Subcutaneous injections are indeed a good way to validate contrast agents. As far as gold nanorods are concerned, this was done extensively in our previously published article (Comenge et al., 2016). In the case of the genetic reporter, subcutaneous experiments are included (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). To make it clearer to the reader that such experiments have indeed been conducted for both types of labelling strategies, we have inserted the following sentence at the beginning of the section “Imaging biodistribution of cells after intracardiac injection” in Results and Discussion:</p><p>“Detection of labelled cells after subcutaneous injection has provided indications that gold nanorods (our previous work<sup>7</sup>) and genetic reporters (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) could enable cell tracking.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, from Figure 3A it looks as though most of the injected cells go to the brain. This is confusing – the authors should explain why the cells did not go to the liver or lung and whether they cross the blood-brain barrier.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is correct in his/her observation that shortly after intracardiac injection many cells get trapped in the small capillaries of the brain, but also in those of the liver and kidneys as we show in Figure 3A, B and C. In this respect, the initial distribution of cells after injection into the left cardiac ventricle differs from intravenous injection, which, following passage through the right cardiac ventricle, leads to distribution of cells to the lung first, where a majority of cells then become trapped instead. With regard to the question of blood-brain barrier penetration, we show in a different manuscript that i.c. injected mouse MSCs remain inside the lumen of the brain capillaries (please see Figures 2A and D in Scarfe et al., 2017 – this paper has also been uploaded to <italic>eLife</italic> as a ‘Related Manuscript File’). To clarify this aspect, we have now added the following sentence to the revised manuscript:</p><p>“As shown in our parallel work (Scarfe et al., 2017, the mMSCs remain in the lumen of the brain capillaries and do not cross the blood-brain barrier.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) Figure 2A: The genetic map of the reporter constructs lacks a scale bar and does not seem to be drawn to scale. ORFs should be represented such that they are distinguishable from promoters and other genetic elements.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not drawn the scheme of the reporter constructs to scale, since some of the elements would then be too small and unrecognisable. However, we have modified the Figure 2A scheme to indicate the reporter gene transcript and the ORFs more clearly. The full sequence of the E2A plasmid version and the positions of all the indicated genetic elements are provided in the Genbank sequence file with accession number MF693179, which is mentioned in the Materials and methods (subsection “Lentivirus vectors”) and Key Resources Table. This plasmid is also available at the Addgene repository (#104587).</p><p>We have also modified the legend to Figure 2A, which now reads as follows:</p><p>“a) Scheme of the vectors that mediate co-expression of iRFP720 and firefly luciferase either via IRES- or E2A-mediated mechanisms (not drawn to scale). Arrows above and below the scheme indicate the reporter gene transcript and open reading frames, respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2C: The authors should add a DNA staining such as DAPI, otherwise it is hard to judge cytoplasmic vs. nuclear localization of iRFP720 and luciferase.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now repeated the mMSC cellular imaging experiment and included DAPI nuclear staining. The images in Figure 2C have been replaced with a new set of 4 confocal image panels showing DAPI, Luciferase and iRFP720 in greyscale, as well as a merged overlay in colour. Although there is some variability between cells, nuclear accumulation of iRFP720 is clearly recognisable in a number of cells. We have slightly modified the legend for Figure 2C as follows:</p><p>“In contrast to Luc, iRFP720 tends to accumulate in the nucleus (yellow triangles).”</p><p>Overall, in the context of the in vivo cell tracking studies of this manuscript we would like to note that the subcellular localisation of iRFP720 is less relevant, since it should not affect its optoacoustic detection in animals via MSOT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;Hence, both GNR batches were coated with a silica shell as previously described.&quot; Please add reference.</p></disp-quote><p>The following sentence with references has been added to the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“Silica coating was performed as described in our previous work (Comenge et al., 2016), which was based on slight modifications of a protocol by Fernández-López et al. (Fernández-López et al., 2009).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The rationale for two types of GNRs is not clear and should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following sentence in the first section of the Results and Discussion:</p><p>“The rationale for evaluating two types of gold nanorods in this study is as follows. […] Second, having two different probes provided us with a powerful control for false positive signals as explained in more detail below in the context of Figure 4. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) What was the efficiency of transfection with the iRFP construct?</p></disp-quote><p>The transfection efficiency of the cells with the virus particles can vary, depending on the virus purification protocol and their concentration/titre. As mentioned in the Materials and methods (mMSC culture, labelling and immunofluorescence), we selected the iRFP720-positive cells by FACS sorting and expanded these purified populations. We then re-analysed these populations by FACS to compare the iRFP720 signal intensity between the IRES and E2A vector-transfected populations, which is shown in Figure 2B.</p><p>To explain this better, we have slightly modified the text in Results as follows:</p><p>“Following transfection with lentivirus vectors, the mMSCs were sorted by FACS for iRFP720 fluorescence, to obtain a pure IRES-vector and a pure E2A-vector transfected cell population, respectively, with similar levels of expression of the first ORF protein (iRFP720) (Figure 2B).”</p><p>We have also modified the legend of Figure 2 as follows:</p><p>“b) FACS analyses of iRFP720 fluorescent signal intensity in purified mMSC populations, which had been transfected with either the IRES or E2A vector, respectively, indicated similar levels of expression of the first ORF.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) &quot;Interestingly, from this stage onwards the bioluminescence images no longer correlated with the photoacoustic imaging (Figure 5A-C).&quot; What do you mean by this point? Time point? If so, please be more explicit.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid misunderstandings we have re-worded the sentence as follows:</p><p>“Interestingly, after 24 hours, the bioluminescence signal and the photoacoustic signal for GNRs were no longer localised in the same regions/organs (Figure 5A-C), indicating that the vast majority of GNRs followed a different fate than the remaining luciferase-expressing cells.”</p><p>Additionally, we modified the legend of Figure 5C as follows:</p><p>“(c) In contrast to the kidneys, MSOT signal in liver increased substantially at day 1, although bioluminescence had declined in this tissue at this stage as shown in (b), which suggests that GNRs accumulated in the liver.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) How do detection limits compare between the two techniques? Which is more sensitive? GNRs or iRFP or bioluminescence?</p></disp-quote><p>We suggest that quantitative determination and comparison of detection limits would be only feasible in highly simplified systems of limited relevance (e.g. phantoms), because factors such as distance to the sensors, differences of ultrasound coupling between different regions of the body, etc. would interfere in the actual measure. However, it is clear from our work and from the literature that the most sensitive technique is bioluminescence, whilst photoacoustic imaging provides much higher resolution. Regarding photoacoustic imaging between GNRs and iRFP, we can also conclude that GNRs generates a much higher contrast, with the disadvantage of potential false positive once cells die. We have slightly edited the conclusion section to make the above points clearer. It now reads:</p><p>“We show that multispectral optoacoustic tomography achieves high spatial resolution of the initial cell distribution through analysis of the GNR signal. Whilst expression of iRFP720 is initially undetectable, due to the scattered distribution of cells, it provides long-term tumour monitoring capability in MSOT as clustered iRFP720-positive cells lead to a stronger photoacoustic signal.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Why does the GNR signal drop? Is it because the cells die and release their cargo and macrophages take it to the liver? Or are viable cells taken to the liver.</p></disp-quote><p>Our hypothesis is that cells die during the first hours after injection (decrease in total bioluminescence, Figure 5), simultaneously GNR signal moved towards the liver and spleen, which suggest either dead cells, cell debris or cell content are transported there. Since these are phagocytic organs, it is very likely that macrophages are somehow involved, but we lack any definitive proof. So for now, we regard the clarification of this specific aspect as beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Is there dilution of GNR contrast agent over time as the cells divide?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. As explained in our previous work (Comenge et al., 2016), this is a relevant limitation of all nanoparticle-based contrast agents. However, we do not observe this phenomenon here due to the massive amount of cell death within the first 24 hours after systemic injection. Reporter genes overcome this potential limitation of nanoparticle-labelling for long term tracking of dividing cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Some additional citations to photoacoustic imaging are appropriate here:a) http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wnan.1404/fullb) http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/sci/2016/9240652.pdf</p></disp-quote><p>We were aware of those references, which provide valuable information. We have now added them in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction section (Lemaster and Jokerst, 2017 and Wang et al., 2016).</p></body></sub-article></article>
