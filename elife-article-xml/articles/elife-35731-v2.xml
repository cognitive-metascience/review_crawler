Here, we show that Trigger Factor (TF), an ATP-independent chaperone, exerts strikingly contrasting effects on the folding of non-native proteins as it transitions between a monomeric and a dimeric state. We used NMR spectroscopy to determine the atomic resolution structure of the 100 kDa dimeric TF. The structural data show that some of the substrate-binding sites are buried in the dimeric interface, explaining the lower affinity for protein substrates of the dimeric compared to the monomeric TF. Surprisingly, the dimeric TF associates faster with proteins and it exhibits stronger anti-aggregation and holdase activity than the monomeric TF. The structural data show that the dimer assembles in a way that substrate-binding sites in the two subunits form a large contiguous surface inside a cavity, thus accounting for the observed accelerated association with unfolded proteins. Our results demonstrate how the activity of a chaperone can be modulated to provide distinct functional outcomes in the cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular chaperones</kwd><kwd>protein folding</kwd><kwd>NMR Spectroscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI (17H05657)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saio</surname><given-names>Tomohide</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRESTO</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saio</surname><given-names>Tomohide</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM122461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kalodimos</surname><given-names>Charalampos G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combined NMR and kinetic study demonstrates how the dynamic transition of a molecular chaperone between different oligomerization states can modulate its activity by altering the binding kinetics and energetics of non-native proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Molecular chaperones typically prevent the aggregation and assist with the folding of non-native proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balchin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bukau et al., 2006</xref>).

Despite common features, the mechanisms of activity are distinct in different families of chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mattoo and Goloubinoff, 2014</xref>). Studies of ATP-dependent chaperones, such as the Hsp70 and GroEL systems, have shown how cycles of ATP binding, hydrolysis and nucleotide release can give rise to different conformational states that exhibit distinct affinities for the substrate protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apetri and Horwich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clare et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayer-Hartl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayer and Bukau, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saibil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sekhar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>).

TF is also being widely used as a co-expression factor to improve the folding and yield of soluble proteins in biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uthailak et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We recently determined the atomic resolution structure of TF in complex with a non-native protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saio et al., 2014</xref>). The structure revealed how the chaperone recognizes and engages the non-native protein and how it retains it in an unfolded state. Interestingly, our data showed that substrate protein binding causes TF to monomerize, thus indicating that the substrate-binding sites are occluded in dimeric TF. The interplay between substrate protein binding and chaperone oligomerization is likely to be used as a mechanism to modulate the energetics and kinetics of interaction in chaperone-substrate protein complexes, as for example in small heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eyles and Gierasch, 2010</xref>). The large size of the dimeric TF (100 kDa) and its apparent dynamic nature has hindered determination of its structure.</p><p>We have taken advantage of recent advances in NMR spectroscopy and isotope labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang and Kalodimos, 2017</xref>) to determine the atomic structure of dimeric TF. The structure shows that three out of the five substrate-binding sites are partially buried in the dimer, thus explaining why protein binding results in TF monomerization. Interestingly, the dimer assembles in such a way that substrate-binding sites in the two subunits form a large contiguous surface inside a cavity. The structural data explain the unexpected finding that non-native proteins appear to bind with higher association rate to the dimeric TF than to the monomeric TF. Activity assays showed that TF dimerization enables the chaperone to exhibit stronger holdase and anti-aggregation activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of TF dimerization</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> TF consists of 432 amino acids, comprising RBD (residues 1 to 112), PPD (residues 150 to 246), and SBD (residues 113 to 149 and 247 to 432) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

TF forms a symmetric dimer in a head-to-tail orientation. Part of RBD inserts into a large cavity that is formed between the SBD and PPD of the other subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) and the arrangement results in three major interfaces that hold the dimer together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The three helices in RBD (α1-α3) form extensive contacts with PPD and the SBD arm 1 and arm 2 regions. Specifically, a hydrophobic patch in SBD arm 1 consisting of bulky hydrophobic residues (Leu314, Phe322, Leu332, Leu336, and Phe337) forms intimate nonpolar contacts with the C-terminal region of RBD helix α1 (Val35, Ala36, Val39, and Ile41) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This binding interface is further strengthened by a salt bridge between Arg40 and Glu339 and a hydrogen bond between Lys38 and Gln340. SBD arm 1 also interacts with the N-terminal part of RBD helix α3 exclusively via polar contacts (e.g. between Asp65 and Arg321) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). 2,540 Å<sup>2</sup> (1,620 Å<sup>2</sup> nonpolar and 920 Å<sup>2</sup> polar) of surface are buried in this interface of the dimer. A large hydrophobic patch in PPD consisting of aromatic and bulky nonpolar residues (Phe168, Phe185, Met194, Ile195, Tyr221) engages the long loop in RBD connecting helices α1 and α3, which also features a short helix (α2). Residues Phe44, Val49, Ile53, and Tyr58 in RBD appear to establish the most important contacts with PPD, including two salt bridges (between Arg57 and Asp184 and between Lys48 and Glu199) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). 2,650 Å<sup>2</sup> (1,900 Å<sup>2</sup> nonpolar and 750 Å<sup>2</sup> polar) of surface are buried in this interface. The third major dimeric interface is mediated by SBD arm 2 and the C-terminal region of RBD helix α3. Similar to the other two, this interface is made up primarily of nonpolar residues (RBD residues Ile76, Ile79, Ile80 and Ile84; SBD residues Val384, Tyr388, Phe387, and Leu394) with additional salt bridges at the periphery of the binding site. 1,480 Å<sup>2</sup> (1,050 Å<sup>2</sup> nonpolar and 430 Å<sup>2</sup> polar) are buried at this dimeric interface, which is the smallest among the three ones. A total surface of 6,670 Å<sup>2</sup> is buried upon dimer formation. The extensive interface seen in the structure to mediate the dimer was tested by mutagenesis and a triple amino-acid substitution variant (V39E/I76E/I80A; hereafter TF<sup>mon</sup>) was identified that abolishes TF dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The structural data suggest that TF dimerization has profound impact on the function of TF because the ribosome-binding region as well as several of the substrate-binding sites are buried in the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The RBD loop, which contains the signature motif (G<sup>43</sup>FRxGxxP<sup>50</sup>) mediating the interaction of TF with the ribosome, is sequestered by the PPD of the other subunit in the TF dimer and thus is not available for binding to the ribosome. This finding explains why TF must monomerize upon binding to the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferbitz et al., 2004</xref>). The intrinsic affinity of TF for the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaiser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maier et al., 2003</xref>) (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> ~0.5 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) is comparable to the dimerization <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> (~2 μM); therefore, there is a strong competition between TF dimerization and ribosome binding. Because the affinity of TF for ribosome-nascent-chain (RNC) complexes is substantially stronger (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &lt;0.01 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bornemann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rutkowska et al., 2008</xref>) than for vacant ribosomes, translating ribosomes will be invariably bound, and thus protected by TF.</p><p>TF uses five distinct binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) to interact with unfolded substrates such as the maltose binding protein (MBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saio et al., 2014</xref>). Four of these substrate-binding sites are located in SBD (A-D) and the fifth one (E) is located in PPD. In the dimeric form of TF only two (A and D) among these five substrate-binding sites are fully accessible for binding, whereas the other three (B, C, and E) are partially occluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A protein substrate typically engages at least four of the binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saio et al., 2014</xref>); thus, complex formation between TF and an unfolded protein requires that TF monomerize, as supported by NMR and MALS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,E and F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saio et al., 2014</xref>). Previous crystallographic data indicated that TF may also bind to small folded proteins as a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martinez-Hackert and Hendrickson, 2007</xref>). However, NMR characterization of such complexes in solution showed that the substrates are in an unfolded state and TF is in the monomeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Dimerization modulates the chaperone activities of TF. The concentration of TF in the cell (~50 μM) is 2 to 3-fold that of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patzelt et al., 2002</xref>), and given the low <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of dimerization (~2 μM) the vast majority of free TF in the cytoplasm will exist in the dimeric form. The dissociation rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>diss</sub>) of the dimer is ~ 10 s<sup>−1</sup> indicating a rather dynamic TF dimer with a residence time of ~ 100 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). We sought to investigate whether the chaperone activity of TF is affected as it transitions between the monomeric and dimeric forms. To characterize the chaperone activity of the monomeric form of TF, we used the TF<sup>mon</sup> variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The amino acid substitutions that abolish dimerization in this variant are located in RBD and thus do not affect protein substrate binding. First, we performed aggregation assay using the 35 kDa protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the absence and presence of TF or TF<sup>mon</sup>. Denatured GAPDH was diluted into buffer and its aggregation was monitored by light scattering. The results showed that dimeric TF was substantially more efficient at suppressing aggregation than the monomeric TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The results showed that in the case of shorter substrate, which has a smaller number of hydrophobic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), the difference in the anti-aggregation activity between the dimeric TF and monomeric TF is much less pronounced and both species are equally efficient in suppressing aggregation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35731.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Effect of TF dimerization on chaperone activities.</title><p>Aggregation of GAPDH in the absence or presence of TF and TF<sup>mon</sup> at 0.5 μM (<bold>A</bold>) and OmpA in the absence or presence of TF and TF<sup>mon</sup> at 4 μM (<bold>B</bold>).

At 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with MBP, TF<sup>mon</sup> had a minimal effect on MBP folding whereas dimeric TF had a pronounced effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Specifically, dimeric TF increased the apparent folding rate of MBP and at the same time increased the yield of the soluble fraction substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). The increase in the apparent folding rate is likely due to the most efficient suppression of aggregation by the dimeric TF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apetri and Horwich, 2008</xref>). Notably, a much higher TF<sup>mon</sup> concentration was needed to match the chaperone activity of the dimeric TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). We also tested the effect of TF on an aggregation-prone, slowly folding mutant of MBP (MBP<sup>Y283D</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saio et al., 2014</xref>). The dimeric TF was observed to have a strong ‘holdase’ effect on the mutant MBP as evidenced by the suppression of the folding of MBP<sup>Y283D</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, TF<sup>mon</sup> slightly accelerated folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Because refolding of MBP<sup>Y283D</sup> was performed in a chloride-free buffer in which MBP does not aggregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apetri and Horwich, 2008</xref>), any contribution of an anti-aggregation effect can be excluded. Taken together, all assays showed that the monomeric and dimeric TF states have distinct chaperone activities.</p><p>TF dimerization accelerates its association rate with substrates. To understand how the oligomeric state of TF affects chaperone activity, we sought to determine how the monomeric and dimeric TF species interact with protein substrates. ITC showed that TF<sup>mon</sup> has a 5-fold higher affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> ~ 6 μM) for protein substrates than the dimeric TF (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> ~ 35 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is expected given that a sizable fraction of the substrate-binding surface is buried in the dimeric TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Next, we measured the kinetics of substrate binding to TF using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. Notably, the rates of protein substrate association and dissociation are very different for the dimeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>) and monomeric TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Specifically, unfolded PhoA binds TF<sup>mon</sup> with a <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> ~ 0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and dissociates with a <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> ~ 6 s<sup>−1</sup>. In comparison, dimeric TF binds PhoA with a 2-fold faster association rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> ~ 1.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and dissociates with a 5-fold faster dissociation rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> ~ 30 s<sup>−1</sup>). The faster association of non-native proteins with the dimeric TF over the monomeric TF is consistent with the stronger holdase activity of dimeric TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Note that the holdase activity of a chaperone is determined by the difference between the folding rate of the substrate protein and the association rate between the chaperone and the unfolded substrate protein, as shown by kinetic experiments on SecB and TF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Thus the association rate of dimeric TF for the substrate appears to be fast enough to delay the folding of the slowly folding mutant MBP<sup>Y283D</sup>, but not fast enough to delay the folding of wild type MBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>). Although three out of the five substrate-binding sites are partially occluded in the dimeric TF, assembly of the dimer brings next to each other substrate-binding sites A, B, and D in the two subunits.

The structural, energetic and kinetic data presented here explain previous observations and offer new insights into the various roles of TF in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). When bound to the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, panel i), TF is in the monomeric form and exposes all substrate-binding sites to the nascent protein. The co-localization with the nascent chain results in TF delaying folding and preventing aggregation as shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agashe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoffmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saio et al., 2014</xref>). As the nascent chain grows, additional TF molecules are recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, panel ii) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaiser et al., 2006</xref>). Because of the high concentration of free TF in the cytoplasm, it is likely that a TF molecule outcompetes and displaces the fraction of the nascent chain that is bound to the TF to form a TF dimer. In this case, folding of a domain may occur co-translationally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, panel iii). Most cytosolic proteins released from the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, panel iv) spontaneously form their native structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balchin et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, panel v). However, in the absence of molecular chaperones, many proteins have a tendency to aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, panel vi). TF has an anti-aggregation activity, with the dimeric form being more potent than the monomeric form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). We posit that this is because of the higher local concentration of TF subunits in the dimeric form, which can both bind upon dimer dissociation with the interacting non-native polypeptide to protect longer segments of the polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, panel vii). The increased local concentration of TF subunits results in faster association of the second molecule of TF to the substrate protein, which enables TF to more efficiently capture the substrate protein before the it starts to aggregate. This hypothesis is consistent with the following findings: (i) higher concentrations of monomeric TF are needed to achieve the same anti-aggregation activity as the dimeric TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>); and (ii) aggregation of shorter substrates, which are expected to bind to a single TF molecule, are equally prevented by the monomeric and dimeric TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Depending on the energetics and kinetics of interaction between TF and the non-native polypeptide in the cytoplasm, dimeric TF can also function as a potent holdase chaperone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) to delay the folding of proteins destined for export, such as periplasmic and outer membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oh et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings demonstrate how the activity of a chaperone can be modulated and tailored to specialized needs in the cell simply by a change in the oligomeric state of the chaperone, without the need of ATP binding and hydrolysis cycles or the binding of co-factors.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35731.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Chaperone activities of TF in the cell.</title><p>The ribosome is shown in light blue.

The samples, dialyzed overnight against the reference buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl) were loaded into a cell assembly comprised of a double sector charcoal-filled centerpiece with a 12 mm path length and sapphire windows. Buffer density and viscosity were determined in a DMA 5000 M density meter and an AMVn automated micro-viscometer (both Anton Paar, Graz, Austria), respectively. The partial specific volumes and the molecular masses of the proteins were calculated based on their amino acid compositions in SEDFIT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sedfitsedphat.nibib.nih.gov/software/default.aspx">https://sedfitsedphat.nibib.nih.gov/software/default.aspx</ext-link>). The cell assembly, containing identical sample and reference buffer volumes of 360 µL, was placed in a rotor and temperature equilibrated at rest at 20°C for 2 hr before it was accelerated from 0 to 50,000 rpm. Absorbance scans at 230 and 280 nm were collected continuously for 12 hr. The velocity data were modeled with diffusion-deconvoluted sedimentation coefficient distributions c(s) in SEDFIT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sedfitsedphat.nibib.nih.gov/software/default.aspx">https://sedfitsedphat.nibib.nih.gov/software/default.aspx</ext-link>), using algebraic noise decomposition and with signal-average frictional ratio and meniscus position refined with non-linear regression. The s-values were corrected for time and finite acceleration of the rotor was accounted for in the evaluation of Lamm equation solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benfield et al., 2011</xref>). Maximum entropy regularization was applied at a confidence level of P-0.68.</p><p>Sedimentation velocity isotherm data that is the signal-weighted average sedimentation coefficients, sw(c), of the total sedimenting system derived from integration of the complete c(s) distributions at various concentrations (40.18, 12.13, 3.83 and 0.596 µM) of TF were fitted to a monomer-dimer self-association model using SEDPHAT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sedfitsedphat.nibib.nih.gov/software/default.aspx">https://sedfitsedphat.nibib.nih.gov/software/default.aspx</ext-link>). For interacting systems, sw represents the average sedimentation property of the species under investigation. The association scheme used in this analysis was A + A ↔ A2 with equilibrium dissociation constant <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>. All plots were generated with the program GUSSI (kindly provided by Dr. Chad Brautigam).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Stopped-flow experiments</title><p>Kinetic measurements were performed on FP-8300 Fluorescence Stopped Flow System (JASCO Corporation). The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 280 nm (band width 10 nm) and 350 nm (band width 20 nm), respectively, so that the intrinsic tryptophan-fluorescence of PhoA<sup>220-310</sup> containing two Trp residues or that of TF containing one tryptophan residue can be monitored. All measurements were carried out in the buffer containing 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mM KCl, 4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.05% NaN<sub>3</sub>. Individual kinetics were typically measured 40 times and averaged. The data were analyzed with Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). To account for photobleaching, an exponential baseline was defined using the data after 1000 ms of the mixing, by which the dissociation or association has completed and reached to the equilibrium. Dissociation of TF dimer was initiated by 10-fold dilution of TF at 1 µM. The temperature was set to 22°C. The protein solution was placed in 2.5 mL syringe and the buffer was placed in 10 mL syringe. The dissociation kinetics was analyzed using a single exponential function. Binding between TF and PhoA<sup>220-310</sup> was monitored after rapid mixing by the stopped-flow instrument. Association of PhoA<sup>220-310</sup> and TF or TF<sup>mon</sup> was initiated by mixing equal volumes of 4 µM PhoA220-310 and 0–80 µM TF or TF<sup>mon</sup> resulting in final concentrations of 2 µM PhoA<sup>220-310</sup> and 0–40 µM TF or TF<sup>mon</sup>. A single tryptophan residue in TF (W151) was mutated to phenylalanine in order to selectively monitor the change in the fluorescence from PhoA<sup>220-310</sup> containing two residues both located in the binding sites for TF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saio et al., 2014</xref>). Both samples were placed in the 10 mL syringe. The temperature was set to 18°C. The fluorescence intensity of PhoA<sup>220-310</sup> increased upon binding to TF as seen in the previous report using reduced and carboxymethylated form of α-lactalbumin (RCM-La). When PhoA<sup>220-310</sup> was mixed with the monomeric mutant TF<sup>mon</sup>, each of the time traces was well explained by a single exponential curve. The time traces at varying concentration of TF<sup>mon</sup> showed linear dependence of the observed rate <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> on the concentration of TF<sup>mon</sup>, and <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> were extracted by fit of the data to the linear function of <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub>[TF]+<italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>. On the other hand, the time traces of the binding between PhoA<sup>220-310</sup> and TF were best represented as the sum of the two exponential curves. The fit of the time traces to two exponential functions resulted the fraction of the fast phase more than 80% that increased as the concentration of TF increased. The fraction for the fast phase coincides with the fraction of the dimer as estimated by the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of dimerization (2 µM) determined by the AUC experiment, and thus we concluded that the fast and slow phases are attributed to the binding of PhoA<sup>220-310</sup> to the dimer and the monomer fractions of TF, respectively. The concentration for the plots of <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> was calculated for each of the dimer and the monomer, using the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of dimerization (2 µM). The kinetic parameters determined for the monomer fraction of TF roughly correspond to those determined for the monomeric mutant TF<sup>mon</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ITC experiments</title><p>For the ribosome and TF, calorimetric titrations were carried out on iTC200 microcalorimeter (GE healthcare) at 22°C. All protein samples were dialyzed against ITC buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM potassium acetate, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). The 200 µL sample cell was filled with 12 µM solution of the ribosome, and 40 µL injection syringe was filled with 160 to 190 µM solution of TF or RBD. The titrations were carried out with a preliminary 0.2 µL injection, followed by 14 injections of 2.5 µL each with time intervals of 5 min. The solution was stirred at 1000 rpm. For unfolded substrates (PhoA<sup>220-310</sup> or MBP<sup>198-265</sup>) and TF, TF<sup>mon</sup>, or TF<sup>ΔRBD</sup>, calorimetric titrations were carried out on Auto-iTC200 microcalorimeter (GE healthcare). The calorimetric titrations for PhoA220-310 and MBP198-265 were performed at 8°C and 22°C, respectively. All protein samples were purified in ITC buffer containing 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mM KCl by gel filtration. For titration of PhoA<sup>220-310</sup>, the 200 µL sample cell was filled with 90 µM solution of TF, TF<sup>mon</sup>, or TF<sup>ΔRBD</sup>, and 40 µL injection syringe was filled with 1.1 mM solution of PhoA<sup>220-310</sup>. For titration of MBP<sup>198-265</sup>, the 200 µL sample cell was filled with 110 µM solution of TF or TF<sup>ΔRBD</sup>, and 40 µL injection syringe was filled with 1.1 mM solution of MBP198-265. The titrations were carried out with a preliminary 0.2 µL injection, followed by 8 injections of 4.2 µL each with time intervals of 5 min. The solution was stirred at 1000 rpm. Data for the preliminary injection, which are affected by diffusion of the solution from and into the injection syringe during the initial equilibration period, were discarded. Binding isotherms were generated by plotting heats of reaction normalized by the modes of injectant versus the ratio of total injectant to total protein per injection. The data were fitted with Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Anti-aggregation assays</title><p>Aggregation of denatured GAPDH from rabbit muscle (Sigma; G-2267) was measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saio et al., 2014</xref>). 125 µM GAPDH was denatured by 3 M guanidine-HCl in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.05% NaN<sub>3</sub> for 12 hr at 4°C.

The proteins were denatured in the buffer containing 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, and 8 M urea. PreMBP and MBP<sup>Y283D</sup> were concentrated to 80 and 32 µM, respectively. Refolding of preMBP was initiated by 20-fold rapid dilution into the buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% NaN<sub>3</sub>. Refolding process of preMBP in the absence and presence of TF or TF<sup>ΔRBD</sup> at the concentration of 4 or 20 µM was monitored by an increase in tryptophan fluorescence intensity.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Lewis E Kay (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your work has been reviewed by three experts who are all very positive but suggest minor improvements for a subsequent revision. In particular, all reviewers noted that the structure of the TF dimer is a major accomplishment both technically and in terms of the information that it provides concerning mechanism of action. Indeed, reviewers write: &quot;This work makes important contributions to the chaperone biology by rationalizing observations in structural terms. Moreover, the structural studies of such a large complex are far from routine and the work thus serves as an excellent example of the power of modern NMR approaches. Overall this is an excellent paper&quot;. &quot;This is a major contribution because:</p><p>- TF is representative of ATP-independent chaperones, which are not as well understood as ATP-dependent chaperones, such as GroEL.</p><p>- The authors were able to cleverly overcome major technical challenges posed by the high MW and the dynamic nature of the monomer/dimer exchange.</p><p>- The monomer/dimer equilibrium is central to the chaperone function of TF, not only as a modulatory mechanism, but also because it is known that TF binds, as a monomer, at the ribosome to prevent the aggregation of nascent polypeptides, while it functions as a dimer in cytosol to assist protein folding and prevent aggregation of unfolded protein.</p><p>- The structure informs a new molecular mechanism for the TF chaperone (Figure 5)&quot;</p><p>&quot;The widely accepted concept is that TF dimerization is a storage form of the chaperone. An alternative function of the TF dimer in binding folded, small substrates was suggested by the crystal structure of the Thermotoga maritima TF in complex with the ribosomal protein S7 (Martinez-Hackert and Hendrickson, 2009). Saio et al. elegantly rule out the second scenario, by showing that it is the monomeric TF that binds two S7 molecules and that the S7 protein is unfolded when bound.&quot;</p><p>We would encourage the authors to address point 6 below experimentally and perhaps aspects of point 1, but acceptance is not predicated on new experimental data.</p><p>Major:</p><p>1) The authors utilize a mutant TF, ensuring that the kinetic parameters obtained refer to the monomeric form of the protein. But I wonder about the parameters for the dimer. Since substrate can bind to monomers with higher affinity than dimers (as the authors mention) and dimer dissociation is a route for substrate binding, are the measured on/off rates for dimer contaminated by the monomer-dimer equilibrium (even though the equilibrium amount of dimer is much higher than monomer)? Is it possible to prepare a disulfide-linked dimer that would provide a better mimic of the dimeric chaperone, without complications? The question is of interest as the authors argue that the better anti-aggregation activity of the dimer reflects in part the fact that the dimer can dissociate to form 2 monomers, which are then both available for binding. If the dimer could not dissociate into monomers then would the monomer TF be a more potent anti-aggregator or would the faster on rate for the dimer still play an effect? Given that the KDs for dimerization, and for substrate binding for both monomer and dimeric TF are available and assuming physiological concentrations of TF (50 μM) and of substrate it should be possible to calculate the fraction of substrate that is bound to TF that is a monomer or a dimer.</p><p>2) In Figure 3 the authors speak about a holdase activity for the dimeric TF form. They rationalize this in terms of the faster association rates measured. Yet, naïvely I would have thought that what is important for a holdase activity is the lifetime of the bound complex or 1/<italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>; and <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>is much larger for the dimer than the monomeric TF. (ii) Why is there not a holdase effect on the WT MBP protein? (iii) I would imagine that for TF to prevent aggregation the substrate on rate must be greater than the aggregation rates. Can the authors compare their measured on rates to aggregations rates to verify this if aggregation rates are available?</p><p>3) The spectrum of the dimeric TF shows significant broadening of residues from the RBD, seen both in cases of amide resonances (Morgado et al., 2017) and of methyl group selective labeling (Saio et al., 2014). A major concern is that the current structure does not explain that broadening, that most likely reports on a dynamic assembly. This then raises the question – how well does this single conformation satisfy all the distance restraints?</p><p>Also, due to the broadening of the RBD residues, how many NOEs were reliably measured between the RBD and the other TF domain in the dimer?

But I wonder about the parameters for the dimer. Since substrate can bind to monomers with higher affinity than dimers (as the authors mention) and dimer dissociation is a route for substrate binding, are the measured on/off rates for dimer contaminated by the monomer-dimer equilibrium (even though the equilibrium amount of dimer is much higher than monomer)? Is it possible to prepare a disulfide-linked dimer that would provide a better mimic of the dimeric chaperone, without complications? The question is of interest as the authors argue that the better anti-aggregation activity of the dimer reflects in part the fact that the dimer can dissociate to form 2 monomers, which are then both available for binding. If the dimer could not dissociate into monomers then would the monomer TF be a more potent anti-aggregator or would the faster on rate for the dimer still play an effect? Given that the KDs for dimerization, and for substrate binding for both monomer and dimeric TF are available and assuming physiological concentrations of TF (50 μM) and of substrate it should be possible to calculate the fraction of substrate that is bound to TF that is a monomer or a dimer.</p></disp-quote><p>We had previously tried to prepare a disulfide-linked TF dimer but unfortunately it proved not to be a good mimic of the physiological dimer (and thus we decided not to include the data in the original submission). We designed a mutant TF (I80C/E383C) in which the two surface amino acid residues located at the RBD-Arm2 interface in the dimer were mutated to Cys. Based on the structural data this pair was expected to form a favorable disulfide bond. SEC-MALS showed that the oxidized form of TF I80C/E383C mutant indeed forms a stable dimer, even at concentrations below the dimerization K<sub>D</sub> of (~2 μM). NMR spectra of the oxidized TF I80C/E383C showed that the chemical shift of most of the resonances matched those of wt TF. However, several resonances corresponding to residues located at the RBD-Arm2 interface were broadened in the spectrum of the mutant, which suggests that the S-S bridge may have destabilized the local structure around the substrate-binding site B and/or alter the dynamics of the dimeric interface. The stopped-flow experiments indeed showed that the association kinetics between the TF I80C/E383C mutant and protein substrate is much slower than that between wt TF and protein substrate. Because the substrate-binding site-B on TF partially overlaps with the dimer interface, these results imply that the introduction of the intermolecular disulfide bridge or cysteine mutations disturbs the substrate binding site on TF. Since all the dimer interfaces partially overlap with substrate-binding sites, it has been impossible to introduce a disulfide bridge without disrupting substrate binding to TF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 3 the authors speak about a holdase activity for the dimeric TF form. They rationalize this in terms of the faster association rates measured. Yet, naïvely I would have thought that what is important for a holdase activity is the lifetime of the bound complex or 1/k<sub>off</sub>; and k<sub>off</sub> is much larger for the dimer than the monomeric TF. (ii) Why is there not a holdase effect on the WT MBP protein? (iii) I would imagine that for TF to prevent aggregation the substrate on rate must be greater than the aggregation rates. Can the authors compare their measured on rates to aggregations rates to verify this if aggregation rates are available?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in our previous work by Huang et al., 2016, the kinetic competition between the substrate folding rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>fold</sub>) and its association rate with the chaperone (<italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic>) determines the effect of the chaperone on the folding of the substrate protein. Although <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>may also play a role, it is in this case of almost no relevance given that the dissociation rates between chaperones and substrates are relatively fast. Whether a chaperone delays the folding of a substrate is determined by how quickly it can associate with the unfolded state of the substrate before it has the chance to fold to its native state. We added relevant text elaborating this point in the eighth paragraph of the Results.</p><p>ii) The reason is that wt MBP has a fast folding rate and thus TF has no effect. Even strong holdase chaperones such as SecB have little effect on the folding rate of wt MBP. More details and kinetic rates are provided in our previous work (Huang et al., 2016).</p><p>(iii) Assuming that the binding kinetics for the unfolded GAPDH is similar to that for the unfolded PhoA, the association rate between TF and GAPDH is expected to be ~0.5 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is indeed much faster than the process of overall aggregation (Figure 4A). There are no rates for the individual processes leading to aggregation and thus a direct comparison is currently not possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The spectrum of the dimeric TF shows significant broadening of residues from the RBD, seen both in cases of amide resonances (Morgado et al., 2017) and of methyl group selective labeling (Saio et al., 2014). A major concern is that the current structure does not explain that broadening, that most likely reports on a dynamic assembly. This then raises the question – how well does this single conformation satisfy all the distance restraints?</p><p>Also, due to the broadening of the RBD residues, how many NOEs were reliably measured between the RBD and the other TF domain in the dimer? Also it is important that the chemical shifts are deposited in the BMRB, and that the scripts containing restraints used for structure calculations be including in supporting information.</p></disp-quote><p>The measured kinetics of TF dimer association and dissociation suggest that the broadening of resonances corresponding to residues located at the dimeric interface is due to the monomer-dimer transition, rather than internal dynamics within TF. This is further corroborated by the observation that the methyl TROSY spectra of dimeric TF at higher concentrations exhibit reduced line broadening. The spectra reported in the current work are of much higher quality than the ones reported in Saio et al., 2014 as a result of optimized experimental conditions (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We have added a in the subsection “Structure of dimeric TF”. All of the intermolecular NOEs are well satisfied in the structure as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, indicating that the dimeric TF structure is faithfully represented by our NOE-derived distance restraints. All of the coordinates, restraints, chemical shift assignments are being deposited to PDB and BMRB.

As TF monomerizes upon binding to substrate the overall aggregation activity should in principle be quite similar between the wild type and mutant TF.</p></disp-quote><p>We propose here that the difference in the chaperone activities between the dimeric TF and the monomeric TF is due to the differences in the binding kinetics to the substrate protein and the local concentration. Especially for anti-aggregation activity, the elevated local concentration of TF by dimerization is a major factor as explained in the Discussion. The binding to the substrate leads to the dissociation of the dimer into monomers as shown by SEC-MALS (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E) and NMR (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Upon dissociation, one dimer generates two monomeric TF that both co-localize nearby the substrate protein. For a long substrate protein consisting of &gt; ~200 amino acid residues such as GAPDH (~350 a.a.) and MBP (~400 a.a.), both of TF monomers are used to capture the substrate protein (Figure 6, panels vii and viii). Thus, the dissociation of TF dimer into monomers upon binding to the substrate protein results in higher local concentration of TF around the substrate protein, resulting in faster association of the second TF molecule to the substrate protein. The faster association enables TF to more efficiently capture the substrate protein before the substrate proteins aggregate. Such an effect is not observed when a shorter substrate is used, in which case only one TF molecule is sufficient to bind the entire substrate. We have added relevant text to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Another point is that the chaperone activities of wild type TF and TF<sup>ΔRBD</sup> truncation that results in TF monomerization were found to be very similar (Merz et al., 2006).

These observations are consistent with our results. In our GAPDH aggregation assay, as well as MBP refolding assay, the effect of TF<sup>ΔRBD</sup> was also assessed and the results showed that the activity of TF<sup>ΔRBD</sup> was essentially the same as that of the TF monomeric mutant. We added relevant text about TF<sup>ΔRBD</sup> and cited the paper in the first paragraph of the subsection “Dimerization modulates the chaperone activities of TF”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Last point regarding the chaperone activity is that the prevention of GAPDH aggregation was done using 0.5 μm of TF dimer, which is significantly below the K<sub>D</sub> for dimer formation.

At TF concentration of 1 μM, the monomeric mutant (TF<sup>mon</sup>) exhibited weaker anti-aggregation activity than wt TF, which is consistent with the result in the presence of 0.5 μM of TF and TF<sup>mon</sup>. However, the difference between dimeric TF and monomeric TF is smaller at 1 μM concentration because at this higher concentration even the monomeric TF can efficiently suppress aggregation. We have added a new figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We did not increase the concentration of GAPDH because the aggregation is very sensitive to the experimental conditions including concentration of protein and denaturant, dilution factor, and temperature, and thus change of GAPDH concentration would require extensive optimization. Almost all previous GAPDH aggregation assays have been performed using the similar conditions to the ones used in this work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
