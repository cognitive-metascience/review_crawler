mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe/S) proteins is a key process of cells, and defects cause many rare diseases. In the first phase of this pathway, ten Fe/S cluster (ISC) assembly components synthesize and insert [2Fe-2S] clusters. The second phase is dedicated to the assembly of [4Fe-4S] proteins, yet this part is poorly understood. Here, we characterize the BOLA family proteins Bol1 and Bol3 as specific mitochondrial ISC assembly factors that facilitate [4Fe-4S] cluster insertion into a subset of mitochondrial proteins such as lipoate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase. Bol1-Bol3 perform largely overlapping functions, yet cannot replace the ISC protein Nfu1 that also participates in this phase of Fe/S protein biogenesis. Bol1 and Bol3 form dimeric complexes with both monothiol glutaredoxin Grx5 and Nfu1. Complex formation differentially influences the stability of the Grx5-Bol-shared Fe/S clusters. Our findings provide the biochemical basis for explaining the pathological phenotypes of patients with mutations in <italic>BOLA3</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16673.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16673.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16673.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins perform almost all the tasks necessary for cells to survive. However, some proteins, especially enzymes involved in metabolism and energy production, need to contain extra molecules called co-factors to work properly. In human, yeast and other eukaryotic cells, co-factors called iron-sulfur clusters are made in compartments called mitochondria before being packaged into target proteins.</p><p>Defects that affect the assembly of proteins with iron-sulfur clusters are associated with severe diseases that affect metabolism, the nervous system and the blood. Mitochondria contain at least 17 proteins involved in making iron-sulfur proteins, but there may be others that have not yet been identified. For example, a study on patients with a rare human genetic disease suggested that a protein called BOLA3 might also play a role in this process.</p><p>BOLA3 is closely related to the BOLA1 proteins. Here, Uzarska, Nasta, Weiler et al. used yeast to test how these proteins contribute to the assembly of iron-sulfur proteins. Biochemical techniques showed that the yeast equivalents of BOLA1 and BOLA3 (known as Bol1 and Bol3) play specific roles in the assembly pathway. When both of these proteins were missing from yeast, some iron-sulfur proteins – including an important enzyme called lipoic acid synthase – did not assemble properly. The experiments suggest that yeast Bol1 and Bol3 play overlapping and critical roles during the last step of iron-sulfur protein assembly when the iron-sulfur cluster is inserted into the target protein.</p><p>Lastly, Uzarska, Nasta, Weiler et al. used biophysical techniques to show how Bol1 and Bol3 interact with another mitochondrial protein that performs a more general role in iron-sulfur protein assembly. Defects in assembling iron-sulfur proteins are generally more harmful to human cells than yeast cells. Therefore, the next step is to investigate what exact roles BOLA1 and BOLA3 play in human cells and how similar this pathway is in different eukaryotes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16673.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16673.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd><kwd>metal biology</kwd><kwd>ISC machinery</kwd><kwd>lipoic acid</kwd><kwd>respiratory chain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 987</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mühlenhoff</surname><given-names>Ulrich</given-names></name><name><surname>Lill</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>iNEXT 653706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banci</surname><given-names>Lucia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Instruct</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banci</surname><given-names>Lucia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 1927</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lill</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LOEWE program of state Hesse, Germany</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Synmikro</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lill</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 1710</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lill</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009103</institution-id><institution>Von-Behring-Röntgen-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lill</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell biological, biochemical and structural studies reveal the mechanistic roles of two new mitochondrial iron-sulfur protein assembly factors, explaining the patho-biochemical defects of affected patients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are essential organelles and are involved in numerous biological tasks including fatty acid degradation, citric acid cycle, respiration, ATP production, and the biogenesis of various protein cofactors such as heme, lipoic acid and iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters. Genetic defects in these pathways are associated with a spectrum of diverse mitochondriopathies with neurological, neurodegenerative, hematological, and metabolic phenotypes. Knowledge of the molecular deficits of the affected mitochondrial components is key for the development of a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial diseases. A mutation in human <italic>BOLA3</italic> encoding a mitochondrial protein is associated with diverse defects summarized as multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndrome 2 (MMDS2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cameron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haack et al., 2013</xref>). In particular, BOLA3 deficiency results in decreased functions of respiratory complexes I and II as well as lipoic acid-dependent enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), and glycine cleavage system (GCS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mayr et al., 2014</xref>). BOLA3 was suggested to play a role in mitochondrial Fe/S protein biogenesis because of similar clinical and biochemical phenotypes in patients with mutations in the known ISC factors <italic>NFU1</italic> (causing MMDS1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cameron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Invernizzi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>IBA57</italic> (causing MMDS3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajit Bolar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lossos et al., 2015</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beilschmidt and Puccio, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stehling et al., 2014</xref>). Another link for BOLA3 to mitochondrial Fe/S protein biogenesis is provided by the fact that related bacterial and plant Bol proteins interact with monothiol glutaredoxins, factors that play a critical role in Fe/S protein biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutigny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roret et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yeung et al., 2011</xref>]). However, dedicated biochemical investigations of the molecular role of BOLA3 in mitochondria have not been reported hitherto.</p><p>Human BOLA3 belongs to a large protein family of bacterial origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldea et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Willems et al., 2013</xref>). Eukaryotes such as yeast and humans possess three BOLA family members that can be discriminated by conserved sequence elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To date, the precise function of the BOLA proteins and the functional relationship between the three eukaryotic BOLA family members is unclear. Yeast Bol2 (formerly termed Fra2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumanovics et al., 2008</xref>]) is cytosolic, and is involved in cellular iron regulation by forming heterodimeric, [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing complexes with the cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins Grx3-Grx4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mühlenhoff et al., 2010</xref>). The human relative BOLA2 also forms hetero-complexes with human GRX3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2012</xref>), yet the exact physiological role of the Bol2 proteins is still poorly defined. Additionally to BOLA3, human mitochondria contain the homologous BOLA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Willems et al., 2013</xref>). Ablation of <italic>BOLA1</italic> in cultured human cells increases mitochondrial protein thiol oxidation and elicits alterations in mitochondrial morphology. BOLA1 (but not BOLA3) co-purified with tagged mitochondrial monothiol glutaredoxin GLRX5 that is crucial for Fe/S protein biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Willems et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ye et al., 2010</xref>). Both BOLA1 and BOLA3 have structural counterparts in many eukaryotes including yeast Bol1 and Bol3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Apart from the <italic>BOLA3</italic> patient cell analysis, no solid evidence for a direct role of the BOLA family proteins in cellular Fe/S protein metabolism has been described. We therefore sought to better define the physiological role of the mitochondrial Bol1-Bol3 (mBols) and cytosolic Bol2 proteins in this essential biosynthetic pathway by using the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as a model organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beilschmidt and Puccio, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lill, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Netz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rouault, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondrial Fe/S protein biogenesis in yeast involves 17 known ISC components which were inherited from bacteria and are conserved in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lill, 2009</xref>). The pathway can be divided into two major phases. First, components of the ‘core ISC machinery’ including the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1 and the scaffold protein Isu1 synthesize a [2Fe-2S] cluster, and transfer it transiently to the monothiol glutaredoxin Grx5 for subsequent assembly of mitochondrial [2Fe-2S] proteins. Second, dedicated ISC factors use the Grx5-bound Fe/S cluster to assemble a [4Fe-4S] cluster and to facilitate its insertion into mitochondrial apoproteins such as aconitase, respiratory complexes, and the radical SAM Fe/S protein lipoic acid synthase (LIAS). Even though the molecular mechanisms of this late phase of Fe/S protein biogenesis are poorly resolved, recent studies have shown that the Isa1, Isa2 and Iba57 proteins cooperate to generate a [4Fe-4S] cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brancaccio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gelling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mühlenhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sheftel et al., 2012</xref>). Its insertion into specific target apoproteins is subsequently facilitated by Nfu1 and the P-loop ATPase Ind1, both transiently binding [4Fe-4S] clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bych et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sheftel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tong et al., 2003</xref>). The latter ISC protein is specific for maturation of respiratory complex I, but nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying [4Fe-4S] cluster insertion by eukaryotic Nfu1 and Ind1.</p><p>While most proteins of the core ISC machinery are essential for cell viability, impairment of the ISC factors involved in the second phase of Fe/S protein biogenesis only compromises mitochondrial function of yeast cells. This striking difference for phases I and II is explained by the central, additional role of the core ISC machinery in both cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis and cellular iron regulation. Functional defects of core ISC factors lead to impaired assembly of essential Fe/S proteins such as nuclear DNA polymerases and helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Netz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stehling et al., 2012</xref>) and an induction of the yeast iron regulon involving the above mentioned Bol2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Outten and Albetel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paul and Lill, 2015</xref>). Here, we employed a combination of cell biological, biochemical and ultrastructural methods to characterize the potential role of the Bol proteins in cellular Fe/S protein biogenesis and to define their position in the complex pathway. We also investigate the involvement of the mBols in cellular iron regulation in comparison to Bol2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deficiency of Bol1-Bol3 causes defects in a subset of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] enzymes</title><p>We first analyzed the sub-cellular localization of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Bol1 (YAL044W-A) and Bol3 (formerly termed Aim1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hess et al., 2009</xref>) by cell fractionation. Both proteins were exclusively present in the mitochondrial fraction and absent in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Upon sub-fractionation of mitochondria by hypotonic swelling or detergent lysis, the Bol proteins behaved similar to the matrix proteins Tim44 and Mge1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, Bol1 and Bol3 are constituents of the mitochondrial matrix. To examine the physiological function of mitochondrial Bol1-Bol3 (mBols), we created single and double deletion cells, as well as combined deletions with <italic>BOL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>; strain background BY4742). All deletion strains grew at wild-type rates on minimal media containing the non-fermentable carbon sources glycerol or acetate with the exception of <italic>bol13Δ</italic> and <italic>bol123Δ</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Apparently, simultaneous deletion of <italic>BOL1</italic> and <italic>BOL3</italic> created a weak respiratory defect which is slightly weaker than that seen for <italic>NFU1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schilke et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>We then analyzed key mitochondrial enzyme activities to detect potential defects in Fe/S protein biogenesis, and we compared these results to data for a <italic>NFU1</italic> deletion strain which shows mild, yet specific Fe/S enzyme defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schilke et al., 1999</xref>). This analysis included the mitochondrial Fe/S proteins aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH or complex II), and yeast LIAS (Lip5). The latter can be assayed indirectly either by the enzyme activities or the lipoylation extent of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gelling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schonauer et al., 2009</xref>). Further, we measured the activity of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (COX). Even though this enzyme does not contain Fe/S clusters, it is frequently affected by mitochondrial Fe/S protein biogenesis defects, for unknown reasons (see, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mühlenhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sheftel et al., 2012</xref>]).

The decrease in SDH was likely due to a direct defect in Fe/S cluster assembly, because SDH protein levels remained unchanged in immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In keeping with the decreased PDH and KGDH activities, we also found a lipoylation defect of the E2 subunits of these enzymes by immunostaining against lipoic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gelling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schonauer et al., 2009</xref>).

Together, these data show that the mBols were crucial for efficient maturation of LIAS, yet they play only an auxiliary role in SDH maturation. The levels of Bol1 and Nfu1 did not change or rather slightly decreased in the various deletion cells making a compensatory effect unlikely (data not shown; Bol3 levels could not be tested due to the lack of antibody detection).

Taken together, these data support a specific function of the mBols in the maturation of a subset of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins, whereby Bol1 and Bol3 perform largely overlapping, non-essential functions. Interestingly, the <sup>55</sup>Fe radiolabeling assay revealed a slightly more important role for Bol3 as compared to Bol1. This tendency, yet less well pronounced, was also observed for the enzyme activities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

This behavior is strikingly different from that of members of the core ISC machinery, and shows that the mBols were not required for maturation of [2Fe-2S] proteins. We conclude that Bol1-Bol3 are dedicated ISC assembly factors specifically involved in the maturation of a subset of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] but not of [2Fe-2S] proteins. Further, the mBols act after Grx5, the final core ISC component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Uzarska et al., 2013</xref>), because they were not needed for <sup>55</sup>Fe incorporation into Grx5.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Neither mitochondrial Bol1-Bol3 nor cytosolic Bol2 are required for cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis</title><p>We next examined if the mitochondrial Bol proteins perform an additional role in cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis, if they functionally cooperate with cytosolic Bol2, or if Bol2 alone plays a crucial role in this process. Previous studies on yeast Bol2 and human BOLA2 have suggested an involvement of these cytosolic proteins in intracellular iron metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumanovics et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2012</xref>). First, we measured the consequences of various <italic>BOL</italic> gene deletions on the activation of the Aft1-Aft2-dependent iron regulon, a hallmark of all cells with defects in the core ISC machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Outten and Albetel, 2013</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumanovics et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>bol2Δ</italic> cells displayed a substantial activation of the Aft1-dependent <italic>FIT3</italic> and <italic>FET3</italic> genes in a GFP-based promoter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). In contrast, yeast strains lacking <italic>BOL1</italic> and/or <italic>BOL3</italic> behaved like wild-type cells indicating that the mBols are not involved in cellular iron regulation. This fits nicely to our conclusion above that Bol1-Bol3 do not belong to the core ISC system. The same situation was observed for cells lacking Nfu1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), another known late-acting specific ISC assembly factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</xref>).

No changes were observed when <italic>BOL1-BOL3</italic> genes were deleted either alone or in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>bol2Δ</italic> cells showed a twofold decrease in Leu1 activity, which further declined upon additional deletion of <italic>BOL1-BOL3</italic>. Collectively, these results show that the mBols are not involved in cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis, yet there is a cross-talk of the mBol deficiency with the <italic>BOL2</italic> deletion. To better understand the reason of this combinatory effect, we took advantage of the <sup>55</sup>Fe radiolabeling assay described above. Deletion of either <italic>BOL1-BOL3</italic> or <italic>BOL2</italic> hardly affected <sup>55</sup>Fe/S cluster binding to Leu1 indicating that neither mitochondrial Bol1-Bol3 nor cytosolic Bol2 perform a decisive role in Leu1 Fe/S cluster incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>). However, combining the <italic>BOL2</italic> deletion with that of <italic>BOL1</italic> and/or <italic>BOL3</italic> resulted in an up to twofold decrease in <sup>55</sup>Fe/S cluster association with Leu1. A similar twofold decrease (compared to wild-type) was seen for <sup>55</sup>Fe incorporation into another cytosolic Fe/S protein, the ABC protein Rli1 using the triple <italic>BOL</italic> deletion strain <italic>bol123Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). We note, however, that these decreases in <sup>55</sup>Fe incorporation were rather weak compared to defects in core ISC or CIA components (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Netz et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paul et al., 2015</xref>). The Rli1 maturation defect was completely restored when any of the <italic>BOL</italic> genes was reintroduced into the <italic>bol123Δ</italic> mutant. This supports the notion that neither the mBols nor Bol2 are directly involved in cytosolic Fe/S protein maturation. Obviously, their combined absence causes alterations in both mitochondrial metabolism and cellular iron homeostasis, thereby creating conditions that negatively affect cytosolic Fe/S cluster insertion. The physiological conditions prevailing in <italic>bol123Δ</italic> cells might also explain the slight decrease in the enzyme activity of aconitase which, like Leu1, is a highly susceptible protein to, e.g., oxidative stress conditions or changes in iron availability (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>). Together, our data indicate that the mBols execute a mitochondria-specific function in [4Fe-4S] protein assembly, whereas Bol2 plays a specific role in cellular iron regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumanovics et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Bol1-Bol3 and Nfu1 perform distinct tasks in mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] protein maturation</title><p>Our current and previous results suggested functions of the mBols and of Nfu1 as specialized ISC assembly factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cameron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</xref>).

We used the human proteins for these in vitro studies because they were more stable than the yeast counterparts. First, the solution structures of human BOLA1 and BOLA3 were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). A detailed description of the two structures and of their backbone dynamic properties is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. According to the DALI server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holm and Sander, 1993</xref>), both BOLA1 and BOLA3 show the highest structural similarity to BolA-like proteins from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana, Babesia bovis</italic>, and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abendroth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kasai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roret et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, the BOLA1 structure matches better with those homologues that have a longer loop between β1 and β2, while the BOLA3 structure is more similar to homologues having a shorter β1-β2 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Apparently, the structural features of the loop between β1 and β2 are key for differentiating BOLA1 from BOLA3. Remarkably, this loop is closer to the ‘invariant’ His residue (His102 in BOLA1 and His96 in BOLA3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which has been shown to coordinate the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the yeast Bol2-Grx3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2011</xref>). This region contains further possible Fe/S cluster ligands, namely His58, His67 in BOLA1 and Cys59 in BOLA3. Another conserved His residue (His86 in BOLA1 and His81 in BOLA3) is distant from this region and thus excluded as a cluster ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

The overall topology of the solution structure of human BOLA3 is α1β1β2η1α2η2β3 (h: 3<sub>10</sub>-helix), in which β1 and β2 are antiparallel, and β3 is parallel to β2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

A cysteine residue (Cys59), typically conserved in Bol3 homologues, is located close to the invariant His96 residue in an extended loop between β1 and β2. The two residues are not in the proper orientation to coordinate a [2Fe-2S] cluster (Sγ of Cys59 is at an average distance of ~8 Å from Nε2 of His96). The overall topology of the solution structure of BOLA1 is similar to that of BOLA3, with the exception of the presence, in BOLA1, of short helices in the loop regions and at the C-terminus (α1η1β1β2η2α2α3β3α4 topology) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, at both termini BOLA1 has ca. 15 residues that are unstructured and whose backbone NH resonances are clustered in the central region of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum (part B).

The CD spectrum of GLRX5-BOLA1 characteristically differed from that of holo-GLRX5 in a positive versus negative ellipticity around 400 nm with a 6 nm blue shift and 40% decrease of the ~460 nm peak with a 6 nm red shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These spectral changes saturated at an equimolar ratio of holo-GLRX5 and BOLA1 suggesting a high affinity equimolar hetero-complex formation with a shared [2Fe-2S] cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The cluster coordinated by the GLRX5-BOLA1 hetero-dimer was stable against reduction by dithionite creating a CD spectrum in which the peak at 460 nm was maintained but that at 400 nm was lost. In contrast, the cluster of holo-GLRX5 was destroyed upon dithionite treatment with no residual CD peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Hardly any CD spectral changes were observed upon co-reconstituting or mixing GLRX5 and BOLA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Further, the Fe/S cluster was not protected against destruction by dithionite treatment indicating rather different coordination situations for the [2Fe-2S] clusters in the two GLRX5-BOLA heterodimers. These results are consistent with the different NMR chemical shift changes in the putative Fe/S cluster binding regions of the two BOLAs in the hetero-complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). They do not explain, however, why NMR still detected holo-specific changes in the putative cluster-binding region of the BOLA3 hetero-complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Since the NMR data were recorded in GSH-containing buffer at lower pH, we repeated the CD analysis under NMR buffer conditions. We found a general decrease of the CD peaks upon GLRX5-BOLA3 hetero-complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These changes mainly depended on the presence of GSH, and not salt or pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In all cases, the CD signal decrease did not reach saturation even after addition of a more than tenfold molar excess of BOLA3 over holo-GLRX5. This result indicated a rather low affinity for this interference of BOLA3 with the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Overall, the CD data indicate a rather weak and GSH-dependent influence of BOLA3 on the GLRX5 [2Fe-2S] cluster which is not stabilized by hetero-complex formation.</p><p>To independently analyze the GLRX5-BOLA complex formation, we used size exclusion chromatography. Holo-GLRX5 (recorded at 420 nm) eluted at 44 kDa indicative of homodimer with bound Fe/S cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). A significantly smaller molecular mass was observed for the heterodimeric GLRX5-BOLA1 (32 kDa), while the mixture of holo-GLRX5 and BOLA3 did not alter the elution behavior of GLRX5 at 420 nm. The elution profile at 280 nm showed no significant protein peak around 30 kDa that might represent a GLRX5-BOLA3 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Further, BOLA3 from the GLRX5-BOLA3 mixture eluted exclusively at the position of BOLA3 alone. These results support the formation of a stable heterodimer between GLRX5 and BOLA1, yet the interaction of GLRX5 with BOLA3 appears to be kinetically unstable, especially in the absence of GSH.</p><p>The lack of stable interaction between GLRX5 and BOLA3 raised the question of whether the latter could interact with NFU1. Since Fe/S cluster binding to NFU1 was CD-silent, we performed in vitro binding studies by microscale thermophoresis (MST), an equilibrium method that can be performed under anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Webert et al., 2014</xref>). For these interaction experiments we used both apo-NFU1 and chemically reconstituted holo-NFU1 carrying a [4Fe-4S] cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tong et al., 2003</xref>). MST indeed showed a specific interaction between the two BOLA proteins and both apo- and holo-NFU1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). The dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) of the interactions were in the range of 3 µM, with the notable exception of a fourfold higher affinity detected for BOLA3 and holo-NFU1 (K<sub>d</sub> = 0.8 µM). As a control, no significant affinity was observed for human [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin FDX2, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> or RNase A as control proteins. Collectively, these results data suggest that holo-GLRX5 preferentially cooperates with BOLA1, and holo-NFU1 with BOLA3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we have defined the molecular function of the mitochondrial Bol1 and Bol3 proteins (mBols) as specific ISC assembly factors required for the insertion of [4Fe-4S] clusters into a small subset of mitochondrial target apoproteins. The two mBols act late in the ISC pathway, and execute a largely overlapping function, because only simultaneous deletion of both <italic>BOL</italic> genes was associated with appreciable effects on mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] target proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Lipoic acid synthase (LIAS) with its two [4Fe-4S] clusters is the primary client of mBol function because of strong effects on lipoic acid-dependent proteins (such as PDH and KGDH) in <italic>bol13Δ</italic> cells. These severe effects were observed under all experimental conditions tested, unlike the comparatively weak effects on SDH (complex II) which typically is one of the more sensitive mitochondrial Fe/S proteins upon ISC factor defects. Therefore, we cannot exclude an indirect effect of the <italic>BOL</italic> gene deletion on SDH maturation. The [4Fe-4S] aconitase, on the other hand, was not or hardly affected in <italic>bol13Δ</italic> cells distinguishing the <italic>BOL</italic> deletion phenotype from that of all other known ISC genes, with the exception of the complex I-specific <italic>IND1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bych et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sheftel et al., 2009</xref>). We propose that the rather inconspicuous effects on aconitase are indirect consequences of the metabolic and respiratory alterations arising from lipoic acid-dependent enzyme defects which mainly affect the citric acid cycle (PDH and KGDH) and the amino acid metabolism (BCKDH, GCS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The functions of the mBols are largely overlapping, yet not entirely identical. This was evident from small effects on LIAS and SDH in <italic>bol3Δ</italic> cells, versus no detectable alterations upon <italic>BOL1</italic> deletion. Moreover, double deletion of <italic>BOL3</italic> and <italic>NFU1</italic>, encoding another late-acting ISC factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Melber et al., 2016</xref>; accompanying manuscript), exacerbated the Fe/S protein defects compared to single deletions, while double deletion of <italic>BOL1</italic> and <italic>NFU1</italic> behaved similarly to <italic>nfu1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Two models may explain the largely complementary functions of the two mBols. i) The mBols assist the same biochemical reaction. In this case, the subtle differences between <italic>bol1Δ</italic> and <italic>bol3Δ</italic> strains may be due to minor target apoprotein specificities of the two mBols or the different protein interactions with Grx5 and Nfu1. ii) The mBols act consecutively in two independent maturation steps that both can be bypassed to some extent. Even though we biochemically favor the first possibility, current knowledge does not allow a more precise mechanistic definition of mBol function. Taken together, the major evident physiological function of the yeast mBol proteins is in lipoate synthase maturation. A similar defect is seen in human cells obtained from <italic>BOLA3</italic> patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cameron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haack et al., 2013</xref>). This phenotypical resemblance suggests that the yeast mBols and at least human BOLA3 are functionally similar. Even though yeast appears to be a suitable model system for the physiological and mechanistic investigation of mBols, the two human BOLAs now need to be studied in cell culture to gain better insights into their relative function.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16673.025</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Working model for the role of mitochondrial BOLA proteins as specific ISC assembly factors in the late phase of mitochondrial Fe/S protein biogenesis.</title><p>Members of the core ISC assembly machinery including the sulfur donor NFS1, the scaffold protein ISCU, and dedicated chaperones (Chap.) mediate the assembly of a transiently bound, glutathione (GS)-coordinated [2Fe-2S] cluster on the monothiol glutaredoxin GLRX5 which is essential for [2Fe-2S] protein maturation, cytosolic Fe/S protein assembly (CIA), and cellular iron regulation in yeast. With the help of ISCA1, ISCA2, and IBA57, the GLRX5-bound [2Fe-2S] cluster is converted into a [4Fe-4S] type. BOLA1 and BOLA3 together with NFU1 and IND1 function in a specific assembly of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins as indicated. The central target of the BOLA proteins is the Fe/S protein lipoic acid (LA) synthase (LIAS). Its product is used as a cofactor of five mitochondrial enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH). Based on the hetero-complex formation with the BOLA proteins an additional function of GLRX5 in this late phase of mitochondrial Fe/S protein assembly is likely. Mutations in human <italic>NFU1</italic> and <italic>BOLA3</italic> cause multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndromes (MMDS; for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beilschmidt and Puccio, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stehling et al., 2014</xref>]).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16673.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16673.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-16673-fig8-v3"/></fig></p><p>Several findings allowed us to define the site of action of the mBols in the multi-step ISC assembly pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). First, the mBols were not required for maturation of mitochondrial [2Fe-2S] proteins or cytosolic Fe/S proteins. Second, their deletion did not affect the yeast cellular iron regulon. These criteria distinguish the mBol phenotype from that of the components of the core ISC machinery including Grx5, that is the final core ISC factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Uzarska et al., 2013</xref>), and suggest that mBols act subsequently to Grx5. This view is further corroborated by our finding that, third, <sup>55</sup>Fe incorporation into Grx5 occurred independently of mBols. Finally, the function of the mBols must be after the involvement of Isa-Iba57 proteins in the [4Fe-4S] cluster formation, because the mBols exhibit high [4Fe-4S] target specificity. In Isa-Iba57-defective cells, all mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins and the non-Fe/S protein cytochrome oxidase are severely affected, unlike in <italic>bol13Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mühlenhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sheftel et al., 2012</xref>). Overall, the site of action of the mBols is similar to that of the late-acting ISC assembly factor Nfu1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Navarro-Sastre et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, we found that the mBol and Nfu1 proteins cannot complement each other’s function, even after overexpression, suggesting that they both fulfil a highly specific task in the dedicated insertion of [4Fe-4S] clusters into target apoproteins.</p><p>The observation that the mBols function subsequently to Grx5 is somewhat unexpected in light of our findings that the mBols form binary complexes with this core ISC component. Apparently, complex formation with the mBols is not critical for Grx5’s major function as a core ISC factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), as the <italic>GRX5</italic> deficiency is associated with rather severe defects in virtually all mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe/S proteins plus a misregulation of cellular iron homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodriguez-Manzaneque et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Uzarska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ye et al., 2010</xref>), radically distinguishing this phenotype from that of the rather inconspicuous <italic>BOL1-BOL3</italic> deletion. It is well possible that the Grx5-mBol complexes play a role at the later stage of Fe/S cluster insertion into apoproteins. This seems likely based on interaction between BOLA1 and GLRX5 observed in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Willems et al., 2013</xref>), and similar interactions reported in the accompanying manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Melber et al., 2016</xref>). At present, it is impossible to verify such a function by in vivo studies, because the potential Grx5 involvement at this later stage of the ISC pathway is hidden by the severe <italic>GRX5</italic> deletion phenotype.</p><p>In our present work, we have characterized the Grx5-mBol interactions by a number of in vitro techniques including gel filtration, CD spectroscopy and NMR structural analyses. Human GLRX5 interacted with both mBols, stoichiometrically forming a 1:1 complex both in the apo- and chemically reconstituted holo-forms, involving similar regions on the three proteins as revealed by NMR studies. However, for the holo-forms, further residues were affected, and were clustered around the region containing the invariant histidine (His102 in BOLA1 and His96 in BOLA3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>), which in cytosolic Bol2 is a ligand for Fe/S cluster binding with Grx3-Grx4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2011</xref>). These Bol regions include other potential cluster ligands, which are two His residues in BOLA1, located at the end of β2 and in the loop between β1 and β2, and one Cys in BOLA3, located in the loop between β1 and β2. CD spectroscopy revealed striking differences in Fe/S cluster binding to the two holo-GLRX5-BOLA complexes. Compared to holo-GLRX5, the holo-GLRX5-BOLA1 complex showed characteristic new spectral features including a new peak at ~400 nm. GLRX5 and BOLA1 coordinate the [2Fe-2S] cluster with high affinity. The spectral features of the complex were rather insensitive to changes in ionic conditions or to the presence of additional GSH. Most characteristically, the [2Fe-2S] cluster of GLRX5 was stabilized by BOLA1 binding against destruction by the reductant dithionite indicating a stable holo-GLRX5-BOLA1 complex.</p><p>All these criteria were different for the holo-GLRX5-BOLA3 complex. First, the CD spectral features of the holo-GLRX5-BOLA3 complex differed from those of holo-GLRX5 by a general signal decrease, and were observed mainly in the presence of GSH suggesting that without added GSH the GLRX5 cluster is not shared with BOLA3. Second, the spectral changes induced by BOLA3 addition to holo-GLRX5 were not saturable indicating a rather weak influence of BOLA3 on the GLRX5 Fe/S cluster. Third, the CD signals became rather weak at high BOLA3 or salt concentrations. Finally, dithionite readily destroyed the [2Fe-2S] cluster of GLRX5 in the presence and absence of BOLA3. In support of this data, gel filtration did not identify a stable complex between holo-GLRX5 and BOLA3 indicating that their interaction is kinetically labile, and a hetero-dimer may dissociate during the non-equilibrium method. All these findings document radically different Fe/S cluster binding properties of the two GLXR5-BOLA complexes with BOLA1 stabilizing and BOLA3 destabilizing the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Interestingly, we found a preferential interaction of BOLA3 with the holoform of NFU1 by thermophoresis. These data suggest that BOLA3 may stabilize the [4Fe-4S] cluster bound on NFU1. A specific genetic interaction of <italic>NFU1</italic> and <italic>BOL3</italic> supports our biochemical findings. Double deletion of these genes exacerbated the defects of SDH and LIAS, whereas simultaneous deletions of <italic>NFU1</italic> and <italic>BOL1</italic> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). This suggests that Bol3 and Nfu1 cooperate in SDH and LIAS maturation. Future biochemical studies have to address the physiological meaning of the stabilizing or destabilizing function of the mBols for the different Fe/S clusters on Grx5 and Nfu1.</p><p>The NMR structures of the mBols share a similar fold, alike to those of other eukaryotic homologous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abendroth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kasai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roret et al., 2014</xref>). Further, similar interacting regions for the apo- and holo-states of the GLRX5-BOLA heterodimers were found, and a similar location of the invariant His residue, a known Fe/S cluster ligand in Bol2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2011</xref>). However, we note that its surrounding is structurally different in the two BOLAs, that is His102 of BOLA1 is the first residue following a long β-strand, while His96 of BOLA3 is in a 3<sub>10</sub> helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The other potential Fe/S cluster ligands are located in structurally different positions of the two mBols. In particular, the location of the two conserved His58, His67 residues in BOLA1 and of Cys59 in BOLA3 are different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These features can possibly explain the observed differences in the binding and stability of [2Fe-2S] clusters to the holo heterodimers with GLRX5. The distinct functional roles of the mBols could be viewed as consequence of the different coordination spheres of the Fe/S cluster.</p><p>The role of the mBols in a late step of the mitochondrial ISC pathway fits well with our observation that their functional deficiency (<italic>bol13Δ</italic> cells) does not cause any significant defects on cytosolic Fe/S proteins. Interestingly, a combination of these gene deletions with <italic>BOL2</italic> elicited significant effects, even though these were rather weak compared to known core ISC or CIA deficiencies (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hausmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Netz et al., 2010</xref>). The defects, especially in the triple deletion mutant <italic>bol123Δ</italic>, are therefore best explained by combined detrimental effects of mitochondrial respiratory and metabolic changes arising from the <italic>BOL1-BOL3</italic> deletion (see above) and the disturbed cellular iron homeostasis resulting from <italic>BOL2</italic> ablation. Single <italic>BOL2</italic> deletion is not associated with major phenotypes apart from iron homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumanovics et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is clearly different from the usual lethality of CIA gene deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Netz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paul and Lill, 2015</xref>), and fits well with the rather weak or even inconspicuous effects of a <italic>BOL2</italic> deletion on the maturation of the cytosolic Fe/S proteins Leu1 and Rli1. Any slight effects are most likely due to the auxiliary role of Bol2 in iron metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumanovics et al., 2008</xref>). In this function, Bol2 cooperates with Grx3-Grx4 (human PICOT) which, in its role in cellular iron mobilization, is essential for cytosolic Fe/S protein maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haunhorst et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mühlenhoff et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our comprehensive physiological investigations of mBol function in yeast reveal that <italic>bol13Δ</italic> cells behave similarly to human patients deficient in BOLA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cameron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haack et al., 2013</xref>). Patients with the resulting multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndrome 2 (MMDS 2) show major defects in lipoic acid-dependent enzymes, similar to the most severe effect observed in <italic>bol13Δ</italic> yeast. Moreover, the patient cells are deficient in respiratory complexes I and II, the latter also being affected in yeast. We conclude that the mBol protein function is conserved from yeast to man with a major role in [4Fe-4S] cluster insertion into LIAS and respiratory complexes I and II, whereas Fe/S proteins such as aconitase are matured independently of mBol function. The conclusion of similar mBol functions in yeast and man may be surprising based on the rather inconspicuous yeast deletion phenotypes versus the lethal effect in BOLA3-deficient individuals. This difference may simply reflect the higher complexity of a multi-cellular organism and its dependence on respiration and metabolic homeostasis, whereas yeast can tolerate substantial deviations from optimal conditions. Notably, RNAi-mediated depletion of BOLA1 was associated with rather mild effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Willems et al., 2013</xref>) predicting that the combination with a BOLA3 depletion may create a more pathological phenotype mimicking that of human patients and of <italic>bol13Δ</italic> yeast cells. Our elucidation of the target apoprotein-specific ISC assembly function of mBols will be instrumental for future mechanistic studies on how the mBols facilitate the insertion of [4Fe-4S] clusters into LIAS and possibly other Fe/S proteins. These studies will also have to reveal why other Fe/S proteins such as aconitase are matured efficiently in the absence of these specialized ISC assembly factors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Klaus Pfanner, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript authored by Uzarska et al. concerns BOL-type proteins of the mitochondria. The analysis reported focuses on two approaches – genetic analysis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (BOL1 and BOL3) and biophysical analysis of human proteins (BOLA1 and BOLA3). This is the first analysis of the yeast genes. The authors show that a single deletion of either Bol1 or 3 produces very mild or no phenotype in the activities of target proteins. The double deletion produces a measurable phenotype which they state is milder compared with other disruptions earlier in the Fe-S pathway. They investigated the interaction of Bol1 and Bol3 with GRX5 and NFU1, two other components of the late Fe-S assembly pathway.</p><p>Overall, the experiments are of high quality and the clear linkage to Fe-S cluster biogenesis and the apparent specificity for 4Fe-4S clusters is important new information.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The functional difference between Bol1 and Bol3 is difficult to depict. Deletion of only one of them showed hardly phenotypical consequences, yet deleting both showed drastic effects. Is there a compensatory effect in terms of protein levels of Bol1 and Bol3 and even Nfu1 and Grx5 in bol1-δ, bol3-δ and nfu1-δ strains? Overexpression of Bola3 in bola1-δ may overcome the weak interaction of Bola3-Glrx5 to substitute for Bola1.</p><p>The observation that Bol1 and Bol3 interact with different known components of the Fe-S cluster biosynthetic pathway does not suggest to me that they have overlapping functions as claimed. Rather I would say that the double deletion produces a synthetic sick strain, consistent with both proteins acting in the same pathway. They also claim that yeast is a good model for the human disease, but in humans mutations in BOLA3 alone clearly produce a very severe biochemical and clinical phenotype, so I would be tempted to conclude that BOLA1 and BOL3 have non-overlapping functions in humans.</p><p>2) A key aspect of the yeast analysis that is missing is analysis of the levels of the proteins in cells being analyzed, particularly Bol1 and Bol3, but also Nfu1. This information is important for interpreting the differences in the phenotypes of deletion strains. But it is even more so in the cases where additional copies are expressed from plasmids. The effect of such additional copies can be interpreted if the fold overexpression is known and the relative level of protein being overexpressed to the level normally present of the protein.</p><p>At a minimum the authors need to intellectually address this issue and be more transparent about what they do and don't know. Of course, the paper would be much stronger if protein levels were measured using specific antibodies or tagged proteins that were demonstrated to be functional.</p><p>3) The relationship between the yeast and human sections of the manuscript is not so clear.</p><p>What is the sequence relationship between the yeast mBols and the human BOLAs? It appears from the alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> that yeast Bol1 is more similar to BOLA1 and yeast Bol3 is more similar to BOLA3. But this is not at all clear as one is reading through the manuscript. It would be very helpful to the reader if this be addressed directly up front at the beginning of the manuscript. Also a bit of background as to what are the core features that &quot;define&quot; a &quot;BOL&quot; protein and what in general is known about &quot;distinguishing characteristics&quot; among members.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16673.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The functional difference between Bol1 and Bol3 is difficult to depict.

Overexpression of Bola3 in bola1-δ may overcome the weak interaction of Bola3-Glrx5 to substitute for Bola1.</italic> </p><p>This is a valid point which we possibly have not outlined well in our manuscript. We do not see compensatory effects between Bol1, Bol2, Nfu1, and Grx5. We have already shown in the previous version of our manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>) that Nfu1 overexpression cannot compensate for Bol1,3, and Bol3 does not for Nfu1. The same is true for overexpressed Grx5 that cannot compensate for the mBols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As a further analysis into this direction and as suggested by the Reviewers, we now have analyzed the levels of Bol1, Bol3 (see legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>), and Nfu1 in the various yeast deletion cells to check the levels of the residual proteins. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>, we do not find major compensatory changes for these ISC proteins. The level of Bol1 in <italic>bol3Δ</italic> cells is even lower. Hence, we find it highly unlikely that compensatory effects may explain the synthetic phenotype of <italic>BOL1,3</italic> deletions, or the generally rather weak effects of the deletion of the late-acting <italic>ISC</italic> genes. We now mention this finding in the Results in our revised manuscript. We also emphasize that the weak effects of late ISC protein deficiencies are easily explained by their rather specific requirement for maturation of only a small subset of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins (Discussion).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16673.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Late ISC protein levels in various yeast strains.</title><p>Wild-type (WT; BY4742), indicated <italic>BOL</italic> deletion strains and nfu1Δ cells were grown in (<bold>A</bold>) minimal medium containing 2% galactose supplemented with 50 µM ferric ammonium citrate, (<bold>B</bold>) iron-poor minimal medium containing 2% galactose or (<bold>C</bold>) lactate medium.

Rather I would say that the double deletion produces a synthetic sick strain, consistent with both proteins acting in the same pathway.</italic></p><p>We agree with the latter part of this interpretation. Our <italic>BOL</italic> deletions strains clearly show that the presence of one Bol protein can suppress most or all phenotypes of the double deletion. In our view, two biochemical models may explain this situation. i) The two Bol proteins assist the same reaction. Hence, absence of only one Bol protein does not cause a major phenotype. The subtle differences between the <italic>bol1Δ</italic> (no phenotypes) and <italic>bol3Δ</italic> (occasional weak phenotypes) strains may then be due to minor target apoprotein specificities of the two Bol proteins or the different protein interactions as mentioned by the Reviewers. We emphasize, however, that we have no phenotypical evidence that the Bol protein complexes have an in vivorelevance. ii) The Bol proteins act consecutively in two independent maturation steps that both can be bypassed to some extent. Even though we find the second possibility biochemically less attractive, it is hard at this stage of analysis to more precisely define the specific molecular function of the Bol proteins. To better explain our interpretation of the relative function of Bol1-Bol3, we have improved our Discussion (first paragraph), and hope this point is much clearer now.</p><p> <italic>They also claim that yeast is a good model for the human disease, but in humans mutations in BOLA3 alone clearly produce a very severe biochemical and clinical phenotype, so I would be tempted to conclude that BOLA1 and BOL3 have non-overlapping functions in humans.</italic></p><p>Apparently, our comment that yeast is a good model for human disease was found misleading. What we meant to say (and we still think is correct), is that the Bol proteins in both yeast and human cells have a major function in lipoate synthase maturation. This is the major and strongest phenotype in both yeast and humans. We have improved our statements in the Discussion to make this issue clearer. Since the two human BOLA proteins have not been analyzed in a direct comparative in vivo study, we agree with the Reviewers that any further speculation about the similarity between yeast and human Bol proteins is not justified at this stage. We have screened our manuscript for possible confusing comments and have amended them.</p><p> <italic>2) A key aspect of the yeast analysis that is missing is analysis of the levels of the proteins in cells being analyzed, particularly Bol1 and Bol3, but also Nfu1. This information is important for interpreting the differences in the phenotypes of deletion strains. But it is even more so in the cases where additional copies are expressed from plasmids. The effect of such additional copies can be interpreted if the fold overexpression is known and the relative level of protein being overexpressed to the level normally present of the protein.</italic></p><p> <italic>At a minimum the authors need to intellectually address this issue and be more transparent about what they do and don't know. Of course, the paper would be much stronger if protein levels were measured using specific antibodies or tagged proteins that were demonstrated to be functional.</italic></p><p>This is a valid point and connected to point 1. Protein levels in yeast are available from systematic studies (see the SGD website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/">http://www.yeastgenome.org/</ext-link>). 10-fold lower amounts of Bol1 and Bol3 were found compared to Nfu1 and Grx5 (two tables were provided for the reviewers’ consideration). However, these data sets may be of limited use, because the protein values differ more than tenfold between the different published data sets. Even after normalization to one protein (e.g., Nfs1) the relative protein levels in the different data sets differ substantially. Thus, we cannot rely on published numbers. We therefore have quantitated the levels of Bol1, Bol3, and Grx5 as suggested by the reviewers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>). The analysis shows that Grx5 is (at least) 4-fold more abundant than the Bol proteins. From immunoblots we know that overexpression usually generates 10-20-fold higher levels. However, as discussed above from the analysis of protein levels in various deletions strains, the mere protein level increases do not have major effects on the phenotypes studied in our investigation. We have discussed this issue briefly. An analysis for Nfu1 was not feasible because we could not obtain purified yeast Nfu1.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16673.028</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Protein levels of Bol1, Bol3 and Grx5 in yeast mitochondria.</title><p>Wild-type (WT; BY4742) and <italic>bol13Δ</italic> cells were grown in minimal medium containing 2% galactose supplemented with 50 µM ferric ammonium citrate and used for isolation of mitochondria (mito).

Densitometry of the bands was used to calculate the proteins levels (in ng per mg mitochondria). Since our antibody did not detect wild-type amounts of Bol3 in mitochondria (<bold>B</bold>), only an upper limit of Bol3 could be calculated. The different gel mobility of purified and mitochondrial Bol1 and Grx5 is explained by a His-tag on purified proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16673.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16673.028</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16673-resp-fig2-v3"/></fig></p><p> <italic>3) The relationship between the yeast and human sections of the manuscript is not so clear.</italic></p><p> <italic>What is the sequence relationship between the yeast mBols and the human BOLAs?

But this is not at all clear as one is reading through the manuscript. It would be very helpful to the reader if this be addressed directly up front at the beginning of the manuscript.

As suggested, we have rewritten part of our Introduction (second paragraph) to better explain the various BOLA protein family members. We also added a cartoon (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) to highlight the specific sequence features of the prokaryotic and various eukaryotic BOLA family members. We thank the reviewers for pointing out this didactic short-coming.</p></body></sub-article></article>
