However, kinetochore components and cellular phenotypes associated with kinetochore dysfunction are much less explored in plants. Here, we carried out a comprehensive characterization of conserved kinetochore components in the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> and uncovered a distinct scenario in plant cells regarding both the localization and cellular impact of the kinetochore proteins. Most surprisingly, knock-down of several kinetochore proteins led to polyploidy, not aneuploidy, through cytokinesis failure in &gt;90% of the cells that exhibited lagging chromosomes for several minutes or longer. The resultant cells, containing two or more nuclei, proceeded to the next cell cycle and eventually developed into polyploid plants. As lagging chromosomes have been observed in various plant species in the wild, our observation raised a possibility that they could be one of the natural pathways to polyploidy in plants.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43652.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants and animals, like all living things, are made of self-contained units called cells that are able to grow and multiply as required. Each cell contains structures called chromosomes that provide the genetic instructions needed to perform every task in the cell. When a cell is preparing to divide to make two identical daughter cells – a process called mitosis – it first needs to duplicate its chromosomes and separate them into two equal-sized sets. This process is carried out by complex cell machinery known as the spindle.</p><p>Structures called kinetochores assemble on the chromosomes to attach them to the spindle. Previous studies in animal cells have shown that, if the kinetochores do not work properly, one or more chromosomes may be left behind when the spindle operates. These ‘lagging’ chromosomes may ultimately land up in the wrong daughter cell, resulting in one of the cells having more chromosomes than the other. This can lead to cancer or other serious diseases in animals. However, it was not known what happens in plant cells when kinetochores fail to work properly.</p><p>To address this question, Kozgunova et al. used a technique called RNA interference (or RNAi for short) to temporarily interrupt the production of kinetochores in the cells of a moss called <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>. Unexpectedly, the experiments found that most of the moss cells with lagging chromosomes were unable to divide. Instead, they remained as single cells that had twice the number of chromosomes as normal, a condition known as polyploidy. After the effects of the RNAi wore off, these polyploid moss cells were able to divide normally and were successfully grown into moss plants with a polyploid number of chromosomes.</p><p>Polyploidy is actually widespread in the plant kingdom, and it has major impacts on plant evolution. It is also known to increase the amount of food that crops produce. However, it is still unclear why polyploidy is so common in plants. By showing that errors in mitosis may also be able to double the number of chromosomes in plant cells, the findings of Kozgunova et al. provide new insights into plant evolution and, potentially, a method to increase polyploidy in crop plants in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic></kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>CCAN</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 17H06471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goshima</surname><given-names>Gohta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 17H01431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goshima</surname><given-names>Gohta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lagging chromosomes in anaphase inhibits cytokinesis in plant cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The kinetochore is a macromolecular complex that connects chromosomes to spindle microtubules and plays a central role in chromosome segregation. Kinetochore malfunction causes checkpoint-dependent mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and/or aneuploidy-inducing chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Potapova and Gorbsky, 2017</xref>). Most of our knowledge on kinetochore function and impact on genome stability is derived from animal and yeast studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Musacchio and Desai, 2017</xref>). Another major group of eukaryotes, plants, also possesses conserved kinetochore proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Hooff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamada and Goshima, 2017</xref>). Although the localization and loss-of-function phenotype of some plant kinetochore proteins have been reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caillaud et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Komaki and Schnittger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lermontova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sandmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Du and Dawe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ogura et al., 2004</xref>), the data are mostly obtained from fixed cells of specific tissues. No comprehensive picture of plant kinetochore protein dynamics and functions can be drawn as of yet. For example, 12 out of 16 components that form CCAN (<italic>c</italic>onstitutive <italic>c</italic>entromere <italic>a</italic>ssociated <italic>n</italic>etwork) in animal and yeast cells cannot be identified by homology searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Musacchio and Desai, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamada and Goshima, 2017</xref>). How the residual four putative CCAN subunits act in plants is also unknown.</p><p>The moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> is an emerging model system for plant cell biology. The majority of its tissues are in a haploid state, and, owing to an extremely high rate of homologous recombination, gene disruption and fluorescent protein tagging of endogenous genes are easy to obtain in the first generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cove et al., 2006</xref>). The homology search indicated that all the <italic>P. patens</italic> proteins identified as the homologue of human kinetochore components are conserved in the most popular model plant species <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamada and Goshima, 2017</xref>): therefore, the knowledge gained in <italic>P. patens</italic> would be largely applicable to flowering plants, including crop species. Another remarkable feature of <italic>P. patens</italic> is its regeneration ability; for example, differentiated gametophore leaf cells, when excised, are efficiently reprogrammed to become stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ishikawa et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, genome alteration even in a somatic cell can potentially spread through the population.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to comprehensively characterize conserved kinetochore proteins in a single-cell type, the <italic>P. patens</italic> caulonemal apical cell. We observed that many proteins displayed localization patterns distinct from their animal counterparts. Furthermore, kinetochore malfunction led to chromosome missegregation and microtubule disorganization in the phragmoplast, eventually resulting in cytokinesis failure and polyploidy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endogenous localization analysis of conserved kinetochore proteins in <italic>P. patens</italic></title><p>To observe the endogenous localization of putative kinetochore components, we inserted a fluorescent tag in-frame at the N- and/or C-terminus of 18 selected proteins, which contain at least one subunit per sub-complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Initially, we conducted C-terminal tagging since the success rate of homologous recombination is much higher than N-terminal tagging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>). For 10 proteins, function was unlikely perturbed by tagging, as the transgenic moss grew indistinguishably from wild-type, despite the single-copy protein being replaced with the tagged protein. For other proteins, the functionality of the tagged version could not be verified, since untagged paralogs are present in the genome. The C-terminal tagging line for CENP-S could not be obtained after two attempts, suggesting that tagging affected the protein’s function and thereby moss viability. The N-termini of CENP-S, CENP-O, and CENP-C were also tagged with Citrine. Among them, no paralogous protein could be identified for CENP-C; therefore, Citrine signals would precisely represent the endogenous localization. Exceptionally, histone H3-like CENP-A (CenH3) localization was determined by ectopic Citrine-CENP-A expression, as tagging likely perturbs its function.</p><p>Consistent with their sequence homology, many of the proteins were localized to the kinetochore at least transiently during the cell cycle. However, multiple proteins also showed unexpected localization (or disappearance) at certain cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>–7; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). Most surprising were CCAN protein dynamics: CENP-X, CENP-O and CENP-S did not show kinetochore enrichment at any stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>), whereas CENP-C also dissociated from the kinetochore transiently in the post-mitotic phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>−<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>).

We therefore quantified the duration of lagging chromosomes’ residence in the midzone between separating chromatids following anaphase onset. Interestingly, a minor delay of chromosomes in the midzone (&lt;4 min) never perturbed cytokinesis (100%, n = 9 for CENP-A, n = 4 for CENP-X and n = 3 for SKA1). By contrast, if we observed a longer delay of chromosome clearance from the midzone, even when only a single chromosome was detectable, cytokinesis defects occurred in 96% of the cells (n = 9, 14 and 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>−<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>During plant cytokinesis, a bipolar microtubule-based structure known as the phragmoplast is assembled between segregating chromatids.

The tagged proteins were expressed under their native promoter at the original chromosome locus; thus, fluorescent signals of most, if not all, proteins would represent the endogenous localization.</p><p>Overall, the behavior of outer subunits was largely consistent with their animal counterparts, suggesting that the mitotic function is also conserved. However, the timing of kinetochore enrichment differed from that of animal cells and even flowering plants (e.g. Arabidopsis, maize) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Du and Dawe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hori et al., 2003</xref>): for example, <italic>P. patens</italic> Ndc80 complex gradually accumulated at the kinetochore after NEBD, unlike Arabidopsis and maize, where it showed kinetochore enrichment throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Du and Dawe, 2007</xref>). More unexpected localizations were observed for inner CCAN subunits, namely CENP-C, CENP-O, CENP-S and CENP-X. For example, CENP-C disappeared from the centromeres shortly after mitotic exit. In animal cells, CENP-C has been suggested to act in cooperation with Mis18BP1/KNL2 to facilitate CENP-A deposition in late telophase and early G1 (2). Hence, the mechanism of CENP-A incorporation might have been modified in plants.</p><p>CENP-O, -S, or –X did not show kinetochore enrichment at any stage. CENP-X localization was unlikely an artifact of Citrine tagging, since the tagged protein rescued the RNAi phenotype. In human cells, 16 CCAN subunits, forming four sub-complexes, have been identified and shown to be critical for kinetochore assembly and function, not only in cells, but also in reconstitution systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weir et al., 2016</xref>). In plants, only four CCAN homologues have been identified through sequence homology search. It is therefore possible that less conserved CCAN subunits are present but could not be identified by the homology search. However, the complete lack of kinetochore localization for CENP-O, -S, -X suggests that plants have lost the entire kinetochore-enriched CCAN complex. Somewhat puzzlingly, CENP-X, despite its unusual localization, remained an essential factor for chromosome segregation in <italic>P. patens</italic>. In animals, it has been proposed that CENP-S and CENP-X form a complex and play an important role in outer kinetochore assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2009</xref>). It is an interesting target for further investigation if plant CENP-S/CENP-X preserves such a function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Chromosome missegregation causes polyploidization</title><p>We observed lagging chromosomes as well as cytokinesis failure after knocking down kinetochore components.

Furthermore, the cytokinesis phenotype frequently appeared in RNAi lines targeting other six kinetochore proteins, and only when lagging chromosomes were present. Based on these data, we propose that persistent lagging chromosomes cause cytokinesis failure. Lagging chromosomes might act as physical obstacles to perturb phragmoplast microtubule amplification and/or cell plate formation. Alternatively, persistent lagging chromosomes might produce an unknown signal or induce a certain cell state that inhibits phragmoplast expansion and/or cell plate formation in order to prevent chromosome damage, reminiscent of the NoCut pathway in animal cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Norden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amaral et al., 2016</xref>). We favor the latter model, as abnormal microtubule interdigitates were observed in the whole phragmoplast and not limited to the region proximal to the lagging chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Notably, in a recent study, cytokinesis in moss protonema cells could be completed despite longer microtubule overlaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Keijzer et al., 2017</xref>). It suggests that abnormal microtubule interdigitates represent the consequence of microtubule dynamics mis-regulation rather than the direct cause of cytokinesis failure.</p><p>Our data further suggest that, in <italic>P. patens</italic>, chromosome missegregation in a single cell could lead to the generation of polyploid plants. Could lagging chromosomes cause polyploidization through somatic cell lineage in wild-type plants? In our imaging of control moss cells, we could not find any lagging chromosome, since mitotic fidelity is very high in our culture conditions. Intriguingly, however, various mitotic abnormalities, including lagging chromosomes have been long observed in wild-type plants and crops, albeit at a low frequency and/or under harsh natural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Menéndez-Yuffá et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nichols, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kvitko et al., 2011</xref>). Those studies did not analyze the relationship between lagging chromosomes and cytokinesis integrity; we expect the presence of lagging chromosomes for a certain duration to similarly perturb cytokinesis as observed in our study of moss, since the cytokinesis process is highly conserved between bryophytes and angiosperms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smertenko et al., 2017</xref>). Genome sequencing suggests that <italic>P. patens</italic>, like many other plant species, experienced whole genome duplication at least once during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rensing et al., 2008</xref>). Polyploidization through spontaneous mitotic errors in somatic cells might have a greater impact on de novo formation of polyploid plants than previously anticipated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Moss culture and transformation</title><p>We generally followed protocols described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamada et al.

(2007)</xref> with the following modifications: sonicated moss was cultured for 6–7 days on the BCDAT plate, containing 5 µM β-estradiol for RNAi induction and 20 µg/ml G418 to prevent contamination. Collected cells were preserved in a fixative solution (2% formaldehyde, 25 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) for 30 min and washed three times with PME buffer (25 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM EGTA). Following fixation, cells were mounted on 0.1%PEI (polyethyleneimine)-coated glass slides and subsequently incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PME for 30 min and 0.2% driselase (Sigma-Aldrich) in PME for 30 min. Next, cells were washed twice in PME, twice in TBS-T buffer (125 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 0.05% Tween 20) and mounted in 10 µg/mL DAPI in TBS-T for observation. Images were acquired with the Olympus BX-51 fluorescence microscope equipped with ZEISS Axiocam 506 Color and controlled by ZEN software. Fluorescent intensity was measured with ImageJ. Cytoplasmic background was subtracted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Live-imaging microscopy</title><p>A glass-bottom dish (Mattek) inoculated with moss was prepared as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamada et al.

To observe RNAi lines, we added 5 µM β-estradiol to culture medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). For the high-magnification time-lapse microscopy, the Nikon Ti microscope (60 × 1.40 NA lens or 100 × 1.45 NA lens) equipped with the spinning-disk confocal unit CSU-X1 (Yokogawa) and an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera (ImagEM; Hamamatsu) was used. Images were acquired every 30 s for localization analysis and every 2 min for RNAi analysis. The microscope was controlled by the Micro-Manager software and the data was analyzed with ImageJ. The rescue lines for RNAi were observed using a fluorescence microscope (IX-83; Olympus) equipped with a Nipkow disk confocal unit (CSU-W1; Yokogawa Electric) controlled by Metamorph software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Single-cell isolation</title><p>Protonema tissue of <italic>P. patens</italic> was sonicated, diluted with BCD medium with 0.8% agar, and spread on cellophane-covered BCDAT plates that contain 5 µM estradiol to induce RNAi. After 5–6 days, small pieces of cellophane containing clusters of protonemal cells (each containing 3–20 cells) were cut with scissors and placed upside-down on a glass-bottom dish. Bi- or multi-nucleated cells were identified using Axio Zoom.v16. Single bi-nucleated cell (SKA1 RNAi line) or random cell (control GH line) was selected for isolation, and all other cells were ablated with a solid-state ultraviolet laser (355 nm) through a 20X objective lens (LD Plan-NEOFLUAR, NA 0.40; Zeiss) at a laser focus diameter of less than 1 µm using the laser pressure catapulting function of the PALM microdissection system (Zeiss). Irradiation was targeted to a position distantly located from the cell selected for isolation to minimize the irradiation effect. Note that visual distinction of multi-nucleated cells from those with slightly deformed nuclei is not easy in <italic>P. patens</italic>, since in multi-nucleated cells, the nuclei maintain very close association with each other, so that nuclear boundaries often overlap. We interpret that two of four regenerated protonemata had haploid DNA content due to our unintentional isolation of a single cell with a deformed nucleus rather than multi-nuclei. Next, a piece of cellophane with single isolated cell was transferred from the glass-bottom dish to estradiol-free medium (20 µg/ml G418 was supplied to prevent bacterial/fungal contamination). DAPI staining was performed 5–6 weeks later as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>Full-size amino acid sequences of the selected proteins were aligned using MAFFT ver. 7.043 and then revised manually with MacClade ver. 4.08 OSX.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Chromosome missegregation causes somatic polyploidization in plants&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript addresses the functions of kinetochore proteins in the moss <italic>P. patens</italic>. 18 putative kinetochore proteins in this moss were identified on the basis of their homology with known proteins from human, then tagged versions were localized to examine how they behaved over the cell cycle. Several candidate proteins localized to the kinetochores in <italic>P. patens</italic>. There are a few minor surprises: CENPC is not constitutive, the rest of the CCAN does not localize, and KNLI and SKA1 do localize to kinetochores. They then examine phenotypes of RNAi knockdowns for 3 proteins and find lagging chromosomes, and show that polyploid cells (i.e., diploid from haploid) cells arose from such lines. The authors propose that lagging chromosomes inhibit phragmoplast functions and cell plate assembly, then propose that similar delays of chromosome segregation could have been a mechanism for natural polyploidization during plant evolution.</p><p>Title: The title is overly broad and emphasizes the speculation about polyploidization (using the strong word &quot;causes&quot;) rather than the data in the paper, which is about one organism (not plants in general) and about the localization of some (not all) kinetochore proteins and the consequences of RNAi knockdowns for a few of these. Please revise the title to include <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> in the title, and emphasize the results in the paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear from the text why localization of Nnf1, Dsn1, Spc24, SKA3 was not examined. Why were CENPX and SKA1 chosen? Why avoid the obvious choices, i.e. CENPC, MIS12, and NDC80? The authors should provide some language and preferably data to show what happened with those traditional kinetochore proteins. It is extremely tenuous to use CENPX to support the CENPA results given that their CENPX-tagged version did not localize to kinetochores. It is very strange that they chose SKA1 as an outer kinetochore protein and not NDC80. It seems like something is being avoided here. Please list all the genes targeted by RNAi and whether all of them showed laggards and polyploidy, not just the select few that support their polyploidy claim.</p><p>2) Please address whether the chromosome lagging and the cytokinetic failure could be partly consequence of failed microtubule stabilization in the central spindle, rather than solely a phragmoplast problem. The phenotypes resemble phenotypes seen after treatment with microtubule drugs. It appears that the phragmoplast (with classical anti-parallel microtubule overlap in the midzone) does not form. The quality of the images and videos is not sufficient to determine the reason for the cytokinetic failure. For example, Video 6 shows lack of cell plate initiation in the SKA1 knockdown. It is possible that cell division fails due to the abnormal anaphase B spindle morphology? If kinetochore failures cause major changes in microtubule organization, perhaps this better explains why CENPX, wherever it functions, had the same basic phenotype as CENH3?</p><p>3) According to the localization data, kinetochore protein composition varies as cells progress through the cell cycle. It is not clear why the structure of the kinetochore or the stoichiometry of kinetochore proteins changes. Could it be an artifact of tagging? Only one position of the tag was tested. The localization pattern could change if the tag was used at the other end of the protein. Please address these points in the revision.</p><p>4) Regarding the RNAi knockdowns. Why this unlikely trio, CENPA, CENPX, and SKA1? In each of these cases, they find that severe lagging (greater than 12 min, but not less than 4 min) leads to restitution and reformation of diploid nuclei. The numbers are not large here and the phenotypes for each mutant are a little different. However, they make the point that in all cases, no matter what the origin, long-delayed lagging chromosomes led to cells with 2 nuclei and genome doubling (from haploid to diploid).</p><p>5) The idea that kinetochore defects can lead to polyploidy is appealing and that idea is largely presented as theory and not necessarily as fact (except in the title). However, the extrapolation of their results to angiosperms should be tempered. The 1938 McClintock paper is on ring chromosomes which form bridges following sister chromatid exchange (they are bridges, not laggards). It is inaccurate to cite this as evidence that as much as 8% of plant mitoses have errors, since these were special mutant lines. Likewise, they cite studies involving tissue culture (which is known to induce segregation errors), and old seeds, and plants from extreme environments. Please reword to say errors have been found in mutant lines and extreme environments (with citations) and might also occur in normal unperturbed tissues at some frequency. You don't need 8% to make the story. Polyploidy events occur over evolutionary timescales.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43652.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Title: The title is overly broad and emphasizes the speculation about polyploidization (using the strong word &quot;causes&quot;) rather than the data in the paper, which is about one organism (not plants in general) and about the localization of some (not all) kinetochore proteins and the consequences of RNAi knockdowns for a few of these.

Initially, we picked up at least one subunit per sub-complex as representatives (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplements 1-7). It is likely that other components of a sub-complex behave similarly, as they are strongly bound to each other. Consistent with this notion, we have shown the identical localisation pattern of Mis12 and Nnf1; Ndc80, Nuf2 and Spc25; SKA1 and SKA2 as members of the Mis12, Ndc80 and SKA complex, respectively (the Nnf1-Citrine data on Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 5B is a new addition to the revised manuscript). We have also provided a more detailed explanation in the text regarding our selection strategy for gene tagging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why were CENPX and SKA1 chosen?

However, since manuscript submission, we have also selected RNAi lines and performed time-lapse microscopy for CENP-C, Nnf1, KNL1 Ndc80, Nuf2, and borealin. The complete list, along with brief phenotype descriptions and accompanying notes, has been presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Representative image sequences of several new RNAi lines can be found in Video 5.</p><p>RNAi lines targeting 7 out of 10 genes frequently showed phenotypes similar to CENP-A/SKA1/CENP-X, namely chromosome missegregation, multi-nucleated cells, and/or cytokinesis failure (new data of CENP-C, Nnf1, KNL1 and Nuf2 are shown in Video 5). In the remaining Ndc80 and borealin RNAi lines, we have also observed multi-nucleated cells and cytokinesis failure, but the frequency of cytokinesis failure was low compared to other RNAi, possibly due to incomplete RNAi; therefore, we did not include this data in the manuscript. Finally, we could not obtain a Mis12 RNAi line with mitotic phenotypes even after multiple attempts (Nakaoka et al., 2012; two more unpublished attempts); RNAi lines cannot always be selected in our hands. In the case of Mis12, a small amount of protein might be sufficient to fulfil its functions, consequently giving rise to perceived RNAi resistance (this was the case for yeast Mis12; Goshima et al. EMBO J. 2003). More importantly, we did see the expected phenotypes of chromosome missegregation and cytokinesis failure for Nnf1, another member of the Mis12 complex.</p><p>Overall, the high probability of phenotype detection has reinforced our conclusion that chromosome missegregation underlies cytokinesis failure and polyploidization in <italic>P. patens</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please address whether the chromosome lagging and the cytokinetic failure could be partly consequence of failed microtubule stabilization in the central spindle, rather than solely a phragmoplast problem.

In 5 out of 7 control cells, we observed sharp microtubule overlaps in the phragmoplast (Figure 2E; Hiwatashi et al., 2008). Microtubules signals were also enriched in phragmoplast midzone of the RNAi cells; however, the overlap was fuzzy and less prominent compared to the control (n = 6 out of 6 SKA1 RNAi; 6 out of 6 CENP-A RNAi; 2 out of 7 control cells). These results suggest that lagging chromosomes affect microtubule organisation during telophase.</p><p>In this experiment, we noticed that microtubule overlaps are overall abnormal, irrespective of the proximity to the lagging chromosome, in the RNAi lines. This suggests that lagging chromosomes do not simply act as physical obstacles during cell plate deposition; instead, they produce a certain signal to prevent proper phragmoplast formation. This point has been discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this observation and bringing it to our attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) According to the localization data, kinetochore protein composition varies as cells progress through the cell cycle. It is not clear why the structure of the kinetochore or the stoichiometry of kinetochore proteins changes. Could it be an artifact of tagging? Only one position of the tag was tested. The localization pattern could change if the tag was used at the other end of the protein. Please address these points in the revision.</p></disp-quote><p>Endogenous N-terminal tagging is technically more challenging than C-terminal tagging in moss (Yamada et al., 2016). We therefore tagged Citrine or mCherry to the C-terminus of 18 genes that are very likely essential for moss’s viability (CENP-C, -X, Nnf1, Ndc80, Nuf2, borealin, Mis12, KNL1 and SKA1; essentiality is assumed by failure of KO selection as well as robust RNAi phenotype). Since the “replacement” lines grew indistinguishably from the wild-type, we naturally interpreted that the tagging did not perturb the protein function (note that protonemal tissue is haploid; hence, when no orthologues are present, no other endogenous gene is left in the replacement line).</p><p>We think that the localisation of the function-verified and tagged protein represents the endogenous localisation well; in fact, this is a standard approach in yeast, where homologous recombination has been routinely applied, and, more recently, in animal tissue culture cells, for which endogenous tagging becomes possible owing to CRISPR technology.</p><p>Nevertheless, we also selected both N- and C-terminal Citrine lines for CENP-C and CENP-O, and verified the identical localisation patterns (newly added Video 3). C-terminal tagging line of CENP-S and N-terminal tagging line of CENP-X could not be selected after two attempts, suggesting that, in those two cases, tagging perturbed protein function.</p><p>For CENP-O, KNL2 (Mis18BP1), Ndc80, Spc25, SKA2, BubR1 and Mps1 genes, the functionality of the Citrine tagging could not be confirmed, since there is an additional orthologue present in the genome.</p><p>We have summarised our attempts and data on Citrine/mCherry tagging in the Figure 1—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Regarding the RNAi knockdowns.
