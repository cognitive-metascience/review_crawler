This beat is caused by the interference between the quasi-sinusoidal electric organ discharges (EODs) of two fish that are in close proximity of one another and its frequency is equal to the difference between the two individual EOD frequencies. Weakly electric fish also emit communication signals called ‘chirps’ consisting of a transient increase in EOD frequency that occur on top of the background beat. Behavioral data shows that chirps can occur at any phase of the beat with uniform probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, a chirp with given duration and frequency increase can give rise to very different patterns of stimulation depending on the beat phase at which it occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marsat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walz et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Metzen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We previously found that the single neuron spiking activity of peripheral electrosensory afferents did not provide a phase invariant representation as these faithfully encoded the different stimulus waveforms resulting from the same chirp occurring at different phases of the beat. However, when instead considering population activity, we found that correlations between afferent spike trains systematically increased in response to the chirp irrespective of beat phase, thereby providing a phase invariant representation. Recordings from pyramidal cells within the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) receiving synaptic input from multiple peripheral afferents showed that their responses were ‘locally’ phase invariant (i.e. they gave similar responses only to stimulus waveforms resulting from a given chirp occurring at some but not all beat phases). Recordings from neurons within the midbrain Torus semicircularis (TS) revealed the emergence of a more ‘globally’ phase invariant representation as these responded to the different stimulus waveforms resulting from the same chirp occurring at different beat phases through similar increases in firing rate. Finally, we showed that weakly electric fish gave similar behavioral responses to patterns of stimulation resulting from the same chirp occurring at different beat phases, suggesting that the globally phase invariant representation of chirps in midbrain is decoded and further refined downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Metzen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that our previous results were obtained using only a low background beat frequency that was not varied. However, behavioral data shows that chirps are emitted on top of beats with frequencies spanning a wide range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zakon et al., 2002</xref>), which gives rise to further heterogeneities in the resulting stimulus waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zupanc and Maler, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we investigated the effects of varying the background beat frequency on phase invariant coding and perception of chirp stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded from peripheral receptor afferents and measured behavioral responses at the organismal level to stimulus waveforms resulting from a chirp with given frequency excursion and duration occurring at different phases within a background with different frequencies. In the absence of communication signals (i.e. when both EOD frequencies are constant), interference between the emitter and receiver fish’s EODs gives rise to a sinusoidal amplitude modulation (i.e. the beat) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Natural communication signals (i.e. chirps) occur during social encounters in which the emitter fish sends the signal to the receiver fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As mentioned above, the chirp consists of one fish increasing its EOD frequency for a short duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top red/green trace), which, when considering the resulting stimulus sensed by the receiver fish, consists of a transient perturbation of the underlying beat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, black bottom trace). Because a chirp with a given EOD frequency time course (i.e. duration and frequency excursion) can occur with uniform probability at all phases of the beat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</xref>) as well as different beat frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zakon et al., 2002</xref>), the resulting stimulus waveforms display significant heterogeneities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Metzen et al., 2016</xref>). It is important to note that chirp stimulus waveforms are more similar to the background itself for higher beat frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, compare columns). This is because the ‘frequency contrast’ between the beat and the chirp is then lower, which makes differentiating chirp signals from the background beat more difficult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Despite this decrease in detectability, it is important to notice that the stimulus waveforms resulting from the same chirp occurring at different beat phases remain equally different from one another irrespective of background beat frequency, as quantified by the average distance between all possible combinations of chirp signals at a given beat frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24482.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A chirp with given duration and frequency excursion gives rise to heterogeneous waveforms depending on time of occurrence within the beat cycle as well as beat frequency.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two weakly electric fish with their electric organ discharges (EODs) in red and blue.

Such phase locking results from the fact that afferents display high-pass filtering properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastian, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chacron et al., 2005</xref>). As such, background beats with higher frequencies will elicit greater modulations in firing rate around the baseline (i.e. in the absence of stimulation) value, thereby increasing the probability of rectification (i.e. cessation of firing). Indeed, the range of stimulus phases during which the firing rate is null increases with beat frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, compare blue traces). It is these periods during which there is complete cessation of firing that decrease the distance between responses to chirps occurring at different beat phases, thereby slightly increasing the invariance score for higher (&gt;32 Hz) beat frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, blue).</p><p>When instead considering detectability, we found that single afferent responses to the chirp are as variable as the responses to the beat itself for all beat frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, blue). This is not surprising given the results above showing that the relative distance between chirp stimulus waveforms remain constant across beat frequencies. However, the modulations in firing rate caused by the chirp and the background beat were similar irrespective of beat frequency. Consequently, detectability of chirps as quantified from single afferent activity was low for all beat frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, blue).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Correlated afferent activity is only phase invariant and a good detector of chirp occurrence for low beat frequencies</title><p>We next investigated the effects of varying background beat frequency on afferent responses at the population level. To do so, we quantified pairwise correlations between afferent activities as a function of time during the beat and the chirp as done previously (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Metzen et al., 2016</xref>). We found that the duration of the response to a chirp using correlated activity decreased as a function of increasing background beat frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, purple) and therefore used time windows whose duration matched those observed experimentally for correlated activity to quantify invariance using the same measure as done previously (see Materials and methods).</p><p>For low (&lt;16 Hz) background beat frequencies, we found that afferent spiking activity was synchronized either through large increases in firing rate or cessation of firing after chirp onset but not during the beat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, there was an increase in correlation after chirp onset irrespective of the beat phase the chirp occurred at for low background beat frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, purple traces), consistent with our previous results. For higher background beat frequencies (&gt;32 Hz), afferent activity was still synchronized either through large increases in firing rate or cessation of firing after chirp onset. However, afferents also displayed strong phase locking as mentioned above, thereby causing increased synchrony through cessation of firing during the beat itself at the population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Thus, afferent activities became more correlated with one another only for some portions of the beat cycle (i.e. those for which there is cessation of firing) as the beat frequency is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, purple traces). This phase dependency had two effects. First, we found that correlated activity no longer provided a phase invariant representation of chirp stimuli for higher beat frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, purple). Indeed, correlations between responses to the chirp then became more alike to those found during the beat, which is expected as the corresponding stimulus waveforms are more similar to one another. The before mentioned phase dependency of correlated activity during the beat is then ‘inherited’ when considering responses to chirps, causing dissimilarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, purple). Consequently, we found that invariance values strongly decreased as background beat frequency increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, purple). We therefor conclude that phase locking in single afferent responses is strongly detrimental to phase invariant coding by correlated activity.</p><p>Second, the phase dependency of correlated activity during the background beat also had a strong effect on response detectability to chirps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, purple). Specifically, correlated activity during the beat became more similar to those elicited by the chirp as background beat frequency is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, purple), thereby decreasing detectability by correlated activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, purple).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Correlated afferent activity is a good predictor of behavior when considering both phase invariance and detectability for all beat frequencies</title><p>So far, we have shown that the increased phase locking in afferents observed for higher background beat frequencies has strong detrimental effects on detectability and phase invariant coding of chirps by correlated afferent activity. Thus, if correlated afferent activity is indeed used by downstream neurons in order to give rise to perception, then we should find that behavioral responses to chirps for higher background beat frequencies should: (1) no longer be invariant and; (2) be less likely to occur reflecting lower detectability.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, we recorded behavioral responses to patterns of stimulation resulting from the same chirp occurring at different phases within a beat cycle with different frequencies (N = 33 fish; n = 3467 chirps) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) using a previously established behavioral paradigm that measures echo chirp responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zupanc et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Metzen et al., 2016</xref>) (see Materials and methods). We found that the characteristics (i.e. frequency excursion and duration) of the chirps elicited for different background beat frequencies were not significantly different from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Confirming hypothesis 1), we found that echo responses were more dissimilar to one another for high beat frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Consequently, there was a strong decrease in behavioral invariance at background beat frequencies &gt;32 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, brown). Further evidence strongly suggesting that correlated afferent activity is decoded by downstream neurons comes from a good match between invariance scores obtained from correlated activity and behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, compare brown and purple). In contrast, there was a poor match between invariance as computed by single afferent activity and behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, compare brown and blue). In order to quantify detectability, we computed the echo response rate as a function of background beat frequency. We found that there was a strong decrease in echo response rate as a function of increasing background beat frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, brown), thereby confirming hypothesis 2).

As the signal-background frequency contrast decreased by increasing background beat frequency, we found that responses to the signal became more similar to those of the background, thereby decreasing signal detectability at the population level of peripheral afferents. We also found that single afferents tended to display phase locking as the background beat frequency increased due to their high-pass tuning properties. Such phase locking caused afferent responses to be more identical to one another during some portions of the background beat cycle, thereby causing correlations to vary widely throughout. As a consequence of phase locking and that responses to the chirp signal are more similar to those to the beat background, increasing background beat frequency decreased phase invariant coding by correlated afferent activity. These changes in neural responses were accompanied by similar changes in behavioral responses at the organismal level. Indeed, not only did detectability decrease, but behavioral responses (i.e. perception) were also no longer phase invariant for high background beat frequencies. Overall, we found that correlated afferent activity was a good predictor of behavioral performance, thereby providing further evidence supporting the hypothesis that correlated activity is decoded by higher brain centers in order to give rise to behavior. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the changes in behavior were due to another computation being performed in the electrosensory brain. Further studies recording from higher brain areas in response to small chirps occurring on top of higher beat frequencies are needed to investigate whether there is a causal link between correlated peripheral afferent activity and behavioral responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Effects of signal background on coding of small chirps</title><p>Our results provide novel explanations for previous observations. Specifically, it is well known that the small chirp stimuli considered here occur preferentially on top of low frequency beat backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engler and Zupanc, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zakon et al., 2002</xref>). Although it is clear that the frequency contrast between the background beat and small chirps decreases as the background beat frequency increases, previous studies have mostly considered the consequences on single neuron activity both at the periphery and more centrally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marsat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walz et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we have shown that it is not single peripheral afferent activity that can accurately predict behavioral responses but rather correlations between the spiking activities of multiple afferents. We have also shown that the decreased signal detectability was due to the greater tendency of peripheral afferents to display phase locking to higher background beat frequencies, which is a direct consequence of their high-pass frequency tuning characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastian, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chacron et al., 2005</xref>). Such phase locking causes increased correlations among afferents during some portions of the background beat for which both afferents do not fire action potentials. This greater variability in correlation throughout the beat cycle then decreases signal detectability. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that small chirps occur more rarely on top of beats with higher frequencies because such chirps cannot be encoded and perceived irrespective of the beat phase at which they occur. Alternatively, it is also possible that mechanisms enabling phase invariant coding and perception of small chirps occurring on top of high frequency beats did not evolve because such stimuli occur relatively infrequently in the first place. Further studies are needed to test which hypothesis is correct.</p><p>Previous studies have also shown that small chirps are preferentially elicited when both fish are located farther away from one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hupé and Lewis, 2008</xref>). Indeed, such stimuli seldom occur when both fish are in close vicinity (e.g. biting distance). Our results also provide an explanation for this behavioral observation. In this context, it is important to realize that the background beat contrast (i.e., how strong the beat amplitude is relative to each animal’s unmodulated electric field amplitude) increases as distance between both fish decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fotowat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Metzen and Chacron, 2014</xref>) and there is a lot of interest in understanding how the time-varying beat amplitude is encoded by electrosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Savard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGillivray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Metzen and Chacron, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Metzen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang and Chacron, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang and Chacron, 2016</xref>). In particular, previous studies have found that peripheral afferents will display phase locking in response to low beat frequencies when the beat amplitude is high enough, such as when both animals are right next to one another but not when located further apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nelson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kreiman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Metzen and Chacron, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2015</xref>). Thus, while the beat amplitudes used in this study are in agreement with those experienced when both fish are located further apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Metzen and Chacron, 2014</xref>) such that peripheral afferents did not display significant phase locking, it is clear that these same afferents will do so at low-frequency beat backgrounds at higher amplitudes. We predict that such phase locking will be detrimental not only on signal detectability but also on phase invariant coding for the same reasons that we found for higher background beat frequencies. If such predictions are correct, then they would provide an explanation as to why small chirps are preferentially emitted when the animals are located some distance away from one another. Further studies are needed to verify this interesting prediction and are beyond the scope of the current advance that focused on varying the background beat frequency.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for other systems</title><p>It is likely that our results will have implications for other systems and species.

Moreover, correlations between the activities of neighboring neurons are observed ubiquitously in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>) and are dynamically regulated by several factors such as attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</xref>), behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaadia et al., 1995</xref>) and stimulus statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chacron and Bastian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Litwin-Kumar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ponce-Alvarez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simmonds and Chacron, 2015</xref>).

Small chirps are characterized as a short duration (10–20 ms) increase in EOD frequency of about 60–150 Hz and can thus be considered ‘high-frequency transients’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zupanc and Maler, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engler and Zupanc, 2001</xref>); see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walz et al.

We quantified the non-linear responses of each afferent to the beat frequency by assessing a phase locking index that determines the probability of rectification by calculating the ratio of bins of the corresponding phase histogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Massot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGillivray et al., 2012</xref>) that fall below a given threshold compared to the overall bins of the phase histogram. The threshold was set to be 0.05% of the mean spike count of a given phase histogram. A low value indicates a low amount of phase locking (i.e. spikes are distributed across all beat phases), whereas a high value indicates that spikes occur at a preferred phase within the beat cycle (i.e. a value of one means that all spikes occur at the same phase). We note that other measures such as vector strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mardia and Jupp, 1999</xref>) can be nonzero even when the sinusoidal stimulus elicits sinusoidal modulations in firing rate around the baseline value: a situation that does not elicit phase locking according to our definition because spiking occurs throughout the stimulus cycle as there is then a linear relationship between the stimulus and the firing rate response.

Qualitatively similar invariance scores were obtained when using window sizes obtained from the response duration of correlated activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, compare filled and hollow circles). We computed phase invariance for correlated activity as described for the single neuron responses except that we used the time course of the varying spike count correlation as an input and a time window whose size was computed from a power-law fit through the response duration of the correlated activity to chirps at different beat frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, purple). This was done to ensure that only the response to the chirp was accounted for in the calculation, as including the response to the beat stimulus itself decreases invariance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Metzen et al., 2016</xref>). We note that changing the size of the analysis window based on beat frequency is not physiologically unrealistic, as previous studies have shown that the integration time window of sensory neurons can change based on stimulus attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reid et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bair and Movshon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prescott and De Koninck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Assisi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Butts et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ratté et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese (Reviewer #3), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce A Carlson (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript is an advance on Metzen et al., 2016 in which the authors showed that correlations between the activities of peripheral afferents mediate a phase invariant representation of natural communication stimuli (chirps) that is refined across successive processing stages thereby leading to perception and behavior in the weakly electric fish <italic>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</italic>. In this advance, they explore how the phase invariance of neuronal responses and behavior to chirps is affected by background beat frequency determined by the difference in EOD frequency of two fish exhibiting steady EOD. The frequency contrast between the background beat and chirps decreases as the background beat frequency increases, but in contrast to previous studies that have focused on single neuron activity in afferents, in this study the authors show that it is correlations between the spiking activities of multiple afferents that determine behavioral responses. They show that the decreased signal detectability is due to the greater tendency of peripheral afferents to display phase locking to higher background beat frequencies, (a direct consequence of their high-pass frequency tuning characteristics). Such phase locking causes increased correlations among afferents during some portions of the background beat for which both afferents do not fire action potentials. This greater variability in correlation throughout the beat cycle then decreases signal detectability. The advance is well written and clearly illustrated, and it significantly extends the previous finding and gives new behavior relevance to afferent correlations, while explaining deterioration of behavioral responses with high frequency beat backgrounds.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are some concerns in the detailed review of reviewer #1 (below) that must be addressed in revision. The most important are the technical points:</p><p>1) The measure of phase-locking (subsection “Electrophysiology”), which is based on a binary threshold decision.</p><p>2) The use of a sliding window for measuring correlations (subsection “Correlation between the spiking activities of electrosensory afferents”).</p><p>Moreover, there was a general concern among the reviewers about the major conclusion. The importance of correlation for invariant coding was demonstrated in the previous publication. The new result here is that the phase invariant coding breaks downs for high frequency beats. The fact that it breaks down at high frequency beats for both the afferent correlation coding and behavioral responses does strengthen the central claim of the first paper that correlated afferent firing mediates perception of the chirps. However, once behavior breaks down, we do not know whether it was because it relied on correlations or some other computation. Thus, the conclusion should be tempered by this caveat.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors build on their recent finding of invariant coding of chirps with respect to chirp phase based on primary afferent correlations to address whether this coding of chirps is also invariant with respect to background frequency. They find that primary afferent correlations invariantly code for chirps only at relatively low background frequencies, and that this correlates with behavioral responses to chirps. This strengthens their previous conclusion that chirp perception is mediated by primary afferent correlations. This finding also meshes well with previous studies showing that chirps are more frequently produced on low-frequency, low-intensity backgrounds. This is a nice follow-up to the previous work, though I do have some concerns with the methods and conclusions.</p><p>1) The authors do a nice job of relating their findings to previous observations that chirps occur more frequently on lower baseline frequencies. However, I take issue with the authors' interpretation of cause and effect. They suggest that the inability to accurately encode chirps is the reason why the fish don't produce chirps at high baseline frequencies. It could be the exact opposite. If chirps don't occur on top of high-frequency beats, then why bother encoding them? I don't think the authors can conclude either way whether constraints of the sensory system are driving the behavior, or that behaviorally relevant signals are driving properties of the sensory system.</p><p>2) Related, do chirps vary quantitatively with baseline frequency? E.g. they may happen less frequently at high baseline frequencies, but do such chirps tend to involve higher frequency excursions? If so, then the use of a constant frequency change across baseline frequencies may not be a &quot;natural stimulus.&quot; Whether or not chirps vary with baseline, it seems inaccurate to refer to all of these stimuli as &quot;natural&quot; if some of them tend not to occur naturally.</p><p>3) Subsection “Implications for other systems”: It is good to link the findings of this study to other sensory systems and taxonomic groups to make the case for general principles. However, it seems that these are fundamentally different kinds of invariance problems to solve. Detecting a chirp irrespective of background frequency or phase is different from detecting frequency irrespective of amplitude, or odor identity irrespective of concentration. The latter have nothing to do with &quot;background.&quot; &quot;Invariance&quot; is being treated here as though it were a measurable physical thing, when really it is context-dependent and can refer to any kind of physical thing. The mechanisms for invariant coding are likewise likely to be context- and stimulus-dependent. This does not mean the findings do not have broad relevance, simply that they need to avoid implying that this is <italic>the</italic> solution to invariance.</p><p>4) Subsection “Implications for other systems”: Do <italic>not</italic> refer to animal species as higher or lower. This is simply not how evolution works. Further, if mammalian nervous systems can solve the problem, then so can fishy ones. It seems more likely that either: (i) these signals (chirp on high-frequency beat) are not behaviorally relevant, so there is no need to solve the problem, or (ii) that the problem of invariance being solved by these fish is a fundamentally different invariance problem from that solved by the other examples given.</p><p>5) I have concerns about the measure of phase-locking (subsection “Electrophysiology”). It is based on a binary threshold decision. Why is it done this way as opposed to a more standard, linear measure of vector strength (e.g. Goldberg and Brown 1969)? Your measure seems to nonlinearly exaggerate differences in the degree of phase-locking. Indeed, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, you can clearly see phase-locking across all 3 stimuli (though different in degree), but the metric used gives you values = 0 at all frequencies &lt;10 Hz in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>. This is not a crucial metric for the conclusions reached, but it is somewhat perplexing why it is used.</p><p>6) I have concerns about the use of a sliding window for measuring correlations (subsection “Correlation between the spiking activities of electrosensory afferents”). If the window gets shorter as baseline frequency gets higher, then correlations might decrease artefactually due to both sampling fewer spikes and increasing the temporal precision needed for a correlation. A similar concern arises in the measurement of invariance across baseline frequencies, for which a window that varies with beat frequency is also used (subsection “Quantifying neural response invariance”). Regardless of this methodological issue, it's not clear how these variably sized windows are physiologically relevant. The integration time window of postsynaptic neurons that would detect these correlations should not change with beat frequency.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24482.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>There are some concerns in the detailed review of reviewer #1 (attached) that must be addressed in revision.

I don't think the authors can conclude either way whether constraints of the sensory system are driving the behavior, or that behaviorally relevant signals are driving properties of the sensory system.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment and have rephrased to mention that our results support the hypothesis that small chirps occur more rarely on top of beats with higher frequencies because they then cannot be encoded and perceived in a phase invariant manner. We also mention that it is also possible that small chirp stimuli on top of high frequency beats are not behaviorally relevant because they occur relatively infrequently in the first place.</p><p><italic>2) Related, do chirps vary quantitatively with baseline frequency? E.g. they may happen less frequently at high baseline frequencies, but do such chirps tend to involve higher frequency excursions? If so, then the use of a constant frequency change across baseline frequencies may not be a &quot;natural stimulus.&quot; Whether or not chirps vary with baseline, it seems inaccurate to refer to all of these stimuli as &quot;natural&quot; if some of them tend not to occur naturally.</italic> </p><p>In order to address this concern, we have performed additional analysis of the characteristics (i.e., duration and frequency excursion) of emitted chirps. The distribution of both measures obtained using different beat frequencies were not significantly different from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is now mentioned in the Results.</p><p><italic>3) Subsection “Implications for other systems”: It is good to link the findings of this study to other sensory systems and taxonomic groups to make the case for general principles. However, it seems that these are fundamentally different kinds of invariance problems to solve. Detecting a chirp irrespective of background frequency or phase is different from detecting frequency irrespective of amplitude, or odor identity irrespective of concentration. The latter have nothing to do with &quot;background.&quot; &quot;Invariance&quot; is being treated here as though it were a measurable physical thing, when really it is context-dependent and can refer to any kind of physical thing. The mechanisms for invariant coding are likewise likely to be context- and stimulus-dependent. This does not mean the findings do not have broad relevance, simply that they need to avoid implying that this is the solution to invariance.</italic> </p><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern and have rewritten accordingly.</p><p><italic>4) Subsection “Implications for other systems”: Do not refer to animal species as higher or lower. This is simply not how evolution works. Further, if mammalian nervous systems can solve the problem, then so can fishy ones. It seems more likely that either: (i) these signals (chirp on high-frequency beat) are not behaviorally relevant, so there is no need to solve the problem, or (ii) that the problem of invariance being solved by these fish is a fundamentally different invariance problem from that solved by the other examples given.</italic> </p><p>We have rewritten accordingly.</p><p><italic>5) I have concerns about the measure of phase-locking (subsection “Electrophysiology”). It is based on a binary threshold decision. Why is it done this way as opposed to a more standard, linear measure of vector strength (e.g. Goldberg and Brown 1969)? Your measure seems to nonlinearly exaggerate differences in the degree of phase-locking. Indeed, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, you can clearly see phase-locking across all 3 stimuli (though different in degree), but the metric used gives you values = 0 at all frequencies &lt;10 Hz in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>. This is not a crucial metric for the conclusions reached, but it is somewhat perplexing why it is used.</italic> </p><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern and now more clearly explain what we mean by phase locking. Specifically, we define as phase locking the tendency of neurons to fire action potentials reliably only during some range of phases of the sinusoidal stimulus cycle (see e.g. Keener et al., 1981; Trussell, 1999). As such, phase locking is a nonlinear phenomenon. Moreover, neurons that reliably display nonlinear rectification (i.e., are driven into cessation of firing) at some stimulus phases must then reliably fire action potentials at other stimulus phases must also display phase locking (see e.g. McGillivray et al. 2012). We thus used an index that quantifies the tendency of afferents to display rectification (i.e., complete cessation of firing) during some portions of the stimulus cycle. We note that measures like the vector strength will not capture such nonlinearities in general as they can be non-zero even when the sinusoidal stimulus elicits sinusoidal modulations in firing rate: a situation for which there is a linear relationship between stimulus and response. This explanation has been added to the Results and Methods.</p><p><italic>6) I have concerns about the use of a sliding window for measuring correlations (subsection “Correlation between the spiking activities of electrosensory afferents”). If the window gets shorter as baseline frequency gets higher, then correlations might decrease artefactually due to both sampling fewer spikes and increasing the temporal precision needed for a correlation. A similar concern arises in the measurement of invariance across baseline frequencies, for which a window that varies with beat frequency is also used (subsection “Quantifying neural response invariance”). Regardless of this methodological issue, it's not clear how these variably sized windows are physiologically relevant. The integration time window of postsynaptic neurons that would detect these correlations should not change with beat frequency.</italic> </p><p>We understand the reviewer’s concerns. To address the first concern that correlations might decrease due to sampling of fewer spikes and increasing the temporal precision needed for a correlation, we now plot the un-normalized correlation coefficients in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and note that correlations actually reach higher values for higher beat frequencies than for lower beat frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, compare dark and light purple curves). To address the second concern, we note that the lengths of the time windows were chosen based on our experimental data showing that the chirp response duration decreases with increasing beat frequency for both single neuron and correlated activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This was done in order to ensure that the invariance scores computed only reflect responses to chirp rather than include the response to the beat, which can decrease invariance as shown in our previous publication (Metzen et al. (2016); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Finally, to address the last concern about the physiological relevance of changing the analysis time window with beat frequency, we note that previous work has shown that the integration time window of sensory neurons can change based on stimulus attributes (Reid et al., 1992; Bair and Movshon, 2004; Prescott and De Koninck, 2005; Assisi et al., 2007; Butts et al., 2007; Ratté et al., 2013). It is also conceivable that information carried by afferent populations could be decoded by separate populations of hindbrain and midbrain neurons with different integration time windows. These arguments have been added to the Methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
