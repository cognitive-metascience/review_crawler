responsiveness. The molecular mechanisms responsible for NK cell education remain unclear. Here, we show that mouse NK cell education is associated with a higher basal activity of the mTOR/Akt pathway, commensurate to the number of educating receptors. This higher activity was dependent on the SHP-1 phosphatase and essential for the improved responsiveness of reactive NK cells. Upon stimulation, the mTOR/Akt pathway amplified signaling through activating NK cell receptors by enhancing calcium flux and LFA-1 integrin activation. Pharmacological inhibition of mTOR resulted in a proportional decrease in NK cell reactivity. Reciprocally, acute cytokine stimulation restored reactivity of hyporesponsive NK cells through mTOR activation. These results demonstrate that mTOR acts as a molecular rheostat of NK cell reactivity controlled by educating receptors and uncover how cytokine stimulation overcomes NK cell education.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26423.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells of the immune system patrol the body to detect and destroy harmful microbes and diseased cells.

However, given that mTOR plays numerous roles within different body cells, any potential therapies that are developed would need to be able to manipulate mTOR specifically in natural killer cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>natural killer</kwd><kwd>cell signaling</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>education</kwd><kwd>activation threshold</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE15-0005-01 Bank</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marçais</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>281025 Dironaki</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walzer</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chronic engagement of Natural killer cell inhibitory receptors by MHC-I molecules maintains a high activity of the mTOR pathway allowing subsequent amplification of signaling through activating receptors upon acute stimulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural killer (NK) cells are group 1 innate lymphoid cells characterized by their ability to kill target cells and to secrete cytokines such as IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spits et al., 2013</xref>). Thereby, they take part in the early response against infected and neoplastic cells. Target cell recognition and NK cell activation are controlled by the balance between positive and negative signals arising from the engagement of an array of NK activating receptors (NKar) and NK inhibitory receptors (NKir). While normal cells express an excess of NKir ligands, stressed cells, such as tumor and infected cells, may lose expression of NKir ligands (‘missing-self’) or acquire expression of NKar ligands (‘modified-self’), thus tilting the balance towards activation. NKirs, which mostly recognize classical or non-classical MHC-I molecules, are stochastically expressed, resulting in a variegated expression pattern. Depending on the species, three types of NKir interact with MHC-I: Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR) in primates, Ly49 receptors of the lectin-like family in rodents and the heterodimer formed by CD94 and NKG2A in these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vivier et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In addition, considerable functional heterogeneity is observed in the NK cell population. Such cell intrinsic differences led to the proposition that NK cell reactivity and consequently their ability to discriminate self from non-self is the result of an education process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anfossi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). There was however considerable debate over the molecular process leading to education. Two theories were crafted to account for these observations: the first one proposing that a priming (or arming) signal was required to confer reactivity to otherwise hyporesponsive cells, the second positing that responsiveness is a default state that is lost upon unopposed chronic stimulation of NKar (disarming) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Höglund and Brodin, 2010</xref>). The data accumulated so far are in favor of the latter model, suggesting that intrinsic reactivity is lost upon chronic engagement of NKar unless this is opposed by concomitant engagement of NKir. Indeed, there is no evidence so far that priming signals are a prerequisite for acquisition of responsiveness. In contrast, disarming is the simplest explanation to account for the tolerance to self of NK cells raised in a mosaic or chimeric environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johansson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu and Raulet, 1997</xref>). Moreover, the loss of reactivity consequent to exposure of NK cells to activating ligands functionally demonstrates the possibility to disarm reactive NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oppenheim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tripathy et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>At the molecular level, physical interaction between NKirs and their ligands is required to maintain responsiveness as (1) only NK cells expressing NKir engaged by MHC-I at the surface of surrounding cells are reactive and as (2) NK cells expressing NKirs but developing in MHC-I deficient humans or animals are functionally impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zimmer et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, the inhibitory signaling module acting downstream of NKirs is required to maintain reactivity. Indeed, mutation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based motifs (ITIM) of inhibitory Ly49 molecules or deficiency in the phosphatase SHP-1, recruited to NKirs upon ligation, decreases responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Viant et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibition of the activating signal by NKir thus serves two-distinct but related purposes: it counters inappropriate NK cell activation and it prevents the desensitization induced by chronic stimulation thereby preserving NK cell reactivity. In inbred C57BL/6 mice, Ly49C (specific for H2-K<sup>b</sup>), Ly49I (specific for H2-K<sup>b</sup>) and the CD94/NKG2A receptor (specific for a D<sup>b</sup> peptide presented by Qa-1) have been shown to interact with substantial affinity with self-MHC class I molecules, while other receptors show no or marginal affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michaëlsson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vance et al., 1998</xref>). Consequently, NK cell populations expressing these receptors are educated in C57BL/6 mice, that is, they are more reactive than their non-educated counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joncker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). Education is a dynamic process tuned by the number of engaged NKirs and the strength of each interaction in a rheostat-like manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodin et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joncker et al., 2009</xref>). It is also reversible in as little as one or two days as shown in different experimental set-ups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ebihara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elliott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joncker et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests the existence of a potent cellular process integrating activating and inhibitory educating signals of variable strength (i.e. the strength of the NKar or NKir-ligand interaction and number of different interactions over time) and controlling the display of effector functions in response to NKar stimulation.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that reactive NK cells are characterized by stronger calcium flux and LFA-1 integrin activation upon NKar stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomas et al., 2013</xref>). However, the nature of the molecular process conditioning NK cell reactivity and negatively affected by chronic engagement of NKar is unknown. To address this question, we systematically compared phosphorylation levels of key molecules involved in immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM) signaling in reactive vs. hyporesponsive NK cells at steady-state and following NKar stimulation. We discovered that NK cell reactivity is associated with a higher basal activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Our genetic and pharmacological approaches collectively demonstrate a prominent role of mTOR signaling in controlling steady-state NK cell responsiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reactive NK cells display higher activity of the Akt/mTOR pathway at steady-state and following acute NKar engagement</title><p>Seeking to identify molecular pathways involved in NK cell education, we systematically screened the basal levels of 20 phosphorylations on 16 proteins involved in ITAM signaling between reactive and hyporesponsive NK cells by flow cytometry (complete list in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This flow-cytometry based approach allowed us to combine the advantages of single-cell analysis and comparison of equivalent cell subset thanks to electronic gating. In C57BL/6 mice, the main educating NKirs are NKG2A and Ly49C, defining four subsets of which the double-negative display the lowest, the double-positive the highest and the single positives an intermediate responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joncker et al., 2009</xref>). We also analyzed <italic>B2m</italic><sup>−/−</sup> NK cells that are uniformly unreactive. Most of these phosphorylations are developmentally regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), thus, to exclude any developmental bias, we compared similar developmental stages defined by CD11b and CD27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Strikingly, all analyzed phosphorylations in the Akt/mTOR pathway correlated positively with the level of NK cell reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This was true when comparing C57BL/6 and <italic>B2m</italic><sup>−/−</sup> NK cells as well as reactive and unreactive populations in C57BL/6 mice, regardless of the maturation stage. In C57BL/6 populations, absence of either NKG2A or Ly49C had a measurable negative effect, the absence of both leading to further decrease in the phosphorylation level. We also noted a significant correlation between education status and the level of pNFκB S529 and S468 as well as pLck Y505 and pItk Y180 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, as the most consistent differences lied in the Akt/mTOR pathway, we decided to focus our analysis on this pathway.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26423.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Basal activity of the mTOR pathway is proportional to the level of NK cell reactivity, and dependent on SHP1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap representing the phosphorylation level of the phosphoepitopes indicated on the right in the different subsets of splenic resting NK cells indicated on top and gated as defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.

To test its involvement in the maintenance of the basal activity of the Akt/mTOR pathway, we measured the phosphorylation levels of the ribosomal S6 protein and Akt in NK cells deficient in <italic>Ptpn6</italic>, the gene encoding SHP-1. As a control, we also measured the level of phosphorylation of STAT5 in these cells. The basal activity of the Akt/mTOR pathway was specifically decreased in NK cells from <italic>Ncr1</italic><sup>iCre/+</sup> <italic>Ptpn6</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice compared to control NK cells while pSTAT5 levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, basal activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway is correlated with NK cell reactivity and controlled by SHP-1-dependent signaling downstream of NKirs.</p><p>We next compared mTOR-related signaling events arising from NKar stimulation in reactive versus hyporesponsive NK cells. To this end, we stimulated splenocytes from C57BL/6 (around 85% of NK cells are reactive in these mice) and <italic>B2m</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice by crosslinking NK1.1 and we measured phosphorylation events over time. Phosphorylation of Akt on T308 and S473 and phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 were induced at higher levels in reactive NK cells compared to hyporesponsive NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). By contrast, other signaling events not linked to the mTOR pathway were induced at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In summary, high activity of the Akt/mTOR pathway is a hallmark of reactive NK cells both at steady-state and following stimulation through NKars. Importantly, considering that education is not a discrete but rather a continuous process, absence of one or two of the educating NKir in C57BL/6 resulted in a commensurate loss in mTOR activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Chronic NK cell stimulation results in decreased phosphorylation of the Akt/mTOR pathway which parallels the loss of reactivity</title><p>Education is rapidly reverted by unopposed chronic stimulation. Indeed, transfer of reactive NK cells into a host devoid of MHC-I leads to their rapid loss of reactivity and to their tolerance to MHC-I negative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joncker et al., 2010</xref>). We thus sought to test whether chronic NKar stimulation decreased the activity of the Akt/mTOR pathway in parallel with the decrease of reactivity. To this purpose, we transferred reactive C57BL/6 NK cells into control C57BL/6 or <italic>B2m</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and measured basal Akt/mTOR phosphorylation levels and their reactivity 3 days after transfer. To quantify the intensity of NKar signaling, we took advantage of a transcriptional reporter of the TCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moran et al., 2011</xref>). This reporter consists of a GFP under the control of the promoter sequence of <italic>Nur77</italic>, an orphan nuclear receptor strongly induced in response to TCR stimulation. The signaling pathways triggered by TCR or NKar engagement mobilizing the same signaling adaptors, we reasoned that the <italic>Nur77</italic><sup>GFP</sup> construct might also report NKar triggering. Indeed, in vitro stimulation with an NK1.1 agonist antibody or YAC-1 cells, a lymphoblastic cell line detected as foreign by C57BL/6 NK cells, resulted in an increase in the GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, this increase was commensurate with reactivity so that higher GFP levels were reached in reactive NKG2A<sup>+</sup>Ly49C<sup>+</sup> NK cells, thus validating the expression of GFP as a reporter of NKar stimulation. Transfer of <italic>Nur77</italic><sup>GFP</sup> cells into <italic>B2m</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice resulted in a transient increase in the GFP level in the reactive subsets one day after transfer indicative of ongoing NKar signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, this was followed, 3 days after transfer, by a significant decrease in steady-state GFP level indicative of a loss of the cell capacity to signal following NKar stimulation.

However, mTOR deficiency leads to a severe NK cell developmental block that may confound the interpretation of the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marçais et al., 2014</xref>). To address this issue we took advantage of Torin2, a highly selective ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor targeting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). We stimulated mature NK cells from C57BL/6 and <italic>B2m</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice with plate-bound anti-NK1.1 in the presence or absence of the inhibitor. Torin2 significantly decreased the capacity of C57BL/6 NK cells to produce IFN-γ and to degranulate upon stimulation, regardless of the subset analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, treatment of C57BL/6 NK cells with Torin2 abrogated the differences between highly reactive (Ly49C<sup>+</sup>NKG2A<sup>+</sup>) and hyporesponsive (Ly49C<sup>-</sup>NKG2A<sup>-</sup>) cells. Treatment of hyporesponsive <italic>B2m</italic><sup>−/−</sup> NK cells led to a further decrease in their capacity to degranulate while their production of IFN-γ was unaffected.

Torin2 treated C57BL/6 NK cells thus functionally behaved like <italic>B2m</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hyporesponsive NK cells.

While injection into control mice led to the disappearance of 50% of the target cells, this rejection was abrogated in Torin2 treated animals, underlining the importance of mTOR activity in NK cell recognition of missing-self under steady-state conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, these results demonstrate that mTOR is required for NK cell reactivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>mTOR is a rheostat of NK cell reactivity through NKar</title><p>The ‘rheostat’ model of education proposes that the strength of the MHC-I input translates into a quantitative modification of NK cell responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodin et al., 2009b</xref>). Indeed, several studies reported that the higher the number of self–MHC-I receptors expressed by NK cells interacting with their ligands, the stronger their responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodin et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joncker et al., 2009</xref>).

To directly test this point, we analyzed how the ex vivo modulation of mTOR activity by pharmacologic mTOR inhibitors changed NK cell responsiveness. We took advantage of four different inhibitors of graded mTOR inhibitory potential: the macrolide Rapamycin that primarily inhibits mTORC1 and three ATP-competitive inhibitors targeting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 to a varying extent: AZD2014, KU-0063794 (KU) and Torin2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">García-Martínez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guichard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sabatini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). The use of different concentrations of those compounds allowed us to modulate mTOR activity in NK cells over a dynamic range of 10-fold for mTORC1 or 2-fold for mTORC2 as measured by phosphorylation of S6 and Akt S473 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Of note, we confirmed that Rapamycin acted specifically on mTORC1 while AZD, KU and Torin2 inhibited both complexes. Importantly, at these concentrations no significant changes in STAT5 phosphorylation or specific toxicity over a 24 hr incubation period were noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We then correlated the S6 and Akt phosphorylation levels to the IFN-γ production and degranulation induced by NK1.1 crosslinking. S6 phosphorylation was positively correlated with the effector functions in all conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Similar correlations were found between Akt phosphorylation and effector function upon AZD, KU or Torin2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, this correlation was lost upon Rapamycin treatment, suggesting that mTORC2 activity alone is not sufficient to sustain effector functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>).

The underlying molecular mechanism has however remained elusive. We reasoned that if the mTOR pathway was really a key determinant of NK cell reactivity, acute activation of this pathway should immediately restore reactivity of hyporesponsive cells. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated NK cells from C57BL/6 or <italic>B2m</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice with plate-bound antibodies stimulating NK1.1 or NKp46 and we simultaneously added IL-2, a cytokine known to potently activate mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marçais et al., 2014</xref>). To test the requirement for the mTOR pathway in this process, cells were also treated or not with Torin2. IL-2 resulted in an increase of the cell capacity to produce IFN-γ and to degranulate as measured by CD107a exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This acute treatment was sufficient for hyporesponsive cells to acquire a level of reactivity equal or even higher than that of reactive NK cells from C57BL/6, regardless of the stimulating antibody. mTOR activity was required for this effect since the increase in reactivity was suppressed by mTOR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Similar results were obtained when using IL-15 instead of IL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As expected, NK1.1 stimulation of hyporesponsive NK cells resulted in a very poor calcium flux compared to reactive NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

We then measured the impact of IL-15 treatment on LFA-1 activation following NK1.1 stimulation. The presence of IL-15 in the assay rendered hyporesponsive NK cells able to activate LFA-1 upon NK1.1 stimulation and bind ICAM-1 coated beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This effect was strongly decreased upon Torin2 treatment, underlying the non-redundant role of mTOR in this process.</p><p>Altogether, these results show that acute stimulation of the mTOR pathway can restore the ability of hyporesponsive NK cells to induce calcium flux and activate LFA-1 upon NKar engagement, thereby re-establishing their reactivity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, to gain mechanistic insight into the phenomenon of NK cell education, we explored signal transduction pathways downstream NKars in reactive and hyporesponsive NK cells. We found that the activity of the Akt/mTOR pathway was selectively higher in reactive NK cells. This was characterized by higher basal phosphorylation of direct and indirect targets of both mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and 2) in strict correlation with the reactivity level. In addition, this pattern was lost concomitantly with the loss of reactivity observed upon transfer of reactive cells in <italic>B2m</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hosts. Our screen also revealed that two out of the three NFκB p65 phosphorylations investigated (S468 and S529) correlated with reactivity. This could be the result of the heightened Akt/mTOR pathway activity, as mTORC2 has been involved in NFκB activation during CD4 T cell stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, this could reveal the involvement of other pathways in the control of NK cell reactivity.</p><p>What is the extracellular signal and the signaling pathway responsible for the maintenance of mTOR basal activity in reactive NK cells specifically? An obvious candidate would be IL-15 as this cytokine is a privileged activator of this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marçais et al., 2014</xref>). However, pSTAT5 levels were identical between reactive and hyporesponsive NK cells (data not shown). Moreover, in vivo treatment with antibodies blocking IL-15 signaling did not alter NK cell education (data not shown). Finally, it is difficult to envisage how reactive cells would get preferential access to IL-15. Instead, in line with the disarming hypothesis, we would favor a model in which basal mTOR activity is set independently of education signals. This initial activity would then be decreased by disarming signals. How mTOR activity is decreased by chronic NKar stimulation is still an open question. We hypothesize that in the absence of surrounding MHC-I or in NK cells lacking functional NKirs, unopposed NKar signaling could lead to shut-down of the Akt/mTOR pathway due to depletion of necessary intermediates or establishment of negative feedbacks as it has been demonstrated in the case of induction of resistance to insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Um et al., 2006</xref>). Engagement of NKirs would prevent this desensitization and maintain an optimal activity of the pathway. In favor of this hypothesis, we show that SHP-1, the phosphatase triggered by NKir ligation and necessary to maintain NK cell reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Viant et al., 2014</xref>), was required to maintain an optimal activity of the mTOR pathway. Furthermore, transfer of <italic>Nur77</italic><sup>GFP</sup> cells into <italic>B2m</italic><sup>−/−</sup> hosts was accompanied by an increase in the GFP level, evidence of active NKar signaling, and followed by the loss of mTOR basal activity concomitant with the loss of reactivity of NKG2A<sup>+</sup>Ly49C<sup>+</sup> NK cells.</p><p>Previous studies have conclusively shown that NK cell education is not an on-off switch but rather a variation on a continuous axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodin et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joncker et al., 2009</xref>). We propose that the mTOR pathway is the long-sought molecular rheostat able to both respond to educating signals and control effector functions in return. Indeed, we showed that activity of the Akt/mTOR pathway is regulated commensurate with the level of NKir engagement by MHC-I molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrated that modulation of mTOR activity by exogenous cytokine or pharmacologic treatments was directly correlated with NK cell responsiveness. Furthermore, mTOR could also regulate NK cell responsiveness by integrating signals beyond NKir ligands. Considering the concept of the extended rheostat model as described initially by Höglund and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodin et al., 2009b</xref>), we envision extracellular inputs in an extended sense, including immunological as well as purely metabolic inputs. Interestingly, a number of environmental conditions, such as the presence of inflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun and Lanier, 2008</xref>) or anti-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sungur et al., 2013</xref>), but also the presence of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keppel et al., 2015</xref>), impact on NK cell responsiveness. All these stimuli positively or negatively affect mTOR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Efeyan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marçais et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sinclair et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Viel et al., 2016</xref>). mTOR activity could thus be the nexus targeted by these different stimuli which would explain their impact on NK cell responsiveness. Thus, considering mTOR as the rheostat of NK cell responsiveness would help to build a common conceptual framework in which these observations could be ordered.</p><p>Finally, we also present evidence on how mTOR activity affects NK cell effector functions. We demonstrated that mTOR activity controls two distinct events characterizing reactive NK cells and required for the triggering of effector functions: Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and integrin activation. How could mTOR activity control such apparently unrelated signaling events? Depending on the relative involvement of mTORC1 or mTORC2, several possibilities can be considered. First, the fact that Rapamycin which specifically inhibits mTORC1 is sufficient to decrease responsiveness unmasks the non-redundant role of this complex. In line with the role of mTORC1 in the control of cellular metabolism, we described that higher basal mTOR activity in educated cells translated into higher basal metabolism as measured by morphological parameters as well as glucose and fatty-acid uptake and mitochondrial content. We and others have described the necessary role of the mTORC1-dependent metabolism in the development of NK cell effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Donnelly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marçais et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to improving the cellular fitness, metabolism could directly modulate signaling by controlling the availability of key intermediates as recently described for Th17/Treg differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araujo et al., 2017</xref>). Another possibility would be through the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, an emerging mode of lymphocyte signaling regulation is through cytoskeleton-dependent regulation of membrane receptors compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattila et al., 2016</xref>), a process that has been proposed to explain the reactivity of educated NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guia et al., 2011</xref>). mTORC2 has been shown to regulate the cytoskeletal organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sarbassov et al., 2004</xref>) and could therefore prime reactive NK cells by cytoskeletal modifications. An interesting parallel can also be drawn with T cell anergy. Indeed, TCR stimulation in the absence of CD28 co-stimulation results in T cell hyporesponsiveness to further re-stimulation. Numerous studies have shown that the precise control of mTOR activity is at the heart of this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chappert and Schwartz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marcais et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2009</xref>). Interestingly, this state is characterized by defective Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dubois et al., 1998</xref>). Further resembling hyporesponsive NK cells, treatment of anergic T cells with IL-2 restores their responsiveness, an event that relies on mTOR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dubois et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux is classically triggered by IP<sub>3</sub>-induced release of endoplasmic reticulum stores which, upon detection by the STIM1/2 sensors, leads to opening of the ORAI channels present on the plasma membrane and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hogan and Rao, 2015</xref>). In addition, an underestimated Ca<sup>2+</sup> store is the endo-lysosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>), which constitutes a further link with mTOR since mTORC1 is activated on the lysosomal surface and positively regulated by lysosomal nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Efeyan et al., 2015</xref>) as well as by calcium release from lysosomal stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Concerning regulation of integrin activation, a putative link would be through the inhibition of GSK3β. Indeed, this kinase is inhibited by Akt following mTORC2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hagiwara et al., 2012</xref>), and a recent study showed that its inhibition leads to better ability of NK cells to form conjugate via integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parameswaran et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, PKCθ, a target of mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), activates WIP via S488 phosphorylation in lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fried et al., 2014</xref>). Since a macro-complex involving WIP, WASp, actin and myosin IIa has been defined in NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krzewski et al., 2006</xref>), WIP activation could explain better interaction with ICAM-1-coated beads in our assay and ultimately better docking to target cell.</p><p>In summary, these findings identify the activity of the mTOR pathway as the molecular rheostat responsible for the control of basal NK cell reactivity in response to NKir ligation. In addition, this provides a molecular basis for a number of previous experiments showing that NK cell education can be overcome by cytokine treatment. Finally, our data underline the extreme versatility of the regulation of NK cell responsiveness and further point to mTOR as a valid target for the manipulation of NK cells for therapeutic purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and adoptive transfers</title><p>Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (L’Arbresle). <italic>B2m</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koller et al., 1990</xref>), <italic>Ncr1</italic><sup>iCre/+</sup> <italic>Mtor</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marçais et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>Ncr1</italic><sup>iCre/+</sup> <italic>Ptpn6</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Viant et al., 2014</xref>) were previously described, littermate control mice were used as controls. <italic>Nur77</italic><sup>GFP</sup> mice were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moran et al., 2011</xref>).

Intracellular stainings for phosphorylated proteins were done using Lyse/Fix and PermIII buffers (BD Bioscience). Measurement of glucose uptake was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marçais et al., 2014</xref>). Mitochondrial content was measured using Mitotracker Green (Molecular Probes, 1 µM) incubated for 10 min at 37°C in PBS. Lipid uptake was measured using BodipyFL C16 (Molecular Probes, 1 µM) incubated for 30 min at 37°C in complete medium. Surface staining were then performed to identify the different populations. Flow cytometry was carried out on a FACS LSR II or on a FACS Fortessa (Becton-Dickinson). Data were analysed using FlowJo (Treestar). The following mAbs from eBioscience, BD Biosciences or Biolegend were used: anti-CD19 (ebio1D3), anti-CD3 (145–2 C11), anti-NK1.1 (PK136), anti NKp46 (29A1.4), anti-CD49b (DX5), anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-CD27 (LG.7F9), anti-Ly49I (YLI90), anti-NKG2A/C/E (20d5), anti-IFN-γ (XMG1.2), anti-CD107a (1D4B). The mAb 4LO3311 recognizing Ly49C was purified on protein A column from supernatant of the 4LO3311 hybridoma generously provided by Pr. Suzanne Lemieux (Institut Armand Frappier, Québec). NKG2A positive cells were identified using the 20d5 clone which also recognizes NKG2C and NKG2E, however, since mouse resting NK cells only express NKG2A, we considered 20d5 reactive cells as NKG2A positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vance et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell culture and stimulation</title><p>1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes were cultured on antibody coated plates (anti-NKp46 (Goat polyclonal, R&amp;D), anti-NK1.1 (PK136, BioXCell) at 10 µg/ml on Immulon 2HB or Nunclon plates) with Golgi-stop (BD Biosciences) in the presence of anti-CD107a for 4 hr. Cytokines and mTOR inhibitors were used at the following concentrations unless otherwise stated: rmIL-15 (Peprotech; 100 ng/ml), IL-2 (muIL-2 supernatant; 200 U/ml), Rapamycin (Calbiochem; 25 nM), KU-0063794 (Stemgent; 3 µM), AZD2014 (Selleckchem; 5 µM) and Torin2 (Tocris; 250 nM).

Two tailed unpaired t-test, and ANOVA tests with Bonferroni correction were used as indicated in the figure legends. Significance is indicated as follows: *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001. The heatmap presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> was established as follow: we first selected the phosphoepitopes for which the MFI (Mean Fluorescence Intensity) was significantly above the one of the FMO control (Student T-test). The MFI of the 15 selected phosphoepitopes for the 4 NC sub-populations defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> was then normalized to the MFI value of the NKG2A<sup>+</sup>Ly49C<sup>+</sup> populations in the C57BL/6 mice and the values obtained were averaged to calculate the means for each populations. These values were used to establish the Heatmap using the Multiple Experiment Viewer application. We used the R statistical language to manage our database and carry out the statistical analysis (R version 3.3.2). We splited the database into six datasets (2 Mouse strains * Differentiation subsets), each containing the 15 phospho-epitopes. We performed an ANOVA for each phospho-epitope to test for the phosphorylation difference between the 4 NC sub-populations. The parameters of the ANOVA Type I SS were adapted to control for the experiment effect. The Bartlett Homogeneity of Variances Test was applied first, when it failed to reject its H0, then the phospho-epitope was retained for the ANOVA test. The normality of the residuals of the ANOVA model was checked graphically and numerically with the Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test. When this test failed to reject its H0 then the adjusted P values for multiple comparisons were extracted with the Tukey's 'Honest Significant Difference' method.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the contribution of SFR Biosciences (UMS3444/CNRS, ENSL, UCBL, US8/INSERM) facilities, in particular the Plateau de Biologie Expérimentale de la Souris, and the flow cytometry facility.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although your paper was viewed with great interest, I am afraid that the consensus of the reviewers and the Editors is that the main conclusions of the paper on NK cell education were not supported by the data presented. The reviewers also discussed the possibility that the manuscript could be sufficiently edited to support more limited conclusions. However, in that case, the consensus view was that the paper would then not be enough of an advance in the field to justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.

In a nice set of experiments the authors show that mTOR contributes to activation signals in NK cells in response to various stimuli, including target cells and signaling by receptors NK1.1 and NKp46. To make such a conclusion it would be necessary to dissociate the role of mTOR in NK cell activation and education. For example, had mTOR acute inhibition by Torin not affected NK cell responses to in vitro stimuli, while deletion of mTOR in NK cells in mice still resulted in lack of education, one could then conclude that mTOR may have a role in education.</p><p>Cytokine stimulation, which activates the mTOR pathway, is taken as evidence for a role of mTOR in overcoming the weak responses of uneducated NK cells. This conclusion cannot be made on the basis of the evidence. It is known that IL-2 or IL-15 overcome NK unresponsiveness and stimulate the mTOR pathway. But these cytokines could overcome unresponsiveness independently of their stimulatory effect on the mTOR pathway. The fact that mTOR contributes to NK activation in the context of IL-2 or IL-15 stimulation does not imply a role in educating NK cells.</p><p>This is a nice study on the contribution of the mTOR pathway to NK cell activation both in vitro and for MHC-I negative tumor cell rejection in vivo. Using titrations of inhibitors the authors show that the degree of mTOR activity correlates well with the strength of NK responses, again showing that mTOR is required for NK activation. mTOR contributes to early steps of NK activation such as calcium responses and activation of integrin.</p><p>1) The main conclusion is not supported by the data, as described above.</p><p>2) There is no evidence so far that NK cell education by inhibitory receptors is due to a unique educating signal, a hypothesis known as the arming hypothesis. However, there is evidence that continuous stimulation of NK cells leads to hyporesponsiveness. Accordingly, the basis for education is that inhibitory signals prevent induction of hyporesponsiveness. The experiments in this paper should be interpreted in that context. The mTOR pathway could be a particularly sensitive target of activation-induced hyporesponsiveness. In the Introduction section the authors actually say that 'the current viewpoint is that engagement of the NKirs prevents the desensitization of the NK cell due to chronic NKar stimulation'. However, this viewpoint has not been considered in this paper, which is interpreted mainly according to the existence of educating signals.</p><p>3) The Discussion is interesting and well written. But it is based on the unsupported premise that mTOR is essential for NK cell education.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Yu et al. showed that increased basal activity of the mTOR/Akt pathway is associated with mouse NK cell education defined by expression of the inhibitory receptors. They also found that mTORC1 signaling is regulated by the SHP-1 phosphatase and is associated with the improved responsiveness of educated NK cells. They further showed that upon stimulation through activating NK cell receptors, the mTOR/Akt pathway enhances calcium flux and LFA-1 integrin activation. In accordance with published work, pharmacological inhibition of mTOR results in decreased NK cell reactivity, while acute cytokine stimulation restores responsiveness of uneducated NK cells through mTOR activation.</p><p>This manuscript studies the previous unaddressed role of mTOR/Akt pathway in NK cell education, and is well written.

Their reply to the first suggests that I have not delivered my main message clearly enough.

Priming as an early event not known to be reversible. In contrast, education is rapidly reverted by chronic stimulation. There is no evidence that education signals are a prerequisite for acquisition of responsiveness. Therefore, basal mTOR activity may be independent of education signals. However, mTOR activity could be lost or diminished by disarming.

Let me comment on their response.</p><p>Their replies to specific points are preceded by five points taken out of my summary paragraph. Their reply to the first suggests that I have not delivered my main message clearly enough. The second main message they propose for the revised manuscript is that &quot;education signals prime basal mTOR activity.&quot; In the NK field the concepts of priming and education are not well understood and their relationship is unclear. Priming as an early event not known to be reversible. In contrast, education is rapidly reverted by chronic stimulation. There is no evidence that education signals are a prerequisite for acquisition of responsiveness. Therefore, basal mTOR activity may be independent of education signals. However, mTOR activity could be lost or diminished by disarming. The authors should interpret their data within the context of two models: education signals that are required versus an intrinsic ability to respond via mTOR that can be switched off.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now profoundly changed the way we present our data to interpret them within the context of the arming vs disarming models. We agree with reviewer 1 that indeed all the experimental evidences collected so far are in favor of the disarming model, i.e. intrinsic reactivity is lost in cells that can not oppose persistent activating stimulation by inhibitory signals. In this context, we now propose that initial activity of the mTOR pathway is set in all NK cells uniformly. This initial activity is then diminished by disarming signals in those NK cells where they are not opposed by inhibitory signals. This is supported by the fact that transfer of reactive NK cells into β2m<sup>-/-</sup> host results in a loss of mTOR activity concomitant with prolonged NKar stimulation. The main messages of the manuscript are now that 1) <italic>mTOR is a molecular rheostat controlling NK cell activation through NK cell receptors</italic> and that 2) <italic>basal mTOR activity is decreased upon prolonged unopposed activating signal.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the second point, I accept their argument on the role of mTOR in cytokine induced education.</p><p>On the fifth point, I agree that the role of mTOR in early NK activation signals is a new contribution.</p><p>Specific points: 1. As above. 2. This point relates to my first comment above. The authors have proposed an interesting experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for judging the proposed experiment as “interesting”. We performed it and found that indeed, transfer of Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> cells into Beta2microglobulin KO mice is accompanied by 1) a rise in the GFP level indicative of NKar signaling, 2) a loss of cell reactivity upon challenge with agonists of NKar or YAC1 target cells as published by others (Joncker et al., 2010) and 3) a concomitant loss of higher basal phosphorylation of S6 and Akt S473 in NKG2A<sup>+</sup>Ly49C<sup>+</sup> NK cells. These data are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. They support the fact that unopposed NKar stimulation leads to decreased mTOR activity which consequently induces loss of cell reactivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 had the following specific comment that should be addressed in the re-submission.</p><p>One thing that they still can’t quite explain is why there is increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 T201/Y204 and pNFkB S5356 in NK cells from B2m-deficient cells. They said that it might be due to unopposed chronic stimulation through NKar… But then if this is the case, NKar also activated mTORC1… What is the difference in the regulation of these phosphorylation in NK cells or why chronic stimulation through NKar negatively impact mTOR signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>We still do not have a definitive answer to this last question. We can only hypothesize that the mTOR pathway is particularly sensitive to desensitization. This supposition is based on the previous observations of a number of negative feedback loops desensitizing this pathway (Um et al., 2006). The main but non-exclusive target of these negative feedback loops is a signaling adaptor: the Insulin Receptor Substrate molecule. It is however regulated by the complex interplay of more than 50 S/T phosphorylations (Copps and White, 2012). In addition, whether IRS proteins play a role in lymphocytes is unknown. We thus feel that finding the exact mechanism at play would go beyond the scope of this manuscript, however, we expose this point in the Discussion referring to studies done in the context of the establishment of resistance to insulin.</p><p>References</p><p>Copps, K.D., and White, M.F.
