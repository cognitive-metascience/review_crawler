enough for successful reproduction. Susceptibility to brief mating-induced death is caused by the loss of protection upon self-sperm depletion. Self-sperm maintains the expression of a DAF-2 insulin-like antagonist, INS-37, which promotes the nuclear localization of intestinal HLH-30/TFEB, a key pro-longevity regulator. Mating induces the agonist INS-8, promoting HLH-30 nuclear exit and subsequent death. In opposition to the protective role of HLH-30 and DAF-16/FOXO, TOR/LET-363 and the IIS-regulated Zn-finger transcription factor PQM-1 promote seminal-fluid-induced killing. Self-sperm maintenance of nuclear HLH-30/TFEB allows hermaphrodites to resist mating-induced death until self-sperm are exhausted, increasing the chances that mothers will survive through reproduction. Mothers combat males’ hijacking of their IIS pathway by expressing an insulin antagonist that keeps her healthy through the activity of pro-longevity factors, as long as she has her own sperm to utilize.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TFEB</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>mating</kwd><kwd>lifespan</kwd><kwd>insulin signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pioneer 1DP1OD020400-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Coleen T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Coleen T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hermaphroditic <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> slow the onset of mating-induced death through self-sperm-regulated insulin-like gene expression, which regulates the activity of the IIS/FOXO pathway, mTOR signaling, and the TFEB/HLH-30 transcription factor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The battle between the sexes is played out across the animal kingdom: males compete with one another to pass on their own genomes, often at the expense of female health, and females, in turn, must devise strategies to reduce the deleterious effects of mating in order to successfully complete reproduction. Sexual antagonism is evident in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, where signals from males kill hermaphrodites through three distinct mechanisms: germline activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>), seminal fluid transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>), and, at high doses, male pheromone toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Maures et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> are hermaphrodites and thus do not require males to reproduce; in fact, males are normally rare in nature (~1/1000). Brief bursts of mating with males can be beneficial for the species due to increased outcrossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kimble, 1988</xref>), but males are quickly eliminated by dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wegewitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>) and by their own pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While germline activation is necessary for reproduction and the resulting lifespan decrease is shared both across sexes and species, seminal fluid (SF) killing appears to be used specifically for the purpose of ‘sperm competition’ (that is, competition between males) within the species: seminal fluid transfer induces death of mothers just after they have produced all of that male’s progeny, eliminating the possibility of the mother re-mating with a different male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>). We noted previously that mating-induced death occurs only after <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites produce all their progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>); this delay is necessary for successful reproduction, but the underlying mechanism allowing this balance was previously unknown. In an accompanying manuscript, Booth et al. report that self-sperm are protective against short-term mating-induced death specifically in hermaphroditic mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we describe the molecular mechanism that hermaphrodites use to prevent early SF-induced death until self-sperm are depleted. This pathway utilizes competing insulin-like peptide agonists and antagonists of the DAF-2/Insulin receptor as well as mTOR signaling to regulate a set of protective (DAF-16/FOXO and HLH-30/TFEB) and detrimental (PQM-1) transcription factors, which in turn determine susceptibility to seminal-fluid-induced death.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Self-sperm protects young hermaphrodites from male seminal-fluid-induced death</title><p>The presence of self-sperm in young hermaphrodites protects them from brief mating-induced death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Therefore, potentially more male sperm and seminal fluid were transferred to N2 hermaphrodites. Still, young N2 are resistant to brief mating-induced death, suggesting that young N2 hermaphrodites’ resistance to brief mating-induced death is not due to lower mating efficiency or the transfer of less male sperm or seminal fluid.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46413-fig1-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Previously we found that mating induces hermaphrodite shrinking through male sperm activation of the hermaphrodite’s germline, and that separately, transfer of male seminal fluid (SF) causes DAF-16/FOXO cytoplasmic localization and inactivation, subsequently leading to death of the mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>). To determine whether brief mating acts through the male sperm/germline pathway or through the seminal fluid pathway, we mated <italic>fer-6</italic> males, which are spermless but still contain seminal fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Argon and Ward, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gems and Riddle, 1996</xref>), or <italic>fog-2</italic> males, which contain male sperm and thus essentially are like wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schedl and Kimble, 1988</xref>), with <italic>fog-2</italic> (self-spermless) females; both sperm-containing and spermless males induce death in young and old <italic>fog-2</italic> mothers at equal rates, suggesting that the death-inducing factor is not sperm.

However, <italic>daf-22</italic> males induce the same brief mating lifespan effect as wild-type males. Similarly, 2 hr treatment on high-dose male pheromone-conditioned plates (‘MCP’; plates pre-treated with 30 males, then removed prior to experiment) does not shorten the lifespan of either wild-type or <italic>fog-2</italic> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–I</xref>).

The presence of self-sperm staves off mating effects by inducing the expression of the insulin receptor antagonist, INS-37, which in turn prevents DAF-2/insulin signaling and retains DAF-16 and HLH-30 in the nucleus, and PQM-1 in the cytoplasm. These key transcription factors are regulated by the DAF-2/insulin signaling pathway via a specific insulin-like peptide agonist (INS-8) and antagonist (INS-37) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and in HLH-30’s case, also by the nutrient sensor TOR/LET-363. INS-8 and INS-7 expression is upregulated in mated mothers and inducing seminal-fluid-mediated killing through activation of DAF-2 and subsequent inhibition of DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lin et al., 2001</xref>) and HLH-30 nuclear localization and activation.

Like HLH-30, PQM-1 is negatively regulated by TOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dowen et al., 2016</xref>), but since PQM-1’s role is detrimental, the loss of each of these factors prevents mating-induced death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

While early mating is detrimental to the mothers, late mating (i.e., after all self-sperm are utilized) is beneficial, as it allows the mother to use her remaining oocytes. Moreover, the involvement of TOR suggests that nutritional status may also influence mating-induced death. Thus, a dynamic system that is responsive to changing sperm levels and nutrient signals may allow such a shift. The expression of a DAF-2 antagonist, INS-37, allows hermaphrodites to resist and delay <italic>C. elegans’</italic> main mechanism of competition with other males, seminal fluid-induced killing, until self-sperm are exhausted, increasing the chances that the mother will survive through the end of her reproductive period. Such strategies, coupled with the increased attraction of males that accompany the depletion of self-sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Morsci et al., 2011</xref>), enable hermaphrodites to delay both the odds of mating, through behavioral changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Morsci et al., 2011</xref>) and the detrimental effects of mating (through molecular signaling), before the full utilization of their own sperm. This increases the chance that they will propagate their own genome preferentially before succumbing to mating. The balance shifts in the male’s favor as the hermaphrodite’s sperm are depleted, causing her death shortly after producing his progeny, and preventing further mating by other males. This insulin peptide-based arms race regulates a transition from preventing to promoting the activation of the insulin signaling pathway, resulting first in protection from death during early reproduction, and then accelerated death of the mother immediately after reproduction. Together, these signals tune and optimize reproduction for the hermaphroditic mother, even when confronted with deleterious effects from males.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Strains</th><th valign="top">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">N2</td><td valign="top">CGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">CF1038: <italic>daf−16(mu86) I</italic></td><td valign="top">CGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">BA6: <italic>fer−6(hc6) I</italic></td><td valign="top">CGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">CB4108: <italic>fog−2(q71) V</italic></td><td valign="top">CGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">BA17: <italic>fem−1(hc17) IV</italic></td><td valign="top">CGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JK816: <italic>fem−3(q20) IV</italic></td><td valign="top">CGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">DR476: <italic>daf−22(m130) II</italic></td><td valign="top">CGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">RB711: <italic>pqm−1(ok485) II</italic></td><td valign="top">CGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">JIN1375: <italic>hlh−30(tm1978) IV</italic></td><td valign="top">CGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">BC11288: <italic>dpy−5(e907) I; sEx11288[rCes W02C12.3b::GFP + pCeh361]</italic></td><td valign="top">CGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">OP201: <italic>unc−119(tm4063) III; wgIs201[pqm−1::TY1::EGFP::3xFLAG(92C12)+unc−119(+)]</italic></td><td valign="top">CGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">HT1704: <italic>unc−119(ed3) III; wwEx67[ins−8 p::GFP + unc−119(+)]</italic></td><td valign="top">CGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">TJ356: <italic>zls356[daf-16p::daf-16a/b::GFP + rol-6(su1006)]</italic></td><td valign="top">CGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">CQ777: <italic>fog-2(q71); zls356[daf-16p::daf-16a/b::GFP + rol-6(su1006)]</italic> <break/>(TJ356 crossed into CB4108)</td><td valign="top">This study</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental methods</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Mating setup</title><p>60 mm NGM plates were used to set up group mating.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Insulin-like peptides and the mTOR-TFEB pathway protect <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites from Mating-induced Death&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: George Sutphin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All of the reviewers are in agreement that the work described here provides important insights into the mechanisms that control how mating influences health and longevity in worms and that it will be of general interest. However, some concerns were raised regarding experimental design, replication and statistics, and interpretation that the authors are encouraged to address prior to resubmission. In addition, the authors are encouraged to consider a more general readership who may not be experts in the prior literature or <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetic pathways when revising the text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Statistics and replication: Few experiments were validated in triplicate in this work and many only included a single biological replicate. At an absolute minimum, all experiments should be performed with duplicate biological replicates and preferably the authors would meet the field standard of triplicate replication.</p><p>2) The authors include in their model a strong conclusion that DAF-2 and DAF-16 are mediating the insulin side of the self-sperm protection from mating induced lifespan shortening. No interaction with DAF-2 is explicitly tested in any aspect of this work, and the only experiment examining DAF-16 simply demonstrates that worms lacking <italic>daf-16</italic> are sensitive to brief mating-induced death early in life, while wild-type animals are not. With this single exception, the involvement of DAF-2 and DAF-16 is inferred solely on evidence from interactions with the major genetic players in this story (INS-7, INS-8, INS-37, PMQ-1, HLH-30) in other phenotypic contexts (development, long-term mating, etc). To be clear, the basis for this model is sound, but the interactions have not been confirmed in the context of brief mating-induced death, while involvement of DAF-2 and DAF-16 in this process is strongly stated in the conclusions and final model. One of the compelling reasons for this work and that of Booth et al. is the demonstration that the cost of early-life mating is distinct from late-life or continuous mating (mechanistically because of the presence of self-sperm). Given that some genetic backgrounds appear to have different effects on early-life mating than late-life or continuous mating, inferring relationships between these paradigms is potentially problematic. While experimentally confirming the role of DAF-2 and DAF-16 (e.g. in a manner similar to that presented for HLH-30) would solidify this part of the model, all of these experiments are not absolutely necessary for publication. The reviewers do feel that, at a minimum, the lifespans of <italic>daf-16</italic>(-) mutants should be repeated and a test should be performed for DAF-16::GFP localization. A clearer statement that the role of DAF-2 and DAF-16 are inferred based on previous work on other phenotypes and not directly examined in this work (and similar softening of the final model in Figure 4E) should also be included in the text.</p><p>3) Why did the authors focus on <italic>ins-37</italic> in the first place? In subsection “Self-sperm modulate expression of <italic>ins-37</italic>” they discount sperm specific protein, and then decide to look at gene that they state is germline specific and only expressed when self-sperm is present. The most direct conclusion would be that INS-37 is also a sperm specific gene (sperm is part of the germline after all) and to group it in with the others that were already discounted. Figure 2—figure supplement 2A is referenced and seems to have something to do with expression patterns of INS-37, but the authors only provide a reference to another paper and no description of what the acronyms and markers in the figure are supposed to be showing, it is not possible to tell what information is supposed to be conveyed. It is possible that a clear explanation of this figure will clarify the situation, but a better explanation of the selection of INS-37 for follow up is needed.</p><p>4) Moreover, <italic>ins-37</italic> gene regulation should be validated either by RTPCR and/or transcriptional reporter (as is the case for ins-8 later in the manuscript). Furthermore, the authors do not show that a brief mating leads to the nuclear exit of DAF-16 as a prolonged mating does. The images showing PQM-1 nuclear translocation are unclear, and rather show an increase in fluorescence expression than an increase in nuclear translocation.</p><p>5) The authors show that the transcription factor <italic>hlh-30</italic> is required for protection against mating induced demise. While these data are compelling, the data showing HLH-30 nuclear translocation is not. From the pictures, a decrease of HLH-30 nuclear localization cannot be discerned (Figure 2D, I), and the data on complete nuclear localization of HLH-30 at a young age (Figure 2E) is in contrast to published data (which for the HLH-30::GFP strain from the Irazoqui lab does not indicate nuclear localization is animals at steady state/normal room temperature). Since nuclear localization cannot be evaluated from the images (higher magnification is needed), it is not possible to draw conclusions on the activity of HLH-30 after mating; thus, this data set needs to be revisited. Importantly, what happens to HLH-30 nuclear localization in <italic>fog-2</italic> mutants following mating?</p><p>6) The authors find in their RNASeq that components of the mTOR complex are downregulated in animals that are protected against mating-induced demise. These gene expression data should be validated.</p><p>7) There is an important control missing from the set of experiments presented in Figure 3C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-D. The authors claim that HLH-30 is necessary for LET-363 knockdown to be protective against brief mating on day 3. While they include the <italic>hlh-30</italic> mutant control, the <italic>let-363</italic>(RNAi) control is not shown. In fact, the effect of <italic>let-363</italic> knockdown on mating induced lifespan shortening is only assessed in the <italic>fog-2</italic> background, where the authors also report altered <italic>let-363</italic> expression. It is overall a bit difficult to understand this expected result – if the idea is that mTOR RNAi does not extend lifespan in <italic>fog-2</italic> animals because they have low mTOR pathway activity, how come <italic>fog-2</italic> animals are not long lived (as reported by Kenyon lab)? More rigor and discussion are needed here, and if the authors want to make claims about the functional involvement of the mTOR pathway, the authors should analyze at least one more mTOR pathway mutant, e.g., <italic>raga-1</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46413.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Statistics and replication: Few experiments were validated in triplicate in this work and many only included a single biological replicate.

DAF-16::GFP is mostly nuclear in unmated <italic>fog-2</italic> hermaphrodites, but becomes diffuse and cytoplasmic after mating, consistent with our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why did the authors focus on ins-37 in the first place?

Furthermore, we had shown that the process is dependent on the transfer of seminal fluid from males into females (now moved to Figure 1), and we further showed that <italic>daf-2/daf-16</italic> insulin signaling pathway regulates brief mating-induced death (<italic>daf-2</italic> mutants are resistant to Day 8 brief mating-induced death, Figure 2A-C). However, the upstream molecule(s) that regulates insulin signaling was unknown in the context of brief mating. Indeed, our expression data show that <italic>ins-37</italic> is very highly differentially expressed in unmated L4s compared to spermless L4s (more than a 20-fold difference, which we have now confirmed by qRT-PCR). Therefore, because we know that the Seminal Fluid pathway regulates the insulin signaling pathway, <italic>ins-37</italic> is an excellent candidate for the protective factor. We have now explained logic this more clearly in the text.</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 2A has been removed. The purpose was to convey that it is expressed in the germline (and gfp constructs in the germline are often silenced), as was shown by Ebbing, et al., 2018.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Moreover, ins-37 gene regulation should be validated either by RTPCR and/or transcriptional reporter (as is the case for ins-8 later in the manuscript).

The images showing PQM-1 nuclear translocation are unclear, and rather show an increase in fluorescence expression than an increase in nuclear translocation.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the question, we have now performed qRT-PCR of <italic>ins-37</italic> (Figure 2B), which supports our model that <italic>ins-37</italic> expression is greatly increased in animals with self-sperm.</p><p>As stated above, we have new data showing that DAF-16::GFP is mostly nuclear in unmated <italic>fog-2</italic> hermaphrodites, but becomes diffuse and cytoplasmic after mating (Figure 2 C,D), consistent with our model.</p><p>We have replaced the initial images of PQM-1::GFP with better, clearer images, and we have indicated the nucleus with arrows in the image (Figure 6C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors show that the transcription factor hlh-30 is required for protection against mating induced demise. While these data are compelling, the data showing HLH-30 nuclear translocation is not. From the pictures, a decrease of HLH-30 nuclear localization cannot be discerned (Figure 2D, I), and the data on complete nuclear localization of HLH-30 at a young age (Figure 2E) is in contrast to published data (which for the HLH-30::GFP strain from the Irazoqui lab does not indicate nuclear localization is animals at steady state/normal room temperature). Since nuclear localization cannot be evaluated from the images (higher magnification is needed), it is not possible to draw conclusions on the activity of HLH-30 after mating; thus, this data set needs to be revisited. Importantly, what happens to HLH-30 nuclear localization in fog-2 mutants following mating?</p></disp-quote><p>We were warned by the lab that sent us the HLH-30 (and we did confirm) that HLH-30::GFP quickly traffics out of the nucleus upon the stress of mounting for microscopy, which limits one’s ability to take as high-magnification images as we normally do with fixed worms. To solve this problem, we took images and videos of freely moving HLH-30::GFP to avoid any inaccuracy caused by microscope mounting-induced localization bias; however, the nuclear localization was clear in our assays. We have now explained these details in the Materials and methods. (Please note that the HLH-30::GFP strain we used for the experiments in the manuscript is BC11288, in which gfp was inserted after the start codon of the longest <italic>hlh-30</italic> transcript (Craig et al., 2013, and on Wormbase, there are quite a few HLH-30::GFP pictures curated by Ian Hope’s lab showing nuclear localization of HLH-30 under steady-state conditions.)</p><p>We did notice that the printed versions of our figures after manuscript compression was lower than our original images, so we will work with the journal to be sure that the images in the final version of the paper are as the originals, and that the printed and screen images are equally clear, in case that is the source of the problem.</p><p>HLH-30::GFP also became diffuse after mating in <italic>fog-2</italic> mutants (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors find in their RNASeq that components of the mTOR complex are downregulated in animals that are protected against mating-induced demise. These gene expression data should be validated.</p></disp-quote><p>We confirmed our microarray results with Lauren Booth’s independent RNA-seq data, which we now show as Figure 5B. Both data sets suggest that worms in the “protective” state have lower expression levels of the mTOR complex components.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There is an important control missing from the set of experiments presented in Figure 3C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-D. The authors claim that HLH-30 is necessary for LET-363 knockdown to be protective against brief mating on day 3. While they include the hlh-30 mutant control, the let-363(RNAi) control is not shown. In fact, the effect of let-363 knockdown on mating induced lifespan shortening is only assessed in the fog-2 background, where the authors also report altered let-363 expression. It is overall a bit difficult to understand this expected result – if the idea is that mTOR RNAi does not extend lifespan in fog-2 animals because they have low mTOR pathway activity, how come fog-2 animals are not long lived (as reported by Kenyon lab)?

Both our microarray and RNA-seq data showed that <italic>fog-2</italic> unmated worms express higher levels of most mTOR components, which is why we initially only performed <italic>let-363</italic> RNAi in the <italic>fog-2</italic> background, but we have now included the lifespan of <italic>let-363</italic> RNAi on N2 worms after brief mating (Figure 5—figure supplement 1 A-B, Supplementary file 1 – experiment 32-33).</p><p>We have now also tested several other components of mTOR complex, including <italic>rict-1, daf-15</italic>, and <italic>raga-1</italic>, and found that in all these mutants, reducing the expression of mTOR components in the <italic>fog-2</italic> background protects the hermaphrodites from brief mating induced death (Figure 5E-F, Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-E), supporting our original findings (more replicates are ongoing, but for the purposes of showing the reviewer what progress we have made, these single replicates are currently in the supplement).</p></body></sub-article></article>
