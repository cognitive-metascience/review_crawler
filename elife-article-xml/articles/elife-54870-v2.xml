causing morbidity and disability. Measurements of the pace of aging are needed as surrogate endpoints in trials of therapies designed to prevent disease by slowing biological aging. We report a blood-DNA-methylation measure that is sensitive to variation in pace of biological aging among individuals born the same year. We first modeled change-over-time in 18 biomarkers tracking organ-system integrity across 12 years of follow-up in n = 954 members of the Dunedin Study born in 1972–1973. Rates of change in each biomarker over ages 26–38 years were composited to form a measure of aging-related decline, termed Pace-of-Aging. Elastic-net regression was used to develop a DNA-methylation predictor of Pace-of-Aging, called DunedinPoAm for Dunedin(P)ace(o)f(A)ging(m)ethylation. Validation analysis in cohort studies and the CALERIE trial provide proof-of-principle for DunedinPoAm as a single-time-point measure of a person’s pace of biological aging.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>People’s bodies age at different rates. Age-related biological changes that increase the risk of disease and disability progress rapidly in some people. In others, these processes occur at a slower pace, allowing those individuals to live longer, healthier lives. This observation has led scientists to try to develop therapies that slow aging. The hope is that such treatments could prevent or delay diseases like heart disease or dementia, for which older age is the leading risk factor.</p><p>Studies in animals have identified treatments that extend the creatures’ lives and slow age-related disease. But testing these treatments in humans is challenging. Our lives are much longer than the worms, flies or mice used in the experiments. Scientists would have to follow human study participants for decades to detect delays in disease onset or an extension of their lives. An alternative approach is to try to develop a test that measures the pace of aging, or essentially “a speedometer for aging”. This would allow scientists to more quickly determine if treatments slow the aging process.</p><p>Now, Belsky et al. show a blood test designed to measure the pace of aging predicts which people are at increased risk of poor health, chronic disease and an earlier death. First, data about chemical changes to an individual’s DNA, called DNA methylation, were analyzed from white blood cell samples collected from 954 people in a long-term health study known as “The Dunedin Study”. Using the data, Belsky et al. then developed an algorithm – named “DunedinPoAm” – that identified people with an accelerated or slowed pace of aging based on a single blood test. Next, they used the algorithm on samples from participants in three other long-term studies. This verified that those people the algorithm identified as aging faster had a greater risk of poor health, developing chronic diseases or dying earlier. Similarly, those identified as aging more slowly performed better on tests of balance, strength, walking speed and mental ability, and they also looked younger to trained raters. Additionally, Belsky et al. used the test on participants in a randomized trial testing whether restricting calories had potential to extend healthy lifespan. The results suggested that the calorie restriction could counter the effects of an accelerated pace of aging.</p><p>The test developed by Belsky et al. may provide an alternate way of measuring whether age-slowing treatments work. This would allow faster testing of treatments that can extend the healthy lifespan of humans. The test may also help identify individuals with accelerated aging. This might help public health officials test whether policies or programs can help people lead longer, healthier lives.</p></abstract><kwd-group

producing forecasts of rising burden of disease and disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harper, 2014</xref>). Because this burden arises from multiple age-related diseases, treatments for single diseases will not address the burden challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldman et al., 2013</xref>). Geroscience research suggests an appealing alternative: treatments to slow aging itself could prevent or delay the multiple diseases that increase with advancing age, perhaps with a single therapeutic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gladyshev, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaeberlein, 2013</xref>). Aging can be understood as a gradual and progressive deterioration in biological system integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kirkwood, 2005</xref>). This deterioration is thought to arise from an accumulation of cellular-level changes. These changes, in turn, increase vulnerability to diseases affecting many different organ systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). Animal studies suggest treatments that slow the accumulation of cellular-level changes can extend healthy lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campisi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaeberlein et al., 2015</xref>). However, human trials of these treatments are challenging because humans live much longer than model animals, making it time-consuming and costly to follow up human trial participants to test treatment effects on healthy lifespan. This challenge will be exacerbated in trials that will give treatments to young or middle-aged adults, with the aim to prevent the decline in system integrity that antedates disease onset by years. Involving young and midlife adults in healthspan-extension trials has been approved for development by the National Advisory Council on Aging (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/about/naca/national-advisory-council-aging-meeting-agenda-january-29-30-2019">2019</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/about/naca/national-advisory-council-aging-meeting-agenda-january-29-30-2019">CTAP report to NACA</ext-link>). In midlife trials of treatments to slow aging, called geroprotectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moskalev et al., 2016</xref>), traditional endpoints such as disease diagnosis or death are too far in the future to serve as outcomes. Translation of geroprotector treatments to humans could be aided by measures that quantify the pace of deterioration in biological system integrity in human aging. Such measures could be used as surrogate endpoints for healthy lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Justice et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Justice et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moskalev et al., 2016</xref>), even with young-to-midlife adult trial participants. A useful measure should be non-invasive, inexpensive, reliable, and highly sensitive to biological change.</p><p>Recent efforts to develop such measures have focused on blood DNA methylation as a biological substrate highly sensitive to changes in chronological age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fahy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Horvath and Raj, 2018</xref>). Methylation-clock algorithms have been developed to identify methylation patterns that characterize individuals of different chronological ages. However, a limitation is that individuals born in different years have grown up under different historical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schaie, 1967</xref>). For example, people born 70 years ago experienced more exposure to childhood diseases, tobacco smoke, airborne lead, and less exposure to antibiotics and other medications, and lower quality nutrition, all of which leave signatures on DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell et al., 2019</xref>). As a result, the clocks confound methylation patterns arising from early-life exposures to methylation-altering factors with methylation patterns related to biological aging during adulthood. An alternative approach is to study individuals who were all born the same year, and find methylation patterns that differentiate those who have been aging biologically faster or slower than their same-age peers. The current article reports four steps in our work toward developing a blood DNA methylation measure to represent individual variation in the pace of biological aging.</p><p>In Step 1, which we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>), we collected a panel of 18 blood-chemistry and organ-system-function biomarkers at three successive waves of the Dunedin Study, which follows a 1972–73 population-representative one-year birth cohort (N = 1037). We used repeated-measures data collected when Study members were aged 26, 32, and 38 years old to quantify rates of biological change. We modelled the rate of change in each biomarker and calculated how each Study member’s personal rate-of-change on that biomarker differed from the cohort norm. We then combined the 18 personal rates of change across the panel of biomarkers to compute a composite for each Study member that we called the Pace of Aging. Pace of Aging represents a personal rate of multi-organ-system decline over a dozen years. Pace of Aging was normally distributed, and showed marked variation among Study members who were all the same chronological age, confirming that individual differences in biological aging do emerge already by age 38, years before chronic disease onset.</p><p>In Step 2, which we previously reported, we validated the Pace of Aging against known criteria. As compared to other Study members who were the same chronological age but had slower Pace of Aging, Study members with faster Pace of Aging performed more poorly on tests of physical function; showed signs of cognitive decline on a panel of dementia-relevant neuropsychological tests from an early-life baseline; were rated as looking older based on facial photographs; and reported themselves to be in worse health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>). Subsequently, we reported that faster Pace of Aging is associated with early-life factors important for aging: familial longevity, low childhood social class, and adverse childhood experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belsky et al., 2017</xref>), and that faster Pace of Aging is associated with older scores on Brain Age, a machine-learning-derived measure of structural MRI differences characteristic of different age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elliott et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, Pace of Aging was not well-correlated with published epigenetic age clocks, which were designed to measure how old a person is rather than how fast they are aging biologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Belsky et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>In Step 3, which we report here, we distill the Pace of Aging into a measurement that can be obtained from a single blood sample. Here we focused on blood DNA methylation as an accessible molecular measurement that is sensitive to changes in physiology occurring in multiple organ systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Birney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolund et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hedman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mill and Heijmans, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morris et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wahl et al., 2017</xref>). We used data about the Pace of Aging from age 26 to 38 years in the Dunedin Study along with whole-genome methylation data at age 38 years. Elastic-net regression was applied to derive an algorithm that captured DNA methylation patterns linked with variation among individuals in their Pace of Aging. The algorithm is hereafter termed ‘DunedinPoAm’.</p><p>DunedinPoAm is qualitatively different from previously published DNA methylation measures of aging that were developed by comparing older individuals to younger ones. Those measures, often referred to as ‘clocks,’ are state measures. They estimate how much aging has occurred in an individual up to the point of measurement. DunedinPoAm is a rate measure. It is based on comparison of longitudinal change over time in 18 biomarkers of organ-system integrity among individuals who are all the same chronological age. DunedinPoAm estimates how fast aging is occurring during the years leading up to the time of measurement. Rather than a clock that records how much time has passed, DunedinPoAm is designed to function as a speedometer, recording how fast the subject is aging.</p><p>In Step 4, which we report here, we validated the DunedinPoAm in five ways. First, using the Dunedin Study, we tested if Study member’s DunedinPoAm measured when they were aged 38 years could predict deficits in physical and cognitive functioning seven years later, when the cohort was aged 45 years. Second, we applied the DunedinPoAm algorithm to DNA methylation data from a second, cross-sectional, study of adults to evaluate patterning of DunedinPoAm by chronological age and sex and to test correlations of DunedinPoAm with self-reported health and proposed measures of biological age, including three epigenetic clocks. Third, we applied the DunedinPoAm algorithm to DNA methylation data from a third, longitudinal study of older men to test associations with chronic-disease morbidity and mortality. Fourth, we applied the DunedinPoAm algorithm to DNA methylation data from a fourth, longitudinal, study of young people to test if DunedinPoAm was accelerated by exposure to poverty and victimization, factors which are known to shorten healthy lifespan. Finally, to ascertain the potential usefulness of DunedinPoAm as a measure for trials of geroprotector treatments, we applied the algorithm to DNA methylation data from a randomized trial of caloric restriction, CALERIE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ravussin et al., 2015</xref>). Earlier we reported from this trial that the intervention (two years of prescribed 25% caloric restriction) slowed the rate of biological aging as measured by a blood-chemistry biological-age composite measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belsky et al., 2018a</xref>). Here, using newly generated methylation data from blood drawn at the CALERIE baseline assessment, we tested if (a) DunedinPoAm from blood drawn before caloric restriction could predict the future rate of biological aging of participants during the two-year trial, and (b) if this prediction was disrupted in participants who underwent caloric restriction, but not among control participants.</p><p>We report promising results from this four-step research program, while appreciating that additional measurement development will be needed to support applied use of DunedinPoAm.

Biomarkers were measured in 1998, 2004, and 2010, when all cohort members were aged 26, 32, and 38 years. We composited rates of change across the 18 biomarkers to produce a single measure of aging-related decline in system integrity, termed Pace of Aging.

CALERIE randomized N = 220 adults on a 2:1 ratio to treatment of 25% caloric restriction (CR-treatment) or control ad-libitum (AL-control, as usual) diet for two years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ravussin et al., 2015</xref>). We previously reported that CALERIE participants who were randomized to CR-treatment experienced a slower rate of biological aging as compared to participants in the AL-control arm based on longitudinal change analysis of clinical-biomarker data from the baseline, 12 month, and 24 month follow-up assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belsky et al., 2018a</xref>). Among control participants, the rate of increase in biological age measured using the Klemera-Doubal method (KDM) Biological Age algorithm was 0.71 years of biological age per 12 month follow-up interval. (This slower-than-expected rate of aging could reflect differences between CALERIE Trial participants, who were selected for being in good health, and the nationally representative NHANES sample in which the KDM algorithm was developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belsky et al., 2018a</xref>].) In contrast, among treatment participants, the rate of increase was only 0.11 years of biological age per 12 month follow-up interval (difference b = −0.60 [-0.99,–0.21]). We subsequently generated DNA methylation data from blood DNA that was collected at the baseline assessment of the CALERIE trial for a sub-sample (N = 68 AL-control participants and 118 CR-treatment participants). We used these methylation data to calculate participants’ DunedinPoAm values at study baseline. We then tested if baseline DunedinPoAm could predict participants’ future rate of biological aging as they progressed through the trial.</p><p>We first replicated our original analysis within the methylation sub-sample. Results were the same as in the full sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1G</xref>). Next, we compared DunedinPoAm between CR-treatment and AL-control participants. As expected, there was no group difference at baseline (AL M = 1.00, SD = 0.05; CR M = 1.01, SD = 0.06, p-value for difference = 0.440). Finally, we tested if participants’ baseline DunedinPoAm was associated with their rate of biological aging over the 24 months of follow-up, and if this association was modified by randomization to caloric restriction as compared to ad libitum diet. For AL-control participants, faster baseline DunedinPoAm predicted faster biological aging over the 24 month follow-up, although in this small group this association was not statistically significant at the alpha = 0.05 level (b = 0.22 [-0.05, 0.49], p=0.104). For CR-treatment participants, the association of baseline DunedinPoAm with future rate of aging was sharply reduced, (b = −0.08 [-0.24, 0.09], p=0.351), although the difference between the rate of aging in the AL-control and CR-treatment groups did not reach the alpha = 0.05 threshold for statistical significance (interaction-term testing difference in slopes b = −0.30 [-0.61, 0.01], p-value=0.060).

To advance translation of these interventions, measures are needed that can detect changes in a person’s rate of biological aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moffitt et al., 2017</xref>). We previously showed that the rate of biological aging can be measured by tracking change over time in multiple indicators of organ-system integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we report data illustrating the potential to streamline measurement of Pace of Aging to an exportable, inexpensive and non-invasive blood test, and thereby ease implementation of Pace of Aging measurement in studies of interventions to slow processes of biological aging.</p><p>We conducted machine-learning analysis of the original Pace of Aging measure using elastic-net regression and whole-genome blood DNA methylation data. We trained the algorithm to predict how fast a person was aging. We called the resulting algorithm ‘DunedinPoAm’ for ‘ (P)ace (o)f (A)ging (m)ethylation’. There were four overall findings:</p><p>First, while DunedinPoAm was not a perfect proxy of Pace of Aging, it nevertheless captured critical information about Dunedin Study members’ healthspan-related characteristics. Across the domains of physical function, cognitive function, and subjective signs of aging, Study members with faster DunedinPoAm at age 38 were worse off seven years later at age 45 and, in repeated-measures analysis of change, they showed signs of more rapid decline. Effect-sizes were equal to or greater than those for the 18-biomarker 3-time point measure of Pace of Aging. This result suggests that the DNA-methylation elastic-net regression used to develop DunedinPoAm may have distilled the aging signal from the original Pace of Aging measure and excluded some noise. In sum, DunedinPoAm showed promise as an easy-to-implement alternative to Pace of Aging. Emerging technologies for deep-learning analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhavoronkov et al., 2019</xref>) may improve methylation measurement of Pace of Aging. Alternatively, integration of methylation data with additional molecular datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hasin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zierer et al., 2015</xref>) may be needed to achieve precise measurement of Pace of Aging from a single time-point blood sample.</p><p>Second, DunedinPoAm analysis of the Understanding Society and NAS samples provided proof-of-concept for using DunedinPoAm to quantify biological aging. Age differences in DunedinPoAm parallel population demographic patterns of mortality risk. In the Understanding Society sample, older adults had faster DunedinPoAm as compared to younger ones. In the NAS sample, participants’ DunedinPoAm values increased as they aged. These observations are consistent with the well-documented acceleration of mortality risk with advancing chronological age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robine, 2011</xref>). However, it sets DunedinPoAm apart from other indices of biological aging, which are not known to register this acceleration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Finch and Crimmins, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2020</xref>). DunedinPoAm may therefore provide a novel tool for testing how the rate of aging changes across the life course and whether, as demographic data documenting so-called ‘mortality plateaus’ suggest, processes of aging slow down at the oldest chronological ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>DunedinPoAm is related to but distinct from alternative approaches to quantification of biological aging. DunedinPoAm was moderately correlated with aging rates measured by the epigenetic clocks proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hannum et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Levine et al. (2018)</xref> as well as KDM Biological Age derived from clinical biomarker data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Klemera and Doubal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Levine, 2013</xref>), and with self-rated health. Consistent with findings for the measured Pace of Aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Belsky et al., 2018b</xref>), DunedinPoAm was only weakly correlated with the multi-tissue clock proposed by Horvath. DunedinPoAm was more strongly correlated with a clinical-biomarker measure of biological age, with self-rated health, with functional test-performance and decline, and with morbidity and mortality as compared to the epigenetic clocks.</p><p>Third, DunedinPoAm is already variable by young adulthood and is accelerated in young people at risk for eventual shortened healthspan. E-Risk young adults who grew up in socioeconomically disadvantaged families or who were exposed to victimization early in life already showed accelerated DunedinPoAm by age 18, consistent with epidemiological observations of shorter healthy lifespan for individuals with these exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler and Rehkopf, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Danese and McEwen, 2012</xref>). We previously found that Dunedin Study members with histories of early-life adversity showed accelerated Pace of Aging in their 30 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belsky et al., 2017</xref>). DunedinPoAm analysis of the E-Risk cohort suggests effects may be already manifest at least a decade earlier. DunedinPoAm may therefore provide a useful index that can be applied to evaluate prevention programs to buffer at-risk youth against health damaging effects of challenging circumstances.</p><p>Fourth, DunedinPoAm analysis of the CALERIE trial provided proof-of-concept for using DunedinPoAm to quantify biological aging in geroprotector intervention studies. DunedinPoAm measures the rate of aging over the recent past. Control-arm participants’ baseline DunedinPoAm correlated positively with their clinical-biomarker pace of aging over the two years of the trial, consistent with the hypothesis that their rate of aging was not altered. In contrast, there was no relationship between DunedinPoAm and clinical-biomarker pace of aging for caloric-restriction-arm participants, consistent with the hypothesis that caloric restriction altered participants’ rate of aging. Ultimately, data on DunedinPoAm for all CALERIE participants (and participants in other geroprotector trails) at trial baseline and follow-up will be needed to establish utility of DunedinPoAm as a surrogate endpoint. In the mean-time, these data establish potential to use DunedinPoAm as a pre-treatment covariate in geroprotector trials to boost statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kahan et al., 2014</xref>) or to screen participants for enrollment, for example to identify those who are aging more rapidly and may therefore show larger effects of treatment.</p><p>We acknowledge limitations. Foremost, DunedinPoAm is a first step toward a single-assay cross-sectional measurement of Pace of Aging. The relatively modest size of the Dunedin cohort and the lack of other cohorts that have the requisite three or more waves of repeated biomarkers to measure the Pace of Aging limited sample size for our machine-learning analysis to develop methylation algorithms. As Pace of Aging is measured in additional cohorts, more refined analysis to develop DunedinPoAm-type algorithms will become possible. A related issue is scaling of DunedinPoAm. The original Pace of Aging measure from which DunedinPoAm was developed is denominated in ‘years’ of physiological decline occurring per 12 months of calendar time. Units of DunedinPoAm can, in principle, be interpreted in the same way. But replication in additional cohorts is needed. In addition, our work thus far has not addressed population diversity in biological aging. The Dunedin cohort in which DunedinPoAm was developed and the Understanding Society, NAS, and E-Risk cohorts and CALERIE trial sample in which it was tested were mostly of white European descent. Follow-up of DunedinPoAm in more diverse samples is needed to establish cross-population validity. Finally, because methylation data are not yet available from CALERIE follow-up assessments, we could not test if intervention modified DunedinPoAm at outcome. Ultimately, to establish DunedinPoAm as a surrogate endpoint for healthspan, it will be necessary to establish not only robust association with healthy lifespan phenotypes and modifiability by intervention, but also the extent to which changes in DunedinPoAm induced by intervention correspond to changes in healthy-lifespan phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Prentice, 1989</xref>).</p><p>Within the bounds of these limitations, our analysis establishes proof-of-concept for DunedinPoAm as a single-time-point measure that quantifies Pace of Aging from a blood test. It can be implemented in Illumina 450 k and EPIC array data, making it immediately available for testing in a wide range of existing datasets as a complement to existing methylation measures of aging. Critically, DunedinPoAm offers a unique measurement for intervention trials and natural experiment studies investigating how the rate of aging may be changed by behavioral or drug therapy, or by environmental modification. DunedinPoAm may be especially valuable to studies that collect data outside of clinical settings and lack blood chemistry, hematology, and other data needed to measure aging-related changes to physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data sources</title><p>Data were used from five studies: the Dunedin Study, the Understanding Society Study, the Normative Aging Study (NAS), the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, and the CALERIE Trial.

Details of the study have been published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 1972</xref>). Briefly, the NAS is a closed cohort of 2280 male veterans from the Greater Boston area enrolled after an initial health screening to determine that they were free of known chronic medical conditions. Participants have been re-evaluated every 3–5 years on a continuous rolling basis using detailed on-site physical examinations and questionnaires. DNA from blood samples was collected from 771 participants beginning in 1999. We analyzed blood DNA methylation data from up to four repeated assessments conducted through 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Panni et al., 2016</xref>). Of the 771 participants with DNA methylation data, n = 536 (46%) had data from two repeated assessments and n = 178 (23%) had data from three or four repeated assessments. We restricted the current analysis to participants with at least one DNA methylation data point. The NAS was approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System and written informed consent was obtained from each subject before participation.</p><p>Mortality. Regular mailings to study participants have been used to acquire vital-status information and official death certificates were obtained from the appropriate state health department to be reviewed by a physician. Participant deaths are routinely updated by the research team and the last available update was on 31 December 2013. During follow-up, n = 355 (46%) of the 771 NAS participants died.</p><p>Chronic Disease Morbidity. We measured chronic disease morbidity from participants medical histories and prior diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2019c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lepeule et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nyhan et al., 2018</xref>). We counted the number of chronic diseases to compose an ordinal index with categories of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4+ of the following comorbidities: hypertension, type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and cancer.</p><p><bold>The Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study</bold> tracks the development of a birth cohort of 2,232 British participants. The sample was drawn from a larger birth register of twins born in England and Wales in 1994–1995. Full details about the sample are reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moffitt and E-Risk Study Team, 2002</xref>). Briefly, the E-Risk sample was constructed in 1999–2000, when 1116 families (93% of those eligible) with same-sex 5-year-old twins participated in home-visit assessments. This sample comprised 56% monozygotic (MZ) and 44% dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs; sex was evenly distributed within zygosity (49% male). Families were recruited to represent the UK population of families with newborns in the 1990 s, on the basis of residential location throughout England and Wales and mother’s age. Teenaged mothers with twins were over-selected to replace high-risk families who were selectively lost to the register through non-response. Older mothers having twins via assisted reproduction were under-selected to avoid an excess of well-educated older mothers. The study sample represents the full range of socioeconomic conditions in the UK, as reflected in the families’ distribution on a neighborhood-level socioeconomic index (ACORN [A Classification of Residential Neighborhoods], developed by CACI Inc for commercial use): 25.6% of E-Risk families lived in ‘wealthy achiever’ neighborhoods compared to 25.3% nationwide; 5.3% vs. 11.6% lived in ‘urban prosperity’ neighborhoods; 29.6% vs. 26.9% lived in ‘comfortably off’ neighborhoods; 13.4% vs. 13.9% lived in ‘moderate means’ neighborhoods, and 26.1% vs. 20.7% lived in ‘hard-pressed’ neighborhoods. E-Risk underrepresents ‘urban prosperity’ neighborhoods because such households are likely to be childless.</p><p>Home-visits assessments took place when participants were aged 5, 7, 10, 12 and, most recently, 18 years, when 93% of the participants took part. At ages 5, 7, 10, and 12 years, assessments were carried out with participants as well as their mothers (or primary caretakers); the home visit at age 18 included interviews only with participants. Each twin was assessed by a different interviewer. These data are supplemented by searches of official records and by questionnaires that are mailed, as developmentally appropriate, to teachers, and co-informants nominated by participants themselves. The Joint South London and Maudsley and the Institute of Psychiatry Research Ethics Committee approved each phase of the study. Parents gave informed consent and twins gave assent between 5–12 years and then informed consent at age 18. Study data may be accessed through agreement with the Study investigators (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://moffittcaspi.trinity.duke.edu/research-topics/erisk">https://moffittcaspi.trinity.duke.edu/research-topics/erisk</ext-link>).</p><p>Childhood Socioeconomic Status (SES). Childhood SES was defined through a standardized composite of parental income, education, and occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trzesniewski et al., 2006</xref>). The three SES indicators were highly correlated (r = 0.57–0.67) and loaded significantly onto one factor. The population-wide distribution of the resulting factor was divided in tertiles for analyses.</p><p>Childhood Victimization. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Danese et al., 2017</xref>), we assessed exposure to six types of childhood victimization between birth to age 12: exposure to domestic violence between the mother and her partner, frequent bullying by peers, physical and sexual harm by an adult, and neglect.</p><p><bold>The CALERIE Trial</bold> is described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ravussin et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, N = 220 normal-weight (22.0 ≤ BMI &lt; 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participants (70% female, 77% white) aged 21–50 years at baseline were randomized to caloric restriction or ad libitum conditions with a 2:1 ratio (n = 145 to caloric restriction, n = 75 to ad libitum). ‘Ad libitum’ (normal) caloric intake was determined from two consecutive 14 day assessments of total daily energy expenditure using doubly labeled water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Redman et al., 2014</xref>). Average percent caloric restriction over six-month intervals was retrospectively calculated by the intake-balance method with simultaneous measurements of total daily energy expenditure using doubly labeled water and changes in body composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Racette et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). Over the course of the trial, participants in the caloric-restriction arm averaged 12% reduction in caloric intake (about half the prescribed reduction). Participants in the ad libitum condition reduced caloric intake by &lt;2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ravussin et al., 2015</xref>).

KDM Biological age was measured according to the procedure described in our previous article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belsky et al., 2018a</xref>). Briefly, we computed KDM Biological Age from CALERIE blood chemistry and blood pressure data using the algorithm proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Klemera and Doubal (2006)</xref> trained in data from the NHANES following the method originally described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Levine (2013)</xref> and NHANES data from years matched to the timing of the CALERIE Trial. We included 8 of Levine’s original 10 biomarkers in the algorithm: albumin, alkaline phosphatase (log), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine (log), C-reactive protein (log), HbA1C, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol. Cytomegalovirus optical density and lung function were not measured in CALERIE. We supplemented the algorithm with data on uric acid and white blood cell count.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>DNA methylation data</title><p>DNA methylation was measured from Illumina 450 k Arrays in the Dunedin Study, NAS, and E-Risk Study and from Illumina EPIC 850 k Arrays in the Understanding Society study and the CALERIE Trial. DNA was derived from whole blood samples in all studies. Dunedin Study blood draws were conducted at the cohort’s age-38 assessment during 2010–12. Understanding Society blood draws were conducted in 2012. NAS blood draws were conducted during 1999–2013. E-Risk blood draws were conducted at the cohort’s age-18 assessment during 2012–13.

The criterion variable was Pace of Aging. Development of the Pace of Aging is described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, we conducted mixed-effects growth modeling of longitudinal change in 18 biomarkers measuring integrity of the cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, periodontal, and immune systems. Biomarkers were measured at the age 26, 32, and 38 assessments: in order of listing in Figure 3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belsky et al. (2015)</xref> glycated hemoglobin, cardiorespiratory fitness, waist-hip ratio, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio, FEV<sub>1</sub>, mean arterial pressure, body mass index, leukocyte telomere length, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, lipoprotein (a), triglycerides, gum health, total cholesterol, white blood cell count, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, HDL cholesterol, ApoB100/ApoA1 ratio. For each biomarker, we estimated random slopes quantifying each participant’s own rate of change in that biomarker. We then composited slopes across the 18 biomarkers to calculate a participant’s Pace of Aging. Pace of Aging was scaled in units representing the mean trend in the cohort, that is the average physiological change occurring during one calendar year (N = 954, M = 1, SD = 0.38). Of the N = 819 Dunedin Study members with methylation data at age 38, N = 810 had measured Pace of Aging (M = 0.98, SD = 0.09). This group formed the analysis sample to develop DunedinPoAm.</p><p>To compute DunedinPoAm in the Understanding Society, NAS, E-Risk, and CALERIE Trial datasets, we applied the scoring algorithm estimated from elastic net regression in the Dunedin Study.

To estimate the out-of-sample correlation between mPoA and the original Pace of Aging measure, we conducted 90/10 crossfold validation analysis. We randomly selected 90% of the cohort to serve as the ‘training’ sample in which the mPoA algorithm was developed. We used the remaining 10% to form a ‘test’ sample to estimate the correlation between mPoA and Pace of Aging. We repeated this analysis across 100 bootstrap repetitions. In each repetition, we randomly sampled 90% of the cohort to use in the training analysis and reserved the remaining 10% for testing.</p><p>The mPoA algorithms developed across the 100 bootstrap repetitions included different sets of CpGs (range of 21–209 CpGs selected, M = 54, SD = 27 CpGs). However, the resulting algorithms were highly correlated (mean pairwise r = 0.90, SD = 0.14). The average correlation between the 90%-trained mPoA and longitudinal Pace of Aging in the 10% test samples was (r = 0.33, SD = 0.10).

We analyzed continuous outcome data using linear regression. We analyzed count outcome data using Poisson regression. We analyzed time-to-event outcome data using Cox proportional hazard regression. For analysis of repeated-measures longitudinal DNA methylation data in the NAS, we used generalized estimating equations to account for non-independence of repeated observations of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballinger, 2004</xref>), following the method in previous analysis of those data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2018</xref>), and econometric fixed-effects regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wooldridge, 2012</xref>) to test within-person change over time. For analysis in E-Risk, which include data on twin siblings, we clustered standard errors at the family level to account for non-independence of data. For analysis of longitudinal change in clinical-biomarker biological age in CALERIE, we used mixed-effects growth models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singer and Willett, 2003</xref>) following the method in our original analysis of those data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belsky et al., 2018a</xref>). For regression analysis, methylation measures were adjusted for batch effects by regressing the measure on batch controls and predicting residual values. Dunedin Study, Understanding Society, E-Risk, and CALERIE analyses included covariate adjustment for sex (the NAS included only men). Understanding Society, NAS, and CALERIE analyses included covariate adjustment for chronological age.

The authors train the methylation Pace of Aging (mPoA) predictor in adults aged 38 enrolled in the Dunedin study, and use it to predict subsequent change in the physiologic parameters used to calculate PoA in the same cohort (age 38-45). They next perform analyses of mPoA (measured at one timepoint) in other cohorts and clinical study types to validate mPoA and explore associations with existing methylation and composite biomarkers. Validation studies include Understanding Society Study (cross-sectional, mixed age sample with existing methylation data), E-risk Study (cross-sectional; adolescent / young adults with distinct socio-environmental risk factors), and CALERIE (clinical trial, age-similar to Dunedin training cohort). Authors are commended on an excellent contribution; concerns and comments are relatively minor and should not pose a barrier to publication.</p><p>In general, this is a meritorious and well written addition to a progression of work on biomarkers of biological age in (early) middle-aged adults. The authors have previously evaluated multivariable composite biomarkers in the Dunedin longitudinal cohort and calculated the Pace of Aging (PoA). In the present study the investigators use this composite measure of change as the foundation to train a DNA-wide methylation clock tuned to PoA. In doing so, the investigators have created a first-of-its kind methylation biomarker (mPoA) to designed specifically to predict change over time rather than a static, single-timepoint measure (e.g. clocks tuned to chronologic age or phenotype). A methylation biomarker tuned to detect change is a significant contribution that could have utility as a biomarker in clinical trials designed to prevent or delay declines in health and physiologic function with age.</p><p>1) The findings in CALERIE trial are perhaps the most exciting results: mPoA measured at baseline discriminated change in the multivariable composite KDM Biological Age. It is also suggestive of potential to discriminate between treatment arms of a robust intervention on the biology of aging (caloric restriction), though this needs to be followed up with longitudinal assessment. These noteworthy findings should be emphasized. Authors suggested to restructure presentation of results. In the Abstract authors state that mPoA &quot;was disrupted by caloric restriction in the CALERIE trial.&quot; mPoA was only measured at baseline not tracked longitudinally for between group effects on change in mPoA as implied by statement. Please revise.</p><p>2) mPoA measured at single timepoint.</p><p>• That mPoA is only measured at baseline in CALERIE and at only one timepoint in the validation studies dampens enthusiasm. While the findings in the CALERIE study (Figure 4) are a substantial advancement, biomarkers with repeat measurement are critically needed. Biomarkers with test-retest reliability, sensitivity to change, and predict clinical trial endpoints (e.g. disability onset or incident disease vs. KDM change) are essential to progress. This is noted in limitations. Given iterative nature of research the reviewer trusts that this will be addressed in a future study – hopefully a study repeating mPoA at age 45 in the Dunedin cohort, or at Year 1 in the CALERIE trial when/if additional methylation data become available.</p><p>• While longitudinal change in mPoA cannot be included in this manuscript, two minor suggestions for context:</p><p>2A) The TRIIM clinical study should be referenced (a single arm clinical study in 9 men; Fahy et al., 2019). It is currently the only published report of methylation biomarker performance over time in an intervention study.</p><p>2B) The authors correctly state that &quot;measurements of the rate of biological aging are needed to serve as surrogate endpoints in trials…&quot; This is important, and additional context is needed. For example, criteria to validate surrogate endpoints would be pertinent- e.g. Prentice criteria: biomarker to be considered as a surrogate, it should a) be correlated with clinical endpoint; b) capture net effect of intervention on clinical endpoint. This will provide context and forecast next steps in logical progression of biomarker development (e.g. longitudinal assessment and prediction of clinical trial outcome).</p><p>3) Dunedin study.</p><p>• Many of the physical performance tests in Dunedin Study are likely to have ceiling effects and limited change over time would be expected given the ages and health status of the study population. That the investigators find anything useful in change over time to train the methylation clock is a wonder (reviewer anticipated &quot;flat&quot; findings like those for grip strength). Given the history of work with this cohort revision is not requested. In future it would be interesting to see how mPoA would perform if the algorithm were trained in a more diverse population with greater observable deficits in physiologic function over time.</p><p>3A) The comparison of adult (age 45) to juvenile (age 7-13) Wechsler Intelligence Scales as an index of 'cognitive decline' is puzzling.

As a result, it should be possible to investigate the relative importance of each of these biomarkers. It could help to explain how and why mPOA differs from POA and where and when it might be more or less informative. At the very least the manuscript could include a table and/or figure comparing the associations of mPOA and POA with the 18 biomarkers.</p><p>There is a distinct lack of negative/null findings in the paper suggesting that such findings may have been omitted. For example, mPOA appears to be associated with all measures of aging (except for grip strength, the only measure that apparently increases with age), and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 suggests that mPOA performs better than POA for all (except grip strength). Some functioning and aging measures used to investigate POA are not included in the present study (see e.g. Belsky et al., 2015). Why are they omitted? If mPOA really is better than POA, this should at least draw some discussion if not some follow-up analysis. It suggests that DNA methylation captures some informative biological variation lacking in the 18 underlying biomarkers, perhaps cell count variation, smoking behavior, or age?</p><p>Given the significant amount of published work related to the 'epigenetic clocks', it is critical to show that any new DNA methylation-based model of aging is not only different from previous models but superior in important ways. The manuscript only compares mPOA to other models in terms of associations with KDM Biological Age. In this comparison, mPOA is clearly superior to Horvath and Hannum, but for Levine the comparison is not so clear. It should be easy to derive Levine in the Dunedin data and test associations with functional decline and subjective aging (in fact, haven't Horvath and Hannum have already been derived in Dunedin? – see Belsky et al., 2018).</p><p>Smoking status appears central to mPOA – of the 46 CpG sites on which mPOA is based, at least 12 have been previously linked with smoking. This is explored only for the comparison with the 'epigenetic clocks' in Understanding Society and for assessing associations with SES and victimization in E-Risk. To what extent does smoking status influence the association between mPOA and POA? To what extent does smoking status influence associations/predictions of functional decline and subjective aging in Dunedin?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54870.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

We have added analysis of longitudinal, repeated-measures DNA methylation data from the Normative Aging Study (Discussion, second paragraph).

We have added analysis of an older-adult cohort, the Normative Aging Study. We report analysis of mortality, of incident and prevalent chronic disease, and of within-person change over time. DunedinPoAm is associated with mortality, future incidence of chronic disease, and prevalent chronic disease.

The elastic-net regression method we used to develop DunedinPoAm is agnostic to the biology measured by the DNA methylation marks studied. It produces a statistical summary of variance in the criterion measure, in our analysis, Pace of Aging. That statistical summary may or may not prioritize DNA methylation marks in or near genes relevant to the aging process.</p><p>We report the nearest gene to each CpG included in the algorithm in Supplementary file 1A. To address the reviewers concern, we uploaded this list to pantherdb.org to conduct genes-setenrichment analysis. There were no GO biological processes or PANTHER pathways enriched in this list at an FDR-corrected level of statistical significance. This means that DunedinPoAm is a statistical summary of variation in the multiple-biomarker measure on which it was trained, Pace of Aging. We have not included output from these analyses with our manuscript because they are easily reproduced using the gene list in Supplementary file 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be useful to provide comparisons with the other biological age measures in each of the analyses -i.e. is mPoA more sensitive to adversity in eRisk than hovarth, levine etc or does it predict difference in subsequent aging in the RCT better than KDM BA or Levine etc or even original PoA</p></disp-quote><p>Done. We now comment on this comparison at the end of each section of the Results and include tables and figures reporting effect-sizes for DunedinPoAm and the three epigenetic clocks in each of the analyses (Supplementary file 1C-G). These results show effect-sizes for DunedinPoAm are larger than for the Horvath, Hannum, and Levine epigenetic clocks. We report comparison to the original Pace of Aging measure only for the Dunedin Study because this original measure could not be computed in any of the other datasets</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The Abstract is a bit light on numbers – please add the important details such a number of participants, effects sizes, statistical significance estimates for the main results.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment.

We say “disrupted” because the prediction of future aging made by the DunedinPoAm was disrupted by the intervention: In the control-arm participants, DunedinPoAm correlated with future rate of change in KDM Biological Age. In contrast, in the treatment-arm participants this correlation was disrupted by the intervention. We have revised the Abstract to clarify: “DunedinPoAm prediction was disrupted by caloric restriction in the CALERIE trial”. .

We note that Grip Strength is the only functional test that does not show mean-level decline across the 7-year follow-up interval. As can be seen in the plots, there is substantial variation in rates of decline in this midlife cohort. We can observe this decline because the birth cohort represents the full population, with a retention rate at age 45 over 94%, which means that data for physical function are present for individuals who tend not to take part in typical research samples, including individuals who are experiencing declining function.

We compared age-45 Wechsler intelligence-test scores to Wechsler intelligence scores from ages 7-13. The Wechsler test is the most reliable measure of cognitive functioning available, and the most widely used in clinical practice. Comparison of scores on adolescent and adult versions of the test, which are matched for content, distributional properties, and psychometric properties, is a strong method to detect cognitive decline. This analysis comparing midlife IQ to adolescent IQ parallels previously published analyses of cognitive decline in the Dunedin Study (Belsky et al., 2015; Meier et al., 2012; Reuben et al., 2017), as well as in other cohorts (Deary and Batty, 2007).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3B) Please provide references on validation work for the facial aging in the text or supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.

With respect to the question of “relative importance”, the original Pace of Aging measure is a composite of slopes of change across 18 different biomarkers. Each slope is weighted equally in the composite Pace of Aging. As a result, biomarkers with slopes that correlate with slopes of other biomarkers have relatively higher overall correlations with the composite measure. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we computed correlations of DunedinPoAm with each biomarker slope and compared these to biomarker slope correlations with Pace of Aging. As expected, biomarker slope correlations with DunedinPoAm tend to be smaller as compared to correlations with Pace of Aging. However, the rank orderings of biomarker slope correlations with DunedinPoAm and Pace of Aging are similar, suggesting that biomarker slopes contribute similar information to both measures.</p><p>The plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> graphs biomarker slope correlations with DunedinPoAm (y-axis) against biomarker slope correlations with the original Pace of Aging on which Dunedin PoAm was trained(x-axis). Overall, these data do not suggest any clear differences in organ-system contributions to DunedinPoAm as compared to Pace of Aging. We are happy to take editorial guidance on inclusion of this plot.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54870-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a distinct lack of negative/null findings in the paper suggesting that such findings may have been omitted. For example, mPOA appears to be associated with all measures of aging (except for grip strength, the only measure that apparently increases with age), and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 suggests that mPOA performs better than POA for all (except grip strength). Some functioning and aging measures used to investigate POA are not included in the present study (see e.g. Belsky et al., 2015). Why are they omitted?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify. There were three measures studied in our original 2015 paper that were not included in our original submission, retinal venular caliber, retinal arteriolar caliber, and grooved pegboard testing of motor coordination.</p><p>We have added the age-45 grooved pegboard data. The results are that faster DunedinPoAm is associated with slower pegboard times at age 45 and with more decline in pegboard speed from 38 to 45, although this latter results is not statistically significant at the α=0.05 level. See Figure 2 and Supplementary file 1C.</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not yet have age-45 retinal measures available to include in this paper. The retinal vessel measures are generated from digital retina images by our collaborators at the National University of Singapore. They are currently working on this coding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If mPOA really is better than POA, this should at least draw some discussion if not some follow-up analysis. It suggests that DNA methylation captures some informative biological variation lacking in the 18 underlying biomarkers, perhaps cell count variation, smoking behavior, or age?</p></disp-quote><p>We now comment on the differential performance of DunedinPoAm and the original Pace of Aging measure in the third paragraph of the Discussion. It is possible that Dunedin PoAm captures some information lacking in the 18 biomarkers, but also possible that it contains less noise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the significant amount of published work related to the 'epigenetic clocks', it is critical to show that any new DNA methylation-based model of aging is not only different from previous models but superior in important ways. The manuscript only compares mPOA to other models in terms of associations with KDM Biological Age. In this comparison, mPOA is clearly superior to Horvath and Hannum, but for Levine the comparison is not so clear. It should be easy to derive Levine in the Dunedin data and test associations with functional decline and subjective aging (in fact, haven't Horvath and Hannum have already been derived in Dunedin? – see Belsky et al., 2018).</p></disp-quote><p>Done. The substance of the advance represented by the DunedinPoAm is that it is an entirely different kind of aging measure as compared with the so-called clocks. We now explain this in more detail in the Introduction. That said, DunedinPoAm effect-sizes are larger as compared to the epigenetic clocks in all analyses (Supplementary file 1C-G and Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 3, Figure 2—figure supplements 1-3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Smoking status appears central to mPOA – of the 46 CpG sites on which mPOA is based, at least 12 have been previously linked with smoking. This is explored only for the comparison with the 'epigenetic clocks' in Understanding Society and for assessing associations with SES and victimization in E-Risk. To what extent does smoking status influence the association between mPOA and POA? To what extent does smoking status influence associations/predictions of functional decline and subjective aging in Dunedin?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. Dunedin PoAm is not simply a marker of tobacco smoking. We have added results to Supplementary file 1C-E reporting results for analysis with covariate adjustment for smoking in all of the cohorts studied except CALERIE. (CALERIE Trial participants were all non-smokers.) Covariate adjustment for smoking does not change any of our findings, although effect-sizes in some analyses are partly attenuated in smoking-adjusted analysis. The association of the longitudinal 26-38 Pace of Aging with our age-38 methylation measure (now named “DunedinPoAm”) does not vary by smoking status.
