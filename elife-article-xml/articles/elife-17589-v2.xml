Here we show that Thrombospondin-4 (Thbs4) regulates skeletal muscle integrity and its susceptibility to muscular dystrophy through organization of membrane attachment complexes. Loss of the <italic>Thbs4</italic> gene causes spontaneous dystrophic changes with aging and accelerates disease in 2 mouse models of muscular dystrophy, while overexpression of mouse Thbs4 is protective and mitigates dystrophic disease. In the myofiber, Thbs4 selectively enhances vesicular trafficking of dystrophin-glycoprotein and integrin attachment complexes to stabilize the sarcolemma. In agreement, muscle-specific overexpression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tsp or mouse Thbs4 rescues a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of muscular dystrophy with augmented membrane residence of βPS integrin. This functional conservation emphasizes the fundamental importance of Thbs’ as regulators of cellular attachment and membrane stability and identifies Thbs4 as a potential therapeutic target for muscular dystrophy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17589.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17589.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17589.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Muscle cells, also known as myofibers, need to be robust in order to withstand the physical stresses of contracting and relaxing. As a result, the cell surface membrane that surrounds myofibers is more strongly anchored to its surroundings than that of other cells. Muscular dystrophies are a group of muscle-wasting disorders that usually arise when this surface membrane becomes less stable. For example, mutations that affect a protein called dystrophin-glycoprotein or integrin protein complexes can cause muscular dystrophy since these proteins normally keep the membrane anchored and stable when the muscle contracts and relaxes.</p><p>When myofibers in mammals become injured, as is the case during muscular dystrophy, they produce more proteins called thrombospondins – with thrombospondin-4 being the most common. However, until now it was not clear what these proteins did in muscle cells.</p><p>Vanhoutte et al. hypothesized that thrombospondin-4 may protect injured myofibers and tested their theory by first deleting the gene for thrombospondin-4 from mutant mice that were predisposed to develop muscular dystrophy. This worsened the muscle wasting in the mutant mice, and furthermore, deleting the gene for thrombospondin-4 also caused otherwise normal mice to develop muscular dystrophy in their old age. Conversely, when Vanhoutte et al. artificially increased the levels of thrombospondin-4 in the myofibers, it protected the mice against muscular dystrophy. Additional experiments conducted in fruit flies demonstrated that the protective effects of thrombospondin are conserved or similar in insects too. Lastly, biochemical experiments in mouse and rat cells showed that thrombospondin-4 aids dystrophin-glycoproteins and integrins in getting to the cell surface membrane, increasing its stability.</p><p>Overall these findings provide a clearer picture of the molecular underpinnings of muscular dystrophies. In the future, more experiments will have to focus on exactly how thrombospondins stabilize and direct dystrophin-glycoproteins and integrins to the cell surface membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Muscle degenerative diseases such as muscular dystrophy (MD) are most commonly caused by mutations in genes that are part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein (DGC) complex or the integrin complex of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grounds et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McNally and Pytel, 2007</xref>). In addition, proper post-translational processing and trafficking of these complexes to the sarcolemma are essential to form a molecular attachment network between the myofilament proteins within the myofibers and the basal lamina and extracellular matrix (ECM) outside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goddeeris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). This attachment network provides critical structural support to the plasma membrane (sarcolemma) to withstand contractile forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burr and Molkentin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grounds et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gumerson and Michele, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lapidos et al., 2004</xref>). When this attachment network is deficient in MD, membrane ruptures occur leading to intracellular calcium influx that causes myofiber necrosis, an inflammatory response, fibrosis and fatty tissue replacement, and ultimately muscle functional loss and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burr and Molkentin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gumerson and Michele, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lapidos et al., 2004</xref>). Skeletal muscle is perhaps the most sensitive of all tissues to genetic mutations in genes that impact cellular attachment complexes or membrane repair capacity, in part because of the dynamic changes in length that occurs in each myofiber during contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burr and Molkentin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grounds et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McNally and Pytel, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Thrombospondins (Thbs) comprise a family of 5 genes in mammals that encode secreted matricellular proteins involved in diverse biologic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Lawler, 2011</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schellings et al., 2009</xref>). The thrombospondin family consists of two subgroups based on their sequence conservation and oligomeric structure. Thbs3, Thbs4 and Thbs5 form pentamers and are the most similar to Thbs genes found in lower organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Lawler, 2011</xref>). Thbs1 and Thbs2 form trimers and have evolved additional domains such as a type 1 repeat important for transforming growth factor-β binding and a region that affects angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Lawler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schellings et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> contains a single thrombospondin gene (Tsp) that forms pentamers, and when deficient causes developmental lethality due to disruption in muscle and tendon attachment within the body wall segments of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Lawler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Subramanian et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>While traditionally characterized as a secreted ECM or matricellular protein over the past 3 decades, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Lawler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schellings et al., 2009</xref>) Thbs can also function within the cell, and in some systems this appears to be their primary role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambily et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brody et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duquette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKeown-Longo et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Posey et al., 2014</xref>). For example, Thbs4 was recently shown to have a critical cardioprotective function from within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it mediates an adaptive ER stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brody et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>). The traditional ER stress response involves sensing of calcium and unfolded or damaged proteins within the ER through the calcium binding chaperone protein BiP (GRP78), which binds/regulates at least 3 distinct stress response pathways initiated by either PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) or activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), each resident within the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glembotski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mori, 2009</xref>). These 3 ER stress response mediators initiate a cascade of signaling that alters protein synthesis and other features of cellular adaptation to stress or protein unfolding and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glembotski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mori, 2009</xref>). Here, Thbs4 directly binds the ER luminal domain of ATF6α to promote its shuttling to the Golgi and then nucleus, thereby inducing genes underlying adaptive aspects of the ER stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brody et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Thbs proteins move through the secretory pathway where they appear to facilitate secretion of ECM proteins or perhaps chaperone protein complexes to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Lawler, 2011</xref>). Once secreted, Thbs proteins transiently or permanently reside in the ECM where they interact with fibronectin, collagens and proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Lawler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frolova et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hauser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Södersten et al., 2006</xref>). Thbs proteins are also recycled back into the cell through the low-density receptor-related protein (LRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). One critical feature of the Thbs family is that each member is induced following injury events or in response to processes requiring tissue growth, healing and remodeling. Interestingly, Thbs4 is largely restricted to cardiac and skeletal muscle where its expression is induced with injury or disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Lawler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frolova et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hauser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schellings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Södersten et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, markers of ER stress are upregulated during progression of skeletal muscle disease and MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lavery et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moorwood and Barton, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here we observed that in response to MD in skeletal muscle, Thbs4 mRNA and protein are induced.

High levels of Thbs4 protein overexpression were observed in fast-twitch containing muscles such as the quadriceps, gastrocnemius, with intermediate levels in the diaphragm and very low levels in the soleus, while the heart lacked expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Tissue Immunofluorescent analysis revealed that Thbs4 protein was undetectable in uninjured skeletal muscle while the transgene produced abundant expression that co-localized with calreticulin to a vesicular network on the periphery of the myofibers of paraffin-embedded quadriceps and was also clearly inside of collagen I staining that marks the ECM of cryo-embedded quadriceps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, although Thbs4 protein localization appeared slightly different between paraffin- and cryo-embedded skeletal muscle of the <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse, induction of endogenous Thbs4 again showed localization within the vesicular network inside the myofibers, and only within limited regions outside of myofibers where fibrotic tissue deposition was prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with the above observations of Thbs subcellular localization, biochemical analysis revealed that Thbs4 was high in the type of glycosylation that typifies ER resident proteins, but it also contains glycosylation that is observed on proteins that transit through the Golgi in route to be deposited in the ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Interestingly, in-depth in vitro analysis demonstrated that extracellular Thbs4 is rapidly internalized by both cultured C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes and at least in the case of myoblasts is transported to rab7-positive late endosomes, potentially explaining why Thbs4 protein is low or undectable in the ECM of healthy Thbs4 Tg muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similar to the results observed with collagen I, co-labeling with another ECM/matricellular protein periostin again showed that Thbs4 could co-localize to the ECM region in <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> diseased myofibers, although under non-diseased conditions overexpressed Thbs4 was again only appreciably observed intracellularly under the sarcolemma within a peripheral vesicular pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Hence, although our observations do not exclude the possibility that non-muscle cells might also express Thbs4, our data collectively identify the myofiber as an important cellular source of Thbs4 expression, secretion and re-uptake.</p><p>Careful analysis of other markers of the ER compartment and ER stress showed that Thbs4 overexpression in skeletal muscle induced a profile very similar to diseased skeletal muscle in <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, with increased levels of nuclear ATF6α, BiP, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), calreticulin and Armet, as compared to WT muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Remarkably, transmission electron microscopy and immunogold detection revealed that Thbs4 overexpression in skeletal muscle caused a dramatic induction of sub-sarcolemmal and intramyofibrillar ER and post-ER vesicles that contained Thbs4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These Thbs4-dependent vesicles were highly uniform in size and more electron dense compared with similar vesicles in subsarcolemmal regions from WT muscle. Future studies will investigate the nature of these Thbs4-expanded vesicles and their composition based on known variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paczkowski et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To determine if Thbs4 induction in MD was adaptive or maladaptive we first crossed the Thbs4 Tg into both the <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>mdx</italic> backgrounds.

Two important clues that directed our investigation were the known augmentation in the adaptive ER stress response pathway and the dramatic increase in sub-sarcolemmal vesicles observed in skeletal muscle with Thbs4 overexpression.

Similarly, Golgi-to-sarcolemmal trafficking rates, measured with VSVG-enhanced green floursecent protein (eGFP) after inverse (i) FRAP, were significantly accelerated upon Thbs4 overexpression, which was again inhibited with ATF6α-dn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Like Thbs4, Nell2 contains an N-terminal laminin-G like (LamG) domain and an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeat domain but lacks the ATF6α interacting Type III repeat (T3R) and TSP-C domains from Thbs4. Importantly, unlike full-length Thbs4, overexpression of Nell2 or the LamG domain of Thbs4 did not increase ER-to-Golgi or post-Golgi trafficking rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F,I,J</xref>). However, overexpression of just the T3R domain of Thbs4, which functions as the ATF6α interacting region, was sufficient to accelerate ER to Golgi and post-Golgi trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). Thbs4 overexpression in skeletal muscle also augmented the levels of trafficking regulatory proteins such as Sar1, Rab24, Rab6, Rab3 and Rab8, which control ER-to-Golgi and post-Golgi vesicular trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stenmark, 2009</xref>).

As previously observed, loss of δ-sarcoglycan in skeletal muscle of <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice resulted in the near complete absence of the other sarcoglycans at the membrane (as they all form a complex; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Durbeej and Campbell, 2002</xref>). Interestingly, Thbs4 Tg alone displayed increased sarcolemmal levels of β-dystroglycan, dystrophin and β1D-integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). More importantly, the Thbs4 Tg in the <italic>Sgcd</italic> deficient background resulted in greater membrane localization of α-, β-, and γ-sarcoglycan and β-dystroglycan, as well as in dystrophin, utrophin and β1D-integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). More quantitative assessment of this effect by Western blotting of membrane-specific protein extracts showed that even the Thbs4 Tg alone gave increased membrane levels of utrophin, α- and β-dystroglycan, as well as β1D-, α7 and α5-integrins compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; red boxes), which likely explains our earlier observations whereby Thbs4 Tg skeletal muscle was protected from lengthening-contraction injury and laser injury in isolated myofibers versus WT.

More importantly, ATF6α overexpression did not increase the sarcolemmal localization of any of the membrane attachment proteins observed with Thbs4 overexpression in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). Thus, while ATF6α overexpression activated an adaptive ER stress response in skeletal muscle with a dramatic induction of intracellular and sub-sarcolemmal vesicles to an even higher level than observed in our Thbs4 overexpressing mice, it did not augment the membrane residency of membrane stabilizing proteins in muscle. Hence, our data indicate that ATF6α is only one part of a more integrated mechanism whereby Thbs4 regulates membrane stability of skeletal muscle.</p><p>Taken together, our data so far indicate that increased levels of Thbs4 itself and its trafficking through the secretory pathway are essential to increase membrane attachment protein complexes at the sarcolemma. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of a previously established adenoviral construct encoding a Thbs4 calcium-binding containing mutant that is retained in the ER (Ad-Thbs4-mCa<sup>2+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brody et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the mutant still induces an ATF6α mediated ER-stress response, both in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and when expressed in the gastrocnemius muscle of early postnatal rat pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brody et al., 2016</xref>). Utilizing an identical in vivo approach with adenoviral gene transfer into the gastrocnemius of early neonatal rat pups, we compared βgal control with full-length Thbs4 versus the Thbs4-mCa<sup>2+</sup> for effects on β1 Integrin membrane levels. The data showed that only the secretion competent full-length Thbs4, but not the full-length ER-retained Thbs4 mutant, promoted greater β1 integrin membrane occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Here, we identify a fundamental yet previously unrecognized intracellular role for Thbs4 in skeletal muscle, where it directly augments selective vesicular trafficking and chaperones DGC and integrin attachment complexes to the membrane, leading to greater stability and levels of select complexes at the sarcolemma, and thereby enhancing the mechanical stability of the myofiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

Thbs4 can then reside within the extracellular matrix (ECM) or be actively endocytosed and returned to the intracellular compartment by a recycling receptor. In addition to its established extracellular functions, combined studies in the heart and skeletal muscle now reveal that while in the ER, Thbs4 can compete with BiP (GRP78) for binding to the ER-resident transcription factor ATF6α, thereby facilitating ATF6α translocation to the Golgi for processing and subsequent shuttling to the nucleus where it regulates expression of ER stress responsive genes that are also part of the unfolded protein response (UPR). ATF6α induction in cardiac and skeletal muscle, or by overexpression in Tg mice (lower panel) causes a dramatic expansion of the ER and post-ER vesicles, as well as increased vesicular trafficking to the membrane. The ability of Thbs4 to induce ATF6α processing and nuclear trafficking also causes this same ER expansion and augmentation of intracellular vesicular trafficking to the membrane. However, Thbs4 uniquely regulates trafficking of selected integrins and dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complexes (DGC) members to the sarcolemma, thereby enhancing the mechanical stability of the myofiber, such as observed in Thbs4 Tg muscle (middle panel).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17589.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17589.026</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-17589-fig9-v2"/></fig></p><p>As secreted matricellular proteins, Thbs’ are first produced in the ER where they are glycosylated and transit to the Golgi for additional modifications, where after they traverse the remainder of the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Lawler, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of Thbs4 did not result in accumulation within the ECM, but predominantly produced an intracellular protein localization pattern within the ER and post-ER vesicular network. In fact, we have also since generated cardiac-specific Tg mice overexpressing Thbs1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 in the heart ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>] and data not shown). In these hearts all five Thbs’ reside mainly within the intracellular vesicular network and ER with only limited detectable protein accumulation outside cardiomyocytes. This is in dramatic contrast to the overexpression of an array of other matricellular proteins, such as periostin, which saturates the ECM when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oka et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, dystrophic skeletal muscle did reveal occasional Thbs4 protein accumulation in fibrotic regions around myofibers, confirming that this protein can reside for a period of time in the ECM. These dynamic localization differences at baseline versus during fibrotic disease could be attributed to Thbs recycling at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Lawler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, we observed rapid up take of recombinant Thbs4 when given exogenously to cultured C2C12 myoblasts or myotubes. It is possible that extracellular Thbs4 reuptake could occur through its designated receptor or through the integrin and DGC complexes. Indeed, other matricellular proteins such as SPARC were shown to be actively taken up back into myofibers through such a process with integrin associated endocytosis, sorting and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chlenski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Franceschi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakamura et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our data identify ATF6α as a transcriptional regulator of secretory pathway activity in muscle, a function that was previously established for the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α / X-box binding protein (IRE1α/XBP-1) axis of the canonical ER stress response pathway during plasma cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shaffer et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, although enhancement of the ATF6α-mediated adaptive ER stress pathway was sufficient to drive the dramatic expansion of the ER and post-ER vesicular content and increase vesicular trafficking to the membrane, it did not augment membrane residency of DGC and integrin attachment complexes at the sarcolemma, nor was it sufficient to protect against MD. Thus, ATF6α is only part of a more complex intracellular mechanism whereby Thbs4 regulates mechanical stability of the muscle fiber and its sarcolemma, in coordination with greater vesicle formation and trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Data from both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and zebrafish show that thrombospondin proteins localize outside of cells within the tendinous junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chanana et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Subramanian and Schilling, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Subramanian et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, vertebrate <italic>Thbs1</italic> and <italic>Thbs2</italic> genes have evolved domains that are tailored to affecting processes outside the cell, such as altering transforming growth factor-β activity and the angiogenic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Lawler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bornstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, the simplest interpretation of our data and that reported in the literature is that Thbs proteins are complex, multifactorial proteins that function both inside and outside the cell. However, our working hypothesis is that Thbs4 appears more tailored to intracellular functionality in cardiac and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), and this same paradigm appears to hold true for the other Thbs family members in other tissues. For example, Thbs1 was previously shown to localize to the intracellular side of membrane attachment sites by immunogold-electron microscopy in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hiscott et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, Thbs proteins are known to strongly interact with many different integrin heterodimers, and singular proteomic analysis of the α5β1 integrin complex identified Thbs2 as a core element of its 'interactome' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Lawler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouvard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Franceschi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Plow et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schiller et al., 2013</xref>). Our ultrastructural and biochemical analyses showed that the Thbs-integrin complex resides within the lumen of vesicles. Although further, in-depth analyses will suggest whether Thbs4 co-regulates the signaling competence of this integrin complex and the exact preassembly stage that is influenced by Thbs4 on the way to the cell surface. Finally, Thbs1 silencing or overexpression in human cancer cells was shown to decrease or enhance integrin protein levels, respectively, in the intracellular and plasma membrane compartment and thereby modulate cellular adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duquette et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">John et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, various lines of evidence indicate that Thbs proteins stabilize integrins and the DGC at membrane attachment complexes of the sarcolemma through an intracellular function. Importantly, this observation holds true in both mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic> skeletal muscle where integrin protein content at the cell membrane was increased with Thbs4 overexpression, yet very little Thbs protein was observed outside the cell in either species at baseline. While previously published data showed a large concentration of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tsp protein to the myotendinous junction in stage 16 embryos, this is also the very same region where the integrins are highly concentrated in identical foci and the data do not distinguish if Tsp in inside or outside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Subramanian et al., 2007</xref>). At earlier embryonic stages (stage 12–13) however, the Tsp protein is intracellular with a diffuse pattern similar to that of integrins that have yet to be deposited at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Subramanian et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, in later stage <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae Tsp is no longer detected in the myotendinous junctions or in tendons. Rather, a network of Tsp positive staining is observed within the muscle of larvae (<italic>unpublished observations</italic>, Talila Volk). However, in mammals Thbs4 can oligomerize with Thbs5 and be deposited in the tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hauser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Södersten et al., 2006</xref>), loss of <italic>Thbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> in mice showed altered ECM composition and weakened muscle-tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frolova et al., 2014</xref>), and altered inflammatory responses associated with arteriogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frolova et al., 2010</xref>), whereas Thbs1 and Thbs2 were shown to function from outside the cell in augmenting developmental synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christopherson et al., 2005</xref>). Hence, Thbs proteins are clearly complex regulatory proteins with intra- and extracellular functions.</p><p>One aspect of the biology that was not conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> was the ability of Thbs or Tsp overexpression to expand the intracellular vesicular compartment in this lower organism, likely because <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not rely on an ATF6-like mechanism for the ER stress response, and the Thbs interacting domain within ATF6α is not contained in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mori, 2009</xref>). Thus, the ability of Thbs proteins to activate ATF6α to augment ER protein production and secretory pathway activity is a later evolutionary adaptation beyond just stabilizing membrane attachment complexes, which in higher organisms more effectively coordinates tissue remodeling and healing through the Thbs proteins.</p><p>Taken together, the unique aspects of muscle membrane biology allowed us to uncover a previously unknown and possibly dominant intracellular function of the Thbs proteins that is evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This new model for Thbs protein function has many disease ramifications, especially in skeletal muscle, a tissue that is highly sensitive to mutations in genes that cause weaknesses in cellular attachment and membrane stability. Indeed, there is a lack of therapeutic strategies to effectively treat MD and our study suggests that this protein may provide a universal approach to strengthen the sarcolemma in skeletal muscle if employed in a gene therapy approach. Importantly, this protein is already present in muscle and it would not be perceived as a neo-antigen by viral-mediated overexpression, hence it should be well tolerated and best used in patients where the genetic basis of their MD disease is due to a loss of structural support of the sarcolemma (majority of cases).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse models</title><p>Skeletal muscle-specific transgenic mice for Thbs4 and ATF6α were generated using the modified human skeletal α-actin (Ska) promoter construct as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goonasekera et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>).

For the exercise protocol, exhaustion of the mice was assessed as greater than 10 consecutive seconds on the shock grid without attempting to re-engage running on the treadmill. Mice were then sacrificed and quadriceps, gastrocnemius and diaphragm was embedded in O.C.T. and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue sections were cut at a thickness of 7 μm, air-dried, washed in PBS and stained with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to FITC (Sigma-Aldrich, green) for 1 hr at RT to visualize the membranes. Images were taken on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S inverted microscope system equipped with NIS Elements Advanced Research (AR) microscope imaging software (Nikon Instruments Inc.

A midline incision running from the ankle to the thigh was created and the skin and fascia was gently removed leaving the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle exposed. The leg was immobilized by securing it in a custom jig (Aurora Scientific) with thumbscrews at the distal femur. A 4–0 nylon suture was tied to the distal TA securing it with a small plastic ring at the muscle tendon junction. The distal tendon was transected and the TA elevated to remove its contact with the tibia, and the muscle was mounted to a servomotor (Aurora Scientific, 305C) using the plastic ring. Two intramuscular electrodes were placed on either side of the peroneal nerve and stimulation voltages and optimal muscle length (L<sub>0</sub>) were determined and then adjusted to produce maximal isometric force (P<sub>0</sub>) at a stimulation frequency of 200 Hz. Five consecutive isometric contractions were averaged as a measure of the maximal specific tension. An additional lengthening contraction injury protocol was added in which an isometric contraction was performed to determine baseline force generation, followed by 2 consecutive 20% L<sub>0</sub> lengthening contractions, and finally another isometric contraction performed at L<sub>0.</sub> The force deficit was calculated between the first isometric contraction and those following the lengthening injury cycles (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> for schematic representation). This contraction injury protocol was repeated 2 more times and the force deficit was calculated relative to the pre-injury isometric contraction. In a subset of experiments passive tension was measured prior to the lengthening contraction protocol. Here the TA was set to L<sub>0</sub> and passively stretched to 5, 10, 15, and 20% of L<sub>0</sub>. Each stretch was held for 2 min before the length was returned to its starting position. Maximal passive tension was recorded at the peak of the stretch. A 2-min rest period occurred between each contraction for all experiments and force values were normalized to the muscle’s physiologic cross-sectional area. In some cases we observed tendon breaks during the lengthening contraction protocol. Percentage of tendon breaks, assessed by complete physical rupture of the tendon at the muscle aponeurosis, was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>C2C12 recombinant Thbs4 labeling and In vitro Thbs4 internalization assays</title><p>C2C12 mouse myoblasts (ATCC, ATCC-1772) were plated in either Ibidi μ-slide 8-well dishes (Ibidi USA, Cat# 80826) or in 6-well plates (Fisher Scientific, Cat# 353046) and maintained in DMEM/high glucose (Fisher Scientific, Cat# SH30022.01) supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum (Fisher Scientific, Cat# SH3054103) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin (Cellgro 30-0002-CI, Mediatech, Corning Life Sciences) at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Harry Dietz as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Amy Wagers (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Melissa Spencer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting study that investigates the role of thrombospondin 4 (Thbs4) in skeletal muscle. The authors report significant alterations in muscle fiber stability and myopathic disease progression in mice lacking Thbs4 and mice with transgenic overexpression of Thbs4 specifically in skeletal muscle. The work parallels to some degree a recent report from the same group on Thbs4 function in cardiac muscle, but the additional analyses of Thbs4 in skeletal muscle, together with the fly analyses, which show congruent phenotypes, are important and provide some novel information.</p><p>Overall, the work provides insights into the impacts of thrombospondins in skeletal muscle biology and implicates them as significant contributors to muscle fiber integrity. While all reviewers agreed that the work is appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>, in principle, several critical concerns emerged upon review that were shared among the reviewers and must be addressed prior to publication (see below).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors appear to have assumed that muscle (or muscle fibers) are the normal site of expression for Thrombospondin; but an alternative interpretation is that the artificial system of overexpression in muscle fibers does not reflect its normal expression pattern. WT muscle fibers do not show any intracellular Thbs4 staining or localization to vesicles suggesting that the intracellular role and protective effects may only occur with Thbs4 overexpression. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, staining for Thbs4 in wildtype muscle is not apparent, and it is impossible to tell if the protein is exclusively intracellular or not in Thbs4-Tg or <italic>Scgd<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, contrary to comments in the text (subsection “Thbs4 augments adaptive ER stress signaling in skeletal muscle and mitigates MD”, second paragraph). Likewise, co-IPs with Thbs4 and β1D-Itg only detect Thbs4/β1D-Itg complexes within vesicles with Thbs4-Tg overexpression, not in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As such, the manuscript over-interprets results that are based solely on Thbs4 overexpression, and does not acknowledge that these may not apply to normal muscles. The authors should add additional evidence supporting their interpretations, or, if not possible, they should tone down their conclusions and present their discussion in a more balanced manner to highlight this consideration.</p><p>2) The manuscript tries to &quot;sell&quot; the paper's novelty by exclusively focusing on intracellular events, and ignores, in comparison, well-established ECM functions. While the intracellular role reported here is interesting and potentially therapeutic, the ECM localization and functions of Thbs have been well established through numerous meticulous studies. This should be acknowledged and the results here presented more accurately as a novel mechanism for ECM proteins inside the cell. The last sentence of the first paragraph in the Discussion, &quot;a growing body of data uniformly suggests that Thbs proteins are not dedicated matricellular or ECM proteins&quot; overstates the case and should be removed. The second paragraph of the Discussion cites a selected set of references without acknowledging many additional papers convincingly showing Thbs4 and other Thbs in ECM (Hauser et al., 1995; Frolova et al. 1995; 2010; 2012; 2014; Christopherson et al., 2005; Sodersten and Ekman, 2006). The authors should revise the manuscript to present a more wholistic and balanced view.</p><p>3) Related to the above, co-IPs with Thbs4 and B-integrin show that Thbs4 and β1D-Itg form complexes within vesicles. Are these signaling-ready inside the cell? Are they secreted outside where Thbs4 can localize to the ECM? Is Thbs4 secretion essential for its intracellular functions? Also, if Thbs4 is actively recycled as suggested, then ectopic Thbs4 injected into the ECM should be actively internalized. This should be easily tested.</p><p>4) The interpretations of the distinct rescue phenotypes of Thbs4 overexpression versus ATF6α overexpression, together with the vesicle and membrane protein trafficking analyses, seem a bit incongruous. The protective role appears to be specific to Thbs4's interaction with ATF-6. However, ATF-6 levels are not limiting since increasing Thbs4 expression alone can rescue and protect wild-type cells. The early part of the manuscript appears to argue for an important role for ATF6α in Thbs4's functions but data in the latter half of the paper do not support this idea so strongly. Ultimately, the authors conclude that the situation is &quot;complex&quot;, and while this is undoubtedly true, and they should be congratulated for including the full complement of their data, even if it cannot be easily explained, the paper would benefit from a more extensive discussion about this and inclusion of possible models that could explain the complexity of the data available thus far. Related to this, a comparison of Thbs4 levels in non-transgenic mice, Thbs4 overexpressors and ATF6α overexpressors could be informative, as the results may reflect a dosage effect for Thbs4.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,F</xref>. Differences in expression levels between WT and <italic>Sgcd</italic>-null do not seem as great in 1F as in 1B. The authors should quantify the expression data and estimate the degree of overexpression achieved in the transgenic systems (both Thbs4 tg and ATF6α tg). It is also interesting that the induction of ATF6α, BiP, etc. does not seem to scale with Thbs4 expression level, which should be further clarified by quantification of the Western data and discussed in the text.</p><p>6) Some of the methods appear incongruous with the way the data is presented. For example, the methods state that AAV-GFP and AAV-Thbs4 were injected into contralateral limbs of the same animal, but this is not mentioned in the text or figure legend. This should be explicitly stated in the figure legend and GFP and Thbs4 levels in injected mice should be compared to uninjected mice to account for possible systemic dissemination of AAVs after intramuscular injection. Also, the authors should clarify if the samples shown are from paired samples from the same mouse, or from different mice.</p><p>7) Nuclear position within muscle cells is emphasized throughout the manuscript, but nuclear position is represented only in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and there is no discussion of its importance, which should be included.</p><p>8) Since transgenic mice were created on FVB/N and <italic>mdx</italic> and <italic>Sgcd</italic>-null are C57 background, the authors should clarify the breeding strategy and number of backcrosses performed to generate the mice used in this study.</p><p>9) The paper would benefit greatly from a model figure illustrating the intracellular function of Thbs4 within muscle fibers.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Thrombospondin mediates an intracellular vesicular attachment network that stabilizes muscle membranes&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Harry Dietz as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Amy Wagers, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>We appreciate your responsiveness to prior review. The manuscript clearly has been improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. We expect that you will be able to address these issues without the need to generate new data.</p><p>1) Please add the full analysis of Thbs4 in human muscle disease to the supplement.</p><p>2) The possibility that Thbs4 could also be expressed and have a role in non-muscle cells (as discussed in the rebuttal letter) should be mentioned at some point in the manuscript, as this is relevant to interpreting the knockout phenotypes.</p><p>3) The title and Abstract should be revised to reflect the fact that, despite addition of new data, the manuscript still cannot unequivocally resolve whether secretion and/or re-uptake essential for Thbs4's &quot;intracellular&quot; functions. Overexpression of Thbs4 with the Thbs4 Tg rescues <italic>mdx</italic> and a <italic>Sgcd</italic> mutants, and this requires Thbs4's interaction with ATF6. ATF6 Tg, as well as a Thbs4 mutant unable to interact with ATF6, both fail to rescue. The authors interpret these and other experiments (e.g. Thbs4-mCa) to mean that the Thbs4 mutant cannot be secreted and is retained in vesicles or in their words that &quot;only the fully membrane-trafficked and secretion competent Thbs4, but not the ER-retained mutant, promoted greater Β1-Itg membrane occupancy&quot; (Response to Reviewers). This would suggest that Thbs4 must be secreted to rescue, potentially supporting an extracellular protective role rather than intracellular. Instead, their interpretation is that it &quot;selectively enhances vesicular trafficking of dystrophin-glycoprotein and Itg attachment complexes to the sarcolemma&quot; or, as stated in the title, that it &quot;mediates an intracellular vesicular attachment network that stabilizes muscle membranes&quot;. As the data to support this model do not rule out the alternative, the text describing these results should be more balanced.</p><p>4) The authors suggest that there is re-uptake of Thbs4 by myofibers from the myomatrix but it remains unclear if this only occurs upon Thbs4 overexpression. They should add to the Discussion consideration of this issue as an important area for future research – particularly, whether re-uptake of Thbs4 occurs in wild-type myofibers and whether re-uptake may be mediated through Integrins or Dystroglycan.</p><p>5) The authors claim that their co-IPs show that Thbs4 in vesicles forms a complex with β1D-Itg receptors in a &quot;signaling-ready complex&quot;, but provide no direct evidence. Text should therefore be revised to indicate that signaling competence of this complex remains to be investigated.</p><p>6) As stated previously, discussion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> should be revised. There appears to be no change in the levels or distribution of B-DG or Dystro in <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.</p><p>7) Authors should comment in the text on why Thbs4 localization appears different between the section co-stained with Calreticulin (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, upper right panel) and Collagen I (lower right panel), and why the vesicles appear so different in size and distribution of electron-dense regions between WT and Thbs4 Tg in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17589.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors appear to have assumed that muscle (or muscle fibers) are the normal site of expression for Thrombospondin; but an alternative interpretation is that the artificial system of overexpression in muscle fibers does not reflect its normal expression pattern. WT muscle fibers do not show any intracellular Thbs4 staining or localization to vesicles suggesting that the intracellular role and protective effects may only occur with Thbs4 overexpression. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, staining for Thbs4 in wildtype muscle is not apparent, and it is impossible to tell if the protein is exclusively intracellular or not in Thbs4-Tg or Scgd<sup>-/-</sup>, contrary to comments in the text (subsection “Thbs4 augments adaptive ER stress signaling in skeletal muscle and mitigates MD”, second paragraph). Likewise, co-IPs with Thbs4 and β1D-Itg only detect Thbs4/β1D-Itg complexes within vesicles with Thbs4-Tg overexpression, not in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As such, the manuscript over-interprets results that are based solely on Thbs4 overexpression, and does not acknowledge that these may not apply to normal muscles. The authors should add additional evidence supporting their interpretations, or, if not possible, they should tone down their conclusions and present their discussion in a more balanced manner to highlight this consideration.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that more in-depth analysis were warranted to confirm whether our observations do indeed apply to normal muscle or are solely the result of Thbs4 overexpression. Hence, we performed a series of new experiments to address the concerns raised above.</p><p>First, newly included immunofluorescent analysis now reveals that Thbs4 protein is essentially undetectable in uninjured skeletal muscle by this type of assay, while the Thbs4 transgene produced abundant expression that co-localized with calreticulin to a vesicular network on the periphery of the myofibers but was also clearly inside of collagen I staining that marks the extracellular matrix (ECM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, in diseased skeletal muscle of the <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse, endogenous Thbs4 induction did show protein localization both within the vesicular network inside the myofibers and also within the ECM region in areas of fibrotic accumulation, thus incorporating Thbs4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similar to our results observed with collagen I, co-labeling with another ECM/matricellular protein periostin again shows that Thbs4 co-localizes to the ECM region in <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> diseased myofibers in areas of fibrosis deposition, but not appreciably in the muscle of Thbs4 TG mice that are uninjured, at least by confocal analysis. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, by biochemical fractionation of the ECM and subsequent western blotting, which is more sensitive, we can detect some Thbs4 protein in the ECM of these transgenic mice, suggesting that the overexpressed Thbs4 is progressing through the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>A description of these newly performed experiments has been added to ‘Histological Analysis and Immunohistochemistry’ subsection of the Materials and methods; these additional findings have been incorporated in the Results section and the data itself is displayed as indicated above in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>.</p><p>Second, we investigated whether Thbs4/β1D-Integrin complexes within intracellular vesicles do indeed represent a physiologic process that can be observed in WT and/or <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic>muscle. We reasoned that the signal for Thbs4 in the Thbs4 Tg samples of our initial experiments most likely masked any presence of Thbs4 in WT vesicles. Hence, a new set of β1D-integrin positive intracellular vesicles were isolated from WT and <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic>quadriceps and then blotted for the presence of Thbs4. This approach revealed that Thbs4, even though lowly expressed in WT mice, does indeed localize to β1D-integrin positive intracellular vesicles in WT and <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic>quadriceps and thus represents a physiologic process. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>.</p><p>Taken together, these data reveal that our conclusions do indeed apply to normal muscle (patho)physiology and are not the result of the artificial system of overexpression in muscle. This definitely provides an added value to our manuscript; hence we thank the reviewers and editors for their valuable input.</p><p><italic>2) The manuscript tries to &quot;sell&quot; the paper's novelty by exclusively focusing on intracellular events, and ignores, in comparison, well-established ECM functions. While the intracellular role reported here is interesting and potentially therapeutic, the ECM localization and functions of Thbs have been well established through numerous meticulous studies. This should be acknowledged and the results here presented more accurately as a novel mechanism for ECM proteins inside the cell. The last sentence of the first paragraph in the Discussion, &quot;a growing body of data uniformly suggests that Thbs proteins are not dedicated matricellular or ECM proteins&quot; overstates the case and should be removed. The second paragraph of the Discussion cites a selected set of references without acknowledging many additional papers convincingly showing Thbs4 and other Thbs in ECM (Hauser et al., 1995; Frolova et al. 1995; 2010; 2012; 2014; Christopherson et al., 2005; Sodersten and Ekman, 2006). The authors should revise the manuscript to present a more wholistic and balanced view.</italic> </p><p>We agree with this comment and have now written the Discussion to be more balanced, with acknowledgement of additional important references that clearly show extracellular functions for Thbs proteins, as suggested by the reviewers. In fact, our newly included confocal data (described in response to essential revision 1) now clearly shows that Thbs4 can accumulate in diseased skeletal muscle from dystrophic mice in areas of fibrotic deposition.</p><p><italic>3) Related to the above, co-IPs with Thbs4 and B-integrin show that Thbs4 and β1D-Itg form complexes within vesicles. Are these signaling-ready inside the cell? Are they secreted outside where Thbs4 can localize to the ECM? Is Thbs4 secretion essential for its intracellular functions? Also, if Thbs4 is actively recycled as suggested, then ectopic Thbs4 injected into the ECM should be actively internalized. This should be easily tested.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for these valuable remarks. As discussed in detail in our response to ‘essential revision 1’ we now provide additional experimental proof that Thbs4 not only localizes to β1D-integrin (Itg) positive intracellular vesicles of our Thbs4 Tg quadriceps, but also in WT and <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Furthermore, Thbs4 is indeed secreted and co-localizes in the collagen I rich extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding the myofibers of the <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> diseased myofibers, and we can detect a small amount of Thbs4 in a ECM biochemical fractionation preparation, as discussed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Hence, again our data suggest that these vesicles are indeed signaling ready and traffic through the secretory pathway resulting in incorporation of β1D-integrin in the sarcolemma and secretion of Thbs4 in the ECM (although under nondiseased conditions Thbs4 does not accumulate in the ECM as it is either degraded or taken back up through its recycling receptor; see below).</p><p>To test whether Thbs4 secretion essential for its intracellular functions we took advantage of our previously established adenoviral construct encoding a Thbs4 calcium-binding containing mutations in six DXDXDG calcium-binding sites within the T3R domain of mouse Thbs4 (Ad-Thbs4-mCa<sup>2</sup> ) (Brody et al., 2016). Interestingly, although Thbs4-mCa<sup>2</sup> contains the wildtype Thbs4 signaling peptide, it is not secreted but rather remains within the ER. However, it does induce an ATF6α mediated ER-stress, both in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and when expressed in the gastrocnemius muscle of early postnatal rat pups (Brody et al., 2016). Utilizing an identical in vivoapproach with adenoviral gene transfer into the gastrocnemius of early neonatal rat pups, we compared full-length Thbs4 versus the Thbs4-mCa<sup>2</sup> for effects on β1-Itg membrane levels, as compared to βgal control infection. The data showed that only the fully “membrane-trafficked” and secretion competent Thbs4, but not the ER-retained mutant, promoted greater β1-Itg membrane occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Hence, we conclude that Thbs4 must indeed move through the secretory pathway to chaperone at least β1-itg to the sarcolemma.</p><p>Next, we addressed the question if Thbs4 is indeed actively recycled; hence potentially explaining the limited amount of Thbs4 deposited in the ECM of our Thbs4 Tg muscles. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in reliably injecting recombinant Thbs4 protein only into the ECM of a murine skeletal muscle. Hence we relied on an in vitro approach with standard ‘internalization’ assays to assess uptake of recombinant Thbs4 by cultured C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes as previously described (Chlenski et al., 2011; Nakamura et al., 2014). Interestingly, these in vitroanalysis demonstrated that extracellular Thbs4 is indeed rapidly internalized by both C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes and at least in the case of myoblasts is transported to rab7-positive late endosomes, thus potentially explaining why the presence of Thbs4 protein is low in the ECM of healthy Thbs4 Tg muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In regards to these findings, we also removed our original statement regarding endocytosis, sorting and recycling of integrins (original submission <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>), as a more in-depth future analysis would be needed to exclusively focus on Thbs4 and integrin recycling dynamics.</p><p>A description of these newly performed experiments discussed above has been added to the Materials and methods section and our novel findings have been incorporated in the Results and Discussion section. The newly generated data itself is displayed as indicated above in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>,vE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) The interpretations of the distinct rescue phenotypes of Thbs4 overexpression versus ATF6α overexpression, together with the vesicle and membrane protein trafficking analyses, seem a bit incongruous. The protective role appears to be specific to Thbs4's interaction with ATF-6. However, ATF-6 levels are not limiting since increasing Thbs4 expression alone can rescue and protect wild-type cells. The early part of the manuscript appears to argue for an important role for ATF6α in Thbs4's functions but data in the latter half of the paper do not support this idea so strongly. Ultimately, the authors conclude that the situation is &quot;complex&quot;, and while this is undoubtedly true, and they should be congratulated for including the full complement of their data, even if it cannot be easily explained, the paper would benefit from a more extensive discussion about this and inclusion of possible models that could explain the complexity of the data available thus far. Related to this, a comparison of Thbs4 levels in non-transgenic mice, Thbs4 overexpressors and ATF6α overexpressors could be informative, as the results may reflect a dosage effect for Thbs4.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise an important question here. We had not investigated whether the discrepancy of our findings in the ATF6α overexpressors versus the Thbs4 overexpressors could reflect a dosage effect for Thbs4 or induction of ATF6α-dependent ER stress responsive factors. To directly test this, we now performed comparative immunoblot analysis and semi-quantitative analysis of these events (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We now show that skeletal muscle-specific Tg mice overexpressing ATF6α display high levels of nuclear ATF6α protein and induction of BiP, PDI and calreticulin compared to WT mice, all without influencing Thbs4 protein expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, except for PDI we noted significantly higher levels of these ATF6α-dependent ER stress responsive factors in ATF6α Tg quadriceps as compared to our Thbs4 Tg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, this indicates that Thbs4-induced ATF6α dependent ER stress itself is not sufficient to produce the membrane stabilizing effect we observed in the Thbs4 Tg mice, even when induced at higher levels than those observed in the Thbs4 Tg itself. However, that Thbs4 itself and its trafficking through the secretory pathway plays a pivotal role in the membrane stabilizing effect of Thbs4 is now better supported in our revised manuscript as discussed above in point #3, where we discuss how Thbs4 must indeed move through the secretory pathway to the membrane to chaperone at least β1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that adding a model figure that illustrates the intracellular function of Thbs4 within muscle fibers would be a great added value to our manuscript. Hence, newly included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> now provides a comprehensive model of our proposed intracellular mechanism, in addition to models that illustrate the differences we observe between when overexpressing Thbs4 as compared to ATF6α overexpressing muscle.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,F</xref>. Differences in expression levels between WT and Sgcd-null do not seem as great in 1F as in 1B. The authors should quantify the expression data and estimate the degree of overexpression achieved in the transgenic systems (both Thbs4 tg and ATF6α tg). It is also interesting that the induction of ATF6α, BiP, etc. does not seem to scale with Thbs4 expression level, which should be further clarified by quantification of the Western data and discussed in the text.</italic> </p><p>In agreement with the reviewers remark we have now quantified the expression levels of the immunoblots <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and F</xref> and present these present this analysis in a newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, as extensively discussed in response to the ‘essential revision 4’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> now includes new immunoblots and their semi-quantitative analysis that estimates the degree of Thbs4 and nuclear ATF6α achieved in both Thbs4 Tg and ATF6α Tg quadriceps and their induction of Bip, PDI and calreticulin. These new results have been discussed in the Results section. As indicated above, the newly generated data itself can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) Some of the methods appear incongruous with the way the data is presented. For example, the methods state that AAV-GFP and AAV-Thbs4 were injected into contralateral limbs of the same animal, but this is not mentioned in the text or figure legend. This should be explicitly stated in the figure legend and GFP and Thbs4 levels in injected mice should be compared to uninjected mice to account for possible systemic dissemination of AAVs after intramuscular injection. Also, the authors should clarify if the samples shown are from paired samples from the same mouse, or from different mice.</italic> </p><p>We would like to apologize to the reviewers if description of the AAV9 experimental approach in the original manuscript was unclear. We agree with the reviewer’s comment that if AAV9-eGFP and AAV9-Thbs4 were to be injected into contralateral limbs from the same animal that there could (i) be potential systemic dissemination of AAVs after intramuscular injection and that (ii) additional experimental controls such as untreated muscles would be appropriate. However, our original submitted data was derived from mice in which we did not mix the AAVs in a single animal. In other words, we treated both left and right gastrocnemius muscles of 3-day old <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice with either AAV9-eGFP or in separate pups, only AAV9-Thbs4. Mice were sacrificed at 6 weeks of age. The left gastrocnemius of each mouse was fixed, processed, paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&amp;E and Masson’s Trichrome, whereas the right muscles were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -80°C. Hence the samples shown in the figure are from different mice.</p><p>To avoid potential confusion for the reader regarding our experimental setup, we now specifically clarify our approach in the Results section, the ‘Adeno-associated virus (AAV) Serotype-9 Production and injection’ subsection of the Materials and methods and the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) Nuclear position within muscle cells is emphasized throughout the manuscript, but nuclear position is represented only in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and there is no discussion of its importance, which should be included.</italic> </p><p>In agreement with the reviewer’s comment, the revised manuscript now includes (i) a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> displaying H&amp;E histological assessment of central nucleation from quadriceps with Thbs4 overexpression or when crossed into both Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup> and mdx dystrophic backgrounds; (ii) H&amp;E images were added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>; and (iii) discussion of what central nucleation represents is also now given in the revised paper.</p><p><italic>8) Since transgenic mice were created on FVB/N and mdx and Sgcd-null are C57 background, the authors should clarify the breeding strategy and number of backcrosses performed to generate the mice used in this study.</italic> </p><p>In agreement with the reviewer’s comment, we expanded the ‘mouse models’ subsection of the Materials and methods with the breeding strategy and number of backcrosses performed to generate the mice used in our study.</p><p>More specifically, the ‘Mouse Models’ subsection now state: “Next, Ska-Thbs4-Tg, ska-ATF6α-Tg and Thbs4<sup>-/-</sup> mice were backcrossed for at least 6 generations into the <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background to generate <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Thbs4-Tg mice, <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ATF6α-Tg mice and <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup> Thbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, as well as their littermate controls.

Hence, newly included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> now provides a comprehensive model of our proposed intracellular mechanism. In addition, this figure and accompanying figure legend also includes models to illustrate the differences we observe between when overexpressing Thbs4 as compared to ATF6α overexpressing muscle.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) Please add the full analysis of Thbs4 in human muscle disease to the supplement.</italic> </p><p>In agreement with the reviewers remark we now display the analysis of Thbs4 mRNA relative expression levels in all 11 human muscle diseases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>. In addition, the ‘Thbs4 augments adaptive ER stress signaling in skeletal muscle and mitigates MD’subsection of the Results section and figure legends for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> have been adjusted accordingly.</p><p><italic>2) The possibility that Thbs4 could also be expressed and have a role in non-muscle cells (as discussed in the rebuttal letter) should be mentioned at some point in the manuscript, as this is relevant to interpreting the knockout phenotypes.</italic> </p><p>As correctly pointed out by the reviewers our current findings do not rule out other, non-muscle cells as other potential cellular sources of Thbs4 expression and secretion in skeletal muscle. As requested, following statement was added to the <italic>‘</italic>Thbs4 augments adaptive ER stress signaling in skeletal muscle and mitigates MD’subsection of the Results section: “Hence, although our findings currently do not rule out that other, non-muscle cells in thedystrophic muscle might express and secrete Thbs4, our data collectively identify the myofiber as an important cellular source of Thbs4 expression, secretion and re-uptake.”</p><p><italic>3) The title and Abstract should be revised to reflect the fact that, despite addition of new data, the manuscript still cannot unequivocally resolve whether secretion and/or re-uptake essential for Thbs4's &quot;intracellular&quot; functions. Overexpression of Thbs4 with the Thbs4 Tg rescues mdx and a-Sgcd mutants, and this requires Thbs4's interaction with ATF6. ATF6 Tg, as well as a Thbs4 mutant unable to interact with ATF6, both fail to rescue. The authors interpret these and other experiments (e.g. Thbs4-mCa) to mean that the Thbs4 mutant cannot be secreted and is retained in vesicles or in their words that &quot;only the fully membrane-trafficked and secretion competent Thbs4, but not the ER-retained mutant, promoted greater Β1-Itg membrane occupancy&quot; (Response to Reviewers). This would suggest that Thbs4 must be secreted to rescue, potentially supporting an extracellular protective role rather than intracellular. Instead, their interpretation is that it &quot;selectively enhances vesicular trafficking of dystrophin-glycoprotein and Itg attachment complexes to the sarcolemma&quot; or, as stated in the title, that it &quot;mediates an intracellular vesicular attachment network that stabilizes muscle membranes&quot;. As the data to support this model do not rule out the alternative, the text describing these results should be more balanced.</italic> </p><p>Although we believe that our data make a strong case that Thbs4 does indeed mediate an intracellular vesicular attachment network that stabilizes muscle membranes from inside the myofiber, there are rarely absolutes and our findings do not definitively demonstrate an exclusive intracellular function for Thbs4. Hence, as suggested we have changed the title and Abstract of the revised paper to remove the implication that Thbs4 functions intracellularly. Further studies are currently ongoing and will hopefully shed an unequivocal light on this pressing question. The exact changes are:</p><p>Title: “Thrombospondin mediates an intracellular vesicular attachment network that stabilizes muscle membranes” to “Thrombospondin expression in myofibers stabilizes muscle membranes”.</p><p><italic>Revised the last sentence of the Abstract from “This functional conservation emphasizes the fundamental importance of Thbs’ asintracellular regulators of cellular attachment and membrane stability and identifies Thbs4 as a potential therapeutic target for muscular dystrophy” to “This functional conservation emphasizes the fundamental importance of Thbs’ as regulators of cellular attachment and membrane stability and identifies Thbs4 as a potential therapeutic target for muscular dystrophy.”</italic></p><p><italic>4) The authors suggest that there is re-uptake of Thbs4 by myofibers from the myomatrix but it remains unclear if this only occurs upon Thbs4 overexpression. They should add to the Discussion consideration of this issue as an important area for future research – particularly, whether re-uptake of Thbs4 occurs in wild-type myofibers and whether re-uptake may be mediated through Integrins or Dystroglycan.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for their constructive comment. We agree that this finding opens up an important area for future research and have therefore extended the Discussion of our manuscript on the re-uptake of Thbs4 into the myofiber with the following consideration:</p><p>“These dynamic localization differences at baseline versus during fibrotic disease could be attributed to Thbs recycling at the cell surface (Adams and Lawler, 2011; Wang et al., 2004). Indeed, we observed rapid up take of recombinant Thbs4 when given exogenously to cultured C2C12 myoblasts or myotubes. It is possible that extracellular Thbs4 reuptake could occur through its designated receptor or through the integrin and DGC complexes. Indeed, other matricellular proteins such as SPARC were shown to be actively taken up back into myofibers through such a process with integrin associated endocytosis, sorting and recycling (Chlenski et al., 2011; De Franceschi et al., 2015; Nakamura et al., 2014).”</p><p><italic>5) The authors claim that their co-IPs show that Thbs4 in vesicles forms a complex with β1D-Itg receptors in a &quot;signaling-ready complex&quot;, but provide no direct evidence. Text should therefore be revised to indicate that signaling competence of this complex remains to be investigated.</italic> </p><p>As pointed out by the reviewers our data indeed do not provide direct evidence to support that Thbs4 in vesicles forms a complex with β1D-integrin in a ‘signaling-ready complex’. Hence, we have revised our original statement in the Discussion of the manuscript:</p><p>“Our ultrastructural and biochemical analyses showed that the Thbs-integrin complex resides withinthe lumen of vesicles, likely in their preassembly stage on their way to the cell surface.”</p><p>to:</p><p>“Our ultrastructural and biochemical analyses showed that the Thbs-integrin complex resides withinthe lumen of vesicles. Although further, in-depth analyses will suggest whether Thbs4 co-regulates the signaling competence of this integrin complex and the exact preassembly stage that is influenced by Thbs4 on the way to the cell surface.”</p><p><italic>6) As stated previously, discussion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> should be revised. There appears to be no change in the levels or distribution of B-DG or Dystro in Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We apologise to the reviewers for how we reworded this sentence and we agree it was not very clear. In agreement with the reviewers comment we have now corrected our original discussion of the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, stating “As previously observed, loss of δ-sarcoglycan in skeletal muscle of <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice resulted in the near complete absence of the other sarcoglycans at the membrane (as they all form a complex), with reductions in dystroglycan and dystrophin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (Durbeej and Campbell, 2002).”</p><p>to:</p><p>“As previously observed, loss of δ-sarcoglycan in skeletal muscle of <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice resultedin the near complete absence of the other sarcoglycans at the membrane (as they all form a complex; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (Durbeej and Campbell, 2002).”</p><p><italic>7) Authors should comment in the text on why Thbs4 localization appears different between the section co-stained with Calreticulin (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, upper right panel) and Collagen I (lower right panel), and why the vesicles appear so different in size and distribution of electron-dense regions between WT and Thbs4 Tg in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this valuable comment. Unfortunately, we were unable to co- label tissue sections with Thbs4 and ER marker calreticulin, on the one hand, or Thbs4 and collagen I or periostin, on the other hand, using a singular tissue processing method. As originally described in detail in the Materials and methods section co-staining with calreticulin occurred on paraffin-embedded muscle sections, whereas co-staining with either collagen I or periostin was performed using cryo-embedded tissue sections. Hence, we believe that Thbs4 localization appears slightly different due to differences in tissue processing and subsequent Thbs4 epitope availability for antibody binding. To clarify and further underscore this for the reader, we have revised our original Results section:</p><p>“Tissue Immunofluorescent analysis revealed that Thbs4 protein was undetectableinuninjured skeletal muscle while the transgene produced abundant expression that co-localized with calreticulin to a vesicular network on the periphery of the myofibers that was also clearly inside of collagen I staining that marks the ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, in diseased skeletal muscle of the <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse, endogenous Thbs4 induction showed protein localization again within the vesicular network inside the myofibers, but also within regions of ECM that had fibrotic tissue deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).”</p><p>to:</p><p>&quot;Tissue Immunofluorescent analysis revealed that Thbs4 protein was undetectable inuninjured skeletal muscle while the transgene produced abundant expression that co-localized with calreticulin to a vesicular network on the periphery of the myofibers of paraffin-embedded quadriceps and was also clearly inside of collagen I staining that marks the ECM of cryo- embedded quadriceps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, although Thbs4 protein localization appeared slightly different between paraffin- and cryo-embedded skeletal muscle of the <italic>Sgcd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse, induction of endogenous Thbs4 again showed localization within the vesicular network inside the myofibers, and only within limited regions outside of myofibers where fibrotic tissue deposition was prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).&quot;</p><p>Secondly, using transmission electron microscopy and immunogold detection we do indeed consistently observe that overexpression of Thbs4 induces a very large expansion of seemingly homogenously smaller sized, Thbs4 dens, sub-sarcolemmal and intramyofibrillar ER and post-ER vesicles, as compared to the irregularly sized, less electron-dense, Thbs4 containing vesicles observed in WT muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Although highly interesting, the molecular machinery that determines vesicular size, in general, and in our case is driving this altered vesicular phonotype observed upon Thbs4 overexpression is poorly understood and currently still under investigation. Nevertheless, to highlight these findings and our future efforts, we have revised the original discussion of these results from:</p><p>“Remarkably, Thbs4 overexpression in skeletal muscle caused a dramatic induction <italic>of</italic> sub-sarcolemmal and intramyofibrillar ER and post-ER vesicles that also contain Thbs4, as shown by transmission electron microscopy and immunogold detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

These Thbs4-dependent vesicles were highly uniform in size and moreelectron dense compared with similar vesicles in subsarcolemmal regions from WT muscle. Future studies will investigate the nature of these Thbs4-expanded vesicles and their composition based on known variables (Malhotra and Erlmann, 2015; Paczkowski et al., 2015).&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
