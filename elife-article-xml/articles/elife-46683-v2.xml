by patterning the ventral neural tube, which establishes MN progenitor identity. It remains unknown, however, if Shh signaling plays a role in generating columnar diversity of MNs that connect distinct target muscles. Here, we report that Shh, expressed in MNs, is essential for the formation of lateral motor column (LMC) neurons in vertebrate spinal cord. This novel activity of Shh is mediated by its downstream effector ARHGAP36, whose expression is directly induced by the MN-specific transcription factor complex Isl1-Lhx3. Furthermore, we found that AKT stimulates the Shh activity to induce LMC MNs through the stabilization of ARHGAP36 proteins. Taken together, our data reveal that Shh, secreted from MNs, plays a crucial role in generating MN diversity via a regulatory axis of Shh-AKT-ARHGAP36 in the developing mouse spinal cord.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ARHGAP36</kwd><kwd>motor neuron</kwd><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>sonic hedgehog</kwd><kwd>Isl1</kwd><kwd>Lhx3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003710</institution-id><institution>Korea Health Industry Development Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HI17C0447</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Seunghee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS100471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Soo-Kyung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Shh, produced by postmitotic spinal neurons, plays crucial roles in the specification of the lateral motor column of the spinal cord through ARHGAP36.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spinal motor neurons (MNs) innervating the limb are contained within the lateral motor columns (LMCs), which are produced specifically at brachial and lumbar levels of the spinal cord. LMC neurons are subsequently divided into two populations, lateral LMC (LMCl) neurons that innervate the dorsal part of the limb and medial LMC (LMCm) neurons that innervate the ventral part of the limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Landmesser, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hollyday, 1980a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hollyday, 1980b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tosney and Landmesser, 1985b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tosney and Landmesser, 1985a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sockanathan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ji et al., 2006</xref>). The molecular mechanism of how morphogenetic signaling molecules cooperate with transcription factors to define MN subtype specification has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shirasaki and Pfaff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee and Pfaff, 2001</xref>). Retinoic acid (RA) is essential for the diversification of MN subtype and MN columnar organization. At brachial level, within the LMCs, RA is synthesized in subpopulations of MNs expressing the RA-synthesizing enzyme, RALDH2, and specifies migrating MN precursor cells into the LMCl neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vermot et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sockanathan et al., 2003</xref>). However, it remains poorly understood whether other signaling molecules also contribute to the specification and/or maintenance of LMC and other MN columns.</p><p>Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is a highly conserved pathway that is essential in directing cell proliferation and patterning during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ingham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>). In spinal neuron development, Shh, released from the notochord and floor plate, leads to the generation of distinct classes of progenitor domains including MN progenitor (pMN) within the ventral side of spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee and Pfaff, 2001</xref>). In Shh-responsive cells, protein kinase A (PKA) plays crucial roles in fate specification and proliferation by modulating the activity of Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kotani, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asaoka, 2012</xref>). In the absence of Shh, PKA phosphorylates Gli transcription factors, promoting the production of repressor forms of Gli and thus repressing the Shh target gene expression, while Shh antagonizes this action of PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2009</xref>). As both decreased and increased activity of PKA results in abnormal cell proliferation and cell fate specification, the basal level of PKA activity should be precisely controlled spatiotemporally to ensure its proper action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kotani, 2012</xref>). PKA activation occurs upon binding of cyclic AMP (cAMP) to its regulatory subunits (PKAR), causing the release of its catalytic subunits (PKAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor et al., 1990</xref>). Shh is able to induce phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)-dependent AKT phosphorylation in cell lines such as LIGHT cells and HUVEC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riobó et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, PI3-kinase-dependent AKT activation further potentiates Shh signaling in the neuronal fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riobó et al., 2006</xref>). It was suggested that AKT might target proteins that modulate PKA kinase activity or the interaction between PKA and Gli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riobó et al., 2006</xref>), but the identity of such proteins remain unknown.</p><p>During MN development, two LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcription factors, Islet-1 (Isl1) and LIM homeobox-3 (Lhx3) act as essential players in MN fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pfaff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sharma et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanabe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thaler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>) by forming a hexameric complex, named the Isl1-Lhx3 complex, which consists of two Isl1:Lhx3 dimers and a nuclear LIM interactor (NLI) dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Genome-wide analyses of the Isl1-Lhx3 complex binding sites from chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mazzoni et al., 2013</xref>) combined with MN transcriptome analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mazzoni et al., 2013</xref>) identified many novel signaling pathways and regulators that are directly regulated by the Isl1-Lhx3 complex. Studies of individual target genes of the Isl1-Lhx3 complex in MN specification uncovered critical effector genes in MN specification such as genes involved in cholinergic neuronal identity determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2014</xref>), miR-218 as a downstream effector of Isl1-Lhx3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thiebes et al., 2015</xref>) and STAM1 as an endosomal sorting machinery necessary for ventral motor axon projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nam and Lee, 2016</xref>).</p><p>ARHGAP36, a putative Rho GTPase-activating protein, was identified from a genome-scale cDNA overexpression screen as a positive regulator of the Shh pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rack et al., 2014</xref>). Overexpression of ARHGAP36 recapitulates Shh signaling transduction and these effects are independent of Smo and require kinesin family member 3a (Kif3a) and intraflagellar transport protein 88 (Ift88) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rack et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, ARHGAP36 has emerged as a potent antagonist of PKA signaling. ARHGAP36 interacts with PKAC and inhibits PKAC catalytic activity as a PKA pseudosubstrate inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eccles et al., 2016</xref>). It also targets PKAC for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eccles et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, ARHGAP36 interaction with Patched1 leads to the removal of centrosomal ARHGAP36 with ciliary Patched1 and the accumulation of centrosomal PKA that phosphorylates Inversin and this Patched1-ARHGAP36-PKA-Inversin axis determines the ciliary translocation of Smoothened and consequent hedgehog pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Although recent studies in cultured cells suggest that ARHGAP36 regulates Shh activity through inhibiting PKA kinase activity, it remains unexplored whether ARHGAP36 functions as a key modulator of Shh signaling pathway in vivo.</p><p>Here we report that Shh expression is induced in postmitotic MNs at brachial and lumbar levels but not at thoracic level at later stages of development when motor columnar identities are established. Shh is required for proper LMC formation as the knock-down of <italic>Shh</italic> in the developing chick spinal cord and the deletion of <italic>Shh</italic> in the developing MNs of mouse embryos result in reduction of FoxP1<sup>+</sup> LMC. We further show that ARHGAP36 is a critical MN-enriched Shh transduction component and <italic>Arhgap36</italic> is a direct target gene of Isl1-Lhx3 complex during MN generation. The action of ARHGAP36 is to promote Gli-dependent transactivation partly through inhibition of PKA activity. Moreover, AKT, known as an inhibitor of PKA activity, interacts with ARHGAP36 and stabilizes ARHGAP36 protein, which further enforces suppression of PKA activity by ARHGAP36. Consistently, blocking AKT activity reduces the protein level of ARHGAP36 and hinders the efficiency of in vitro MN differentiation from mouse ESCs. Consistently, deletion of <italic>Arhgap36</italic> gene in mouse results in defects in LMC formation at brachial level, which might be caused by dysregulation of Shh signaling pathway. Our results define a new regulatory axis of Shh-AKT-ARHGAP36-PKA in LMC specification, in which ARHGAP36 functions as an essential effector of Shh and AKT in repressing PKA activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Shh is expressed in LMC neurons in developing mouse and chick spinal cord</title><p>While searching for extrinsic signaling molecules for LMC specification other than RA, we found that Shh shows an interesting expression pattern in ventro-lateral region of spinal cord where LMC neurons are located. At earlier stages, Shh is mainly detected in the notochord (NC) and floor plate (FP) of the mouse and chick embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitgood and McMahon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oppenheim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martí and Bovolenta, 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When MNs begin to be segregated into distinct motor columns, Shh is also detected in the LMC region at brachial and lumbar level but not at the thoracic level in chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitgood and McMahon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oppenheim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martí and Bovolenta, 2002</xref>) and mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). To provide the detailed expression of Shh, we performed in situ hybridization (ISH) for chick Shh and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for well-defined markers for motor columns in chick embryos (HH St.29). Our analyses showed that Shh is expressed in LMCm (Isl1<sup>+</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) but not LMCl (Isl1<sup>-</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) at brachial level, and interestingly, it is expressed in LMCl (Isl1<sup>-</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) at lumbar level. Shh expression is clearly excluded from MMC (Lhx3<sup>+</sup> MNs) at all axial levels, as demonstrated by converging analyses of Lhx3 and Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The expression of Shh in motor neurons of mouse embryo is much lower than that of in chick embryo and it is rather restricted to LMCl region at different developmental stages examined so far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As we examined the comparable developmental stages in mouse and chick embryos, the sensitivity differences in ISH outcomes may reflect species differences. Nonetheless, our analyses in both mouse and chick embryos demonstrate the expression of Shh in postmitotic motor neurons.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46683.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Shh is expressed in LMC neurons in developing mouse and chick spinal cord.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ISH analysis of mouse spinal cord (dotted outline) showed the expression of Shh in FP and LMC region (arrowhead) at later stages when motor columns are specified.

We misexpressed shRNA-Shh or shRNA-vector control in neural progenitors of the developing spinal cord by using <italic>in ovo</italic> electroporation and harvested embryos 4 days post electroporation when motor columns are established. <italic>In ovo</italic> electroporation of shRNA vector resulted in the expression of GFP throughout the electroporated spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). First, we confirmed the specific reduction of <italic>Shh</italic> expression in LMC region but not in the floor plate of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). In our electroporation condition, the electroporation efficiency of the floor plate cells is generally very low. Thus, we expected that Shh knock-down would be mostly effective in motor neurons but not in the floor plate, allowing us to focus on analyzing the effect of Shh loss-of-function (LOF) on motor columnar specification without significant changes in progenitor proliferation or early patterning of the neural tube. Furthermore, we analyzed the chick embryos that do not express GFP in the floor plate, which was further confirmed by ISH analyses of Shh expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). Our analyses including careful quantification indeed revealed that there’s no significant change in proliferation (BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells), survival (cCasp3<sup>+</sup> cells) of neural progenitors or ventral neural patterning (Olig2<sup>+</sup> and Nkx2.2<sup>+</sup> cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). These rigorous analyses exclude the possibility that any observed phenotypes are caused by the effect of Shh deletion in the progenitors. Newborn motor neurons express Isl1, Lhx3 and Hb9. As the motor neurons are segregated into different motor columns, MMC neurons keep on expressing Isl1, Lhx3 and Hb9 while LMC neurons lose Lhx3 expression and gain FoxP1 expression. Thus, FoxP1 marks LMC neurons including both LMCm (Isl1<sup>+</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) and LMCl (Hb9<sup>+</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) neurons, whereas Isl1 and Hb9 label both MMC and hypaxial motor column (HMC) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and 5E). The number of LMCl (Hb9<sup>+</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) neurons of the sh-Shh injected embryos showed approximately 26% reduction compared to the uninjected control side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). However there was no effect on other motor columns, and consequently the number of total MNs was reduced by knock-down of Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), suggesting that Shh plays an essential role in specifying the FoxP1<sup>+</sup> LMC neuronal identity.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46683.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Shh signaling is required for LMC specification in chick spinal cord.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IHC analyses in chick spinal cords electroporated with sh-Shh and sh-vector construct.

We generated a mouse ESC line, in which doxycycline (Dox) induces the expression of ARHGAP36 (iARHGAP36-ESCs) and tested whether ARHGAP36 can replace the activity of Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The iARHGAP36-ESCs enabled us to control the exact timing of ARHGAP36 expression by treating the cells with Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We used conventional MN differentiation method with retinoic acid (RA) and Shh agonist (Smoothened agonist, SAG) to compare the efficiency of MN generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). iARHGAP36-ESCs treated with RA and SAG exhibited effective MN differentiation, as determined by the induction of MN markers such as Hb9. iARHGAP36-ESCs treated with RA and Dox without SAG differentiated into neurons as marked by TuJ1 expression, but failed to induce the MN gene, Hb9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting that ARHGAP36 alone is not sufficient to activate Shh downstream pathway to promote the initial ventralization and MN induction in mESCs. These results suggest that Shh ligand is likely needed for ARHGAP36 to function properly in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>ARHGAP36 mediates the positive effect of AKT in Shh signaling</title><p>To fully understand the nature of ARHGAP36 function, we tried to identify signaling pathways that regulate the activity of ARHGAP36 through post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation. We adopted GPS 3.0 website for predicted sites based on protein sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xue et al., 2005</xref>). We found several predicted phosphorylation sites in ARHGAP36 proteins, and AKT kinase was one of the high ranked kinase (data not shown). Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)-dependent AKT activation plays an essential role in Shh signaling by antagonizing PKA-mediated Gli inactivation in the specification of neuronal fates in chicken neural explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riobó et al., 2006</xref>). To test whether ARHGAP36 functions as a downstream effector of AKT, we transfected ARHGAP36 with AKT constructs in HEK293T cells and measured the protein levels of ARHGAP36 in the presence of AKT. As ARHGAP36 is not expressed endogenously in HEK293T cells, ARHGAP36 proteins are expressed only from the ARHGAP36-encoding plasmid, in which CMV promoter drives the transcription of ARHGAP36. Interestingly, wild type AKT (WT) and constitutively active myristoylated form of AKT (CA), but not a nonphosphorylatable dominant negative form of mutant AKT (DN), stabilized ARHGAP36 proteins robustly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), suggesting that AKT increases ARHGAP36 proteins likely by stabilizing ARHGAP36 protein, rather than activating the ARHGAP36 promoter transcriptionally. We also found that the half-life of ARHGAP36 protein, treated with cycloheximide that blocks the protein translation, was prolonged in the presence of AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This stabilization of ARHGAP36 protein by AKT WT was reversed by AKT inhibitor, but the CA form of AKT was not affected by AKT inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Also AKT and ARHGAP36 associated with each other in co-immunoprecipitation assays and this association was decreased by treatment of AKT inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The CA form of AKT interacted with ARHGAP36 more robustly than WT AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 showed relatively low expression in the spinal cord but they were specifically enriched in the lateral region of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We also examined the expression patterns of PKA catalytic isoforms and regulatory isoforms using ISH. Most of them were expressed in the lateral region of the spinal cord, while PKA CA, CB, RIb and RIIa were more enriched in the LMC region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Given the relatively high expression of AKT and PKA in ventro-lateral region of the spinal cord and the role of Shh in inducing the activation of AKT in cell lines such as LIGHT cells and HUVEC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riobó et al., 2006</xref>), we proposed that Shh expressed in the motor neurons triggers AKT activation, which in turn stabilizes the protein level of ARHGAP36 in LMC neurons.

LMCl neurons are born later than LMCm neurons, and these LMCl neurons have to migrate through earlier born LMCs.

In this report, we discovered a novel role of Shh in inducing LMC specification, which involves coordination of multiple signaling pathways by ARHGAP36, a key modulator of Shh signaling pathway. First, we discovered that Shh is expressed in MNs at brachial and lumbar levels of the spinal cord where LMC neurons are specified and is required for proper LMC formation in developing chick and mouse spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Second, we identified ARHGAP36, along with Shh, as a protein highly expressed in the LMC regions of differentiating MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Third, ARHGAP36 modulates the activity of PKA, an inhibitor of Shh pathway, thereby enhancing the activity of Gli-dependent transcription in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Fourth, ARHGAP36 levels seem to be tightly regulated by AKT during MN generation, as shown by the increase of ARHGAP36 protein levels by WT AKT and a constitutively active form of AKT and a decrease in ARHGAP36 levels by a dominant negative form of AKT and AKT inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>). Fifth, deletion of <italic>Arhgap36</italic> in mouse results in specific reduction of FoxP1<sup>+</sup> LMC MNs in the developing mouse embryonic spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), which is similar to what was observed in Shh knock-down chick spinal cord and <italic>Shh</italic>-cKO mouse spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Taken together, our results reveal a regulatory axis consisting of Shh-AKT-ARHGAP36-PKA, which plays crucial roles in modulating the activity of Shh signaling in a spatiotemporal manner for LMC specification.</p><p>Once MN progenitors, produced in the pMN progenitor domain of the ventral neural tube in response to the morphogen Shh, give birth to MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jessell, 2000</xref>), MNs are further organized into distinct motor columns that are responsible for innervating each target muscle along the rostral-caudal neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dasen and Jessell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stifani, 2014</xref>). MMC neurons innervate dorsal epaxial muscles, whereas HMC neurons project to the ventral hypaxial muscles. The LMC neurons innervate limb muscles and PGC neurons innervate sympathetic ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stifani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dasen and Jessell, 2009</xref>). Motor column specific transcription factors and morphogenetic signaling molecules collaborate to define MN subtype specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shirasaki and Pfaff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee and Pfaff, 2001</xref>). RA is essential for the diversification of MN subtype and MN columnar organization. Also Hox genes, which encode a family of transcription factors, determine MN subtypes and there is a clear relationship between Hox protein expression and motor columnar specification. Moreover, FoxP1 has been shown to function as a critical Hox cofactor in regulating MN subtype diversity especially for specification of both the LMC and PGC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rousso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfaff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dasen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arber, 2008</xref>). It has been shown that abnormal expression of Hox proteins within postmitotic MNs result in subtype switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dasen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin and Carpenter, 2003</xref>). The spatiotemporal expression of these HD factors together with extrinsic signaling suggest that MN subtype identity remains plastic even after they exit the cell cycle and it should be tightly regulated to generate proper MN columnar subtypes. It is intriguing that two prominent extrinsic cues, RA and Shh, participate in LMC specification. Future studies should be directed at elucidating whether Shh pathway involving ARHGAP36 integrates with RA and Hox genes in LMC specification.</p><p>Because LMC and PGC neurons do not express Lhx3, it is not clear whether ARHGAP36 induced by the Isl1-Lhx3 complex at earlier stages of MN development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) persists in LMC and PGC neurons or another mechanism independently induces the expression of ARHGAP36 in these specific motor columns at later stages. Because Shh stabilizes ARHGAP36 through AKT activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and Shh is only expressed in LMC neurons at later developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), Shh may be responsible for the continuous existence of ARHGAP36 at least in LMC neurons via its ability to stabilize ARHGAP36 protein. It is also possible that Hox and its cofactor Pbx may additionally upregulate the expression of ARHGAP36 at later stages of MN columnar specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanley et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We found that there was no obvious defect in the general MN formation in <italic>Arhgap36</italic> knockout mouse embryonic spinal cord at early stages, suggesting that its function is not necessary for the initial MN differentiation. This conclusion is supported by the lack of Shh expression in early born MNs and with our notion that Shh agonist is likely needed for the activity of ARHGAP36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) as well as our finding that overexpression of AKT shows specific effect only on FoxP1<sup>+</sup> LMC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Because ARHGAP36 is also expressed in early born MNs, however, ARHGAP36 may also have a critical role in initial MN generation. This action of ARHGAP36 may have a redundant functional homologue, given no deficits were observed in early MN generation in <italic>Arhgap36</italic> knockout mouse embryonic spinal cord. Furthermore, there was no obvious defect even in the LMC formation in male mutant spinal cord at later stages. Based on the amino acid sequence of ARHGAP36, it is predicted to be a Rho GAP family member, but it lacks the ‘arginine finger’ motif for Rho GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rittinger et al., 1997</xref>), suggesting that the catalytic GAP domain is not required for Gli activation. <italic>Arhgap6</italic> is the closest homolog of <italic>Arhgap36</italic>, which does not affect Shh activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rack et al., 2014</xref>). It will be interesting to further investigate whether another functional homologue to ARHGAP36 controls initial MN generation as well as LMC formation particularly in male embryos. At E12.5, we observed that LMCm (Isl1<sup>+</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) neurons are increased, whereas LMCl (Lhx1<sup>+</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) neurons are decreased in <italic>Arhgap36</italic> mutant spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). But later on, the number of FoxP1<sup>+</sup> LMC neurons decreased significantly in <italic>Arhgap36</italic> deficient mouse embryonic spinal cord. These results suggest that the increased early born LMCm neurons in the <italic>Arhgap36</italic> mutant spinal cord somehow adopt other cell fates or degenerate. These possibilities need to be further investigated in the future. Later born LMCl neurons have to migrate through earlier born LMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sockanathan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maden, 2006</xref>) but it is not known whether early born LMCm neurons can change their fate into LMCl neurons by receiving signals such as RA and Shh from the neighboring cells. It will be interesting to further investigate whether early born LMCm neurons affect LMCl neuron specification through Shh signaling pathway and its modulator ARHGAP36.</p><p>In the developing central nervous system, a number of differentiated cells degenerate during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oppenheim, 1991</xref>). Initially overproduced MNs undergo cell death by competing for a limited amount of neurotropic factors when they arrive at the target muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamamoto and Henderson, 1999</xref>). LMC neuronal axons navigate through a very long distance to their final destinations by integrating intrinsic factors and extrinsic pro- and anti-apoptotic signals. Based on the well-known function of AKT in cell survival, we speculate that ARHGAP36 proteins stabilized by AKT may also function to maintain the proper number of differentiated LMC neurons by blocking their apoptosis. Indeed, we observed an increase in cell death with a reduction of FoxP1<sup>+</sup> LMC neurons in <italic>Arhgap36</italic> KO mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that ARHGAP36 may function as an essential downstream effector of AKT-directed cell survival.</p><p>It remains to be further investigated how ARHGAP36 affects the FoxP1<sup>+</sup> LMC cell fate specification. It has been shown that FoxP1 expression is regulated by PI3K/AKT/p70S6K signaling cascade in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halacli and Dogan, 2015</xref>). These results further support our proposal that the expression of FoxP1 in LMC neurons is likely regulated by activated AKT in collaboration with ARHGAP36. Furthermore, ARHGAP36 is up-regulated in medulloblastoma where Shh pathway is aberrantly activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rack et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that similar mechanisms may be applied to tumorigenesis. Therefore, it will be interesting to further study the function of ARHGAP36 in Shh-dependent tumorigenesis, for instance using the cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) from <italic>Arhgap36</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Shh<sup>f/f</sup></italic></td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2165468">MGI:2165468</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Olig2-Cre</italic></td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18046410">18046410</ext-link></td><td/><td>Dr. Bennett G.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript addresses the role of Sonic hedgehog expressed by postmitotic spinal neurons in chick and mouse embryos. The paper shows that Shh is required for the formation of the lateral motor column at brachial level and that it acts by activating AKT signaling, which stabilises the ARHGAP36 protein, induced in motorneurons by Isl1-Lhx3 complexes. ARHGAP36 in turn inhibits the kinase activity of PKA, which dephosphorylates Gli proteins and favours the formation of activating over repressing forms of Gli proteins.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>The reviewers found this study novel and interesting. However, reviewer 2 was concerned that electroporation experiments in chick embryos did not rule out an effect of the manipulation on patterning or proliferation of progenitor cells rather than a direct effect on postmitotic motorneurons, because electroporations were performed at a stage when patterning was not fully established and the expression constructs did not contain a motorneuron-specific promoter (reviewer 2, points 7 and 19). Similarly, the reviewer was concerned that Shh deletion in mouse embryos using the Olig2-Cre deleter line did not exclude patterning or proliferation defects due to elimination of Shh in ventral progenitors rather than in postmitotic neurons (reviewer 2 point 11). After consultation between the reviewer, reviewer 1 agrees with these points. As Olig2 is initially expressed in the ventral-most domain of the spinal cord except in the most medial cells (e.g. Dessaud et al., 2007), it cannot be excluded that Shh has been deleted by Olig2-Cre from cells in the early Olig2+ progenitor domain, resulting in the observed phenotype.</p><p>Other concerns include the lack of sufficient analysis to exclude patterning, proliferation or survival defects in the manipulated chick and mouse embryos (reviewer point 1; reviewer 2 points 5 and 6), and the insufficient quantification of the data (reviewer 1 point 2; reviewer 2 points 4, 8, 14, 17, 19, 22-25).</p><p>Addressing these different concerns would require new experiments, which would likely take substantially longer than the two months normally allocated to the revision of <italic>eLife</italic> manuscripts. We have therefore regretfully decided to reject your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper reports a novel role of Shh, produced by postmitotic motor neurons, in the specification of the lateral motor column (LMC) in the chick and mouse spinal cord. The authors show that AKT stabilises the Rho GAP protein ARHGAP36 in the LMC region, and that ARHGAP36 in turn inhibits the activity of PKA and thereby enhances the production of activating forms of Gli proteins.</p><p>The identification of a role for Shh in motor neuron specification and the elucidation of the downstream pathway involving a novel regulator and multiple signaling molecules is of significant interest. The data supports the conclusions of the authors and the work is of excellent quality and well presented. I have a few requests to improve the data, the analysis and discussion to strengthen the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>1) Shh acts as a mitogen in many systems but the authors rule out that it is the case here by labelling MN progenitors with antibodies to Olig2 and <italic>Sox2</italic> in Figure 2C. However the Shh LOF phenotype in Figure 2A only affects the generation of a small minority of MNs, which could be due to a proliferation defect affecting only a small fraction of progenitors which may not be picked up by the current analysis. To rule this out, the authors should examine proliferating cells more directly, eg with a short pulse of EdU. This should detect a putative proliferation defect with more sensitivity than examining total progenitor numbers.</p><p>2) The ectopic expression of ARHGAP36 in the ventral spinal cord in Figure 5B increases visibly the number of FoxP1+ LMC neurons while Lhx3+ Hb9+ MMCm neurons do not appear affected. However to conclude that ARHGAP36 induces LMC neurons rather than converting MMCm into LMC, requires quantification of the data.</p><p>3) The conclusion of the experiment in Figure 6A that AKT stabilises ARHGAP36 protein should be strengthened by measuring ARHGAP36 half-life in HEK293T cells in the presence and absence of AKT, and also by showing that manipulating AKT activity does not affect ARHGAP36 transcription.</p><p>4) The regulation of ARHGAP36 expression may need further discussion. Figure 6 shows that AKT controls ARHGAP36 protein stability, but how its transcription is regulated is less clear. Figure 2 S1, shows a reduction of its expression in Shh cKO mice. How does Shh regulates its expression and are there other signals involved? Along the same line, the arrow between Shh and P-AKT in Figure 7D may need more explanation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Nam and cols, entitled &quot;Critical roles of ARHGAP36 as a signal transduction mediator of Shh pathway in lateral motor columnar specification&quot; proposes a novel role for Shh signalling in spinal cord development.</p><p>A putative role for Shh activity as a signal instructing the selection of specific MNs subpopulations is novel and attractive. It is based in the observation of Shh expression in postmitotic MNs, which is not fully novel, but has not been well characterized previously.</p><p>Authors also find that the Rho GAP family member <italic>Arhgap36</italic> is expressed in postmitotic MNs, and propose that it might act as a Shh effector in MN subpopulations selection. In different cell contexts, <italic>Arhgap36</italic> has previously been shown to inhibit PKA activity, hence regulating Shh signalling. However, it would be nice to fully define its in vivo relevance, in the context of selection of specific MNs subpopulations. In summary, the manuscript contains some novel and interesting data, however it lacks definitive demonstration of some of the conclusions raised by the authors.</p><p>Hence, I believe that, in the present format, the manuscript has important gaps that need to be fulfilled.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>In order to propose a new role for Shh signalling as an instructive signal the selection of specific MNs subpopulations, I believe that authors should improve the characterization of the MN subpopulations expressing Shh.</p><p>1) In the chick embryo spinal cord, Shh expression has previously been reported in postmitotic motor neurons of the LMC (at stage HH15), extending later to the MMC (Stage HH35) (Figure 1 in Oppenheim et al., 1999). However, Nam and cols, in this manuscript shows Shh expression restricted to LMC neurons at the brachial level. The selected section showed in Figure 1A shows Shh expression restricted to the mLMC (and excluded from lLMC), as well as excluded from MMC. Could authors clarify these contradictory issues?</p><p>2) Panel B of this figure (expression in mouse embryos) do not show this restricted expression to mLMC. Are these specie specific differences? Or developmental stage differences?</p><p>3) A detailed temporo-spatial expression of Shh in postmitotic MNs should be provided. These should be easy to clarify combining with the available and well defined markers for each MN column (see for example Adams et al., 2015)</p><p>In order to analyse the role of Shh in MN subtype specification; loss-of-function experiments in chick embryo NT were performed by electroporation at HH stage 13 chick embryos (Materials and methods), at which patterning of the NT is not definitely established (see for example Cayuso et al., 2006).</p><p>4) Controls showing quantification of Shh- loss are required, particularly since defects appeared to be mild, despite the length of the experiments (96 hours post-electroporation at HH13). For example, Gli-bs-luc experiments to show the efficiency of the Shh-LOF vector.</p><p>5) Moreover, the role of Shh signalling in proliferation and survival of neural progenitors are also well stablished, hence controls ruling out these defects are required.</p><p>6) Controls showing markers for progenitors should be included in order to rule out patterning defects.</p><p>7) I strongly believe that, in order to analyse a specific role for Shh signalling in postmitotic MN subtype generation, experiments should have been done using a MN specific driver (for example the well characterized HB9) to avoid patterning and proliferation defects.</p><p>8) Quantitative data indicating the total number of MNs, versus sub-type specific MNs should be provided. It is important to understand whether LMNs have switch their fate, of whether LMNs are not being generated.</p><p>9) Quantitative data in Figure 1A panel D shows FoxP1+ cells, are these islet1+? Or islet1-? Same for Hb9, these analyses will discriminate between lLMB vs mLMC. Quantitative data in Figure 1A panel E shows Lhx3+ cells, same for the combination with additional marker to restrict the phenotype to specific MN subtype</p><p>10) A schematic drawing of the MN columns, including markers and phenotype would be of great help.</p><p>11) The same holds for the analysis of the Shh-Olig2C mutant phenotype. These experiments should have been done using a MN specific driver (for example the well characterized HB9CRE line, available at Jackson) to avoid patterning and proliferation defects.</p><p>12) Please indicate the total number of MNs, versus sub-type specific MNs. Please indicate whether FoxP1+ cells are islet1 and Hb9 +/-.</p><p>To identify the candidate effector genes, authors searched for target genes of the Isl1-Lhx3 transcriptional complex, well characterized previously by this group. What is the link between this searching strategy and Shh signalling, it is not clear to me, but they identify the Rho GAP family member <italic>Arhgap36</italic>, which is known to activate Gli transcriptional responses through the inhibition of PKA activities.</p><p>13) It would be nice to see, among the many genes regulated by the Isl1-Lhx3 transcriptional complex, whether there might be a cluster of HH-signalling components?</p><p>14) Authors identify a HxRE of the <italic>Arhgap36</italic> gene, and test the in vivo activity by electroporation experiments in chick embryo NT. Please provide quantitative data indicating number of embryos analysed. Provide quantitative data indicating HB9 ectopic cells induced.

We have therefore regretfully decided to reject your manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>One of the main concerns of reviewers was if Shh deletion in mouse embryos using the Olig2-Cre deleter line could exclude patterning or proliferation defects due to the elimination of Shh in ventral progenitors rather than in postmitotic neurons. The reviewer pointed out that &quot;As Olig2 is initially expressed in the ventral-most domain of the spinal cord except in the most medial cells [1], it cannot be excluded that Shh has been deleted by Olig2-Cre from cells in the early Olig2<sup>+</sup> progenitor domain, resulting in the observed phenotype.&quot;</p><p>We understand why the reviewer expressed the concern as Shh secreted from the floor plate is critical for the patterning of the ventral neural tube, thus affecting the subsequent motor neuron differentiation. However, the data from my lab and other groups indicate that the expression of Shh in the floor plate is not compromised in our Shh-cKO;Olig2-Cre mouse model, excluding the possibility that the observed phenotype is caused by Shh deletion in the floor plate.</p><p>First, it is important to note that Shh is specifically expressed in the floor plate, but not in neurons, at the early stage of spinal cord development when the ventral progenitors undergo Shh-dependent patterning. Our in situ hybridization data (Figure 1A,B) are consistent with the previous reports. Further supporting the floor plate-specific expression pattern of Shh, Shh-Cre activity is also found exclusively in the floor plate [2] (see Figure 1N', N&quot; of Varadarajan et al., 2017 Neuron [3]).</p><p>Second, Olig2-Cre is not active in the floor plate. For instance, Varadarajan et al. 2017 Neuron [3] depicted Olig2-Cre active cells and their progeny by crossing Olig2-Cre deleter with Rosa26-gfp reporter mice, and the data show that GFP is not expressed in the floor plate (see Figure 2FF of Varadarajan et al., 2017 Neuron [3]). We have also crossed Olig2-Cre with the reporter allele detecting Cre-mediated recombination and found that Olig2-Cre is not active in the floor plate.</p><p>As the reviewer described, Figure 1H of Dessaud et al., 2007 [1] clearly shows that Olig2 is <italic>not</italic> expressed in the MOST medial cells, which are the floor plate. The ventral most domain of the spinal cord in which Olig2 is initially expressed in this paper [1] is the p3 domain, which gives rise to V3 interneurons. Importantly, V3 interneurons do not express Shh.</p><p>Taken together, when the patterning of the ventral neural progenitors occurs, Olig2-Cre is <italic>not</italic> active in the floor plate cells, which are the only cell types that express Shh at this stage. Thus, the deletion of the Shh gene by Olig2-Cre should affect neither the expression of Shh in the neural tube nor Shh-dependent patterning of the ventral progenitor domains, including pMN domain.</p><p>Finally, the phenotype of Shh-cKO;Olig2-Cre mice further supports the notion that the observed phenotype is <italic>not</italic> caused by Shh deletion in the floor plate. Shh in the floor plate is required for the patterning of the ventral spinal cord, the production of pMN cells, and the generation of motor neurons and ventral interneurons [4]. Thus, if Shh in the floor plate is absent or reduced in Shh-cKO;Olig2-Cre embryos, it would lead to a complete loss or a drastic reduction of Olig2<sup>+</sup> pMN progenitors, all types of motor neurons, and V2 interneurons. However, we found no significant difference in the number of Olig2<sup>+</sup> pMN progenitors in the analyzed Shh-cKO;Olig2-Cre and control embryos (Figure 3B,C), indicating that Shh level secreted from the floor plate was adequate to drive the pMN patterning and production. In the revised manuscript, we included the quantification data of the number of Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells in Shh-cKO;Olig2-Cre and control embryos (Figure 3B,C). We also found that only FoxP1<sup>+</sup> LMC motor neurons, but neither Lhx3<sup>+</sup>Hb9<sup>+</sup> MMC, Isl1<sup>+</sup>Hb9<sup>+</sup> HMC motor neurons nor Lhx3<sup>+</sup>Hb9<sup>-</sup> V2 interneurons, was reduced in Shh-cKO;Olig2-Cre mice (Figure 3A,C). These data further support the notion that Shh secreted from the floor plate in Shh-cKO;Olig2-Cre mice was adequate to drive the patterning of the ventral spinal cord and the production of pMN cells and that the reduced LMC motor neuron is not a secondary outcome of the defects in neural progenitors.</p><p>We hope these address the reviewer’s concern that the observed phenotype can be caused by the deletion of Shh in Olig2<sup>+</sup> progenitors.</p><p>Next, the reviewer #2 stressed to use a motor neuron-specific driver, such as Hb9-Cre line. We have already purchased Hb9-Cre for this purpose, but Hb9-Cre turned out to be problematic for our experiments, because Hb9 is expressed (therefore Hb9-Cre is active) in the notochord, which secretes Shh required for the neural tube development [5]. As Hb9-Cre deletes Shh in the notochord and eliminates Shh required for the ventral neural tube patterning, Hb9-Cre cannot be used for our experiment. To circumvent this issue, we also used Isl1-Cre, whose Cre expression occurs as motor neurons emerge from the progenitors. We generated Shh-cKO with Isl1-Cre and found that Shh-cKO;Isl1-Cre mice have severe deficits in the limb development as Isl1-Cre inactivates Shh in the developing limb [2, 6, 7]. The deficits of limb development in Shh-cKO;Isl1-Cre compounded our analyses of LMC development, given the observed defects of LMC motor neurons can be caused secondarily by the severe developmental defects of the limbs. In summary, Hb9-Cre is inadequate for deleting Shh only in motor neurons, and Olig2-Cre was the best line that we could use to inactive Shh in motor neurons. Finally, our data indicate that the observed phenotypes in Shh-cKO;Olig2-Cre mice are caused by inactivation of Shh in motor neurons, not by the removal of Shh in the floor plate which does not occur in Shh-cKO;Olig2-Cre mice, as described above.</p><p>Other concerns include the lack of sufficient analysis to exclude patterning, proliferation or survival defects in the manipulated chick and mouse embryos (reviewer 1 point 1; reviewer 2 points 5 and 6), and the insufficient quantification of the data (reviewer 1 point 2; reviewer 2 points 4, 8, 14, 17, 19, 22-25). We addressed these concerns as explained below. In particular, as for the concern regarding the chick electroporation of Shh knockdown construct, the electroporation efficiency of the floor plate cells is generally very low. In our electroporation scheme, all electroporated cells are labeled by GFP. To better address reviewer's concern, we analyzed the chick embryos that do not express GFP in the floor plate (therefore no inactivation of Shh), which was confirmed by in situ hybridization analyses of Shh expression. We also confirmed that the patterning and cell proliferation are normal in chick embryos analyzed (Figure 2A,C). These rigorous analyses exclude the possibility that any observed phenotypes are caused by the effect of Shh deletion in the progenitors.</p><p>With the successful completion of all the requested revisions, we hope that you and the reviewers find this manuscript exciting and convincing. In particular, we hope to emphasize that this story presents at least two highly innovative findings; a novel function for Shh in postmitotic neurons and its critical downstream effector ARHGAP36 in directing the development of the specific type of MNs (LMC-MNs) in the developing spinal cord. Our results identify a new regulatory axis consisting of AKT-ARHGAP36-PKA, which plays crucial roles in Shh signal transduction for LMC specification.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper reports a novel role of Shh, produced by postmitotic motor neurons, in the specification of the lateral motor column (LMC) in the chick and mouse spinal cord.

We would also like to thank the reviewer for many insightful suggestions. We are pleased that we were able to address all issues that the reviewer #1 raised, as described below each of the reviewer's point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Shh acts as a mitogen in many systems but the authors rule out that it is the case here by labelling MN progenitors with antibodies to Olig2 and Sox2 in Figure 2C. However the Shh LOF phenotype in Figure 2A only affects the generation of a small minority of MNs, which could be due to a proliferation defect affecting only a small fraction of progenitors which may not be picked up by the current analysis. To rule this out, the authors should examine proliferating cells more directly, eg with a short pulse of EdU. This should detect a putative proliferation defect with more sensitivity than examining total progenitor numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed a short pulse of BrdU labeling and Ki67 staining. Our analyses revealed that Shh-cKO mice exhibited no significant change in the proliferation of progenitors as monitored by the four independent markers, such as Olig2, Ki67, <italic>Sox2</italic> and BrdU (Figure 3B,C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The ectopic expression of ARHGAP36 in the ventral spinal cord in Figure 5B increases visibly the number of FoxP1+ LMC neurons while Lhx3+ Hb9+ MMCm neurons do not appear affected. However to conclude that ARHGAP36 induces LMC neurons rather than converting MMCm into LMC, requires quantification of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We included the quantification data for FoxP1<sup>+</sup> LMC and MMC (Lhx3<sup>+</sup>Hb9<sup>+</sup>) neurons (Figure 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The conclusion of the experiment in Figure 6A that AKT stabilises ARHGAP36 protein should be strengthened by measuring ARHGAP36 half-life in HEK293T cells in the presence and absence of AKT, and also by showing that manipulating AKT activity does not affect ARHGAP36 transcription.</p></disp-quote><p>We included the data showing the half-life of ARHGAP36 protein was prolonged in the presence of AKT when treated with cycloheximide that blocks the protein translation (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We also confirmed that AKT inhibitor reduced the protein level of ARHGAP36 by western blotting (Figure 7B, Figure 7—figure supplement 2C) but not the transcription of Arhgap36 by RT-PCR (Figure 7—figure supplement 2D) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The regulation of ARHGAP36 expression may need further discussion. Figure 6 shows that AKT controls ARHGAP36 protein stability, but how its transcription is regulated is less clear. Figure 2—figure supplement 1, shows a reduction of its expression in Shh cKO mice. How does Shh regulates its expression and are there other signals involved? Along the same line, the arrow between Shh and P-AKT in Figure 7D may need more explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 7, to test the effect of AKT activity in the regulation of ARHGAP36 protein stability, we ectopically expressed ARHGAP36 together with different forms of AKT by transfecting HEK293T cells with plasmids that encode ARHGAP36 and AKT genes. As ARHGAP36 is not expressed endogenously in HEK293T cells, in these cells, ARHGAP36 proteins are expressed only from the ARHGAP36-encoding plasmid, in which CMV promoter drives the transcription of ARHGAP36. These experiments show that active AKT increases ARHGAP36 protein levels, suggesting that AKT increases ARHGAP36 proteins likely by stabilizing ARHGAP36 protein, rather than activating the ARHGAP36 promoter transcriptionally, in this experimental setting.</p><p>To further test whether endogenous ARHGAP36 transcription is upregulated by AKT in differentiating motor neurons, we used mESC system where ARHGAP36 is induced under motor neuron differentiation condition. In this condition, AKT inhibitor did not affect the mRNA level of ARHGAP36 (see the answer above and Figure 7—figure supplement 2D), suggesting that AKT is not involved in the transcriptional activation of the ARHGAP36 gene.</p><p>Then, how does Shh increase ARHGAP36 levels? It is noteworthy that Shh is capable of inducing the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)-dependent AKT phosphorylation in cell lines (LIGHT cells and HUBEC cells) [8, 9]. We proposed that Shh expressed in the motor neurons triggers AKT activation, which in turn stabilizes the protein level of ARHGAP36 in motor neurons. Our model predicts that the ARHGAP36 protein level would be decreased in <italic>Shh</italic>-cKO mice.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript by Nam and cols, entitled &quot;Critical roles of ARHGAP36 as a signal transduction mediator of Shh pathway in lateral motor columnar specification&quot; proposes a novel role for Shh signalling in spinal cord development.</p><p>A putative role for Shh activity as a signal instructing the selection of specific MNs subpopulations is novel and attractive.

However, it would be nice to fully define its in vivo relevance, in the context of selection of specific MNs subpopulations.

However, Nam and cols, in this manuscript shows Shh expression restricted to LMC neurons at the brachial level. The selected section showed in Figure 1A shows Shh expression restricted to the mLMC (and excluded from lLMC), as well as excluded from MMC. Could authors clarify these contradictory issues?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we re-examined the expression of Shh more thoroughly with well-defined markers for motor columns in chick embryos (stage HH29) (Figure 1B). Our analyses show that Shh is expressed in LMCm (Isl1<sup>+</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) but not LMCl (Isl1<sup>-</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) at brachial level, and interestingly, it is expressed in LMCl (Isl1<sup>-</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) at lumbar level. Shh expression is clearly excluded from MMC (Lhx3<sup>+</sup> MNs) at all axial levels, as demonstrated by converging analyses of Lhx3 and Shh (Figure 1B). Overall, our Shh expression analysis results are highly similar to the data in the referenced paper (Oppenheim et al., 1999) [10], despite the minor differences likely due to detection sensitivity variations of Shh antisense probes.</p><p>Oppenheim et al. showed nice expression of Shh in chick embryos at different developmental stages. At stage HH15, Shh is expressed in notochord and floor plate but not in postmitotic motor neurons of the LMC (Figure 1A in Oppenheim et al. [10]), which is similar to what we have observed. There is a low level detection of Shh in the ventral horn at stage HH23 (Figure 1C in Oppenheim et al. [10]), which may result from higher level sensitivity of Shh antisense probe. Oppenheim et al. also described that at stage HH35, Shh is expressed in two distinct motoneuron (MN) populations (medial and lateral) and the referee 2 may be referring this medial MNs as MMC. However, this Shh-expressing medial MN population is likely to be LMCm, judging by the cell body location. It is hard to conclude the identity of motor columns without co-expression analyses with motor column markers. Thus, we performed these needed co-expression analyses in Figure 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Panel B of this figure (expression in mouse embryos) do not show this restricted expression to mLMC. Are these specie specific differences? Or developmental stage differences?</p></disp-quote><p>The expression level of Shh in mouse motor neurons is much lower than that in chick motor neurons. As we examined the comparable developmental stages in mouse and chick embryos, we do not think that the difference in expression levels reflects developmental stage differences. We have observed that overall in situ hybridization analyses tend to work more effectively in chick embryos than in mouse embryos not only for Shh but also for many other genes. This sensitivity differences in in situ hybridization outcomes may reflect species differences, but we are yet to understand what factors exactly contribute to this observation. Nonetheless, our analyses in both mouse and chick embryos demonstrate the expression of Shh in postmitotic motor neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A detailed temporo-spatial expression of Shh in postmitotic MNs should be provided.

For example, Gli-bs-luc experiments to show the efficiency of the Shh-LOF vector.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we quantified the intensity of Shh ISH signal and confirmed the significant reduction of Shh expression in motor neurons (Figure 2C). Of note, in our electroporation condition, the electroporation efficiency of the floor plate cells is generally very low, likely due to the depth and location of the electrodes. Thus, we expected that Shh knockdown would be mostly effective in motor neurons but not in the floor plate, allowing us to focus on analyzing the effect of Shh-LOF on motor columnar specification without significant changes in progenitor proliferation or early patterning of the neural tube. Our analyses including careful quantification indeed revealed that there’s no significant change in proliferation (BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells) or ventral neural patterning (Olig2<sup>+</sup>, Nkx2.2<sup>+</sup> cells in Figure 2A,C). We also found a significant reduction of LMCl motor neurons (Figure 2B,C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Moreover, the role of Shh signalling in proliferation and survival of neural progenitors are also well stablished, hence controls ruling out these defects are required.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we provided the data of BrdU incorporation for proliferation and cleaved caspase 3 staining for apoptotic cells and these results show no significant change in proliferation and survival of neural progenitors (Figure 2A,C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Controls showing markers for progenitors should be included in order to rule out patterning defects.</p></disp-quote><p>Now we provided the data that ventral progenitor cells are established properly by staining with Olig2 and Nkx2.2, markers of p2 and p3 domain, respectively, whose expression is dependent on Shh levels in the floor plate (Figure 2A,C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) I strongly believe that, in order to analyse a specific role for Shh signalling in postmitotic MN subtype generation, experiments should have been done using a MN specific driver (for example the well characterized HB9) to avoid patterning and proliferation defects.</p></disp-quote><p>We have already attempted to use Hb9-Cre for this purpose, but Hb9-Cre turned out to be problematic for our experiments, because Hb9 is expressed (therefore Hb9-Cre is active) in the notochord, which secretes Shh required for the neural tube development [5].

Thus, Hb9-Cre cannot be used for our experiment. To circumvent this issue, we also used Isl1-Cre, whose Cre expression occurs as motor neurons emerge from the progenitors. We generated Shh-cKO with Isl1-Cre and found that Shh-cKO;Isl1-Cre mice have severe deficits in the limb development as Isl1-Cre inactivates Shh in the developing limb [2, 6, 7]. The deficits of limb development in Shh-cKO;Isl1-Cre compounded our analyses of LMC development, given the observed defects of LMC motor neurons can be caused secondarily by the severe developmental defects of the limbs.

We analyzed the chick embryos that do not express GFP in the floor plate (therefore no inactivation of Shh), which was further confirmed by in situ hybridization analyses of Shh expression. Our data show that the cell proliferation is normal in chick embryos analyzed. We also examined ventral progenitor markers, such as Nkx2.2 and Olig2, whose expression is dependent on Shh levels in the floor plate to further probe the presence of Shh in the floor plate.

Please indicate whether FoxP1+ cells are islet1 and Hb9 +/-.</p></disp-quote><p>We included the quantification data for each motor column and total number of MNs in Figure 3C. The number of FoxP1<sup>+</sup> LMC motor neurons including both LMCm and LMCl was reduced, but neither MMC (Lhx3<sup>+</sup>Hb9<sup>+</sup>) motor neurons nor Isl1<sup>+</sup>Hb9<sup>+</sup> HMC motor neurons, was changed in Shh-cKO;Olig2-Cre mice (Figure 3C), which results in reduction of total number of MNs in <italic>Shh</italic>-cKO compared to control littermates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To identify the candidate effector genes, authors searched for target genes of the Isl1-Lhx3 transcriptional complex, well characterized previously by this group. What is the link between this searching strategy and Shh signalling, it is not clear to me, but they identify the Rho GAP family member Arhgap36, which is known to activate Gli transcriptional responses through the inhibition of PKA activities.</p></disp-quote><p>While we were analyzing the function of Shh in the columnar specification, ARHGAP36 was reported to activate Gli transcriptional responses through the inhibition of PKA activities. We have examined the expression pattern of putative target genes of the Isl1-Lhx3 complex in the developing spinal cord and found ARHGAP36 as one of the potential MN genes as its expression is very high and specific in MNs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) It would be nice to see, among the many genes regulated by the Isl1-Lhx3 transcriptional complex, whether there might be a cluster of HH-signalling components?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not see a cluster of HH-signaling components regulated by the Isl1-Lhx3 complex other than ARHGAP36.</p><p><italic>14) Authors identify a HxRE of the Arhgap36 gene, and test the</italic> in vivo <italic>activity by electroporation experiments in chick embryo NT.

Please provide electroporation time course, as well as negative control experiments.</italic> </p><p>We provided quantitative data for the number of embryos injected, electroporation time course in the figure legend. It is very well established that electroporation of Isl1+Lhx3 induces ectopic Hb9<sup>+</sup> cells in the dorsal spinal cord [12-14], and we routinely do this experiment in the lab. From this set of experiment, we would like to see the induction of GFP reporter driven by <italic>Arghap36</italic>-enhancer activated by Isl1+Lhx3 in the dorsal spinal cord. Indeed, we could detect very nice GFP expression as well as ectopic Hb9<sup>+</sup> cells in the dorsal spinal cord by Isl1+Lhx3 expression. We included the counting data of the ectopic Hb9<sup>+</sup> cells in the dorsal spinal cord (Figure 4F) and negative control experiment with TATA-GFP vector construct that has no HxRE and was not activated by Isl1+Lhx3 (Figure 4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) I believe that the data provided here demonstrate that the Isl1-Lhx3 complex is sufficient to induce Arhgap36 expression, whether this induction is direct is not fully demonstrated.</p></disp-quote><p>ChIP assay using mouse spinal cord extracts showed that Isl1 and Lhx3 are strongly recruited to the enhancer region of <italic>Arhgap36</italic> but not to the negative control region of <italic>Untr6</italic> (Figure 4C), indicating that the induction of Arhgap36 by Isl1-Lhx3 complex is direct indeed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next authors analyse Arhgap36 expression in postmitotic neurons. This is an important issue, since Shh might be acting either in a paracrine manner, or in a cell autonomous manner, to instruct MNs subtype identity.</p><p>16) Please provide a better characterization of Arhgap36 in MN subtypes (co-localization with MN subtype markers) and co-localization (or not) with Shh, with cellular resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provided the detailed expression data of <italic>Arhgap36</italic> combining with defined markers for each MN column such as <italic>Arhgap36</italic>/Isl1/FoxP1, <italic>Arhgap36</italic>/Isl1/Hb9, and <italic>Arhgap36</italic>/Lhx3/Hb9 in mouse embryos (Figure 5C). <italic>Arhgap36</italic> is most highly expressed in LMCl (Isl1<sup>-</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) region, some in MMC-rhomboideus (Hb9<sup>+</sup>/Lhx3<sup>low</sup>) and a very little in the most medial part of MMC but not in LMCm (Isl1<sup>+</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) at cervical level. At thoracic level, <italic>Arhgap36</italic> is also expressed in PGC (FoxP1<sup>+</sup>/Isl1<sup>+</sup>) and HMC (Isl1<sup>+</sup>/Hb9<sup>+</sup>) MNs, although the expression level is relatively lower. At lumbar level, <italic>Arhgap36</italic> is relatively highly enriched in LMCl (Isl1<sup>-</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>) and show very low level in the most medial part of MMC. To examine the co-localization of <italic>Arhgap36</italic> with Shh, we performed in situ hybridization of Shh and IHC of <italic>Arhgap36</italic> in mouse E12.5 spinal cord at cervical level. Shh is co-localized with <italic>Arhgap36</italic> mostly in LMCl region (Figure 5D).</p><p>In summary, mouse Shh is mainly expressed in LMCl of the mouse spinal cord that is co-localized with <italic>Arhgap36</italic>, while chick Shh is expressed in LMCm at cervical level and LMCl at lumbar level of chick spinal cord where chick <italic>Arhgap36</italic> is broadly expressed within the spinal cord. Although there is a discrepancy in the expression pattern of Shh in mouse and chick spinal cord, <italic>Arhgap36</italic> seems to be coexpressed with Shh in both species and the regulatory axis of Shh-ARHGAP36 can still function in both mouse and chick spinal cord.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Please provide Arhgap36 expression data in chick embryos MNs. It would be interesting to see the conservation of it expression in MNs.</p></disp-quote><p>In situ hybridization of chick <italic>Arhgap36</italic> showed rather broad but specific and high expression within the spinal cord compared to other tissues in the chick embryo (Figure 7—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next authors test whether the Shh-pathway is activated upon over-expression of Arhgap36. Experiments in chick embryo NT were performed by electroporation of ARHGAP36 at HH stage 13 chick embryos (Materials and methods). These gain-of-function experiments produce NT overgrowth, corresponding to the over-activation of Shh signalling, in addition to ventralization of the entire NT. Quantitative data indicating number of embryos analysed is missing, electroporation time course, as well as quantification of marker-specific ectopic cells should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We provided quantitative data for the number of embryos injected, electroporation time course in the figure legend and included the quantification data for FoxP1<sup>+</sup> LMC and MMC (Lhx3<sup>+</sup>/Hb9<sup>+</sup>) neurons (Figure 6B).</p><p><italic>18) I believe that these experiments are controls of the capacity of ARHGAP36 in activating Shh-mediated responses</italic> in vivo<italic>. Since this has been previously documented in other systems, these experiments can go as supplementary information.</italic> </p><p>We moved these data to supplementary information (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Authors claim that over-expression of ARHGAP36 in ventral NT, harvested at 4 dpe the number of FoxP1+ LMC neurons increased drastically, suggest that ARHGAP36 is sufficient to direct LMC fate-determination. Again here, I believe that these experiments should have been done using a MN HB9 specific driver to avoid patterning and proliferation defects. With the present experimental design, it is very difficult to assign a direct role for ARHGAP36 in postmitotic MN subpopulations selection, other that the role in MN progenitors</p></disp-quote><p>We used Gal4/UAS system to drive the motor neuron specific expression of <italic>Arhgap36</italic>. We generated Hb9-Gal4 construct where Gal4 DNA binding transactivation domain is expressed driven by motor neuron specific Hb9 promoter and UAS-<italic>Arhgap36</italic> construct where <italic>Arhgap36</italic> is expressed through the binding of Gal4 to the UAS response element. Using this system, we could direct the expression of <italic>Arhgap36</italic> into postmitotic MNs and this experiment also resulted in the specific increase of FoxP1<sup>+</sup> LMC neurons but had no effect on MMC (Lhx3<sup>+</sup>/Hb9<sup>+</sup>) neurons (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again in these experiments, quantitative data indicating number of embryos analysed is required, electroporation time course is missing. Quantification of marker-specific ectopic cells should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provided the quantitative data of number of embryos in the figure legend and quantification data for marker<sup>+</sup> cell numbers in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, authors show that PKA activity is inhibited by ARHGAP36. However, this observation is not novel, since Eccles et al. (2016) showed that ARHGAP36 combines two distinct inhibitory mechanisms to antagonise PKA signalling; it blocks PKA catalytic activity and it targets PKAc for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, resulting in activation of the Shh pathway.</p><p>20) I don't see the point in analysing other targets but PKA in the context of MN specification, hence I believe that panels C,D,E from Figure 5 are not relevant in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>We moved these data to supplementary figures (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) Again, in the context of Shh/ ARHGAP36 signalling in MN subtype selection, I do not see the relevance of the AKT experiments shown if Figure 6.

As Shh pathway plays critical roles in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis, it is important to define the regulatory network modulating multiple components involved in the pathway. We found that AKT stabilizes the Arhgpa36 protein level and further potentiates the Shh activity in MN subtype generation, which is quite novel and this regulatory axis can be broadly implicated in various Shh-dependent conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) Authors show reduced expression of ARHGAP36 in Shh-KO mice (Figure S4), again without any quantitative data.</p></disp-quote><p>We provided the quantitative data (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, authors generate an ARHGAP36 mutant mice.

It is important to understand whether, in the absence of ARHGAP36, LMNs have switch their fate, of whether LMNs are not being generated.</p></disp-quote><p>We included the quantification data of LMCm (Isl1<sup>+</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>), LMCl (Hb9<sup>+</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>, Lhx1<sup>+</sup>/FoxP1<sup>+</sup>), HMC (Hb9<sup>+</sup>/Isl1<sup>+</sup>), MMC (Lhx3<sup>+</sup>/Hb9<sup>+</sup>) at the brachial and thoracic levels (Figure 8C). In <italic>Arhgap36</italic> KO mice, FoxP1<sup>+</sup> LMC including LMCm and LMCl neurons reduced, while there is no compensatory increase in non-LMC type motor neurons that we examined, and then as a result this leads to the reduction of total MNs (Figure 8C). The increase of active Caspase3<sup>+</sup> cells in the motor neuron area of <italic>Arhgap36</italic> KO mice (Figure 8—figure supplement 1) suggests that prospective LMC neurons undergo apoptotic cell death in the absence of <italic>Arhgap36</italic>. It remains unclear, however, if cell death is a direct outcome of loss of <italic>Arhgap36</italic> in promoting cell survival or an indirect outcome of the failure of acquiring or maintaining the correct LMC identity. Importantly, previous studies show that postmitotic motor neuron fate specification and their survival are closely linked and it is difficult to distinguish the phenotypes between the fate specification and survival of postmitotic motor neurons. After cell cycle exit, the 'generic' motor neurons diversify into distinct motor neuron subtypes, including LMC. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling plays a role in the specification and maintenance of forelimb LMC identity [15-21]. The loss of RA from motor neurons leads to a reduced number of LMC neurons without a significant change in the number of MMC neurons [21], similar to our <italic>Arhgap36</italic> KO embryos. The ectopic activation of RA signaling in thoracic motor neurons impairs non-LMC type motor neuron differentiation and ultimately triggers apoptotic cell death [19]. One potential mechanism that links the fate specification and cell survival is that motor neurons which did not acquire the correct cell identity fail to receive target-derived neurotrophic signals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>References:</p></disp-quote><p>1) Dessaud, E., et al., Interpretation of the sonic hedgehog morphogen gradient by a temporal adaptation mechanism.
