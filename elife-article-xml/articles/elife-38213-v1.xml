myoclonic twitches during active sleep. A previous study suggested that the brainstem motor structures that produce twitches also send motor copies (or corollary discharge, CD) to the cerebellum. We tested this possibility by recording from two precerebellar nuclei—the inferior olive (IO) and lateral reticular nucleus (LRN). In most IO and LRN neurons, twitch-related activity peaked sharply around twitch onset, consistent with CD. Next, we identified twitch-production areas in the midbrain that project independently to the IO and LRN. Finally, we blocked calcium-activated slow potassium (SK) channels in the IO to explain how broadly tuned brainstem motor signals can be transformed into precise CD signals. We conclude that the precerebellar nuclei convey a diversity of sleep-related neural activity to the developing cerebellum to enable processing of convergent input from CD and reafferent signals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>lateral reticular nucleus</kwd><kwd>inferior olive</kwd><kwd>REM sleep</kwd><kwd>myoclonic twitch</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-HD081168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blumberg</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HD063071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blumberg</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Infant rats distinguish between self- and other-generated movements, and they do so primarily when moving during active sleep.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sensorimotor systems of diverse vertebrate and invertebrate species distinguish signals arising from self-generated movements (i.e., reafference) from those arising from other-generated movements (i.e., exafference; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cullen, 2004</xref>). To make this distinction, motor structures generate copies of motor commands, referred to as corollary discharge (CD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crapse and Sommer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Poulet and Hedwig, 2007</xref>). CD is conveyed to non-motor structures to inform them of the imminent arrival of reafference arising from self-generated movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crapse and Sommer, 2008</xref>). By comparing the two signals, animals are able to distinguish between self-produced and other-produced movements.</p><p>Self-produced movements are not restricted to periods of wakefulness, especially during development. Infants produce brief, discrete, jerky movements of skeletal muscles during active sleep (AS or REM sleep), a predominant behavioral state during early infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jouvet-Mounier et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roffwarg et al., 1966</xref>). These spontaneous movements, called myoclonic twitches, are most abundant and conspicuous in developing mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Blumberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gramsbergen et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jouvet-Mounier et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roffwarg et al., 1966</xref>).</p><p>Revealing the similarities and differences between twitches and wake movements is important for understanding the contribution that each type of movement makes to the development of the sensorimotor system. For example, in addition to their very different kinematic properties, twitches and wake movements differ in how they are processed by the infant brain. Specifically, in week-old rats the external cuneate nucleus (ECN), a medullary nucleus that receives proprioceptive input from the forelimbs, actively inhibits reafference arising from wake-related limb movements but not those arising from twitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tiriac and Blumberg, 2016</xref>). This state-dependent gating by the ECN suggested the selective engagement of a CD mechanism during wake movements and its suspension during twitching. It remained unclear, however, whether the suspension of the gating mechanism reflected the absence of a twitch-related CD signal or the inhibition of CD’s effects within the ECN. Resolving the question of whether CD accompanies twitching would be an important step toward understanding the functional significance of CD in early development. Indeed, if twitches contribute to the process whereby limbs are assimilated into the emerging body schema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Blumberg and Dooley, 2017</xref>), then one would expect CD—which underlies the capacity to distinguish self from other—to be critical to that process.</p><p>There is some indirect evidence that twitches are accompanied by CD. In week-old rats, twitches trigger both complex spikes (arising from climbing fibers) and simple spikes (arising from mossy fibers) in cerebellar Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sokoloff et al., 2015a</xref>). These neural events were detected at latencies that were likely too short to be reafferent signals arising from the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Puro and Woodward, 1977a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Puro and Woodward, 1977b</xref>). Accordingly, it is possible that the motor structures that produce twitches also convey CD to the cerebellum, as occurs with waking movements in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Azim and Alstermark, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Azim et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>If a twitch-related CD signal reaches the cerebellar cortex, it must be conveyed through the precerebellar nuclei. The inferior olive (IO) is a good candidate structure for such a CD signal. First, it is the sole source of climbing fibers to cerebellar cortex and is therefore responsible for the triggering of complex spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ruigrok et al., 2014</xref>). Second, midbrain motor structures project directly to the IO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Zeeuw et al., 1998</xref>). Finally, the IO fires precisely at the onset of self-generated movements in waking adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Keating and Thach, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>With respect to mossy fibers, there are a few major candidate structures to consider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ruigrok et al., 2014</xref>). First, the pontine nucleus is an unlikely source of CD in week-old rats because it receives descending input from motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee and Mihailoff, 1990</xref>), which does not contribute to the production of twitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blumberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kreider and Blumberg, 2000</xref>). Second, the ECN can also be ruled out as a source of CD because it processes twitch-related reafference exclusively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tiriac and Blumberg, 2016</xref>). Finally, the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN) is a possible candidate because it receives both sensory input from the limbs and motor input from midbrain structures, including the red nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alstermark and Ekerot, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pivetta et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the LRN has been implicated in processing CD associated with self-generated movements in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alstermark and Ekerot, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Arshavsky et al., 1978</xref>).</p><p>Accordingly, we recorded neural activity in the IO and LRN in postnatal day (P) 7–9 (hereafter P8) rats. Relying on three proposed criteria for identifying CD signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Poulet and Hedwig, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sommer and Wurtz, 2008</xref>), we first show that neurons within the IO and LRN sharply increase their activity within ±10 ms of twitch onset; such activity is not easily attributable to either motor or reafferent activity. Second, we show that the twitch-related IO and LRN activity originates in midbrain structures that contribute to motor outflow. Because neither the IO nor LRN plays a direct role in the production of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gellman et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ruigrok et al., 2014</xref>), a third CD criterion is satisfied. Finally, we test the hypothesis that calcium-activated slow potassium (SK) channels are responsible for converting the broadly tuned motor signal arising from the midbrain into a sharply tuned CD signal. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first direct neurophysiological evidence of a CD signal in an infant mammal.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IO activity predominates during active sleep</title><p>We recorded IO activity in unanesthetized head-fixed pups as they cycled spontaneously between sleep and wake with their limbs dangling freely (n = 20 pups, 37 units, 1–4 units/pup).

With respect to (a), the IO, despite being implicated in the precise timing of motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Zeeuw et al., 1998</xref>), is not directly involved in the generation of movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Horn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lang et al., 2017</xref>). Although it receives afferent projections from motor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Saint-Cyr, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saint-Cyr and Courville, 1981</xref>), there are no efferent projections from the IO to spinal motor neurons. In fact, cerebellar climbing fibers comprise the sole efferent projection from the IO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ruigrok et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, in adults, stimulation of the IO does not evoke or modulate movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gellman et al., 1985</xref>).</p><p>With respect to (b), although the IO can receive short-latency reafferent signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gellman et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sedgwick and Williams, 1967</xref>), it is unlikely that reafference can account for the short-latency peaks observed here. Consider that for the structures in which we have seen clear evidence of twitch-related reafference (e.g. ECN), we have also seen clear exafferent responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tiriac et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tiriac and Blumberg, 2016</xref>). In contrast, in IO units that exhibited sharp peaks with a latency of ±10 ms, exafferent stimulation did not evoke significant increases in firing rate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, only a small number of IO units (7/37) exhibited twitch-triggered responses at latencies consistent with reafferent processing (&gt;10 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, the signature feature of the majority of IO activity—a sharp peak centered on twitch onset—is consistent with the notion that the IO receives CD associated with the production of a twitch.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>LRN neurons exhibit two kinds of twitch-related activity</title><p>Based on research in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alstermark and Ekerot, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Arshavsky et al., 1978</xref>), we predicted that the LRN, like the IO, would exhibit CD-related activity.

First, neurons receiving CD should increase their activity at the onset of a movement; as shown here, the activity of IO and LRN neurons increases precisely at the onset of twitches, exhibiting a temporal profile that clearly distinguishes it from twitch-preceding activity in MDJ nuclei and twitch-following activity in the ECN. Second, a CD should originate in a structure that is demonstrably involved in the production of movement; as shown here, the twitch-related activity in the IO and LRN originates from several independent motor structures in the MDJ that are involved in the production of twitches and wake movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Del Rio-Bermudez et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, areas receiving CD should themselves play no direct role in the production of movement; as precerebellar nuclei whose efferents project exclusively to the cerebellum, the IO and LRN cannot directly produce movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gellman et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ruigrok et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, at P8 (and also P12) in rats, pharmacological inactivation of the deep cerebellar nuclei with muscimol exerted no discernible effects on either the rate of twitching or the duration of active sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Del Rio-Bermudez et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the twitch-related activity in the IO and LRN satisfies the key criteria of CD. Below we discuss the implications of this finding and its significance for sensorimotor development.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Neurophysiological identification of CD signals in behaving animals</title><p>Neural pathways conveying CD have been delineated in a diverse array of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dale and Cullen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davis et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sommer and Wurtz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yang et al., 2008</xref>).

The relatively small and simple nervous systems of these species have allowed for the isolation of neurons that carry or receive CD signals and identify their relationship to behavior. In contrast, CD signals have thus far only been recorded in the mediodorsal thalamus of non-human primates during eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sommer and Wurtz, 2004</xref>) and in the auditory cortex of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The current findings provide the first direct neurophysiological evidence of CD in a developing mammal.

This is surprising because, as shown here and in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Del Rio-Bermudez et al., 2015</xref>), twitch-related motor activity in MDJ neurons exhibits broad peaks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). How does a broad presynaptic signal in the MDJ get converted into a sharp postsynaptic response in the IO and LRN (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>)? To answer this question, we focused on the IO because, compared with the LRN, a much higher proportion of its neurons exhibited sharp peaks.</p><p>There are a few possible candidate mechanisms. For example, in cortical pyramidal neurons, interactions between excitatory and inhibitory inputs can sharpen a neuron’s activity profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kremkow et al., 2010</xref>). A similar mechanism is unlikely to operate in the IO for several reasons. First, inhibitory interneurons are sparse in that structure (&lt;0.1%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nelson and Mugnaini, 1988</xref>). Second, although the IO receives its predominant inhibitory input from the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Zeeuw et al., 1988</xref>), DCN activity occurs ~40 ms after a twitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Del Rio-Bermudez et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, in pilot experiments, we found that pharmacological inactivation of the DCN had no effect on IO activity at P8, consistent with a previously published report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nicholson and Freeman, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Consequently, we hypothesized that inhibition in the IO is mediated by SK channels. In the IO of adult rats, these channels prevent summation of excitatory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Garden et al., 2017</xref>). Here, using pharmacological inactivation, we demonstrate that SK channels contribute to sharpening the olivary CD signal. A similar mechanism could be functional in the LRN as SK channels are also expressed in that structure in adult rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xu et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Differential actions of CD signals at precerebellar nuclei</title><p>We previously demonstrated that wake-related reafference is blocked within the ECN, likely due to modulation by a wake-related CD signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tiriac and Blumberg, 2016</xref>). This CD-mediated blockade was lifted during twitching, thereby allowing twitch-related reafference to be conveyed to downstream motor structures, including the cerebellum. In contrast, focusing here on the IO and LRN, we found that the twitch-related CD signals themselves—not reafference—are conveyed to the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Therefore, within this broader context, we see that CD accompanies sleep and wake behavior in infants, but its effects are not monolithic: It can modulate the action of a comparator to gate reafference (as in the ECN) or be transmitted sequentially to multiple downstream structures (as in the IO or LRN → cerebellum). Such diverse effects of CD have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crapse and Sommer, 2008</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38213.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary diagram depicting the flow of twitch-related activity in the cerebellar system during active sleep in week-old rats.</title><p>A motor command from the MDJ to muscle (green line) produces a twitch.

In addition, and as shown here, IO and LRN units were less likely to be AW-on than AS-on and exhibited weak and unreliable activity profiles around the onset of wake movements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Altogether, the patterns of state-dependent activity in these three precerebellar nuclei are consistent with what was observed downstream in the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei at these ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Del Rio-Bermudez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sokoloff et al., 2015a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Functional implications of CD and reafference</title><p>The developing sensorimotor system receives substantial sensory input from self-generated twitches and from external stimulation arising from the mother and littermates. It has been suggested that the infant brain does not distinguish between these two sources of input and that twitch-related reafference serves merely as a ‘proxy’ for exafferent stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmetshina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McVea et al., 2016</xref>). This suggestion rests in part on the observation that both forms of stimulation, despite their very different origins, trigger similar patterns of cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmetshina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tiriac et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). With our finding that CD accompanies the production of twitches, it is now clear that there exists a mechanism with which the infant brain can distinguish self-generated from other-generated movements; the ability to make this distinction is thought to rely in part on the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blakemore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>There are a number of ways in which twitch-related CD could contribute to cerebellar development and function. For example, in the adult cerebellum, CD and reafference converge onto Purkinje cells via climbing and mossy fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blakemore et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van Kan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>). In this way, it is thought that the cerebellum instantiates a forward model that receives sensory predictions and computes prediction errors (by comparing CD with reafference) in order to facilitate motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blakemore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Requarth and Sawtell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Twitches could contribute to the process by which forward models are instantiated and updated, especially in the context of a rapidly growing body. To appreciate this possibility, consider this description of cerebellar function: “After much trial and error during infancy and throughout life, the cerebellum learns to associate actual movements with intended movements. Many of our motor memories are movements that we have repeated millions or billions of times...” (p. 538, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mason, 2011</xref>). In that context, the millions of twitches produced in early infancy could be a critical source of repeated convergent input to the developing cerebellum. This convergence, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, would provide the developing cerebellum with abundant opportunities to align prediction and feedback signals in a topographically organized fashion.</p><p>Cerebellar circuitry undergoes substantial development over the first three postnatal weeks in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altman, 1972a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Altman, 1972b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Altman, 1972c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shimono et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang and Zoghbi, 2001</xref>). Many of these developmental processes depend heavily on neural activity, including climbing fiber synapse elimination and translocation at Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Andjus et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kakizawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kano and Hashimoto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Watanabe and Kano, 2011</xref>). With respect to synapse elimination, beginning around P8, the initial multiple innervation of Purkinje cells by climbing fibers begins to shift toward singly innervated cells in the second postnatal week as one climbing fiber is selectively strengthened over others. Importantly, spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has been implicated in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kawamura et al., 2013</xref>); STDP depends on the repetitive and sequential firing of pre- and post-synaptic cells within a short and precise time window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Feldman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kawamura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sgritta et al., 2017</xref>). The present findings in precerebellar nuclei, in which twitch-related CD reliably preceded reafference by approximately 10–30 ms, are consistent with twitches playing a role in cerebellar development via STDP. In fact, recording from Purkinje cells at P8, we previously found that both complex and simple spikes were highly likely to occur within 0–50 ms after twitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sokoloff et al., 2015a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications for neurodevelopmental disorders</title><p>Disruption of cerebellar function during sensitive periods of development can have negative cascading effects on cerebello-cortical communication and ultimately on associated sensorimotor and cognitive processes, as observed in autism-spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Diamond, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).

The experimenter, blind to the electrophysiological record, scored the pup’s sleep and wake behaviors, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Karlsson et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>At the end of the recording session, the experimenter assessed evoked neural responses to exafferent stimulation of the limbs. Forelimbs and hindlimbs were gently stimulated using a paint brush. When responses to a limb stimulation were observed in at least one of the recording channels, stimulation of that limb was repeated 20–30 times at intervals of at least 5 s. Each stimulus event was marked using a key press.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Histology</title><p>At the end of all recording sessions, pups were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (1.5 mg/g IP) or ketamine/xylazine (0.02 mg/g IP) and perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline and 4% formaldehyde. Brains were sectioned coronally at 80 µm using a freezing microtome (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Recording sites were determined by examining DiI tracks, before and after staining with cresyl violet, using a fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Retrograde tracing</title><p>Retrograde tracing was performed at P8 (n = 7) using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 or 488 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). WGA-555 was injected into the IO in three pups and into the LRN in two pups. In the remaining two pups, dual tracing was performed by injecting WGA-488 into the IO and WGA-555 into the LRN. To perform these injections, a pup was anesthetized with 2–5% isoflurane and secured in a stereotaxic apparatus. A 0.5 µl microsyringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) was lowered stereotaxically into the IO or LRN and 0.01–0.02 µl of 2% WGA-555 or WGA-488 (dissolved in 0.9% saline) was injected over 1 min. After a 15-min post-infusion period, the microsyringe was withdrawn and the incision was closed using Vetbond (3M, Maplewood, MN). The pup was returned to its home cage and perfused 24 hr later as described above. Brains were sectioned coronally at 50 µm. Every other section was kept for Nissl staining for verification of the injection sites and areas that show retrograde labeling. Retrogradely labeled cell bodies were imaged using a fluorescent microscope (DFC300FX, Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL)</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Stimulation of MDJ structures</title><p>In urethanized (1.5 mg/g) head-fixed P8 rats (n = 8), a parylene-coated tungsten stimulating electrode (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) was lowered into the MDJ nuclei most strongly implicated by retrograde tracing. The nuclei were electrically stimulated to produce discrete movements of the forelimbs and/or hindlimbs. Trains of pulses (pulse duration: 0.2–0.4 ms; pulse frequency: 300 Hz; train width: 45 ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williams et al., 2014</xref>) were delivered every 5 s for 60 min. The current was adjusted (300–900 μA) as needed to ensure that stimulation continued to reliably produce movement. Ninety min after the last stimulation, the pup was sacrificed and the brain was prepared for c-Fos immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry for c-Fos expression</title><p>Brains were sliced in 50 μm sections and every other section was kept for Nissl staining for verification of the stimulation sites and visualization of c-Fos expression, respectively. Primary antibody against c-Fos (anti-c-Fos rabbit polyclonal IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted 1:1000 in a universal blocking serum (2% bovine serum albumin; 1% triton; 0.02% sodium azide) and applied to the sections. Sections were coverslipped and left to incubate for 48 hr at 4˚C. After incubation of the primary antibody and a series of washes in PBS, a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY; 1:500 in PBS) was applied to the sections and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. The slides were coverslipped using Fluoro-Gel (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and expression of c-Fos was examined using a fluorescent microscope (DFC300FX or DM6B, Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Intra-IO injection of apamin</title><p>In 18 P8 rats, pups were prepared for electrophysiological recording as described above and transferred to the recording rig. Once a pup started cycling between sleep and wake, a 0.5 µl microsyringe was lowered stereotaxically into the IO and 100 nl of apamin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA; 1 µM, dissolved in 0.9% saline, n = 8) or saline (n = 10) was injected over 1 min. During preparation of the drug or vehicle, fluorogold (4%, Fluorochrome, Denver, CO) was added to the solutions for subsequent assessment of the extent of drug diffusion. After a 15-min period to allow for diffusion, the microsyringe was withdrawn and a recording electrode was lowered in its place into the IO and activity was recorded for 30 min. At the end of the experiment, the pup was sacrificed and its brain was prepared for histology as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Spike sorting</title><p>As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mukherjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sokoloff et al., 2015a</xref>), action potentials (signal-to-noise≥2:1) were sorted from MUA records using template matching and principal component analysis in Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design). Waveforms exceeding 3.5 SD from the mean of a given template were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Identification of behavioral states</title><p>EMG activity and behavioral scoring were used to identify behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Blumberg et al., 2015</xref>). To establish an EMG threshold for distinguishing sleep from wake, EMG signals were rectified and smoothed (tau = 0.001 s). The mean amplitude of high muscle tone and atonia were calculated from five representative 1-s segments and the midpoint between the two was used to establish the threshold for defining periods of wake (defined as muscle tone being above the threshold for at least 1 s) and sleep (defined as muscle tone being below the threshold for at least 1 s). Active wake (AW) was identified by high-amplitude limb movements (e.g. stepping, stretching) against a background of high muscle tone and was confirmed using behavioral scoring. The onset of a wake movement was defined on the basis of EMG amplitude surpassing the established threshold. Active sleep (AS) was characterized by the presence of myoclonic twitches of the limbs against a background of muscle atonia. Twitches were identified as sharp EMG events that exceeded by ≥3 x the mean EMG baseline during atonia; twitches were also confirmed by behavioral scoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Seelke and Blumberg, 2010</xref>). Additionally, behavioral quiescence (BQ) was characterized as periods of low muscle tone interposed between AW and AS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>State-dependent neural activity</title><p>For each unit, average firing rate across all behavioral states was determined. Bouts of AS, AW, and BQ were excluded when firing rates exceeded 3 SD of the firing rate for that behavioral state; this happened rarely (0–2 per unit). Next, pairwise comparison of firing rates across states was performed using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test (SPSS; IBM, Armonk, NY). Units were categorized as AS-on (AS &gt;AW ≥ BQ), AW-on (AW &gt;AS ≥ BQ), AS+AW-on (AS = AW &gt; BQ) or state-independent (AS = AW = BQ). Firing rates of all AS-on and AS+AW-on units across behavioral states were further compared using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Twitch-triggered neural activity</title><p>To determine the relationship between unit activity and twitching, we triggered unit activity on twitch onsets and generated perievent histograms over a 1-s window using 5- or 10-ms bins. We performed these analyses on each individual unit using twitches from nuchal, forelimb, and hindlimb muscles. We tested statistical significance by jittering twitch events 1000 times over a 500-ms window using PatternJitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Amarasingham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harrison and Geman, 2009</xref>), implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA), which generates upper and lower confidence bands (p &lt; 0.05 or 0.01 for each band) using a method that corrects for multiple comparisons. For each unit, after histograms were separately constructed for nuchal, forelimb, or hindlimb twitches, we identified activity that was significant in response to a twitch. When more than one muscle yielded a significant change in neural activity, we further analyzed the data only for the muscle that showed the strongest relationship (determined by the highest firing rate) between twitches and unit activity. We then pooled these data to create perievent histograms composed of significant units and performed final jitter analyses on the pooled data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-5"><title>Wake-triggered neural activity</title><p>To determine the relationship between neural activity and wake movements, we triggered unit activity on wake-movement onset and, as described above, used jitter analyses to determine which units were individually significant. When appropriate, we pooled these data to create perievent histograms composed of significant units and performed final jitter analyses on the pooled data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-6"><title>Evoked response to exafferent stimulation</title><p>We identified MUA in which evoked responses were observed and then sorted the units. Those units were then pooled and triggered on stimulus onset (determined using EMG artifact) to create perievent histograms. The jitter analysis was performed on the individual unit data, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-7"><title>Intra-olivary injection of apamin</title><p>First, we identified if apamin affected sleep-wake behavior. We assessed the amount of time spent in AS and the number of twitches per min of AS in each pup. Differences across groups were tested using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Next, we determined if apamin altered the overall firing rate. We calculated the firing rate of each unit during AS and compared that across groups using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. One value exceeding 3 SD was excluded as an outlier.</p><p>We then assessed whether apamin altered the shape of twitch-triggered perievent histogram. First, we created perievent histograms (10-ms bins, 1-s window) for each unit as described above. For each unit, firing rate was normalized to the peak firing rate and the average normalized firing rate across all units in each group was calculated. Perievent histograms were then created with the average (+SEM) normalized firing rates triggered on twitches for each group. Next, we assessed how apamin altered the pattern of twitch-triggered activity of individual units. To do that, we identified significant units by performing jitter analysis on individual units as described above. We counted the percentage of units that showed a precise peak within ±10 ms of twitch onset and compared that across groups using a Chi-squared test. Finally, we pooled significant units in each group and pooled them to create perievent histograms consisting of significant units only. To assess the difference in the shape of perievent histograms, we calculated the area under the curve by adding the histogram counts within a particular time window and compared that across groups using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. One value exceeding 3 SD was excluded as an outlier.</p><p>Unless otherwise stated, alpha was set at 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data availability</title><p>Source data files have been provided for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Alex Tiriac and Jimmy Dooley for helpful comments and technical assistance.

What follows is the editors’ letter requesting such plan.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;It's not you, it's me: Corollary discharge in precerebellar nuclei of sleeping infant rats&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, which may potentially include new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>The reviewers were generally enthusiastic about the importance of this work. However, all reviewers felt that one finding was not supported by replications in a sufficient number of mice (i.e., Figure 4C), although reviewers all agreed that the authors could choose to deal with this issue in a few different ways (see reviewer #1, Essential revision 1). Reviewers also agreed that more thorough analyses of neuronal recordings, particularly during awake movements, would strengthen the paper. Moreover, it was agreed that the authors should include confidence intervals, or error bars, on figures where appropriate (e.g.,, Figure 2D, Figure 5F, Figure 6E, Figure 6G).</p><p>However, during the discussion, reviewers were unable to come to an agreement on another major point. One reviewer strongly felt that a microstimulation experiment was essential to prove that the observed activity is a corollary discharge and not associated with the generation of twitch movement (reviewer #3, Essential revision 3). The second reviewer strongly disagreed (i.e., thought that this experiment was not essential to the paper's main conclusions), and the first reviewer did not have a strong opinion either way. So, in the end, the Reviewing Editor and the reviewers decided to let the authors choose how to address this point and to explain their decision in their action plan. The reviews are included in their entirety below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Sleep during development is important for shaping sensorimotor development. This study investigates neural circuits underlying sensorimotor development. The study investigates the extent to which twitches occurring in infant rats are just random muscle movements without any further relevance for the developing motor system or instead internally generated movement which share the same neuronal substrates as movements during wakefulness, including corollary discharge and efference copies.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 4C used only n=2. This is a low number of rats that does not support a concrete conclusion. When presenting this result, the authors should either include more rats to increase their n, remove this finding, or write a caveat in the Results section (since these experiments in which tracers were injected into two brain areas in the same rat simply bolster the results that were already shown with single tracer injections in each of the two brain areas in two different, larger groups of rats).</p><p>2) Figure 1B, Figure 3B, Figure 5B: It is unclear whether these histology pictures are really from rats in which units were recorded. To better help the readers to understand where the recording was performed, it would be informative to add the actual histology picture showing the position of the electrode.</p><p>3) Figure 5—figure supplement 1B: Why is the wake movement related perievent histogram so flat compared to the very sharp twitch related histogram in Figure 2? Do the IO neurons only fire in response to specific movements such that in average the peak is blurred out? If so, what subclass of movements is accompanied by IO spiking? For example, do only forelimb movements show CD? To convincingly show that the IO is part of the &quot;normal&quot; pathway how internally generated movements are triggered, I would assume that these neurons should show similar precise and discharge during wake movements.</p><p>To stress the point that the IO is a (potentially) unique brain area in the mammalian brain showing CD the authors should invest a bit more into explaining what happens during wakefulness. Which types of movements are accompanied by CD, how reliable is the CD, etc.? Perhaps some example raw traces could be shown. Overall such data would further stress the significance of CD during active sleep for development. (If the IO only shows CD during active sleep, but not during wake, it's probably not that important for development).

The question addressed in the current study is whether the lack of a corollary discharge following sleep twitches is a general, nervous system wide phenomenon or limited to the external cuneate nucleus. The latter was suggested by an experiment that showed that sleep twitches elicited complex and simple spikes in the cerebellum. This brings us to the current study: Investigating whether or not the sources for climbing fiber and mossy fiber pathways (inferior olive and lateral reticular nucleus, respectively) show evidence of sleep twitch-related corollary discharge.</p><p>Using a combination of approaches – electrophysiology, microstimulation, immediate-early gene expression, tracers, and pharmacology – the authors provide converging (and convincing) evidence that the both the inferior olive and the lateral reticular nucleus receive a corollary discharge following sleep-twitches (with the lateral reticular nucleus also showing longer-latency reafferent responses in some neurons).</p><p>This work is another important piece of the puzzle of sleep twitches and their role in nervous system development. I don't have any issues with the experiments or their interpretations. No single approach is entirely convincing but when taken together, it is difficult to reach any other conclusion than the existence of sleep twitch corollary discharge in the inferior olive and lateral reticular nucleus.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The number of neurons for some conditions seems to be a bit on the low side (e.g., 16 neurons for the LRN experiments). The authors should explain why this is so (e.g., difficult to record from certain structures?) and provide effect sizes.</p><p>2) It would be nice to have the cresyl violet sections for the tracer results shown in Figure 4.</p><p>3) The Introduction does not do justice to the importance of the study. In its current form it quickly jumps into the Blumberg's lab previous studies as a source of motivation. It seems like one could broaden the audience by introducing first the importance of twitches during development to the self-organizing nervous system, then the putative importance of corollary discharges in this process.</p><p>4) The reader might better follow the logic of the results if the paragraph that starts the Discussion section (about how to identify a corollary discharge signal) was moved to the beginning of the Results section.</p><p>5) The Abstract does not do justice to the many approaches taken by the authors to support their discovery. As it stands, it seems like they only did some recordings and the apamin experiment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study builds on prior work from the same laboratory on the role of active sleep-associated brain activity in generation of twitches during nervous system development. The authors here provide a descriptive overview of twitch-associated discharge in inferior olive and lateral reticular nuclei of the cerebellum. They demonstrate that the firing of large subpopulations of neurons in the IO and LRN is higher during active sleep than during waking and is locked to the execution of twitches during sleep. Some additional characterization of the described results is essential for data interpretation. Specific suggestions are outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be useful to better characterize certain parameters described in the results. For example, it would be nice to see the ratio of AS firing to awake firing for individual units classified as AS-on, AW-on and AS+AW-on. It would also be helpful to show a quantification of the ratio of twitch-associated to non-twitch associated firing for each cell.</p><p>2) What about the AW-on cells in IO and LRN? How does their activity correlate with movements? Because the major novel finding is the discrimination of AS twitch associated activity (as opposed to waking movement activity), it would be nice to see a comparison of these two phenomena.</p><p>3) The authors claim, based on prior work, that the activity of IO and LRN is not responsible for generating or altering movements. It would be very useful to demonstrate this in the system under study, across AS and AW. The authors do stimulation studies as described above, but effects of stimulation of IO and LRN in different states, to fully characterize effects (or lack thereof) on movement would make the firing correlations far more meaningful.</p><p>4) On a related note, the authors use apamin to test how correlated firing is driven with respect to (twitch) movements. A quantification of the relationship of this firing effect to movement (if any) would be very helpful (i.e., an analysis of the temporal relationship of firing, relative to both twitches <italic>and</italic> movements during waking, under control and apamin-treated conditions). This would further bolster the argument that the firing of these neurons is a pure CD and not a driver of movement.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Corollary discharge in precerebellar nuclei of sleeping infant rats&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, all reviewers felt that one finding was not supported by replications in a sufficient number of mice (i.e., Figure 4C), although reviewers all agreed that the authors could choose to deal with this issue in a few different ways (see reviewer #1, Essential revision 1). Reviewers also agreed that more thorough analyses of neuronal recordings, particularly during awake movements, would strengthen the paper. Moreover, it was agreed that the authors should include confidence intervals, or error bars, on figures where appropriate (e.g., Figure 2D, Figure 5F, Figure 6E, Figure 6G).</p><p>However, during the discussion, reviewers were unable to come to an agreement on another major point. One reviewer strongly felt that a microstimulation experiment was essential to prove that the observed activity is a corollary discharge and not associated with the generation of twitch movement (reviewer #3, Essential revision 3). The second reviewer strongly disagreed (i.e., thought that this experiment was not essential to the paper's main conclusions), and the first reviewer did not have a strong opinion either way. So, in the end, the Reviewing Editor and the reviewers decided to let the authors choose how to address this point and to explain their decision in their action plan. The reviews are included in their entirety below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 4C used only n=2. This is a low number of rats that does not support a concrete conclusion. When presenting this result, the authors should either include more rats to increase their n, remove this finding, or write a caveat in the Results section (since these experiments in which tracers were injected into two brain areas in the same rat simply bolster the results that were already shown with single tracer injections in each of the two brain areas in two different, larger groups of rats).</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern and have added language to the text to clarify the number of subjects used in this tracing study in the subsection “Non-overlapping regions in the mesodiencephalic junction (MDJ) project to the IO and LRN”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1B, Figure 3B, Figure 5B: It is unclear whether these histology pictures are really from rats in which units were recorded. To better help the readers to understand where the recording was performed, it would be informative to add the actual histology picture showing the position of the electrode.</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended, we have added Nissl-stained images in Figure 1B, Figure 3B, and Figure 5B to show the position of the recording electrodes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 5—figure supplement 1B: Why is the wake movement related perievent histogram so flat compared to the very sharp twitch related histogram in Figure 2? Do the IO neurons only fire in response to specific movements such that in average the peak is blurred out? If so, what subclass of movements is accompanied by IO spiking? For example, do only forelimb movements show CD? To convincingly show that the IO is part of the &quot;normal&quot; pathway how internally generated movements are triggered, I would assume that these neurons should show similar precise and discharge during wake movements.</p><p>To stress the point that the IO is a (potentially) unique brain area in the mammalian brain showing CD the authors should invest a bit more into explaining what happens during wakefulness. Which types of movements are accompanied by CD, how reliable is the CD, etc.? Perhaps some example raw traces could be shown. Overall such data would further stress the significance of CD during active sleep for development. (If the IO only shows CD during active sleep, but not during wake, it's probably not that important for development). Similarly, it would be interesting for the authors to also perform more analyses for the neuronal activity in LRN and MDJ during wakefulness.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have now performed more thorough analyses of wake-related activity and added that information to the manuscript (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1). In general, wake-related activity in the IO and LRN is weaker and less reliable than for twitch-related activity (see subsection “MDJ neurons adjacent to the RN are active before and after the production of twitches”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;Moreover, of the 7 IO units that exhibited twitch-triggered responses at latencies consistent with reafferent processing (i.e.,, &gt; 10 ms; Figure 2—figure supplement 1E), 3 responded to exafferent stimulation.&quot;</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 1E does not show the data for exafferent stimulation.

AW-on cells, however, were extremely rare in both the IO (2/35 units) and LRN (2/27 units) at this age. In contrast with AS-on units, in which activity often decreased after wake onset, AW-on cells exhibited persistent activity throughout wake bouts. Importantly, the activity during wake was significantly higher than that during the other two states (subsections “IO activity predominates during active sleep” and “LRN neurons exhibit two kinds of twitch-related activity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claim, based on prior work, that the activity of IO and LRN is not responsible for generating or altering movements.

It is certainly true that the lower frequency of wake movements creates some difficulties for analysis, but the lower frequency of wake movements also highlights the relative significance of twitching. This significance is supported further by the fact that wake-related activity in the precerebellar nuclei is either actively suppressed (see Tiriac and Blumberg,2016) or relatively weak and unreliable (as shown here).</p><p>In discussing wake-related activity in the paper, we did not sufficiently emphasize how our results are consistent with what we have reported previously downstream in the cerebellum: that neural activity is high during active sleep and low during wake. Accordingly, we have edited the text to highlight these facts and communicate the results using more consistent language. See subsection “MDJ neurons adjacent to the RN are active before and after the production of twitches”, subsection “Differential actions of CD signals at precerebellar nuclei”, and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 legend.</p><p>We have also come to believe that the inclusion of Figure 7B detracted from the main focus of the paper, which is communicated most clearly in Figure 7A.
