Using a tripartite genetic system to selectively ablate either V1 or V2b INs in the caudal spinal cord and assess their specific functions in awake behaving animals, we find that V1 and V2b INs function in an opposing manner to control flexor–extensor-driven movements. Ablation of V1 INs results in limb hyperflexion, suggesting that V1 IN-derived inhibition is needed for proper extension movements of the limb. The loss of V2b INs results in hindlimb hyperextension and a delay in the transition from stance phase to swing phase, demonstrating V2b INs are required for the timely initiation and execution of limb flexion movements. Our findings also reveal a bias in the innervation of flexor- and extensor-related motor neurons by V1 and V2b INs that likely contributes to their differential actions on flexion–extension movements.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04718.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04718.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04718.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Although there are many different movements an animal can make with its limbs—from reaching to walking—they all basically involve two sets of muscles that act as opposing levers around each joint. ‘Flexor’ muscles contract to bend the limb, and ‘extensor’ muscles contract to extend the limb. When an animal is walking these two sets of muscles contract repeatedly, one after the other. Inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord coordinate these walking movements by preventing the flexor or extensor muscles from contracting at the same time. In 2014, researchers discovered that two groups of inhibitory neurons, known as the V1 and V2b interneurons, are essential for this alternating pattern of flexing and extending of the limbs of newborn mice. However, these experiments were not able to assess the particular contribution that the V1 and V2b neurons each make to limb movements.</p><p>Now, Britz et al.—including several of the researchers involved in the 2014 study—have used a sophisticated genetic technique in mice to investigate the role that each group of neurons plays separately. This involved introducing a gene into either the V1 or V2b neurons that makes them susceptible to being killed with the diphtheria toxin. Injecting the mice with diphtheria toxin selectively removed these cells from the regions of the spinal cord that controls hindlimb movements.</p><p>Britz et al. found that removing either group of neurons prevented the mice from walking normally. Eliminating the V1 neurons caused extreme flexing of the hindlimbs, revealing that the V1 neurons are needed to extend the limb by inhibiting the motor neurons that contract the flexor muscles. In contrast, the loss of V2b neurons caused exaggerated hindlimb extension, indicating that the V2b neurons inhibit the motor neurons that innervate extensor muscles.</p><p>Both the V1 and V2b groups of neurons contain a wide range of different cell types. Future studies will therefore need to explore how these different cells are involved in coordinating the motions involved in walking.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04718.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04718.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>motor behavior</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>mouse genetic</kwd><kwd>spinal interneurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS037075, NS090919</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goulding</surname><given-names>Martyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research (Instituts de recherche en santé du Canada)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIHR MOP 86470</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gosgnach</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two classes of premotor inhibitory neurons have specific roles in controlling flexor-extensor behaviors in mice, which is the underlying neural mechanism for limb driven movements in terrestrial vertebrates.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Terrestrial animals use their limbs to generate a broad array of motor behaviors, from stereotypical movements that include protective reflexes and locomotion to complex volitional tasks that are exemplified by reaching and grasping movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grillner, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alstermark and Isa, 2012</xref>). Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sherrington (1906)</xref> first demonstrated that all such motor behaviors rely on the reciprocal actions of flexor and extensor muscles around each limb joint and that terrestrial animals require reciprocal inhibition to move and articulate their limbs. It is known that reciprocal flexor–extensor motor activity is produced by inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord, many of which appear to be core components of the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kiehn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goulding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grillner and Jessell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arber, 2012</xref>). However, the functional organization of the inhibitory circuits that control flexor–extensor activity and the contribution that different inhibitory neuron cell types make to flexor–extensor motor control is still poorly understood.</p><p>Studies in the cat have identified a number of physiologically defined IN cell types that are candidates for exercising flexor–extensor control. The most prominent of these are reciprocal Ia inhibitory interneurons (IaINs), which are activated by muscle spindle afferents and inhibit antagonist motor neurons. IaINs are rhythmically active during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feldman and Orlovsky, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pratt and Jordan, 1987</xref>) and scratching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deliagina and Orlovsky, 1980</xref>). Peak IaIN activity coincides with the phase in which antagonist motor neurons are hyperpolarized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pratt and Jordon, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geertsen et al., 2011</xref>). This activity profile is strong evidence of a central role in reciprocal inhibition. The contribution that non-reciprocal inhibitory Ib interneurons (IbINs) make to locomotion is less clear. While the IbINs that are innervated by Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) generally inhibit homonymous motor neurons under non-locomotor conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jankowska, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pearson and Collins, 1993</xref>), during locomotion the Ib pathway exerts an excitatory effect on extensor motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conway et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pearson and Collins, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gossard et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angel et al., 2005</xref>). Nonetheless, inhibition mediated by IbINs has been observed during the extension phase of walking in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shoji et al., 2005</xref>). This inhibition is associated with the unloading of the limb, and it suggests that IbINs may contribute to the phase transition from stance (extension) to swing (flexion). The role that Renshaw cells play in shaping flexor–extensor locomotor activity appears to be more limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pratt and Jordan, 1987</xref>). While these cells are rhythmically active during locomotor activity, reducing Renshaw cell transmission by pharmacological or genetic blockade of cholinergic transmission changes the periodicity of the locomotor rhythm with little discernible effect on flexor–extensor alternation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noga et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Myers et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Genetic analyses in mice have identified a number of molecularly defined interneuron populations that provide inhibition to motor neurons (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goulding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arber, 2012</xref>). Among these are three prominent populations of ipsilaterally projecting inhibitory interneurons: dorsal Lbx1-derived inhibitory INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gross et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tripodi et al., 2011</xref>) and ventral V1 and V2b INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saueressig et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sapir et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The V1 and V2b IN populations are both heterogeneous, being made up of multiple physiological cell types including Renshaw cells (V1 INs), IaINs (V1 and V2b INs) and putative IbINs (V2b INs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sapir et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3a">Alvarez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), as well as other as yet unidentified inhibitory cell types. Recently, we have found that the composite activities of the V1 and V2b INs are required to secure flexor–extensor alternation in the in vitro neonatal spinal cord and in newborn mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). This finding is consistent with our demonstration that cells with the features of IaINs are derived from both V1 and V2b INs and that disynaptic reciprocal inhibition is only abolished when both of these populations are functionally inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The limited repertoire of motor behaviors that can be assayed using the in vitro neonatal spinal cord preparation, together with our inability to discern any marked differences in the function of V1 and V2b INs with respect to generating an alternating flexor–extensor motor rhythm in vitro, prompted us to examine the contribution that V1 and V2b INs make to motor control in awake behaving mice. In particular, we were interested in determining whether these two inhibitory interneuron classes control discrete aspects of limb movement with regard to flexor–extensor-driven motor behaviors. Our results demonstrate a striking functional bias in the actions of V1 and V2b INs on flexor–extensor motor activity, whereby the selective ablation of V1 vs V2b INs results in hindlimb hyperflexion and hyperextension, respectively. This functional bias was observed both in air-stepping juvenile mice and in adult animals performing motor tasks such as over-ground walking. In analyzing the inhibitory inputs to motor neurons from these two interneuron populations, we find a genetically defined bias in V1 and V2b connectivity that likely underpins the differential effects on flexor–extensor motor activity. Specifically, a higher proportion of the inhibitory contacts on flexor motor neurons come from V1 INs as compared to extensor motor neurons, whereas V2b INs preferentially contact motor neurons that innervate extensor muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Efforts to define the contribution that V1 and V2b INs make to locomotion in awake behaving mice have been thwarted by an inability to selectively manipulate these cells in the spinal cord. Although En1 and Gata3 selectively mark spinal V1 and V2b INs, respectively, both genes are expressed elsewhere in the midbrain, medulla and cerebellum, and in non-neuronal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis and Joyner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Doorninck et al., 1999</xref>). Consequently, genetic protocols that employ <italic>En1</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> regulatory sequences alone to silence or ablate V1 and V2b INs cause perinatal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gosgnach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). To circumvent this issue, we devised a tripartite intersectional genetic system that utilizes the combined activities of Cre recombinase and FlpO recombinase and allows us to selectively express the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buch et al., 2005</xref>) in V1 or V2b INs that are located in the caudal spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), thereby making them selectively sensitive to diphtheria toxin (DTX).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04718.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic strategy for targeting DTR expression to V1 and V2b INs neurons in the caudal spinal cord.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the tripartite genetic system used to restrict diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) expression to caudal V1 and V2b INs.

This finding is consistent with the idea that depleting V1 IN inhibition causes a preferential degradation of inhibition to TA flexor motor neurons. The increase in TA burst duration also caused a moderate lengthening of the step cycle period in V1 IN-ablated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). V2b IN-depleted mice displayed a strikingly different pattern of EMG activity during airstepping. In addition to an aggregate slowing of the motor rhythm, the duration of GS extensor muscle activity was markedly elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>) when compared to control and V1 IN-ablated animals. This slowing of the motor rhythm following the loss of V2b INs can largely be attributed to the increased duration of GS extensor activity, as the TA flexor bursts were similar in length to those seen in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that a flexor-dominant motor rhythm emerges when V1 INs are deleted, while the loss of V2b INs gives rise to an extensor-dominant motor rhythm.</p><p>Further analysis of the EMG profiles of V1- and V2b-IN-ablated mice revealed a significant increase in the number and frequency of skipped or deleted GS and TA bursts in air-stepping juvenile mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, arrowheads). Moreover, quantification of these deletions revealed a strong bias in their valency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Whereas TA deletions were prevalent in V2b IN-ablated pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right panel, arrowheads), mice lacking V1 INs displayed a strong bias toward deletions in GS EMG activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, middle panel, arrowhead). The increased frequency of deletions in the V1- and V2b-IN-ablated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) coupled with the changes in phase duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), strongly suggest that inhibition from V1 and V2b INs facilitates the transition from swing to stance and from stance to swing, respectively. Our observation that the deletions in both V1- and V2b-IN-ablated mice fall into the non-resetting category strongly suggests that both of these genetically defined cell populations are involved in pattern formation rather than rhythm generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lafreniere-Roula and McCrea, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Deficits in flexor–extensor motor coordination persist following V1 and V2b IN ablation</title><p>In order to examine the nature of any persistent changes to locomotor behavior that arise from the loss of V1 and V2b INs, we used combined kinematics and EMG recordings to quantitatively analyze changes in the gait of adult animals 3–5 weeks post DTX treatment. By this time, V1- and V2b-IN-ablated mice had regained partial control of their hindlimbs (see ‘Discussion’) and were able to use them to bear weight. V1 IN-ablated mice still displayed marked deficits in their gait, including a persistent hyperflexion of the hindlimbs during walking, which was particularly prominent in the mid-swing and early stance phases of the step cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, middle panel). Furthermore, V1 IN-ablated mice flexed their hindlimbs faster during the swing phase indicating that they are no longer able to properly modulate the speed and/or force of their flexion movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>The EMG analysis of V1 IN-ablated mice revealed marked changes in the duration and co-activity of TA and GS muscle activity. These included (1) a persistent broadening of TA muscle activity, (2) an overlap in GS and TA burst activity during the transition from stance to swing, and (3) an increase in GS activity at the end of the stance phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, middle panel, asterisk; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>). The increase in GS EMG activity during stance phase appears to be a late behavioral modification that facilitates the opening of the ankle joint during walking, as it is not seen during the early phase of V1 IN ablation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The co-activation of the TA and GS muscles was even more pronounced during swimming with EMG analysis revealing synchronous TA and GS muscle activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, middle panel, asterisk) that causes the extension of the hindlimbs to be aborted during the power stroke. One factor that may contribute to the synchronous flexor–extensor activity seen during swimming may be the reduction in sensory feedback from GTOs that has been shown to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akay et al., 2014</xref>). In V1 IN-ablated mice that lack sensory feedback gated by the V1 INs, the likely loss of Ib-mediated sensory inhibition during swimming could account for the observed co-activation of flexor–extensor muscles and abortive hindlimb movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; see ‘Discussion’).</p><p>In addition to the hyperflexion phenotype, V1 IN-ablated mice displayed a prominent rear paw overshoot during walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Kinematic analysis of walking V1 IN-ablated mice revealed two factors that contribute to rear paw overshoot: (1) an increase in the speed and degree of ankle flexion movements during swing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and (2) an increase in the angular rotation of the pelvis during stepping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This rotation of the pelvis appears to be a behavioral adaption that helps extend the forward throw of the leg during late swing phase, so as to negate the reduced hindlimb extension that occurs when V1 INs are depleted from the spinal cord.</p><p>In contrast to V1 IN-ablated mice, the locomotor phenotype that persists in mice lacking V2b INs was much milder, with the most notable change being a prolongation of the stance phase that results in overextension of the ankle joint during walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right panel, arrowhead). EMG analysis revealed the likely cause of this delay, namely a second ectopic burst of GS motor activity as the limb is transitioning from stance to swing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, right panel, asterisk). The delay in initiating flexion was not observed when the mice were swimming nor did we detect any marked differences in TA and GS EMG activity between control and V2b IN-ablated mice during swimming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, right panel).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The loss of V1 INs in adult mice results in the prolongation of flexor motor neuron activity</title><p>A further set of experiments were performed to probe the nature of the early motor deficits that arise when V1 INs are ablated in adult mice. Unfortunately, we were unable to perform a similar analysis of the early motor deficits that occur in adult V2b IN-ablated animals, as treating these animals with a single high dose of DTX caused bowel blockage and increased morbidity. This is likely to be due to the expression of Gata3 in a subset of enteric neurons. Whereas control mice (n = 5 animals) displayed a highly reproducible pattern of EMG activity both before and after DTX treatment, with the iliopsoas (IP) and TA muscles only being active during the swing phase of the step cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, upper left panel), the depletion of V1 INs (n = 6 animals) resulted in ectopic IP and TA muscle EMG activity within 5 days of DTX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>, upper panel). This ectopic TA and IP muscle activity was even more pronounced 7 days after DTX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>, upper panel), with the TA muscle being co-active during stance with the GS muscle (see bars). A similar expansion of IP activity was observed, although to a less extent than that seen in the TA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>, arrowhead). We posit that the co-activation of the TA and IP muscles during stance constitutes the underlying mechanism that restricts the hip and ankle joints from opening during walking, and it also contributes to the postural changes that occur in V1 IN-ablated mice following DTX treatment. By contrast, there was no increase in GS activity during the swing/flexor phase indicating the loss of V1 INs has an effect on ankle flexor but not extensor activity during walking.</p><p>A careful comparison of kinematic movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, lower panels) and the time locked EMG traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, upper panels) revealed a close correspondence between angular movement of the ankle and EMG activity in the TA and GS muscles. During the early phase of V1 IN cell loss (5 days p.i.), the ankle joint angle at maximal flexion was reduced from 40° to less than 30° (lower middle panel). There was also a progressive decrease in maximal extension of the ankle joint in early swing phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, lower panels, asterisks). A similar hyperflexion phenotype was noted for the knee and hip joints, as indicated by their reduced angular changes during walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, lower panels). In the case of the hip joint, this is consistent with the observed expansion of IP muscle activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>, upper panel, arrowhead). In summary, our findings reveal that V1 INs function to (1) restrict flexor motor activity and promote active limb extension during stance and (2) moderate flexion movements during the swing phase of the step cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Optogenetic activation of V2b INs preferentially suppresses extensor-related locomotor activity</title><p>The weakening of ankle extensor inhibition in V2b IN-ablated mice, as indicated by ectopic GS burst activity during the swing phase of the step cycle and hyperextension of the ankle during walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), led us to ask whether V2b INs preferentially inhibit extensor–motor activity. To test this, we took advantage of the neonatal spinal cord preparation, which can be induced to produce fictive locomotion in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kiehn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goulding, 2009</xref>) and is amenable to optogenetic manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hagglund et al., 2010</xref>). Spinal cords from P0-P1 <italic>Gata3</italic><sup>Cre</sup>; <italic>R26</italic><sup>lsl-ChR2</sup> (<italic>Ai32</italic>) pups displayed a characteristic alternating pattern of L2 flexor-related and L5 extensor-related locomotor rhythm in the presence of NMDA and 5-HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>, n = 6/6 cords). However, upon activating channelrhodopsin in V2b INs, there was a strong and highly selective decrease in extensor-related motor activity as measured by extracellular recordings from the L5 ventral root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>, bar). By contrast, L2 flexor-related motor activity remained largely unchanged following V2b IN activation, although there was some disturbance in the coherence of the motor rhythm. Activation of V1 INs had a more pronounced effect on the motor rhythm, in that it completely suppressed L2 flexor-related and L5 extensor-related rhythmic bursting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, bar, n = 5/5 cords). This is likely to be due to the activation of Renshaw cells, which are known to strongly inhibit motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Windhorst, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhumbra et al., 2014</xref>). In summary, the suppression of extensor-related L5 motor activity in the in vitro spinal cord preparation when V2b INs are activated provides strong evidence that V2b INs can functionally inhibit extensor-related motor activity during locomotion. This finding is consistent with the expansion of extensor motor neuron activity that we see following V2b IN ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5, 6</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04718.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Effect of optogenetic activation of V2b and V1 INs on in vitro locomotion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the in vitro recording setup used for the localized light activation of ChR2 in V1 and V2b INs.

To address this question, defined hindlimb motor pools were visualized by backfilling them from their respective muscles with Cholera Toxin-B (CTB).

The analysis of V1 and V2b inhibitory contacts focused on the soma and proximal dendrites of motor neurons, which is where inputs from inhibitory interneurons such IaINs and Renshaw cells tend to be concentrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jankowska and Roberts, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 1981</xref>).</p><p>Counts of V1-derived inhibitory contacts on motor neurons revealed a strong positive bias in their innervation of the TA ankle flexor motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This preferential innervation is also seen for hip flexor motor neurons, which receive a greater percentage of inputs from V1 INs when compared to their antagonist extensor motor pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). In comparing V1 inhibitory inputs onto TA and GS motor neurons, we counted an approximate twofold greater number of V1-derived synaptic contacts onto TA motor neurons as compared to their antagonist GS counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). Conversely, the proportion of inhibitory contacts onto GS (ankle) extensor motor neurons from V2b INs was higher than the proportion of V2b contacts onto their TA counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We have not seen any significant difference in the proportion of V2b IN contacts onto the knee quadriceps (Q) and BF/St motor pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). These two knee muscle groups are bifunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yakovenko et al., 2002</xref>), and the near neutral weighting of V2b IN inputs onto these motor pools may reflect their bi-functional nature with regard to knee and hip flexion-extension movements. In summary, our findings reveal an overall asymmetry in V1 and V2b in inputs, with flexor-related motor pools receiving proportionately fewer inputs from V2b INs and more from V1 INs, while V2b INs exhibit a bias toward extensor-related motor pools.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study defines, for the first time, the functional contribution that V1 and V2b INs make to flexor–extensor motor behaviors in awake behaving mice by showing that these two inhibitory neuron classes contribute to the functional antagonism of limb movements via their differential actions on limb flexor–extensor motor activity. V1 INs restrict flexor-related motor activity during the stance phase of the step cycle to promote full extension of the limb, whereas V2b INs limit extensor activity to facilitate normal leg flexion movements and the transition to swing. Our results also reveal that the control of limb flexion and extension movements by the V1 and V2b INs is likely to be exerted by graded rather than absolute differences in the inhibition of antagonist motor neurons by V1 and V2b INs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Generation of a flexible genetic system for analyzing neuronal function in the spinal cord</title><p>Multiple methods have been implemented to inactivate genetically defined neurons within a circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2009</xref>).

These systems all have drawbacks. Approaches using tetanus toxin are often non-inducible, while ligand-mediated silencing using Gi-coupled receptors can be highly variable and difficult to quantify. By contrast, DTR-mediated neuronal ablation has the advantage of being highly quantifiable, and the timing of cell killing can also be controlled to minimize potential developmental changes due to the chronic silencing or ablation of cells at early developmental times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gosgnach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Most importantly, by using an intersectional approach to restrict DTR expression to the caudal CNS, we were able to spare essential functions such as respiration and chewing. With further refinements, this intersectional system can be used to target and ablate discrete populations of neurons, including genetically defined subsets of V1 and V2b INs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Differential control of flexor and extensor movements by V1 and V2b INs</title><p>Our results demonstrate that V1 INs facilitate the transition from swing to stance, and V2b INs facilitate the transition from stance to swing.

Interestingly, we see an increase in the incidence of GS (extensor) EMG deletions in airstepping mice that lack V1 INs, suggesting the transition from flexion to extension is compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, these deletions, and the flexor deletions that arise from the loss of the V2b INs, resemble non-resetting deletions in the cat and turtle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grillner and Zangger, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lafreniere-Roula and McCrea, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stein, 2008</xref>). The absence of resetting deletions suggests both populations belong to the pattern forming, rather than rhythm generating, layer of the locomotor CPG. Moreover, the opposing nature of the deletions that occur when V1 vs V2b INs are inactivated suggests that the differential silencing of these two inhibitory cell populations may contribute to the valence of corrective reflexes such as the stumbling corrective reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forssberg, 1979</xref>) and crossed extension reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sherrington, 1910</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Biased vs segregated inhibitory inputs to antagonist motor neurons</title><p>Our preliminary anatomical analysis of the organization of V1 and V2b inputs to motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) reveals a genetically encoded bias in the innervation of flexor vs extensor motor pools by V1 and V2b INs (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Although we were unable to score inhibitory contacts on the distal dendrites of motor neurons, studies showing IaIN and Renshaw cell inhibitory synapses are preferentially located on the soma, and proximal dendrites of motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fyffe, 1991</xref>) suggests that the counts we obtained in this study are likely to be a reasonable measure of the density of V1 and V2b inhibitory synaptic contacts on motor neurons.

This graded recruitment of antagonist flexor–extensor motor neurons would be expected to play an important role in modulating limb stiffness and compliance, which is necessary for smooth movements and postural control. Second, the co-innervation of flexor and extensor motor neurons by V1 and V2b INs would enable motor neurons to actively summate and compare inhibitory inputs that are differentially gated by these two inhibitory interneuron populations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Inhibition and the push–pull control of motor activity</title><p>There is growing evidence that motor neurons receive a mixture of tonic and dynamic inhibition during locomotion that together with excitatory inputs regulate motor neuron excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, the altered membrane conductances produced by concurrent excitation and inhibition are believed to be a fundamental mechanism for changing the gain and dynamic properties of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chance et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mitchell and Silver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Chance, 2005</xref>). Consequently, gain modulation and increases in the variability of motor neuron spiking represent an important mechanism for altering the dynamic range of motor neuron activity, so as to produce smooth gradients of muscle force transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kristan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson et al.

Our observation that V1 and V2b INs are the sole source of Ia inhibition to motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) suggests that they make a major contribution to inhibitory push–pull conductances. As such, the biased innervation of motor neurons by V1 and V2b INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) could facilitate push–pull in limb motor neurons under a range of behavioral conditions. For example, in situations where V2b INs are being dynamically activated by cutaneous feedback, the V1 INs, or subsets thereof, might be tasked with providing tonic inhibition to motor neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Comparative analysis of V1 and V2b IN function in vivo vs in vitro</title><p>Our in vivo behavioral analyses showing an inhibitory network comprised of either V1 or V2b INs still generates an alternating pattern of flexor–extensor activity in awake behaving mice, albeit an abnormal one, concurs with our in vitro analysis showing flexor–extensor alternation is only completely degraded when both the V1 and V2b IN populations are inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). These findings argue that the V1 and V2b INs can function in a redundant manner to produce a grossly alternating flexor–extensor locomotor output, and they are in general agreement with the mixed innervation of flexor and extensor motor neurons by V1 and V2b INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The co-innervation of flexor and extensor motor neurons by V1 and V2b INs may contribute to the functional recovery that occurs following V1 or V2b IN ablation. This functional recovery is suggestive of a degree of plasticity in the inhibitory control of flexor–extensor movements by both inhibitory populations. Interestingly, the functional deficits that persist after ablating the V1 INs are more pronounced than those found following V2b IN ablation. This might be attributable to the relative abundance of these two cell types in the lumbar spinal cord, where there are twice as many V1 INs as compared to V2b INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Differences in the axonal morphology of V1 and V2b INs may also contribute to the persistent hindlimb hyperflexion phenotype V1 IN-ablated mice display, as the motor pools innervating hip and ankle flexors tend to be skewed rostrally in the lumbar spinal cord when compared to their extensor antagonist motor pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McHanwell and Biscoe, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yakovenko et al., 2002</xref>). In this context, it is worth noting that V2b INs predominantly project their axons caudally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) and may therefore have a limited capacity to substitute for those V1 INs that have rostrally projecting axons. In addition to this, there are fewer inhibitory contacts from V2b INs onto flexor motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, the V2b IN-ablated mice regain a large measure of normal limb movement in the aftermath of V2b IN ablation. In this instance, V1 INs, many of which project caudally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), may compensate for the initial loss of V2b IN-derived inhibitory inputs that are proportionately more abundant on extensor motor neurons.</p><p>The one locomotor deficit that persists when the V2b INs are removed is the delay in the transition from stance to swing during walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This transition is controlled in part by Ib pathways from ankle extensor GTOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duysens and Pearson, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pearson, 2008</xref>). Our characterization of presynaptic inputs to V1 and V2b INs showing the V2b INs receive inputs from neurons in the dorsal horn (F Stam and MG, unpublished findings) is a strong indication that inhibitory IbINs are derived from the V2b IN population. As such, the presumed loss of inhibitory IbINs that occurs when V2b INs are ablated could account for the delayed transition from stance to swing that we observe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pearson, 2008</xref>). The loss of IbINs in the V2b IN-ablated mice might also explain why these mice do not show any major change in GS and TA muscle activity during swimming, as Golgi tendon-derived sensory feedback is normally attenuated during this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akay et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates that V1 and V2b INs differentially control flexor–extensor motor output, with V1 INs suppressing flexor motor activity during the stance/extension phase of walking to ensure proper extension of the limbs, while the V2b INs suppress extensor activity to facilitate limb extension and ensure the timely transition from stance to swing. Our results are consistent with the V1 and V2b INs contributing to the dynamic control of limb movements during walking via their differential effects on flexor and extensor motor activity. It should be noted that the V1 and V2b IN populations are made up of multiple cell types and the respective contribution that each of these cell types make to flexor–extensor-driven behaviors needs to be assessed. Future efforts to evaluate in depth how these two populations control flexor–extensor motor behaviors will require a better understanding of the molecular, anatomical, and physiological diversity that exists within these two inhibitory IN populations, coupled with a detailed functional characterization of V1 and V2b IN subtypes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Generation, genotyping and breeding of mice</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted according to NIH guidelines using protocols approved by the Salk Institute for Biological Studies IACUC.

All recordings were performed at least 2 days after electrode implantation. Limb position and movements were tracked with custom-made three-dimensional light reflective markers (2 mm diameter) or black marks positioned on the iliac crest, hip, knee, ankle, paw, and tip of fourth digit of the left hindlimb. Fine EMG recording electrodes were manufactured and implanted into defined hindlimb muscles as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pearson et al., 2005</xref>). Mice were allowed to run or swim in a clear Plexiglas runway and their movements were recorded at 60 to 250 frames/s using an InLine high-speed digital camera (Fastec Imaging Corporation, San Diego, CA). EMG signals were amplified (DAM-50, WPI; DPA-2F, NPI) and recorded using the Clampex acquisition software (Molecular Devices). A time tag triggered by the camera allowed precise synchronization of the EMG and videos recordings.</p><p>The Clampfit data analysis module (Molecular Devices) was used for analyzing and graphing the EMG recording data. Video files were processed using the MaxTRAQ software package (Innovision Systems, Columbiaville, MI). The markers were identified and digitized manually or using the auto tracking feature. The position of the knee was calculated by triangulation based on known femur and tibia bone lengths using the plug-in MaxTRAQ VJR (virtual joint recognition). Data files were further analyzed in MaxMATE, a plug-in for Microsoft Excel. The positions, distances, angles, velocity were analyzed, and plots were generated for selected step sequence.

Small black dots were made on the shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, ankle, and paw to facilitate kinematic analysis. Locomotion was induced by injection of L-DOPA (100 μg/g body weight) subcutaneously into the nape of neck. Animals were immediately placed in a harness that supported the trunk while allowing free movement of the limbs. Airstepping typically commenced 10–15 min post-injection. High-speed video recordings (125 frames/s) of stable rhythmic locomotor activity were made over a 30-min period. Recordings of animals performing a stable sequence of stepping were selected for further kinematic analysis. Videos were digitized using MaxTRAQ software. To measure ankle muscle activity, two fine EMG recording electrodes were inserted into the TA and GS muscles of one hindlimb and EMG activity recorded during stable episodes of locomotion as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Optogenetic activation of V1 and V2b INs</title><p>Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) was excited with a blue LED light source (wavelength 470 nm, max. power 9–10 mW).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L. Calabrese, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors present a very thorough analysis of the physiological roles of V1 and V2b classes of interneurons in the spinal cord of mice. They use elegant genetic techniques to ablate separately these two classes of interneurons from the subcervical spinal cord only in response to DTX injection. They assess the effects of these ablations with a battery of behavioral and electromyographic assays all in awake behaving mice (mainly neonatal). They find that V2b INs predominantly inhibit extensor motor neurons and cause hyperextension when ablated, whereas V1 INs predominantly inhibit flexor motor neurons and cause hyperflexion when ablated. They supplement this work and support these findings with optogenetic experiments in isolated neonatal spinal cord. They then perform anatomical analysis of contacts between each of these two classes of INs and motor neurons and show convincingly that V2b INs contact mainly but not exclusively extensor motor neurons and V1 INs contact mainly but not exclusively flexor motor neurons. Thus inhibitory innervation of motor neurons by these two classes of INs is differential but push-pull. These findings have very important implications for the functional organization of spinal motor circuits. The data set is extensive and thorough. The figures are clear and show necessary data; supplemental figures are extensive but useful. This paper will provoke wide interest among the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>There were some concerns that the authors should address in revision. Each of the reviewers come from different perspectives but provided complementary guidelines for revisions:</p><p>1) The context of the present work needs to be broadened and deepened. Reviewer 2 has several specific suggestions about spinal cord research that should be considered mainly in the Introduction and Discussion. These are repeated in their entirety and should be addressed; it may be that not all the suggested citations are necessary but many can be incorporated to the benefit of the manuscript and each general point should be considered in the authors' response:</p><p>In the Introduction, the references to Feldman and Orlovsky, and Pratt and Jordan are fine, but given Berg et al.'s hypotheses on a simultaneous shift in excitation and inhibition – including the IaIN (the Hultborn's group in Copenhagen used the “Jankowska method” of simultaneous recording of IaIN and the unitary IPSPs in the target motoneurons, thus 100% identified, during fictive locomotion – those interneurons indeed alternate with excitation and are partly responsible for the hyperpolarized phase (please see Hultborn et al., Reciprocal Ia inhibition contributes to motoneuronal hyperpolarisation during the inactive phase of locomotion and scratching in the cat., J Physiol., 2011 Jan 1;589(Pt 1):119-34).</p><p>It is true that Ib inhibitory interneurons are well characterized, but they are largely inhibited during locomotion. Instead, a disynaptic and polysynaptic excitation is seen. There are five major references:</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conway et al. (1987)</xref>.

(2005)</xref>, Candidate interneurones mediating group I disynaptic EPSPs in extensor motoneurones during fictive locomotion in the cat., J Physiol., Mar 1;563(Pt 2):597-610.</p><p>In the Introduction you state: “The latter study revealed […] when both of these classes of neurons are inactivated.” As it is formulated here, it is virtually impossible not to cite the following: Talpalar et al. (2011), Identification of minimal neuronal networks involved in flexor-extensor alternation in the mammalian spinal cord., Neuron 71, 1071-1084.</p><p>The above is based on the model presented by Miller et al. (1977), The spinal locomotor generator., Exp. Brain Res. 30, 387-403.</p><p>Also, it would be helpful to the reader to mention which interneuronal groups belongs to V1 and V2b groups, as far as it is known. In the Results section and especially in the Discussion, it is almost “forgotten” that the Renshaw cells belong to the V1 group – most of the discussion focuses on Ia INs being. They are belonging both to the V1 and V2b groups – perhaps biased in relation to where they are projecting.</p><p>In the Results section, are the authors thinking of “rhythm generator” or “pattern generator” – the multilayered model? Speaking about <italic>rhythm</italic> makes the reader wonder if that is part of the authors thinking or not – the issue is not really raised anywhere.</p><p>In the Talpar et al. paper it is really demonstrated beyond doubt that Ia inhibitory interneurons and Renshaw cells CAN produce a rhythm under special circumstances – to which extent they do contribute in a normal animal is unknown – but blockade of Renshaw cells does not affect the rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noga et al., 1987</xref>, The role of Renshaw cells in locomotion: antagonism of their excitation from motor axon collaterals with intravenous mecamylamine., Exp Brain Res., 66(1):99-105.)</p><p>Regarding the strong inhibition of motoneurons by Renshaw cells, the reference to Windhorst may be OK, but the following recent publication is a must: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhumbra et al. (2014)</xref>, The recurrent case for the Renshaw cell., J Neurosci., Sep 17;34(38):12919-32.</p><p>Reviewer 3 is concerned that the paper overlooks the literature in non-mammalian preparations where many of the suggested mechanisms have been studied (<italic>Xenopus</italic>, lamprey, zebrafish). There are recent data in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish about the role of V1 interneuron function as well as the functional diversity of specific classes of interneurons (V0 and V2a) and their connectivity in zebrafish.</p><p>2) The paper creates ambiguity about the role of these two classes of INs in motor patterning versus motor rhythm generation. The IN classes seem to affect flexor extensor balance (patterning) but not to disrupt the production of rhythmic motor bursts (rhythm generation) which is controlled by spinal oscillatory timing networks. In this conception CPG embraces both patterning and rhythm generating networks and thus CPG is an ambiguous term when trying to specify the exact role of a particular class of IN. The IN classes appear to affect cycle period somewhat in intact mice but this could be mediated by sensory feedback; the optogenetic experiments on fictive locomotion in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> could partially disambiguate this effect on period but a definitive answer would require monitoring rhythm generating elements centrally. There is no apparent strong effect on period in the figure, so perhaps the V1 and V2b INs do not have access to the rhythm generator.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>, the authors need to explain the apparent discrepancy between the lack of movements around the ankle joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>) and the occurrence of alternation EMG activity between GS and TA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) after V1 and V2b interneuron ablation. The changes in EMG activity are used to explain the effects seen on the movements of the ankle joint, but this activity does not fully account for the executed movements. Is something missing here?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>, the effect of V1 ablation is different between walking and swimming. While the EMG activity is alternating during walking, it becomes synchronous during swimming. This needs some explanations to put it in some functional context.

These are repeated in their entirety and should be addressed; it may be that not all the suggested citations are necessary but many can be incorporated to the benefit of the manuscript and each general point should be considered in the authors' response. […] Reviewer 3 is concerned that the paper overlooks the literature in non-mammalian preparations where many of the suggested mechanisms have been studied (</italic>Xenopus<italic>, lamprey, zebrafish). There are recent data in</italic> Xenopus <italic>and zebrafish about the role of V1 interneuron function as well as the functional diversity of specific classes of interneurons (V0 and V2a) and their connectivity in zebrafish</italic>.</p><p>The Introduction of the manuscript has been substantially rewritten. There is now a much more in depth discussion of inhibitory neuron cell types in the cat and what is known about their activity during locomotion and their potential contribution to flexor-extensor motor behaviors. The papers suggested by Reviewer 2 that describe the role of Ib sensory feedback are cited and discussed, together with an additional study by Shoji et al. that describes Ib inhibition in humans during walking. We have included the additional references on Renshaw cells suggested by reviewer 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noga et al., 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhumbra et al., 2014</xref>), and a further reference to the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Myers et al. (2005)</xref>. We decided not to cite Miller and Scott, 1977 as well as Talpalar et al. 2011. The Miller and Scott model has been widely discounted by a number of studies including that of Talpalar et al., and we feel that any discussion of it would not be informative, and instead might be confusing to those outside of the field. We also describe what is known about the cell types that make up the V1 and V2b IN populations. Overall, we feel that this has resulted in a much more thoughtful and scholarly introduction.</p><p><italic>2) The paper creates ambiguity about the role of these two classes of INs in motor patterning versus motor rhythm generation. The IN classes seem to affect flexor extensor balance (patterning) but not to disrupt the production of rhythmic motor bursts (rhythm generation) which is controlled by spinal oscillatory timing networks. In this conception CPG embraces both patterning and rhythm generating networks and thus CPG is an ambiguous term when trying to specify the exact role of a particular class of IN. The IN classes appear to affect cycle period somewhat in intact mice but this could be mediated by sensory feedback; the optogenetic experiments on fictive locomotion in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>could partially disambiguate this effect on period but a definitive answer would require monitoring rhythm generating elements centrally. There is no apparent strong effect on period in the figure, so perhaps the V1 and V2b INs do not have access to the rhythm generator</italic>.</p><p>In our discussion of the deletions that occur during airstepping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we now make it clear that the deletions that we see are likely to be non-resetting in nature, which is consistent with the V1 and V2b Ins operating at the level of pattern formation rather than rhythm generation. We have a modified the Discussion section to tone down our comments about these deletions, as this was not the major focus of our study.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5"><italic>Figures 4 and 5</italic></xref><italic>: The authors need to explain the apparent discrepancy between the lack of movements around the ankle joint (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A, B</italic></xref><italic>) and the occurrence of alternation EMG activity between GS and TA (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>) after V1 and V2b interneuron ablation. The changes in EMG activity are used to explain the effects seen on the movements of the ankle joint, but this activity does not fully account for the executed movements. Is something missing here</italic>?</p><p>We feel that the EMG activity that we see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> does largely account for the limited movement that occurs around the ankle joint. For example in comparing control and V1 IN-ablated mice, what one sees is a marked prolongation of TA activity. Admittedly there are short rhythmic bursts of GS muscle activity, however, these are severely truncated and in some instances are partially co-active with TA muscle activity. We would like to suggest that these short bursts of ankle extensor activity are insufficient for the full opening of the ankle joint. There is some opening, but this is rather limited. Likewise in the V2b IN-ablated animals we see very long bursts of GS extensor activity and a marked reduction in the duration and amplitude of TA activity, which is again consistent with there being very little movement around the ankle joint.</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6D, E</italic></xref><italic>: The effect of V1 ablation is different between walking and swimming. While the EMG activity is alternating during walking, it becomes synchronous during swimming. This needs some explanations to put it in some functional context. The quantification of the phase relationship between GS and TA in all conditions should be provided</italic>.</p><p>We discuss in more detail the differences in ankle extensor and flexor EMG activity that occur during walking versus swimming in the V1 IN-ablated mice (see the third paragraph of the subsection “Deficits in flexor-extensor motor coordination persist following V1 and V2b IN ablation”). We believe that these differences are likely to be due to reduced Ib sensory feedback, which is known to promote extension and also strongly influence the transition from stance to swing during walking. In the absence of V1 inhibitory IN-mediated sensory feedback, attenuation of this pathway during swimming might remove the Ib sensory signals that suppress flexor activity during extension, as along with timing signals that are provided by Golgi tendon activity and possibly also cutaneous signals from the plantar surface of the foot. This point is raised again in the Discussion.
