To investigate the underlying immunologic mechanism, we analyzed the B and T peripheral follicular helper cell (pTfh) responses. Here, we show that protection in both study arms was associated with early induction of functional IL-21-secreting circumsporozoite (CSP)-specific pTfh cells, together with induction of CSP-specific memory B cell responses after the second dose that persisted after the third dose. Data integration of key immunologic measures identified a subset of non-protected individuals in the standard (STD) vaccine arm who lost prior protective B cell responses after receiving the third vaccine dose. We conclude that the DFD regimen favors persistence of functional B cells after the third dose.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria vaccine immunity</kwd><kwd>tfh and malaria vaccine</kwd><kwd>tfh, b cells and vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>PATH’s Malaria Vaccine Initiative or PATH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pahwa</surname><given-names>Savita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder contributed to conceptualization, data review and manuscript preparation</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Circulating T follicular helper cells appear to be a promising biomarker candidate for monitoring vaccine efficacy in malaria vaccine trials.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria is a communicable vector-borne disease caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, a protozoan parasite that is transmitted to humans via <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. The reported case incidence and associated deaths have declined globally over the years, but malaria is still a major threat to communities in affected areas. In 2017, malaria cases were reported to occur in 87 countries with an estimated 435,000 deaths of children under the age of five (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">WHO, 2018</xref>). Development of a protective vaccine has been challenging and currently there is no licensed malaria vaccine. Among vaccines in development, the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine is the most advanced and is now part of a large-scale pilot implementation program in children in selected African countries. This vaccine includes three main components: a) portions of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, which is the primary surface antigen (Ag) on the sporozoites; b) hepatitis B surface antigen (HB); and c) a proprietary AS01B adjuvant from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The adjuvant is composed of 3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) from <italic>Salmonella minnesota</italic> and a saponin molecule (QS-21) purified from an extract from the plant <italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic>, combined in a liposomal formulation consisting of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol in phosphate-buffered saline solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vekemans et al., 2009</xref>). A vaccine delivery regimen in which three doses of RTS,S/AS01B are given on a 0, 1, 2 month schedule was found to provide nearly 50% protection in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kester et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ockenhouse et al., 2015</xref>). In the field, however, a Phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01 vaccine using the same dosing schedule showed only modest efficacy of 30.1% in 6–12-week-old infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agnandji et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In search of better efficacy, a recent CHMI trial of RTS,S/AS01 vaccine (Malaria-071, NCT01857869) was designed to compare the standard (STD) 0, 1, 2 month dosing regimen with a delayed fractional dose (DFD) regimen in which the third dose was one fifth of the standard dose and was administered at 7 months after the second dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Regules et al., 2016</xref>). The rationale for testing the DFD regimen was based on a prior study from 1997 that had found that delaying and reducing the third immunization dose enhanced the immunogenicity of RTS,S vaccine and achieved efficacy to 86% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stoute et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, Malaria-071 confirmed the earlier findings and the DFD regimen again showed 86% efficacy, which was significantly greater than the 62.5% protection observed in the STD regimen. To understand the factors associated with protection against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, a number of immunologic investigations were conducted in a blinded manner.</p><p>The present study focused on assessing the role of peripheral T follicular helper (pTfh) cells and B cells, because a prior CHMI trial of the RTS,S vaccine had found an association of anti-CSP antibody titers and CSP-specific CD4 T cells with protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">White et al., 2013</xref>). In Malaria-071, antibodies of higher avidity were elicited in the DFD regimen in association with higher somatic hypermutation of B cells, suggesting fundamental changes in the maturation of B cell affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Regules et al., 2016</xref>). High-affinity antibodies are generated from long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells that are produced after antigen-primed B cells undergo cognate interaction with T follicular helper cells (Tfh). This interaction occurs in the germinal centers (GC) of secondary lymphoid organs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crotty, 2011</xref>), causing the B cells to proliferate followed by isotype switching and somatic hypermutation. Many properties of lymphoid Tfh cells, including B cell helper function for antibody (Ab) generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crotty, 2011</xref>), are also present in a subset of circulating CD4 T cells designated as pTfh cells that are considered as having emigrated from the lymphoid pool into the peripheral circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pahwa, 2019</xref>). To investigate their role in human vaccine trials, pTfh in circulation serve as an attractive alternative to lymphoid Tfh, which require lymph node biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentebibel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentebibel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herati et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pallikkuth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pallikkuth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pallikkuth et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boswell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cubas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Locci et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simpson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ueno, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Only a few studies of pTfh have been performed in the context of immunogenicity and the efficacy of malaria vaccines. In a murine model, a nanoparticle-based vaccine presenting recombinant <italic>P. vivax</italic> CSP led to a protective immune response, characterized by enhanced GC formation with expansion and differentiation of antigen-specific Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moon et al., 2012</xref>). A malaria vaccine study in humans involving RTS,S/AS01 alone or co-administered with different viral-vectored vaccines showed that skewing of pTfh cells towards a CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3<sup>+</sup>) Th1 phenotype was associated with reduced Ab quantity and quality and lower vaccine efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowyer et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, in a phase III trial of the GSK malaria vaccine ‘Mosquirix’ in Tanzania and Mozambique, children with increased frequencies of pTfh and plasmablasts at the time of vaccination exhibited higher Ab titers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hill et al., 2020</xref>). An important role was ascribed to antigen-specific pTfh and their cytokine profile in influenza vaccine-induced antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pallikkuth et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, investigation of the dynamics of CSP-specific pTfh and B cell responses in the DFD and STD regimens of Malaria-071 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Regules et al., 2016</xref>), pre- and post-vaccination, revealed key immune features that were linked with protection after sporozoite challenge and provided insight into the superiority of the DFD regimen.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CSP-specific pTfh responses are elevated in protected subjects</title><p>A scheme outlining vaccine timepoints and blood-sample collection for the immunological analyses is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

We identified 676 of 1976 immune measures that were significantly increased from baseline (T0) to different timepoints post-vaccine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). By carrying out a correlation analysis to identify groups of correlated immune measures (‘immune clusters’), we were able to group these 1976 immune features into 142 immune clusters, of which 40 clusters had at least one vaccine-antigen-specific immune feature. Analysis of the vaccine-induced responses over the time course of the study revealed that the pTfh response was an early-stage response, emerging as early as T2, and persisting throughout the study. By contrast, the memory B cell response was a later-stage response, peaking between T4 and T5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). 65% to 80% of the immune responses classified as ‘vaccine-induced’ were specific to the vaccine antigens CSP or HBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and the response was fairly balanced between both antigens.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Individualized predictions using machine learning</title><p>In order to assess the extent of regimen- and protection-level differences, we applied a machine-learning approach using random forest statistical modelling that could make individualized predictions of regimen and protection from immune data alone.

This approach allowed us 1) to determine what combination of immune features is most predictive of regimen or protection, and 2) to group subjects according to their pattern of vaccine-induced immune responses. Furthermore, by taking a prediction approach, we were able to determine how early in the vaccination regimen vaccine-induced immune responses would be predictive of protection. In order to assess predictive performance, we carried out a leave-one-out (LOO) analysis, in which each subject was excluded from the data set before the predictive model was trained on the remaining subjects, and then used to predict the outcome (or regimen) of that excluded subject. Accuracy was calculated as the proportion of subjects whose outcome (or regimen) was correctly predicted by the model.</p><p>In order to predict vaccine regimen from immune data alone, we performed a random forest analysis using 41 parameters from timepoints prior to challenge (T6) that were shown to be significantly different with respect to regimen in the univariate analysis.

Overall, an average of 39 out of 46 subjects in the vaccine regimens were predicted correctly. Further, we determined the relative importance of each parameter in the random forest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and found that antigen-induced B cell characteristics, including proliferation (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) and frequencies of SM, sAM, and Ki67 expressing aMBC, were most predictive of regimen.

The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine is a promising candidate that has undergone extensive testing to define an optimal dosing and vaccine delivery strategy. In Malaria-071, a CHMI trial, participants in the DFD group who received a delayed and reduced third dose achieved 86% efficacy, which was significantly greater than the 62.5% protection attained under the STD regimen in which three vaccine doses are given at monthly intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Regules et al., 2016</xref>). To understand whether there was an immunologic basis to explain this difference, we conducted a study to examine T–B cell interactions in PBMC obtained from timed blood samples in the two regimens. For T cells, our focus was on delineating the dynamics of CSP antigen-specific pTfh cells, which were defined by phenotype and function. For B cells, we examined B cell maturation markers to define subsets and evaluated their function. A data integration approach was used to define correlates of vaccine-induced protection and non-protection. We found that protected subjects in both vaccine regimens were characterized by early induction of CSP antigen-specific pTfh responses, followed by functional memory B cell responses preceding the third dose that persisted at later time points. The non-protected subjects in both the DFD and STD regimens failed to mount the early pTfh response or B cell responses, pointing to the importance of pTfh in vaccine-induced protection. A key finding that provided insight into the inferiority of STD regimen was that in some NP subjects an initial ‘protective’ type of immune response was elicited by doses 1 and 2, but was aborted following the third vaccination dose. Understanding the mechanisms by which delaying and reducing the third antigen dose of RTS,S/AS01 after initial priming/boost helps to preserve the B cell immunity will lead to improved vaccination strategies. Our study was performed in a controlled setting with uninfected adult volunteers. Only field trials can tell us how such strategies will translate in endemic areas of the world where malaria exposure is rampant.</p><p>We noticed a clear increase in total pTfh cells and CSP-specific pTfh cells as early as 6 days post-first dose of RTS,S/AS01 vaccination that occurred only in participants who were protected following experimental challenge with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.

Studies in healthy adults have documented the importance of pTfh expansion at day 7 or day 28 post-influenza and after other vaccines as well as bouts of various infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentebibel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentebibel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herati et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pallikkuth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pallikkuth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pallikkuth et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boswell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cubas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Locci et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simpson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ueno, 2016</xref>). The pTfh expansion was noted in both the DFD and STD regimens and was sustained throughout the vaccination schedule. This observation is reminiscent of the early induction of Ebola virus-specific pTfh following a single dose of the rVSV-Zaire Ebolavirus (ZEBOV) vaccine in an endemic population in Guinea, which was associated with protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farooq et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We identified pTfh phenotypically by CXCR5 expression in memory CD4 T cells. Cellular markers that have been used to define pTfh cells and their subsets have varied, with CXCR5 being a universally accepted receptor on these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pahwa, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentebibel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Locci et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pallikkuth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heit et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moysi et al., 2018</xref>). Tfh cells that are located in the GC of secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pahwa, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herati et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heit et al., 2017</xref>) express high levels of PD-1. The frequency of PD-1<sup>+</sup> cells is very low in circulating pTfh cells and the use of PD-1 as an essential marker that defines pTfh is likely to limit the frequency of identifiable pTfh. Moreover, the relevance of PD-1-expressing pTfh remains unclear because the molecule was found to be inhibitory for pTfh function in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Armas et al., 2017a</xref>). We have found that the expression of PD-1 in combination with that of the activation markers CD38 and HLADR in pTfh is inhibitory for their function in healthy volunteers given influenza vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pallikkuth et al., 2019</xref>). In light of this information, we opted to focus on the antigen-specificity of pTfh cells to mark functional cells. An important aspect of our analysis was the determination of CD40L expression, intracellular IL-21 production and ICOS upregulation in antigen-stimulated pTfh. Using these criteria, we observed higher CSP-specific pTfh in P subjects throughout the study, indicating a critical role of functional pTfh cells for protection against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection. IL-21 is the signature cytokine of Tfh cells and is required for optimal B cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crotty, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Linterman and Vinuesa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vogelzang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bryant et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pallikkuth and Pahwa, 2013</xref>). Likewise, ICOS–ICOSL interactions are known to be important for Tfh–B cell collaboration and also for <italic>IL-21</italic> gene transcription in Tfh cells through <italic>c-Maf</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bossaller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauquet et al., 2009</xref>). These results add to the growing body of evidence pointing to the importance of IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schultz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spensieri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Armas et al., 2017b</xref>) and ICOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentebibel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentebibel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herati et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Havenar-Daughton et al., 2016</xref>) in circulating CD4 T cells or CSP-specific pTfh as biomarkers of vaccine responses. In the data integration analysis, neither the non-pTfh cells nor IFNγ+ CSP-specific CD4 and pTfh responses were identified as variables that were associated with protection or regimen difference, reaffirming the central role of antigen-specific pTfh cells in the CD4 T cell compartment in the response to vaccination. The actual timing, magnitude and duration of the pTfh response that needs to be elicited in order to generate qualitatively superior B cell responses for improved protection in the DFD regimen will require further investigations.</p><p>To understand the nature of the B cell response to the vaccine, we examined changes in specific subsets in the context of protection and regimen. The development of strong, functionally competent CSP-specific memory B cells after the second dose in protected subjects suggests the development of highly Ag-experienced functional memory B cells following the early pTfh response induced by vaccination. Development of a CSP-specific memory B cell compartment is in line with previous studies on antibody affinity, B cell somatic hypermutation, and antibody function, and suggests that affinity maturation is altered to some extent in the DFD regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Regules et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chaudhury et al., 2017</xref>). The stronger vaccine-induced memory B cell responses elicited towards PF-16 (the C-terminus of the CSP protein) over R32LR (the central repeat region) may have played a role in protection, as this region is implicated in the initial entry of the sporozoites into hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramasamy, 1998</xref>). In our study, we found persistence of the vaccine-induced CSP-specific memory B cells up to 159 days post-challenge, the last time point for analysis. In a previous study, Pepper and colleagues reported persistence of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific memory B cell populations that had been induced by protein immunization up to 340 days post-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krishnamurty et al., 2016</xref>). Longer follow-up studies are needed to understand whether the vaccine-induced persistence of pTfh responses favors this B cell response in the DFD regimen. Interestingly, aMBC were also increased in the DFD regimen, compared to the STD regimen, at T5 and T6. These cells, originally described as an exhausted subset of memory B cells in HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moir and Fauci, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moir et al., 2008</xref>), have been found in the circulation of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected individuals from endemic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ly and Hansen, 2019</xref>). A role for aMBC in malaria immunity has been suggested on the basis of the accumulation of this sub-population in situations of parasitemia or shorter exposure history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Changrob et al., 2018</xref>) in children and adults from malaria endemic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Changrob et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Portugal et al., 2015</xref>); importantly, aMBC were maintained in situations of persistent parasite exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayieko et al., 2013</xref>) with a decline over 12 months in the absence of transmission. The functional significance of vaccine-induced aMBC expansion and the role of these cells in the development of immunity to malaria needs further investigation.</p><p>A major objective of the present study was to determine the mechanism behind the improved protection in the DFD vaccination regimen as compared to the STD regimen. As both the STD and DFD groups received the same regimen during the first two doses, differences between the study arms were expected only after the second dose, when the regimens split into either a reduced third dose at 7 months in the DFD group or a full third dose one month after the second dose in the STD group. To explore how the DFD regimen enhances efficacy, we used machine-learning tools and made individualized predictions of protection on the basis of early immune responses (pre-dose 3) alone. Using this analysis, we were able to identify a group of non-protected participants in the STD regimen who showed a promising immune response after doses 1 and 2, but lost this response after the third dose. These data suggest that dose 3 in the STD dose schedule has an adverse effect on an otherwise promising immune response generated by the first two doses. This effect could be caused by the Ag or adjuvant concentration of the full third dose, or by the one-month spacing between dose 2 and dose 3, which may hinder the selection of high-affinity B and T cell clones, either through overstimulation and anergy, or through weak selection pressure resulting from high Ag availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander-Miller et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Our data on ex vivo frequencies of dead cells did not differ significantly between the DFD and STD regimens immediately after (day 6) of the third dose (data not shown), and refute the possibility of a higher rate of cell death in the STD regimen. Our results suggest that NP subjects in the STD regimen are a mix of two classes of subjects, true weak responders and strong responders that aren’t protected. This mixed population may explain why it has been difficult to find correlates of protection in RTS,S studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ockenhouse et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, in the new DFD regimen, NP subjects are almost entirely of one class — weak responders. On the basis of the overall findings, we suggest that the early Tfh response, induced by the initial two vaccine doses, results in the formation of a strong high-affinity memory B cell pool that is specific to CSP antigen; in the DFD, this leads to the expansion and differentiation of the pre-formed memory B cells to Ab-secreting cells. By contrast, in the STD vaccine regimen, early administration of the booster dose was detrimental to the expansion and differentiation of pre-formed memory B cells. Previous reports found an association of CSP-specific IL-2<sup>+</sup>, TNF or IFNg<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells or Th1 responses with vaccine responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kester et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lumsden et al., 2011</xref>). These studies did not examine CSP-specific pTfh within the memory CD4 T cell compartment, and most probably included both pTfh and non-pTfh cells in their analysis. Our data show that within the Ag-specific CD4 T cell compartment, pTfh cells but not non-pTfh show a kinetic and functional response to the malaria vaccine.</p><p>It should be noted that our study had limitations. Only a small number of participants (4/30) became infected in the DFD regimen, precluding comparisons of infected and protected subjects within each study regimen. We also did not examine CSP-specific pTfh for their Th1 versus Th2 phenotype or for response to individual CSP peptides in order to fine-map the pTfh responses. In a recent influenza vaccine study, we found that vaccine non-responders were polarized towards an inflammatory Th1/Th17 phenotype with predominant production of inflammatory cytokine TNF and Tfh antagonistic cytokine IL-2, while in responders, pTfh cells showed a Th2 phenotype with ICOS upregulation and IL-21 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pallikkuth et al., 2019</xref>). Another study has documented a negative impact of CXCR3<sup>+</sup>, a marker of Th1 type pTfh, on antibody quantity and quality in a vaccine trial involving RTS,S/AS01B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowyer et al., 2018</xref>). More detailed characterization of the functional and phenotypic heterogeneity of pTfh in future malaria vaccine studies may be informative. Further analyses are needed to ascertain the relationships of the immune parameters investigated herein with the magnitude and breadth of the Ab responses.</p><p>We conclude that delaying and reducing the third vaccine dose is advantageous for developing a protective immune response. This is highlighted particularly in those individuals that elicited promising responses after the first two doses, which then seemed to be disrupted when the third dose of RTS,S/AS01 was administered at the standard concentration one month after the second dose. We recognize that the CHMI studies of RTS,S-vaccinated malaria-naive adults represent a controlled setting for the study of immune response in relation to vaccine-induced protection. Whether the DFD regimen can be translated into the field with beneficial effects remains to be seen. The long interval between the second and third doses may be challenging in the face of overwhelming exposure to mosquitoes that can inoculate sporozoites into the host in this period, thereby affecting the development of immunity. However, the amount of CSP delivered via natural infection is much lower than the amount of CSP in RTS,S/AS01 and, thus, it is unlikely that natural infection would disrupt the development of an otherwise protective immune response. Recently, it was shown that children who responded well to RTS,S/AS01 vaccination had increased baseline frequencies of antibody-secreting and Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hill et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, emerging data also suggests that malaria infection may induce memory Tfh cells that have impaired B cell helper function, and may inhibit differentiation to fully functional Tfh cells, thus resulting in germinal center dysfunction and suboptimal antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>). Last, our data indicate the generation of strong CSP-specific pTfh responses that persist even after 159 days post-challenge, suggesting that CSP-specific pTfh could serve as potential biomarkers for vaccine efficacy. Monitoring CSP-specific pTfh should be considered in future malaria vaccine trials in clinical settings or field studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Regules et al., 2016</xref>). A schema for vaccine timepoints and blood sample collection for immunology analyses in both vaccine regimens and in the control regimen of the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Blood draws for this were performed at eight different timepoints designated T0–T7: (i) pre-vaccination (T0), day 6 post dose 1 (T1), day 28 post dose 1 (T2), day 6 post dose 2 (T3), day 28 post dose 2 (T4), day 6 post dose 3 (T5), day 21 post dose 3 and pre-challenge (T6) and at study end (T7), 159 days post-challenge. Blood was processed for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and cryopreserved PBMC samples were shipped to the University of Miami (UM) in liquid nitrogen. All lab testing, analysis, data entry and plotting of graphs were performed in batches in a blinded manner with information related to vaccine regimen and protection status revealed to the UM lab only after all of the samples had been processed. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of UM. De-identified PBMC samples were processed at UM laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Vaccine antigens, control antigen and monoclonal Abs</title><p>The HBs peptide pool, CSP peptide pool, CS repeat region protein (R32LR) and HBs protein were provided by GSK. The CSP protein (PF-CSP) and the C-terminal peptide (PF-16) were provided by PATH’s Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI). Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (List Biological Laboratories) and CPG ODN 2006 (InvivoGen) were used as positive control antigens for T and B cells, respectively. A list of monoclonal Abs used for the flow cytometry studies, including the information about clone and fluorochrome, is included in the Key resources table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>pTfh frequency and antigen-specific intracellular cytokine secretion (ICS) in short-term cultures</title><p>pTfh frequency and function were analyzed at pre-vaccination (T0) and at all timepoints post-vaccination in each regimen. Briefly, PBMC (1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>/ml/condition) were stimulated with CSP peptide pool (2 µg/ml) and HBs peptide pool (2 µg/ml) along with co-stimulation molecule antiCD28 (1 µg/ml) for 12 hr at 37°C. Brefeldin A (10 µg/ml) was added 7 hr after stimulation to prevent protein transport. SEB (1 µg/ml) was used as a positive control, and medium with co-sitm molecule antiCD28 alone was used as a negative control. After stimulation, cells were stained using a 14-color fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal Ab panel including surface markers that are specific for pTfh identification along with live/dead amine dye (aqua). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized and stained intracellularly for interleukin (IL-21), CD40L, and Ki67, acquired on a BD LSRFortessa, and analyzed by FlowJo (v 9.4.3, Tree Star Inc).</p><p>All flow cytometry analyses were performed using optimally titrated Ab concentrations and after applying appropriate fluorescent compensation using DIVA software on BD LSRFortessa at the time of acquisition and fine tuning of compensation using FlowJo at the time of analysis. Gating controls included unstained cells and Fluorescence Minus One (FMO), and for all stimulation experiments, unstimulated cells were used as additional biological controls. For basic pTfh identification, CD4 T central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>[CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>]) were gated on CXCR5 to determine the frequencies of CXCR5<sup>+</sup> subsets in CD4 T<sub>CM</sub> cells, designated as pTfh cells. For Ag-specific pTfh cells, CD40L<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells were gated on the basis of the expression of CD45RO and CXCR5 (as CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>) as CSP-specific pTfh cells and CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>–</sup> as CSP-specific non-pTfh cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). CSP-specific pTfh cells and non-pTfh cells were further analyzed for the intracellular expression of signature cytokine IL-21, inducible co-stimulator ICOS and proliferation marker Ki67.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Ex vivo B cell maturation subsets</title><p>Thawed PBMC were analyzed for B cell phenotypes without in vitro stimulation by flow cytometry. Total mature B cell were identified as CD3<sup>–</sup>CD10<sup>–</sup>CD20<sup>+</sup> cells after excluding immature CD10<sup>+</sup> B cells, and total memory B cells were identified as CD20<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> cells. On the basis of the expression of CD21, CD27 and IgD, B cell maturation subsets were identified as naïve <sup>(CD21hiIgD+CD27–),</sup> resting memory (RM: CD21<sup>hi</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>), activated memory (AM: CD21<sup>low</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>) and atypical memory B cells (aMBC: CD21<sup>low</sup>CD27<sup>–</sup>). Within the total memory, RM and AM B cells IgD<sup>+</sup>IgG<sup>–</sup> were identified as unswitch and IgD<sup>–</sup>IgG<sup>+</sup> as switch memory B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Spontaneous Ab-secreting cells (ASC)</title><p>A spontaneous ASC enzyme linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay was performed at T0, T1, T3, and T5 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">George et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rinaldi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pallikkuth et al., 2011b</xref>) against wells coated with PF-CSP, R32LR and PF-16 malaria antigens, as well as HBs-antigen, using unstimulated PBMC.

PBMC 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>/ mL per condition were stimulated for 5 days with 2 µg/ml each of malaria (PF-CSP, PF-16, R32LR) and HBs antigens. CpG oligodeoxynucleotides 2006 (CpG ODN2006: 1 µg/ml) was used as a positive control and medium as a negative control. On day 5, cells were harvested and assayed for Ag-specific induction of IgG-secreting cells by ELISpot assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pallikkuth et al., 2011b</xref>). The remaining cells were stained with fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal Abs that were specific for B cell maturation subsets (naïve, total memory, RM, AM, and aMBC). Switch and unswitch memory B cells within total memory, RM and AM subsets were identified on the basis of IgG and IgD expression along with proliferation marker Ki67 and analyzed by flow cytometry as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. Culture supernatants were stored at −80°C and assayed for IgG by ELISA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis and data integration</title><p>To analyze this complex immunology dataset, which includes a large number of immune measurements for each subject, we performed an integration approach in which we combined traditional univariate analysis with multivariate machine-learning methods to isolate immune responses that were vaccine induced, to characterize regimen-specific differences, and to identify correlates of protection. A general workflow of the data integration approach is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>. Analyses were performed to compare changes in pTfh and B cell related markers for each group between different timepoints pre- and post-vaccination, or between P vs NP, or between regimens DFD and STD, at each timepoint or at selected timepoints. Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM), fitted via Penalized Quasi-Likelihood (PQL) using R ‘MASS’ package was used to accommodate repeated measures of time, with random intercept set by patient ID (PID). P value was adjusted for multiple comparisons by Benjamini and Hochberg correction using R ‘multcomp’ package. A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered to be significant. Immune measures were classified as vaccine-induced responses if they showed a significant difference from the pre-immune (<italic>vs.</italic> T0) timepoint. Immune measures were classified as regimen-specific and protection-specific differences if they showed a significant difference with respect to vaccine regimen (STD vs. DFD) or protection status (P vs. NP), respectively.</p><p>To assess the predictive value of the regimen- and protection-specific differences identified in this study, we used the random forest model, a machine-learning method, to make individualized predictions of regimen or protection status on the basis of the immune data alone. The random forest model was generated using all vaccine-induced immune responses (R <italic>caret</italic> package). We trained the model using the repeated cv method, subsampling the dataset by five-fold and resampling ten times. The random forest model was tuned using the caret R package. Specifically, the number of branches of the tree (<italic>mtry</italic>) and the rule for splitting (<italic>gini</italic> or <italic>extratrees</italic>) were adjusted to identify the optimal accuracy and kappa values during internal ten-fold cross validation, repeated ten times. The <italic>oneSE</italic> method was used to select the optimal model. To test the predictive accuracy of the random forest modeling approach, we carried out a leave-one-out analysis, in which one subject was removed from the dataset, after which the model was trained on the remaining subjects and then used to predict the adjuvant condition of the excluded subject on the basis of its immune data. We performed this for all subjects in the dataset, and calculated both the accuracy and kappa value of the prediction model. We used the <italic>varImp</italic> function to determine the variable importance for each generated model, and reported the average variable importance across all models to assess the relative importance of each vaccine-induced immune measure to predicting regimen or protection status.</p><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out in R using the <italic>ir.pca</italic> package and visualized using <italic>ggbiplot</italic>. For the PCA, we used a subset of the immune measures, using only parameters that were found to be predictive of regimen or protection status, as determined by variable importance analysis in the random forest model. Finally, correlation analysis was carried out in R using the <italic>cor</italic> function to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient. All immune measures were compared with all other immune measures, and the correlation matrix was used for hierarchical clustering, using the <italic>hclust</italic> function in R, to identify groups of correlated immune parameters, termed ‘immune clusters’. All immune parameters within an immune cluster have a Pearson correlation coefficient of at least 0.80 to every other parameter in that cluster.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Maria Pallin, Celeste Sanchez and Varghese George from the Pahwa lab for their assistance with laboratory experiments, Dr Ann-Marie Cruz for project management support and scientific input, GSK for PBMC samples, and the study participants.

(CSP) vaccine. Administered according to the standard 1-2-3 month regimen, RTS,S induces but a modicum of protracted protective immunity. By contrast, vaccination according to a delayed and fractional 3<sup>rd</sup> dose results in a superior protective outcome in controlled human malaria infection challenge studies. Understanding vaccine-induced immune protective mechanisms is crucial for developing of an improved vaccine against malaria. In this study, the authors conducted comparative analyses of RTS,S elicited immune responses in subjects vaccinated according to the standard versus delayed and fractional doses. Analyses of peripheral blood cellular and antibody responses combined with machine relearning approaches revealed that early induction of CSP-specific pTfh CD4 T cells and the persistence of CSP-specific B cell responses are associated with the superior protective outcome in the group that received delayed and fractional dose of RTS,S/AS01.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Cellular biomarkers of antibody response to RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in a controlled human vaccine challenge model&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation is being overseen Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers considered that the authors indeed posed and important question regarding the mechanism of RTS,S-mediated protection in a very systematic fashion. On the basis of the reviews provided below, the main concerns are as follows: issues with flow cytometry results for both T and B cells; the accompanying statistical analysis; inclusion of fine/distinct CSP protein peptide or region specificities of IgG and pTfh cells; correlative interaction between pTfh and B cells from individuals, which would address the relationship and/or the qualitative difference between these cell types in protected DFD vs. STD; the machine learning portion needs to be properly presented/explained in the result section; revisions in the labeling of certain figures for clarity; and, finally, please address the issue concerning the writing style, particularly in the Results section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>RTS, S is the most advanced vaccine against pre-erythrocytic (sporozoite) stage of malaria. Studies conducted in malaria endemic areas show only a modicum of protective efficacy and short durability. On the basis of the results from an earlier study by Stoute et al., the repeat of the approach of delivering RTS,S as DFD vs. STD immunizing dose has shown much promise in the recently conducted CHMI studies. The current study describes response of peripheral CD4 T cells, pTfh cells, and B cells as correlates of protection. The results add much value as they expand our understanding of the immune responses that form the basis of protection against malaria. Although immunological parameters may be quite different in endemic areas, particularly among older children who have had malaria infection prior to RTS,S vaccination, nonetheless, this study provides new information regarding pTfh cells in protective immunity against CHMI.</p><p>As with any studies detailing immune responses in human PBMC samples, this study was admittedly quite challenging; the authors succeeded in performed carefully timed analyses and amassed lots of important results. Applying machine learning analyses, they have deduced predictive value concerning early pTfh cells and memory B cells responses as predictors of protection. The manuscript is well organized and, on the whole, the experiments are well performed; however, there are several critical issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>The narrative in the Results section provides data without any benefit of a proper introduction as to what specific question was being asked and why a particular analysis was undertaken. For example, why was ICOS evaluated? Why were B cell responses evaluated? Similarly, what is the significance of measuring cellular expression of Ki67? The exception was an explanation for determining IL-21 for pThf cells.</p><p>The entire Results section concerning B cells is very difficult to follow. The main reason of this is that none of the discussed B cell subsets, e.g. MB, are defined phenotypically. I do acknowledge that the phenotypic markers are indicated in the Materials and methods section; however, it is rather clumsy to go back and forth between the pages looking for the specific phenotypes in one section of the paper and then going back to the Results section for a response of a given B cell population. Even for a reader with some background in immunology, it would be difficult to understand the significance of &quot;…vaccine induced alteration in B cell phenotypes and function…&quot;, as neither specific phenotypic markers nor functions are indicated. What exactly are recall antigens, R32LR and PF-16?</p><p>Speaking of cellular phenotypes, I have not found any gating strategy for B cells. Therefore, it is impossible to evaluate responses shown in Figures 3 and 4. The authors discuss Ig switching, yet apart from ELISPOS for IgG-producing B cells, no other isotypes are shown. It is not clear what criteria the authors have used for the discussion of B cell maturation. Starting with data in Figure 3, how were the B cell gated for the different subsets? The B cell subsets need to be clearly indicated or identified by a set of specific phenotypic markers and Ig isotypes, otherwise, the abbreviations such as sAM, SM, are meaningless for the reader.</p><p>The authors mention that Ab ELISA experiments were performed, but the authors do not show any results. Also, the markers for atypical B cells depart from what is currently described in the literature. And what was the rationale for even considering atypical memory B cells?</p><p>Another critical issue is the authors' generalization of CSP specificities of CD4 T cells. The authors did use PF CSP peptide pools for activation of CD4 or pTfh cells. The content of these pools is not shown, and it needs to be indicated. Importantly, some peptide pools representing certain regions of PF CSP might have shown more recall activity than other peptide pools. In a previously published study, Schwenk and colleagues (2011, Vaccine 29), interrogated RTS,S induced CD4 T cells responses with PF CSP peptides and they showed that subjects respond to a discrete set of PF CSP peptides. Importantly, once PF CSP peptide-specific early responses are induced, the specificity repertoire does not shift following boost immunization or CHMI. I will add, that the authors looked at inflammatory CD4 T cells. In view of these published results concerning PF CSP peptide specific inflammatory CD4 T cells responses, such information would be quite important if only to understand what specificities induced the early pTfh cells in the current study; is there specificity overlap between CD4 T cells with different functional attributes? Because according to the current observation early CD4 T cell responses do matter; it is imperative to show the results from the individual pool activated T cells. In this regard, it also would have been instructive to determine HLA of P vs. NP or early responders.</p><p>It is not entirely clear as to why the authors are surprised that the observed correlates of protection were directed to Ag-specific CD4 and pTfh cells that arose post does 1. To gain some understanding of the T-B cell collaboration for Ab production, it would have been instructive to investigate if the B cell responses in protected persons were T cell dependent. There are markers for such B cell responses, e.g., CD73, CD80 etc. These analyses might need to be conducted to sort our T cell dependent vs. T cell independent B cell responses in the P vs. NP subjects. Pepper et al. did show that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> induced B cells survive only for a short time as short-lived memory B cells. This may provide some explanation to the authors' query.</p><p>The labeling of the figures should be improved, particularly with regard to the time of PBMC sampling versus vaccinations. The authors need to indicate by arrows on the X axis the timing of vaccination vis-a-vis samplings. This will frame the scheduling indicated by T0, T1, etc. Otherwise, one needs to constantly consult the text for clarification.</p><p>The writing in general is a bit confusing. For example, (1) In the Discussion – &quot;A major objective of.……was to determine if one regimen, DFD or STD, was superior…&quot; The results of the superiority of DFD over STD in protection was published previously. Please reword the sentence; (2) &quot;…that differences in immunity in the DFD regimen arose…&quot; (3) &quot;…B cell maturation subsets…&quot;; (4) previously conducted studies are not referenced.</p><p>In the Abstract the authors state that B cells are rescued by the DFD immunization regimen. It is true that B cells producing IgG responses declined (Figure 3). Are B cell numbers also lost? I do not recall any studies where the authors show apoptosis, or some other form of B cell death induced by the STD immunization regimen.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study Pallikkuth et al. examine peripheral T follicular helper (pTfh) cells and memory B cells as potential immunologic mechanisms responsible for the increased protection observed in subjects receiving RTS,S/AS01 in a delayed fractional dose (DFD) compared to the standard dose regimen (STD).</p><p>The authors found that subjects protected from malaria demonstrate an expansion of total- and CSP specific pTfh cells following vaccination and that the variation observed in protection between the STD and DFD arms arises mainly from variations in antigen-specific B cells. In addition, the authors apply a machine learning analysis to identify immune correlates associated with protection from malaria, which indicates an important role for early induction of pTfh responses and suggests that class-switched memory B cells can be engendered &quot;saved&quot; by a delayed fractional dose regimen. This study addresses an important question regarding the mechanism of RTS,S-mediated protection in a very systematic fashion, leveraging a unique trial dataset. The reported association with Tfh responses and protection from RTS,S is a significant advance, and the purported differences observed between the dosing regimens of high potential significance. However, my major concerns revolve around the quality of the flow cytometry data, which is difficult to assess given limited info on gating and absence of B cell flow plots. In addition, some aspects of the statistical analyses are not clear. An inherent weakness of the machine learning analyses rests in the fact that it does not use separate training, validation, and test sets. The dataset from which the model is derived appears to be the same dataset from which the authors go back and make predictions, which limits external inference. While the Introduction and Discussion are well written but several aspects of the Results and figures are not clear.</p><p>1) It is unclear from Figure 2 how flow gates were set; ideally this could be based on FMO controls, which should be shown in the gating panel, but I could not find any mention of how gates were determined in the Materials and methods. The cutoff for ICOS, IL21, and Ki67 looks rather arbitrary, and the Ki67 stain did not appear to provide good separation based on the (very small) example plot.</p><p>2) No flow cytometry plots for B cell subsets are provided. These are critical data and should be shown (with Figure 4 or as Supplemental). This is of particular concern given that the staining for Ki67 on T cells (Figure 2C) was not very convincing, and Ki67<sup>+</sup> B cells comprise the majority of the most predictive parameters in Table 1.</p><p>3) What do the error bars indicate in Figure 1-4 (SD, SEM, other)? In some cases the error bars are quite short relative to the difference between P and NP values, yet the difference is not significant; while in the puzzling case of Figure 2F (T2) the difference IS statistically significant yet the values are almost the same and the bars widely overlap.</p><p>4) The definition of Tfh is somewhat non-conventional and only partially justified (i.e. in Discussion re: PD-1).</p><p>5) The reader has to work rather hard to grasp what comparisons were statistically significant. The differences from T0 to other timepoints stand out (but are not the most interesting result). This overshadows the p-values comparing P and NP. Only the latter are mentioned in the Figure Legend. (applies to Figures 1-3).</p><p>6) The machine learning portions of the paper (rationale, findings) are nicely explained in the Discussion, but are presented in a very confusing manner in the Results. I did not understand the point of this analysis until the Discussion.</p><p>7) Figure 5 was not helpful to this reviewer and could be considered for omission; conversely Figure S1 showing the trial schematic with definition of timepoints T0-T7 was very helpful and should be considered for inclusion in the main text.</p><p>8) Was any analysis of how Tfh correlate with B cells in individuals performed? This would be of interest but appears to be missing.</p><p>9) The paper would benefit from a discussion of the implications of these findings on RTS,S vaccination in real-world endemic settings, where many children would inevitably be exposed (often repeatedly) to malaria antigens during the &quot;suboptimal&quot; 2-6 month window following priming (see Obeng-Adjei et al., 2015).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Cellular biomarkers of antibody response to RTS, S/AS01 malaria vaccine in a controlled human vaccine challenge model&quot; by Pallikkuth et al., immune response to RTS, S/AS01 malaria vaccine and found that delayed fractional dose (DFD) regimen is superior in inducing higher class-switched Ag specific memory B cells post the third immunization compared to the (STD) standard dose regimen.</p><p>Comments as follows:</p><p>1) What is the qualitative difference between the protected versus non-protected subjects in terms of the cTfh levels or its functions?</p><p>2) The authors indicate that expansion of IL-12 and ICOS<sup>+</sup> Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells is indicative of vaccine-induced enhancement; however, this happens in both the arms. It did not look like this is happening only in the DFD arm. Results are written as if they are significantly different.</p><p>3) Do the authors have any hypothesis for the enhancement of B and Tfh cell response in DFD group compared to the STD regimen?</p><p>4) Did they do an antigen-specific IgG subclass response to see whether DFM has wide range of antibody responses compare to STD regimen?</p><p>5) It is also surprising to see that non-Tfh component are not looked at properly such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 levels. What is the association of these cells with antigen specific B cell response between P versus NP individuals?</p><p>6) In the Figure 7 it is not very clear that what predicts the protection and what is not predicting the protection.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cellular biomarkers of antibody response to RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in a controlled human vaccine challenge model&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Dominique Soldati-Favre (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The majority of the requested revisions are editorial in nature, with few exceptions.</p><p>1) In their response to a comment on non-pTfh cells, the authors rely on negative data (not shown) derived from the integration analysis. Despite the outcome of this analysis, it might be useful and most informative to assess the non-pTfh cells alongside the pTfh cells. In the event that the PBMCs are no longer available, the authors need to address these potentially crucial components as possible mechanisms for the superior outcome in DFD regimen of immunization. As an example, previously published works have shown an association between IL-2<sup>+</sup> and IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells and antibody responses in RTS,S vaccinated subjects. In the absence of results, including these points would improve the tenor of the Discussion.</p><p>2) Please revisit the legends and confirm whether they indicate that the error bars signify SEM.</p><p>3) Figure 3. Unlike IL-21 and ICOS, the expression of Ki67 was rather transitory and this point needs to be acknowledged.</p><p>4) A title should be more reflective of the key findings.</p><p>5) In the Abstract, there should be a clearer pivot from data that is previously published (trial results) to data presented therein.</p><p>6) Subheading “CSP-specific B cell responses emerge in protected subjects after the second dose and higher regimen specific memory B cell response in DFD arm” makes no sense grammatically.</p><p>7) In the Discussion, the authors state that &quot;This is the first study demonstrating a protective role of CSP-specific pTfh in RTS,S/AS01 vaccination&quot;. Please tone down this statement as the results do not show a protective role of pTfh cells, they simply show an association.</p><p>8) Discussion section, final two sentence in the penultimate paragraph should could be removed, as they are unnecessary.</p><p>9) Results section requires extensive editing in that a rationale for choosing to ask a certain question or perform a particular experiment needs to be clearly stated. It is insufficient to state, &quot;We next investigated…&quot;.</p><p>10) Discussion paragraph six is very repetitive to early wording in the Results.</p><p>11) The Discussion section on the whole still appears largely as a rehash of the Results section. It fails to provide a cogent picture or a hypothesis that would suggest possible interactions that may be occurring between the pThf cells (and possibly non-pTfh CD4 T cells) and the various B cells subsets and which bring about this enhanced protection seen in subjects receiving DFD regiment.</p><p>12) Along these lines, the authors need to relate their finding to a larger picture of RTS,S vaccination in African countries. Specifically, the paper would benefit from a discussion of the implications of these findings on RTS,S vaccination in real-world endemic settings, where many children would inevitably be exposed (often repeatedly) to malaria antigens during the &quot;suboptimal&quot; 2-6 month window following priming. The authors are not requested to provide field data, which they obviously cannot; however, if a DFD regimen were deployed in Africa, many children would get a natural malaria infection that might have the same negative impact as the STD dose #3 and this is worth discussing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51889.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>The narrative in the Results section provides data without any benefit of a proper introduction as to what specific question was being asked and why a particular analysis was undertaken.

A similar phenotype of atypical memory B cells (aMBC) was reported previously by different investigators. A higher frequency of aMBC have been reported in children and adults with chronic asymptomatic <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection, suggesting an expansion of these B cells in malaria endemic areas (Weiss et al., 2009; Portugal et al., 2015). A decline in the atypical MBC pool was observed during a 12-month period without malaria transmission, further substantiating a role of persistent parasite exposure in the maintenance of this population (Ayieko et al., 2013). In the present study, our goal was to investigate antigen-specific atypical memory B cells following RTS.AS01 vaccination and their association with vaccine-induced protection, Moreover, we wanted to assess effect of DFD vs. STD regimen on the frequencies of vaccine-specific aMBC. We found higher frequencies of PF-CSP-specific proliferating (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) aMBC at T5 and T6 in the DFD regimen compared to STD regimen.

We achieved the goals of the present study which were to identify RTS,S/AS01vaccine-induced pTfh and B cells and their relation to malaria infection outcome in a controlled human malaria infection model. Moreover, we don’t have cryopreserved cells available for additional experiments, as blood sample collection was limited to specific objectives of the study. In the context of the comment being raised here, the review by Moris et al. (Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2018;14:17-27) discusses CSP epitope-specific CD4 T cell responses in malaria vaccine trials in prior studies performed by GSK and others. The serum IgG response from the current trial was published previously by our collaborators (Chaudhury et al., 2017).</p><p>Importantly, we included CSP antigen-induced intracellular IFNγ responses by total CD4 and pTfh cells, as well as CSP-specific pTfh cells in the data integration analyses and our results show that none of the IFNγ<sup>+</sup> T cell variables were associated significantly with protection or regimen level differences. HLA information of protected and non-protected subjects or early responders were not available at the time these analyses were conducted. We mentioned this in the Discussion section as a study limitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not entirely clear as to why the authors are surprised that the observed correlates of protection were directed to Ag-specific CD4 and pTfh cells that arose post does 1. To gain some understanding of the T-B cell collaboration for Ab production, it would have been instructive to investigate if the B cell responses in protected persons were T cell dependent. There are markers for such B cell responses, e.g., CD73, CD80 etc. These analyses might need to be conducted to sort our T cell dependent vs. T cell independent B cell responses in the P vs. NP subjects. Pepper et al. did show that Plasmodium induced B cells survive only for a short time as short-lived memory B cells. This may provide some explanation to the authors' query.</p></disp-quote><p>We included data on ex-vivo expression of CD80, a marker of T dependent B cell responses, on total B cells, resting memory and activated memory B cells as a supplementary figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 2) in the revised manuscript. CD80 expression did not differ significantly between P and NP subjects at any time point, although a trend of higher expression in activated memory B cells at T6 and T7 in the protected subjects was noted.</p><p>We also analyzed the data for differences in the frequencies of dead cells between DFD vs. STD regimens at T5 (6 days post dose 3) based on Live/Dead aqua staining (Aqua<sup>+</sup>/Aqua<sup>-</sup>) on T cells and B cells as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Mean frequencies of dead cells within the T cell compartment were 5.78 ± 3.6 for DFD and 6.3 ± 3.9 for STD regimen. For the B cells, the mean frequencies of dead cells were 8.6 ± 5.0 for the DFD and 9.2 ± 4.9 STD arms. The differences in the frequencies dead cells for either T or B cells were not significant between the two regimens. We mentioned this information in the Discussion section.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Frequencies of dead cells in T cell and B cell compartments at T5 (6 days post dose 3).</title><p>Dead cells were gated from total CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD20<sup>+</sup> cells based live dead aqua staining as CD3+aqua+and CD 20+aqua+ cells.

The authors need to indicate by arrows on the X axis the timing of vaccination vis-a-vis samplings. This will frame the scheduling indicated by T0, T1, etc. Otherwise, one needs to constantly consult the text for clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the figures and included information on the timing of vaccination, PBMC sampling and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> challenge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The writing in general is a bit confusing. For example, (1) In the Discussion – &quot;A major objective of.……was to determine if one regimen, DFD or STD, was superior…&quot; The results of the superiority of DFD over STD in protection was published previously. Please reword the sentence; (2) &quot;…that differences in immunity in the DFD regimen arose…&quot; (3) &quot;…B cell maturation subsets…&quot;; (4) previously conducted studies are not referenced.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the manuscript to address the concerns about the writing style.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Abstract the authors state that B cells are rescued by the DFD immunization regimen. It is true that B cells producing IgG responses declined (Figure 3). Are B cell numbers also lost? I do not recall any studies where the authors show apoptosis or some other form of B cell death induced by the STD immunization regimen.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not include apoptosis markers in the B cell flow cytometry staining panel. Frequencies of dead B cells were estimated from the flow cytometry gating using live/Dead Aqua staining as shown in Figure 1 in the response to comment 6. As discussed above, we did not find significant differences in the frequencies of dead B cells comparing the DFD vs. STD regimens. We are not sure about whether the total B cell numbers decreased, as we don’t have the information for absolute B cell numbers for the DFD and. STD regimens. However, the frequencies of B cells did not change between DFD vs. STD regimens. Our data suggests that the DFD regimen may result in a qualitative improvement within the B cell compartment as compared to the STD regimens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) It is unclear from Figure 2 how flow gates were set; ideally this could be based on FMO controls, which should be shown in the gating panel, but I could not find any mention of how gates were determined in the Materials and methods. The cutoff for ICOS, IL21, and Ki67 looks rather arbitrary, and the Ki67 stain did not appear to provide good separation based on the (very small) example plot.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the gating strategy figures for IL-21, ICOS and Ki67 (now Figure 3 in the revised manuscript). We included the dot plots for fluorescence minus one (FMO) staining controls to clarify the gating issues. The gating strategy write-up was revised in the Materials and methods to include the gating control information. In addition, we included a new supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) showing the gating strategy that was used to identify total pTfh, CSP-specific CD4, and CSP-specific pTfh cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) No flow cytometry plots for B cell subsets are provided. These are critical data and should be shown (with Figure 4 or as Supplemental). This is of particular concern given that the staining for Ki67 on T cells (Figure 2C) was not very convincing, and Ki67<sup>+</sup> B cells comprise the majority of the most predictive parameters in Table 1.</p></disp-quote><p>A detailed gating strategy for the identification of B cell subsets and Ki67 expression on various B cell subsets is included as Figure 5—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript. The definition of B cell subsets based on the markers used, is further clarified in the Materials and methods and Results sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What do the error bars indicate in Figure 1-4 (SD, SEM, other)? In some cases the error bars are quite short relative to the difference between P and NP values, yet the difference is not significant; while in the puzzling case of Figure 2F (T2) the difference IS statistically significant yet the values are almost the same and the bars widely overlap.</p></disp-quote><p>All error bars in the line graphs indicate the standard error of mean (SEM). The data for Figure 2F at T2 was rechecked and corrected as we found an error in the data for the protected subjects. The difference between P and NP subjects at T2 is significant with a p value of &lt;0.01.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The definition of Tfh is somewhat non-conventional and only partially justified (i.e. in Discussion re: PD-1).</p></disp-quote><p>We identified the phenotype of CSP-specific pTfh as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD40L+ cells expressing CD45RO and CXCR5 and also investigated their cytokine profile for IL-21 and IFNγ. We did not include markers associated with pTfh heterogeneity such as PD1, CD38, CXCR3 etc. in the 15-color flow cytometry panel that was used to study the Ag.pTfh. Since we were focusing on a less frequent pTfh population within the CSP-specific CD4 T cells compartment, we rationalized that we needed to maintain a broad(er) definition of pTfh cells as we studied their antigen-specific function with the goal of finding novel determinants of malaria vaccine-induced immune responses. In previous studies, we saw that some of the phenotypic markers used for pTfh identity such as PD1 and CD38 are also influenced by age or other infectious diseases (De Armas et al., 2017). Moreover, in an influenza vaccine study, we found that activated pTfh cells (HLA-DR+CD38+) expressing PD1 appear to be detrimental to the antigen-specific pTfh responses (Pallikkuth et al., 2019). This has been discussed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The reader has to work rather hard to grasp what comparisons were statistically significant. The differences from T0 to other timepoints stand out (but are not the most interesting result). This overshadows the p-values comparing P and NP. Only the latter are mentioned in the Figure Legend. (applies to Figures 1-3).</p></disp-quote><p>We revised all the figures and included information on the timing of vaccination, blood sampling and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> challenge. In order to address the differences between P and NP subjects at each timepoint, we revised the figures by including connecting lines between timepoints in which differences between P vs. NP are significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The machine learning portions of the paper (rationale, findings) are nicely explained in the Discussion, but are presented in a very confusing manner in the Results. I did not understand the point of this analysis until the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The machine learning section of the Results section has been re-organized and significant parts of it have been re-written. One paragraph from the machine learning section in the original draft was moved into a new section of the Results (“Identifying vaccine-induced immune responses in RTS,S”) to make the section more clear. We have revised Results section and Materials and methods section to highlight the changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 5 was not helpful to this reviewer and could be considered for omission; conversely Figure S1 showing the trial schematic with definition of timepoints T0-T7 was very helpful and should be considered for inclusion in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have moved the supplementary figure 1 in the original submission showing study schematics as a main figure (Figure 1) and Figure 5 has been included as Figure 6—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Was any analysis of how Tfh correlate with B cells in individuals performed? This would be of interest but appears to be missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We carried out a correlation analysis between all pTfh and all memory B cell parameters at each timepoint and did not find any direct correlations between pTfh parameters and B cell measures. This observation combined with the early pTfh responses in protected subjects, suggest that initial Tfh cell priming may be required for the subsequent development of a qualitatively superior Tfh-induced B cell response induced by RTS,S/AS01B vaccine. The actual timing and magnitude of pTfh response that need to be elicited in order to influence the quality of the later B cell responses and improved protection in the DFD regimen need further investigations. We have discussed the results and implications in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The paper would benefit from a discussion of the implications of these findings on RTS,S vaccination in real-world endemic settings, where many children would inevitably be exposed (often repeatedly) to malaria antigens during the &quot;suboptimal&quot; 2-6 month window following priming (see Obeng-Adjei et al., 2015).</p></disp-quote><p>While we did not conduct detailed assessments of Tfh and B cell responses following RTS,S vaccination in the field, we are currently in the process of developing a study that will address the role of select T and B cell subpopulations, such as atypical memory B cells, Tfh and gd T cells, in the context of RTSS immunization and immune hypo-responsiveness in Kenyan adults. We have included this information in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) What is the qualitative difference between the protected versus non-protected subjects in terms of the cTfh levels or its functions?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we show the ex-vivo frequencies of total pTfh (CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>) cells in Figure 2A; ICOS expression on ex-vivo total pTfh is mentioned in the Results section. Our data show that frequencies of total pTfh were significantly different between P and NP subjects at T3, T4, T6 and T7 and the ICOS expression on total pTfh was significantly higher in P subjects at T6 and T7 compared to NP subjects. We also analyzed the IL-21 expression in total pTfh after 12 hrs of CSP stimulation, and similar to the observed increase in IL-21 production in the Ag.pTfh cells post-vaccination, there was a trend of higher IL-21 expression in total pTfh cells in P subjects post-vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Taken together, we consider that pTfh are quantitatively and qualitatively superior in P subjects as compared to NP subjects.

It did not look like this is happening only in the DFD arm. Results are written as if they are significantly different.</p></disp-quote><p>Our conclusions are based on the increase in IL-21, ICOS, and Ki67 comparing baseline to post-vaccine timepoints in protected subjects, indicating a vaccine-induced enhancement of these three immune parameters in the CSP-specific pTfh cells. Non-protected subjects did not show an increase in these markers. Moreover, in the DFD arm there was significantly higher IL-21 and ICOS expression at T7 compared to the STD arm, which further supports a regimen-induced enhancement of the pTfh function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Do the authors have any hypothesis for the enhancement of B and Tfh cell response in DFD group compared to the STD regimen?</p></disp-quote><p>One possible hypothesis is that early Tfh response induces by the initial vaccine doses result in the formation of a strong high affinity memory B cell pool specific to CSP antigen and the delayed fractional dose lead to expansion and differentiation of the preformed memory B cells to Ab secreting cells. In the case of STD vaccine regimen, early administration of the booster dose was detrimental to the pre-formed memory B cell expansion and differentiation. To support our hypothesis, our data integration analysis showed that nearly 30% of good “early” responders in the STD arm became non-protected after the 3<sup>rd</sup> dose, indicating that dose 3 within a 0, 1, 2 month dose schedule may have an adverse effect on an otherwise promising immune response generated by dose 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Did they do an antigen-specific IgG subclass response to see whether DFM has wide range of antibody responses compare to STD regimen?</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the total IgG levels in PBMC culture supernatants after 5 days of stimulation with malaria antigens, such as full-length CSP (PF-CSP), C-term CSP (PF-16), and repeat region (R32LR). Responses to each of these antigens were included as a variable in the data integration analysis and none of the IgG responses were selected by the model as being associated with protection or regimen difference. We included this information in the revised manuscript as a supplementary figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 5). Moreover, the serum IgG response specificity/isotype response from this trial was published previously by our collaborators (Chaudhury et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is also surprising to see that non-Tfh component are not looked t properly such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 levels. What is the association of these cells with antigen specific B cell response between P versus NP individuals?</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed non-Tfh compartment and IFNγ responses, while IL-2 or TNF in the Tfh compartment were not analyzed in this study. Non-Tfh and IFNγ data were included as variables in the data integration analysis and neither was selected as a variable associated with protection or regimen difference in the data integration analysis.

Despite the outcome of this analysis, it might be useful and most informative to assess the non-pTfh cells alongside the pTfh cells. In the event that the PBMCs are no longer available, the authors need to address these potentially crucial components as possible mechanisms for the superior outcome in DFD regimen of immunization. As an example, previously published works have shown an association between IL-2<sup>+</sup> and IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells and antibody responses in RTS,S vaccinated subjects. In the absence of results, including these points would improve the tenor of the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the non-pTfh data in the Results section of the manuscript as a supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please revisit the legends and confirm whether they indicate that the error bars signify SEM.</p></disp-quote><p>The information about the error bars signifying SEM is included in all figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3.

It fails to provide a cogent picture or a hypothesis that would suggest possible interactions that may be occurring between the pThf cells (and possibly non-pTfh CD4 T cells) and the various B cells subsets and which bring about this enhanced protection seen in subjects receiving DFD regiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Discussion extensively to discuss the hypothesis that early Tfh response induced by the initial vaccine dose results in the formation of a strong high affinity memory B cell pool specific to CSP antigen, and the DFD leads to expansion and differentiation of the preformed memory B cells to Ab secreting cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Along these lines, the authors need to relate their finding to a larger picture of RTS,S vaccination in African countries. Specifically, the paper would benefit from a discussion of the implications of these findings on RTS,S vaccination in real-world endemic settings, where many children would inevitably be exposed (often repeatedly) to malaria antigens during the &quot;suboptimal&quot; 2-6 month window following priming. The authors are not requested to provide field data, which they obviously cannot; however if a DFD regimen were deployed in Africa, many children would get a natural malaria infection that might have the same negative impact as the STD dose #3 and this is worth discussing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Discussion to relate our findings to the field. We have updated the section in the Discussion reflecting on the induction of Tfh cells by RTS,S/AS01E vaccination in African children, but balanced by findings that malaria infection can induce dysfunctional Tfh phenotypes. In future DFD trials in the field, the induction of Tfh cells should be investigated.</p></body></sub-article></article>
