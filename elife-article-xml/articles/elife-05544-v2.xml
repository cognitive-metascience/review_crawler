Transplanting bone marrow from a healthy person can be used to treat people with certain disorders of the blood and immune system, by providing a new supply of regenerating bone marrow stem cells. Bone marrow transplants are also critical for individuals who had their own bone marrow stem cells destroyed by cancer or by toxic anti-cancer therapies like chemotherapy.</p><p>Acquiring bone marrow for transplants can be a difficult process. Sometimes doctors can use the patient's own stem cells for a transplant. But in circumstances where the patient lacks healthy bone marrow, a bone marrow donor must be found. Donors and recipients must be carefully matched: certain proteins on the donor's bone marrow cells must be very similar to the proteins on the recipient's bone marrow cells, or the recipient's immune system will attack and kill the new cells.</p><p>If scientists could learn to grow the stem cells found in bone marrow in laboratories, they could circumvent some of the challenges associated with bone marrow donation. To do that, scientists must first understand the precise molecular mechanisms that allow the blood cell-producing stem cells to regenerate themselves and produce new blood cells.</p><p>Angiopoietin-like proteins are commonly used to help stem cells grow in the laboratory, and Lin et al. have now looked in detail at how these proteins work. This revealed that angiopoietin-like proteins also cause the stem cells that produce blood cells to grow in zebrafish embryos and are necessary for the embryos' vascular system to develop properly.</p><p>Zebrafish embryos lacking angiopoietin-like proteins develop a similar set of developmental problems as zebrafish embryos with a mutation in another protein called Notch. Through a series of experiments, Lin et al. show that angiopoietin-like proteins interact with Notch and help transform Notch into its active form, which is necessary for blood stem cell growth. Lin et al. also found that both angiopoietin-like proteins and Notch affect the same signaling molecules. This suggests that the two proteins may work together as part of the same molecular pathway. The work suggests an alternative method to activate Notch for blood stem cell stimulation during processes such as bone marrow or cord blood transplantation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

cells (HSPCs) are defined as cells with the ability to self-renew and differentiate into all blood lineages. They provide tremendous therapeutic potential for bone marrow transplantation in the treatment of hematologic malignancy, inherited blood disorders, and cancer chemotherapy. An important goal in studying stem cells is to identify factors that can expand HSPCs in vitro, while maintaining their self-renewal capacity. Scientists have turned to clues during embryonic hematopoietic development to identify novel factors that regulate this expansion. Developmental hematopoiesis occurs in at least two distinct phases, in which an initial transient wave produces mainly primitive erythrocytes and myeloid cells, followed by a definitive wave which produces long-term HSPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orkin and Zon, 2008</xref>). Ontogeny studies across species have identified the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region as the site from which definitive HSPCs arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dieterlen-Lievre, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Medvinsky and Dzierzak, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tavian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaffredo et al., 1998</xref>). Recent studies using time-lapse imaging in live zebrafish embryos and live mouse thick tissue sections revealed that HSPCs bud off from the endothelium lining the ventral wall of the developing dorsal aorta (DA) prior to entering circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bertrand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boisset et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kissa and Herbomel, 2010</xref>). Subsequent to their birth in the AGM, HSPCs migrate to the fetal liver where they undergo significant expansion in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ema and Nakauchi, 2000</xref>) before colonizing the bone marrow and provide life-long supply of all blood cells.</p><p>Angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) were recently identified as growth factors capable of expanding mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farahbakhshian et al., 2014</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khoury et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ventura Ferreira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fan et al., 2014</xref>) HSPCs in culture. ANGPTLs are secreted proteins that closely resembled the Angiopoietins, which are important vascular regulators, but despite structural similarities, they do not bind to TIE-2 or TIE-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oike et al., 2004</xref>).

They are synthesized as ∼300 kD full-length precursor proteins that undergo a series of proteolytic cleavages in order to become fully activated. Prior to translocating to the cell surface, NOTCH is first cleaved by furin-like convertases in the trans-Golgi compartment, resulting in a heterodimer composed of the N-terminal extracellular domain and the C-terminal-transmembrane/intracellular domain, bound through noncovalent linkage. Canonical NOTCH activation requires its obligatory interaction with NOTCH ligands belonging to the Delta/Serrate/Jagged/LAG-2 (DSL) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fortini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>). Several studies support a model in which ligand binding followed by endocytosis creates a mechanical force that alters the conformation of a juxtamembrane NOTCH negative regulatory region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>). This permits cleavage of NOTCH by ADAM/TACE (a disintegrin and metalloprotease/tumor necrosis factor α converting enzyme) at Site 2 (S2), generating the membrane-anchored NOTCH extracellular truncation (NEXT) fragment. NEXT is a substrate for the γ-secretase complex, which cleaves Site 3 (S3), releasing the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD) to freely translocate into the nucleus to interact with DNA binding protein CSL (CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1)/RBPjκ and initiate transcription of target genes.</p><p>While the role of NOTCH in adult HSPC homeostasis still remains controversial, NOTCH is irrefutably important during embryonic hematopoiesis.

More than 3700 genes were differentially regulated with significant <italic>q</italic> value &lt;0.05 (False Discovery Rate (FDR), Benjamini-Hochberg). In order to assess the biological significance of this signature, it was compared to 5562 gene sets in the Broad Molecular Signature Database using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). 284 gene sets showed a highly significant positive enrichment score (ES) with FDR&lt;0.05, indicating that these sets contained genes that positively correlated with our expression phenotype, that is, upregulated in ANGPTL2-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Because the rate-limiting S2 cleavage step gives rise to the transient product, NEXT, which is then very rapidly cleaved by γ-secretase at S3 to generate the terminal fragment, NICD, we sought to determine whether ANGPTL2 can regulate S2 cleavage. To better detect NEXT accumulation, we treated ANGPTL2-stimulated human endothelial cells with the γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT to block S3 cleavage to allow NEXT buildup. Endothelial cells have a more robust NOTCH response and because we hypothesized that <italic>angptls</italic> can regulate hemogenic endothelial cells in zebrafish, we felt that using human endothelial cells maybe more suitable to use in our studies. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, ANGPTL2 stimulated an increase in NICD in endothelial cells (as in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) in vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells and this increase was blocked by DAPT. Blocking upstream of S3 at S2 using two different inhibitors of S2 cleavage (TAPI-2, a broad spectrum ADAM and TACE inhibitor; and SB-3CT, a non-competitive inhibitor for TACE) results in inhibiting NEXT and NICD formation. In control DMSO-treated cells, ANGPTL2 also stimulated the generation of NEXT fragment and this was further enhanced by treatment with DAPT, thus establishing that ANGPTL2 may regulate NOTCH activation via S2 cleavage.</p><p>The activation of Notch receptors triggers a cascade of downstream signaling and requires highly regulated mechanisms to efficiently turn off via proteasomal degradation of NICD in order to avoid deleterious effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>). Thus, to eliminate the possibility that the ANGPTL2-mediated increase in NICD products is due to obstructed NICD degradation, we post-treated ANGPTL2-stimulated cells with DAPT to prevent further cleavage of NOTCH receptor. If the increase in NICD product following ANGPTL2 treatment is a result of NICD degradation blockade and not a result of NOTCH receptor cleavage as we postulated above, it follows that post-ANGPTL2 treatment with DAPT should inhibit any de novo NOTCH receptor cleavage resulting in sustained levels of NICD. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, we first measured NICD protein levels and found that ANGPTL2 stimulated an increase in NICD as previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>). At 1 hr post-ANGPTL2 treatment, cells were treated with either DMSO (blue bar) or DAPT (red bar). Though NICD level continued to remain high in the DMSO group, it started to decrease starting at 2 hr in the DAPT group suggesting that blocking de novo S3 cleavage was sufficient to bring ANGPTL2-stimulated NOTCH activation down to a basal state (at 4 hr of DAPT). We can conclude from this study that the rise in NICD levels induced by ANGPTL2 is a result of NOTCH receptor cleavage as opposed to interference with NICD degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>ANGPTL receptor LILRB2 interacts with NOTCH</title><p>The human leukocyte immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor B2 (LILRB2) was identified to be the ANGPTLs receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). Typical of the Ig superfamily, of which includes more than 850 members, LILRB2 contains 4 Ig domains in its extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain (TM), and 3 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its intracellular domain (ICD). Since proper compartmentalization of membrane receptors with signaling molecules is critical for coordinating and eliciting downstream cascades, we hypothesized that for ANGPTL2 to facilitate NOTCH cleavage, this interaction needs to occur proximal to NOTCH.

They are then singly or doubly transfected with <italic>NOTCH</italic> receptor into HEK293T cells prior to co-IP with NOTCH antibody and subsequently Western blotted for HA. We found that only the full-length or LILRB2 ECD can interact with NOTCH suggesting that this interaction occurs extracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Moreover, we also performed a replating experiment where singly transfected HEK293T cells (<italic>LILRB2</italic> ECD or ICD truncations, or <italic>NOTCH</italic>) were trypsinized one day after transfection, and each plate of <italic>LILRB2</italic> truncation cells was mixed with <italic>NOTCH</italic> transfected cells before being replated and allowed to grow to confluency. These cells were then processed for the same co-IP/Western blotting. We could not detect any interaction after replating (right lanes) while still being able to detect LILRB2 ECD interaction with NOTCH in double transfections (middle lanes), thus suggesting that the LILRB2 and NOTCH interaction likely occur in <italic>cis</italic>, that is, within the same cells extracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Now that we have established physical interaction between LILRB2 and NOTCH, we investigated whether ANGPTL2-mediated LILRB2 activation is responsible for NOTCH receptor cleavage. We made 2 stable knockdown cell lines that were lentivirally transduced for short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against <italic>LILRB2</italic> and performed co-IP for LILRB2. Even though we could only observe a modest knockdown of LILRB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, second blot, with sh-LILRB2-2 being more effective than sh-LILRB2-1), we saw that in contrast to the control scrambled shRNA transduced cells (sh-CT), which still retained the ANGPTL2-mediated NOTCH cleavage, sh-LILRB2 transduced cells had lost this response with no ANGPTL2-induced NICD formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, third blot). Furthermore, the interaction between LILRB2 and NOTCH receptors also decreased in sh-LILRB2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, first blot). Together, these studies demonstrate that ANGPTL2-induced NOTCH activation may occur through a ligand-regulated recruitment of LILRB2 to NOTCH into the same microdomain. Furthermore, this novel finding provides a plausible means by which ANGPTL2 can assist in NOTCH cleavage. The cleavage leads ultimately to an activation of <italic>MYC</italic> target genes that are involved in stimulating endothelial and hematopoietic cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>notch</italic> is indispensable during the developmental specification of HSPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burns et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clements et al., 2011</xref>).

To our knowledge, this is the first time <italic>zangptls</italic> has been shown to activate <italic>notch</italic>. The current model for <italic>notch</italic> specification of HSPCs during development has mostly been suggested to be a cell-autonomous one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hadland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burns et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Robert-Moreno et al., 2005</xref>). Our live imaging data from transient <italic>Tg(drl:eGFP;kdrl:NICD)-</italic>injected embryos resulting in significantly more budding HSPCs in the AGM of DA corroborate with this. More recently, studies have revealed an additional and separate role for somite-derived <italic>notch</italic> signaling during HSPC specification that occurs much earlier than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clements et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kobayashi et al., 2014</xref>). Based on our genetic data in zebrafish in which we observed a tight genetic interaction between <italic>zangptls</italic> and <italic>notch</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we believe that <italic>zangptls</italic> exert their effects on definitive hematopoiesis during the vascular specifications of the axial vessels including the DA, when it coincides with the highest endogenous expression of <italic>zangptl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Though it remains to be determined, information on the spatial/temporal expression pattern of the yet unidentified <italic>zangptl</italic> receptor would solidify this premise. There are receptors in zebrafish with similar domains as the mammalian receptor, but there is no obvious orthologue. Nevertheless, our current proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) extrapolated from our genetic data places <italic>zangptl2</italic> downstream of <italic>mib</italic> as <italic>Tg(hsp70:zangptl2)</italic> crossed into <italic>mib</italic> can rescue its hematopoietic defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). <italic>Zangptl2</italic> acts upstream of <italic>notch</italic> activation, that is, generation of <italic>NICD</italic>, as forced expression of <italic>NICD</italic> from <italic>Tg(hsp70:Gal4;UAS:NICD)</italic> can rescue <italic>angptls-</italic>MO morphant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, loss of <italic>notch</italic> signaling in <italic>angptls-</italic>MO-injected <italic>notch</italic> reporter embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) indicates that <italic>zangptls</italic> are required for <italic>notch</italic> signaling but also raises questions as to whether <italic>notch</italic> ligands needed to be present for <italic>zangptls</italic> to regulate <italic>notch</italic> activation. One of the <italic>notch</italic> ligands, <italic>deltaC,</italic> has considerable overlapping expression both spatially and temporally with <italic>notch</italic> in the developing DA, suggesting that it may play a role during the formation of the hemogenic endothelium and the subsequent generation of HSPCs. <italic>DeltaC</italic> expression<italic>,</italic> normally absent in the DA of <italic>mib</italic> was similarly rescued in <italic>Tg(hsp70:zangptl2);mib</italic> (data not shown). This restoration of <italic>notch</italic> ligand in the <italic>mib</italic> by <italic>zangptl2</italic> overexpression was intriguing, and it remains to be established whether this restored <italic>notch</italic> ligand is functional in the absence of <italic>mib</italic>.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05544.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed models for ANGPTL-mediated NOTCH signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Notch</italic> signaling in zebrafish is believed to be important for HSPC specification in the hemogenic endothelium on the ventral side of the developing dorsal aorta (DA). A simplified view of canonical <italic>notch</italic> signaling starts with <italic>mib</italic> endocytic processing of <italic>notch</italic> ligands to potentiate their ability to activate <italic>notch</italic>, depicted in the wild-type (WT) model. <italic>Notch</italic> receptors interact with ligands in the neighboring cell and this leads to subsequent cleavage of <italic>notch</italic> to release <italic>NICD</italic> to translocate into the nucleus and initiate transcription of target gene like <italic>myc</italic>. In the <italic>mib</italic> mutant however, the lack of signal from <italic>notch</italic> ligands prevents further downstream signaling from the receptor and HSPCs are not formed. From our genetic interaction studies, we believe that <italic>zangptl2</italic> is downstream of <italic>mib</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) but upstream of <italic>NICD</italic> generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) Using cultured cells to further explore the mechanism by which ANGPTL2 can regulate NOTCH signaling, we found that ANGPTL2 can stimulate NOTCH receptor cleavage at S2 and S3, leading to transcription of target genes.

However, <italic>myc</italic> has not been studied in zebrafish hematopoiesis. We found that not only is <italic>myc</italic> required during HSPC formation in the AGM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), overexpression of exogenous <italic>myc</italic> in embryos lacking <italic>zangptls</italic> (<italic>angptls-</italic>MO) or <italic>notch</italic> (<italic>mib</italic>) signaling could similarly rescue AGM defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,B</xref>). This puts <italic>myc</italic> downstream of <italic>zangptls</italic> and <italic>notch</italic> signaling. Through independent gene expression analysis, we found <italic>MYC</italic> to be highly activated upon ANGPTL2 stimulation in human CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, we ran GSEA comparing our ANGPTL2-induced gene expression signature to the set of <italic>MYC</italic> target genes whose regulatory elements were bound by NOTCH from our ChIP-seq data and found significant overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This implies that the set of <italic>MYC</italic> targets downstream of ANGPTL2 and NOTCH signaling is highly similar, supporting our hypothesis that ANGPTL may signal partially through NOTCH.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we utilized cultured mammalian cells to directly investigate the mechanism by which ANGPTL2 may act on NOTCH. We first discovered that purified ANGPTL2 ligand added to cells can rapidly induce NOTCH activation, measurable using three different assays: a luciferase reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), qPCR of known NOTCH target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and Western blotting for the NOTCH cleavage product NICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Of particular note, when we used different drugs that block certain cleavage events, we found that ANGPTL2-stimulated S2 cleavage of NOTCH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, this step occurs at the cell surface when NOTCH engages with its ligands. Although the precise mechanism in which ANGPTL2 mediates NOTCH cleavage is subject to further investigation, our assumption that this level of regulation must occur in close proximity led to our surprising discovery that human ANGPTL2 receptor, LILRB2, can interact with NOTCH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 1,2</xref>). These preliminary results from co-IPs certainly suggest that ANGPTL signaling occurs in very close proximity to NOTCH. Such co-IP experiments do not definitively signify that there is direct physical interaction and do not address the stoichiometry of this potential interaction. Nevertheless, ANGPTL2-mediated NOTCH cleavage appears to be dependent on LILRB2 signaling, as sh-LILRB2 knockdown resulted in diminished NICD generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This demonstrates a functional interaction. A more thorough mapping of the interactions between these two surface receptors will shed light on the mechanism by which ANGPTL2 can regulate NOTCH activation. An attractive speculation as to why this interaction may occur would be to potentially facilitate or even poise the NOTCH receptor for more efficient cleavage, as depicted in the model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. This also raises an intriguing possibility of whether LILRB2 can physically alter NOTCH interaction with its ligand or whether ANGPTL2 signaling can influence NOTCH ligand availability. Indeed several studies have suggested that Notch receptors oligomerize at the cell surface at sites of DSL ligand contact from neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luty et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nichols et al., 2007</xref>). The recruitment of LILRB2 to NOTCH may facilitate this clustering process although the stoichiometry of LILRB2 to NOTCH remains to be established.</p><p>Various alternative non-DSL type ligands have been identified to activate NOTCH, such as the adhesion molecule F3/Contactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2003</xref>), EGF-repeat factor DNER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eiraku et al., 2005</xref>), EGF-like domain 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>), and Microfibrillar associated glycoproteins (MAGP) 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miyamoto et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, a related family member to the latter, MFAP4 was found to be capable of expanding mouse HSPCs <italic>ex vivo</italic> along with ANGPTLs 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Our study does not propose ANGPTL2/LILRB2 as a non-canonical NOTCH ligand but offers an additional layer of regulation on NOTCH activation which may not be previously appreciated.</p><p>Previous report on the discovery of ANGPTL receptor, LILRB2, suggested downstream activation of CAMK (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase)-2 and -4 and subsequent recruitment of SHP-2 (a Src homology 2 domain containing non-transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase) in freshly isolated mouse spleen cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). CAMK2 has been shown to activate NOTCH in human prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mamaeva et al., 2009</xref>) whereas SHP-2 has also been shown to genetically interact with <italic>notch</italic> signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oishi et al., 2006</xref>). Although the answer as to whether CAMKs and SHP-2 may directly or indirectly regulate NOTCH is still yet to be determined, this suggests that LILRB2 signaling may extend beyond the models presented in our studies.</p><p>The ability of ANGPTLs to regulate the local events at which NOTCH cleavage occurs creates new opportunity for therapeutic intervention. The role of Notch during HSPC renewal at homeostasis is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bigas et al., 2010</xref>). Recent studies demonstrate that endothelial-derived <italic>Notch</italic> signal can stimulate murine cKit<sup>+</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>−</sup> cells expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butler et al., 2010</xref>). Delta1<sup>ext−IgG</sup>, in which the engineered activating NOTCH ligand is tethered to the Fc domain of human IgG1, was developed for ex vivo expansion of human CD34<sup>+</sup> cord blood (CB) progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delaney et al., 2005</xref>). More recently, Delta1<sup>ext−IgG</sup>-expanded HSPCs showed great clinical promise in rapid hematopoietic engraftment with shortened time to neutrophil recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delaney et al., 2010</xref>). In support of an interaction between the <italic>angptls</italic> and <italic>notch</italic>, preliminary analysis of human CD34<sup>+</sup> CB progenitors treated with ANGPTL2 or Delta<sup>ext−IgG</sup> had comparable expansion in CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD90(Thy-1)<sup>lo</sup> populations. Furthermore, these expansions were effectively abrogated when cells were treated with a combination of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 blocking antibodies, suggesting that they were at least partially NOTCH mediated. This supports that the ANGPTLs and NOTCH can interact in another cell type such as human cord blood CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. In conclusion, our studies of ANGPTL-mediated activation of NOTCH presented here have uncovered an important genetic, physical, and functional interaction of these two signaling pathways that are critical for hematopoiesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish strains and heatshock experiment</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained in accordance to Boston Children's Hospital Animal Research Guidelines.

Full-length LILRB2 contains four extracellular (ECD) IgG domains, a transmembrane domain (TM) and a short ICD. The LILRB2 ECD truncation mutant includes the entire ECD of LILRB2, the transmembrane domain and the first six amino acids from the ICD. The LILRB2 ICD truncation mutant includes 41 amino acids from the end of ECD, TM and the entire ICD. The HA-tag (TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCT) followed by a linker sequence (GGAGGCTCAGGGGGTTCC) was cloned 5′ to the ATG of full-length LILRB2 or LILRB2 ECD to make the N-terminal-tagged mutants. Likewise, the linker sequence followed by the HA tag was cloned 3′ to the last amino acid before STOP of full-length LILRB2 and LILRB2 ECD to make the C-terminal-tagged mutants. To generate N- or C-terminal HA-tagged LILRB2-ICD, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to insert the HA and linker sequences (Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, NEB, Ipswich, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>LILRB2 shRNA infection and virus production</title><p>Lentiviral shRNA in the pLKO.1-puromycin vector were obtained from the Sigma Mission shRNA library. Two lentiviral shRNA constructs targeted against human LILRB2 were obtained with the following sequences: sh-LILRB2-1 (TRCN0000416153: CCGGGAAGTAAGAATGTGCTTTAAACTCGAGTTTAAAGCACATTCTTACTTCTTTTTTG) and sh-LILRB2-2 (TRCN0000416926: CCGGTGACGTTGGCTTTCGTATAAGCTCGAGCTTATACGAAAGCCAACGTCATTTTTTG). An shRNA with a scrambled sequence was used as a non-targeting control (sh-CT). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). They were transfected at 80% confluence using branched polyethylenimine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with psPAX2 and VSV-G lentiviral plasmids as well as the relevant shRNA plasmid. Medium was refreshed 16–24 hr after transfection. Medium containing viral particles was collected at 48 and 72 hr after transfection and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Stable EA.hy926 cells were infected with each virus with 8 μg/ml protamine sulfate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) overnight at 37°C and selected for 2 weeks in 1 μg/ml Puromycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting</title><p>Subsequent to cells stimulated with purified ANGPTL2, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS prior to lysing in RIPA buffer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 20 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, 0.3 mg/ml Pefabloc SC (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>. Normalized protein lysates were diluted to 1 mg/ml prior to pre-clearing using Protein G-conjugated Dynal beads (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Pre-cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies overnight at 4°C. Protein G-conjugated Dynal beads were used to pull down immunocomplexes and washed with IP buffer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), supplemented with the above mentioned protease/phosphatase inhibitors, three times prior to eluting in SDS sample buffer and loading onto SDS-PAGE for Western blotting. Antibodies used to perform co-IPs and Western blotting are Notch1 (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, sc-6014R or Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, #3608), Cleaved Notch Val1744 (NICD, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, #4147), Cleaved Notch (NEXT, provided by S Blacklow), LILRB2 (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, sc-33454), β-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, #A2228), HA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, #H9658), and VE-Cadherin (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, sc-6458). All co-IPs and Westerns were repeated at least three times with similar results. The densitometries of Western blots are measured using ImageJ v1.48 and indicated below the blots as a ratio of band intensity normalized to the loading control β-actin or the protein used for IP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Microarray analysis</title><p>Samples for microarray analysis were obtained by isolating RNA from three biological triplicates each of human CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells that have been stimulated with ANGPTL2 (1 μg/ml) or PBS vehicle using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) extraction followed by DNaseI (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) digestion and RNeasy (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) cleanup. RNA was prepared for hybridization to the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays. Raw CEL files were analyzed using the Genepattern software suite (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Raw CEL files were converted into GCT format using the ExpressionFileCreator Module, with RMA and quantile normalization. The GCT file was then used in the PreprocessDataSet module, where threshold and ceiling values were set (floor 20 ceiling 20,000, fold = 1.5, delta = 1), and any value lower/higher than the threshold/ceiling were reset to the threshold/ceiling value, and data were processed to discard any invariant genes. Comparisons between groups were performed using the ComparativeMarkerSelection modules, using two-sided t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple hypothesis testing. The data for these microarrays are available on NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database under GEO accession number GES51652.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>GSEA analysis</title><p>The data generated from the Affymetrix arrays were used to query the Broad Molecular Signature Database. The GCT files generated by Genepattern were used as input to GSEA (version 2, Broad Institute) and queried against the c2 curated gene sets, c3 motif gene sets, and c5 GO gene sets. GSEA parameters used for this analysis: scoring_scheme=weighted, metric=Signa2Noise, permute_type=gene_set, permutations=1000. Genesets with a FDR&lt;0.25 were considered significant, and the top 20 sets (all with FDR = 0.00) were used for Leading Edge analysis.

Briefly, 10<sup>8</sup> of the ANGPTL2-stimulated human peripheral blood CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors were cross-linked with fresh formaldehyde, quenched with Glycine and lysed. The nuclear extracts were sonicated (Bioruptor) for 36 cycles of 30-s followed by 1-min rest prior immunoprecipitation with 100 μg of NOTCH antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2011</xref>) and 100 μg of Protein G Dynal beads overnight at 4°C. 50 μl of sonicated lysates prior to antibody addition was reserved as input sample. Beads are washed, eluted, and reverse cross-linked before RNase and Proteinase K treatment and DNA extracted by Phenol/Chloroform. ChIP or input DNA overhangs were blunted and purified using PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Single A in the 3′ end was added and purified with the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Illumina adaptor oligos were added, followed by PCR purification again. The samples were amplified by PCR (18 cycles) to add linker sequence to the fragments to prepare for annealing to the Genome Analyzer flow-cell. Amplified samples were separated on a 2% agarose gel, and products between 150 and 350 bp were excised and gel extracted using Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Polony generation and sequencing were done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trompouki et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>ChIP-seq data analysis</title><p>Sequences obtained from the Illumina/Solexa sequencer were processed through the bundled Solexa image extraction pipeline as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trompouki et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, sequences were aligned using ELAND software to NCBI Build 36 (UCSC hg18) of the human genome. Only sequences that mapped uniquely to the genome with zero or one mismatch were used for our analysis. Analysis methods were based on previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guenther et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marson et al., 2008</xref>). Each read was extended 200 bp toward the interior of the sequence fragment, based on the strand of the alignment. Across the genome the number of ChIP-seq reads was tabulated in 10 bp bins, and the genomic bins that contained statistically significant ChIP-seq enrichment were identified by comparison to a Poissonian background model. Assuming background reads are spread randomly throughout the genome, the probability of observing a given number of reads in a 1-kb window can be modeled as a Poisson process in which the expectation can be estimated as the number of mapped reads multiplied by the number of bins into which each read maps, divided by the total number of bins available. Enriched bins within 200 bp of one another were combined into regions. The Poissonian background model assumes a random distribution of background reads. However, significant deviations from this expectation have been observed. Some of these non random events can be detected as sites of apparent enrichment in negative control DNA samples creating false positives. To remove these false-positive regions, negative control DNA from whole-cell extract (Input DNA sample) was sequenced. Enriched bins and enriched regions were defined as having greater than fivefold density in the experimental sample compared with the control sample when normalized to the total number of reads in each data set. This served to filter out genomic regions that are biased to having a greater than expected background density of ChIP-seq reads. Enriched regions within 5 kb upstream or downstream of the body of the gene were called bound. Additionally, data files that contain genome browser tracks showing genome-wide ChIP-seq density and enriched regions for all experiments are available on NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database under GEO accession number GES63010.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Motif analysis, GREAT analysis, and Ingenuity Pathway analysis</title><p>Non-repeat sequences from NOTCH ChIP-seq were uploaded onto MEME-ChIP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/tools/meme-chip">http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/tools/meme-chip</ext-link>) for motif analysis. Enriched regions from the NOTCH ChIP-seq were imported into Genomic Regions Enrichment Annotations Tool (GREAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McLean et al., 2010</xref>) and genomic regions that are associated with putative genes were used to generate terms that include gene ontology, phenotype data and human disease, pathway data, gene expression, regulatory motifs, and gene families. Each term is determined by the region–gene association settings and significance is computed from the enriched regions of the NOTCH ChIP-seq falling in the regulatory domains of genes involved in a particular function compared to random. Both the enriched genes from the NOTCH ChIP-seq and the gene lists from the microarrays were imported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The functional analysis identified the biological functions and/or disease states that are most significant to the data set. Of note, the Upstream Regulator analysis was used to predict which molecules (in its active or repressed state) are likely to give rise to the observed expression data. <italic>MYC</italic> was identified as the top active molecule.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Y Kubota, Y Oike, T Suda, S Blacklow, H Wang, Y L Wong, K Vasudevan J Ganis, J Lahvic, I Shestopalov, and A Gutierrez for providing reagents; C Blobel, S Blacklow, and TA Springer for helpful discussion and critical comments; Y Zhou for bioinformatics discussions; and N Lawson for providing the Tg<italic>(Tp1bglob:eGFP)</italic><sup><italic>um14</italic></sup>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers and the Reviewing editor are unanimous in recognizing the quality and importance of the experiments and results presented in this work. But the reviewers have one major objection with the manuscript that needs to be attended to. The reviewers find that the vast array of experiments reported in this manuscript fail to decisively prove the mechanistic details of the model presented. As reviewers are not able to pin-point a single experiment that will resolve this issue, and it is only the authors who know how best to present their data, it is unclear how the reviewers should advise the authors on this manuscript. Suggestions ranged from presenting only the zebrafish data to concentrating on one aspect of the mechanism. It is the policy of <italic>eLife</italic> to either clearly state specific, doable, experiments or not accept the manuscript. Yet, we find that the high quality of the experimental results and the importance of the conclusions, if properly justified, make a compelling case for <italic>eLife</italic> as the appropriate journal for this manuscript. It is the Reviewing editor’s impression that at the core of this indecision is the fact that experiments performed in zebrafish and human cell lines are all intermingled together with conclusions from one applied to results from the other, leaving the reader with the impression that the model is not well substantiated. In some cases, additional justification from unrelated experiments could be trimmed. One possibility is to first state all the results from the zebrafish experiments, filling up any holes with new experiments, if possible and then pointing out, with a schematic diagram, the parts of the pathway that have been uncovered. Then state which steps were either confirmed or gaps in the mechanistic details filled in by experiments in the cell line system. Then create a final compound diagram that distinguishes the contributions from the two systems. Of course, the authors may have a better way to create a more focused manuscript, but it is clear that the reviewers have asked for a more critical analysis of what the data do and do not support; not just a rearrangement of the same paragraphs. Presented below are details of some of the other major concerns, but the authors should attempt to resolve them only if they are willing to also make the mechanistic aspects firmer.</p><p>Other specific comments:</p><p>1) The conclusions about the stepwise pathways activated are confused by the experiments that show rescue of the <italic>mib ZF</italic> mutants by over expression of either <italic>angptl1/2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) or constitutive AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The <italic>mib</italic> mutant impairs the notch pathway by impacting on ubiquitination of endocytosed notch ligands so perhaps this is “upstream” of the dependence of notch cleavage steps on AKT, but the fact that <italic>angptl1/2</italic> over expression rescues the mob phenotype is not further explained or put in context in the Discussion.

This raises questions about the quality of the ChiP-Seq data.

It is unclear how this relates to the topic of this paper. Were the ChIP-Seq studies revealing for direct Notch regulation of Myc. In addition, the rescue of the <italic>mib</italic> mutant by <italic>myc</italic> expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> is weak, especially compared to the rescue of the angptls-MO cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> or the rescue by <sup>Myr</sup>hAkt1 in Figure 4–figure supplement 2.</p><p>5) Data suggesting that Akt signaling is upstream of Notch: The data certainly support the idea that both Notch and Akt signals are important. However, the studies suggesting that Akt is proximal to Notch are very weak. For example, the effect of Ly294002 on the Notch reporter is much weaker than inhibiting Notch itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The studies on ADAM7/TACE are very preliminary and in depth functional studies need to be done to evaluate the significance of this result.</p><p>6) The data suggesting that the Angptl receptor interacts with Notch are very preliminary: To date, the data on non-canonical Notch ligands has been confusing (at best). For this reason, characterization of non-canonical ligands needs to be rigorous. What is the effect of knocking down the Angptl receptor in zebrafish? Does it affect Notch signaling? Is the interaction specific for Notch1? The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> suggest that the Angptl receptor:Notch interaction is important for Notch signaling but no functional studies are provided to support this. These need to be done. In addition, how does Angptl signaling affect signaling by canonical Notch ligands? Also, the Western blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are difficult to interpret as they are extremely underexposed.</p><p>7) The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are presented in a complicated manner, and it is not clear if Angptl overexpression in the <italic>Tg(hsp70:zangptl2)</italic> affects <italic>mib</italic> function or <italic>deltaC</italic> expression, or both. It is clear that the hematopoiesis in the embryos is rescued but not clear as to the order of events that lead to the rescue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05544.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers and the Reviewing editor are unanimous in recognizing the quality and importance of the experiments and results presented in this work.

We did find enrichment for the RBPjκ consensus motif but it is embedded as a larger consensus motif for ZNF143. We have clarified this in the text and figure. For Notch ChIP-seq, we have tried several commercially available antibodies but none worked until we tried a published antibody from Jon Aster’s lab. The top motifs from our Notch ChIP-seq, Ets, Runx1 and ZNF143 were similar to those found from his lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, we also found enrichment and significant peaks in regions that were also found in his ChIP-seq thus we feel confident of our data.</p><p><italic>4) Myc as an important target: Most of the data are correlative.

We agree that the rescue of <italic>mib</italic> using <italic>myc</italic> mRNA in the now renamed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> is weaker than those in <italic>angptls-</italic>MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This was due to some technical difficulties we had with <italic>myc</italic> overexpression, which seemed to be quite toxic to the embryos. The <italic>angptls-</italic>MO morphants are generally healthier than <italic>mib</italic> embryos, probably due to the pantropic deleterious effects of <italic>notch</italic> defects while <italic>angptls-</italic>MO only affected cells that expressed the <italic>zangptl</italic> receptor. Thus we have repeated the experiment many times and this level of rescue is reproducible. We have adjusted the text to reflect the partial rescue and our explanations.</p><p><italic>5) Data suggesting that Akt signaling is upstream of Notch: The data certainly support the idea that both Notch and Akt signals are important. However, the studies suggesting that Akt is proximal to Notch are very weak.

What is the effect of knocking down the Angptl receptor in zebrafish? Does it affect Notch signaling? Is the interaction specific for Notch1?</italic></p><p>We are not claiming that Angptls are non-canonical Notch ligands since that would imply Notch activation independent of Notch ligands. Our data simply suggests an additional layer of regulation on Notch afforded by Angptls. We have revised our manuscript to reiterate this point. The zebrafish <italic>angptl</italic> receptor has not been identified. The human LILRB2 belongs to the Ig superfamily, which encompasses more than 850 members. Within this family, LILRB2 is found to be encoded in a large leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) region of chromosome 19, comprising of <italic>KIRs</italic>, <italic>LILRs</italic>, <italic>CEACAMs</italic>, <italic>PSGs</italic>, <italic>Siglec</italic> genes and other extended LRC genes, all of which shared highly similar structure, containing anywhere from 1 to 4 Ig domains in the extracellular region and 1-3 ITAM/ITIM domains intracellularly. Because they are all clustered on 19q13.4, we did extensive bioinformatics searches to find the zebrafish orthologue for LILRB2 but could not discern between the highly similar family members. When we scanned this gene region for synteny, we also could not find the LILRB2 orthologue as a large portion of the region where it could potentially reside within the zebrafish genome seemed to be translocated or deleted. We understand that it would help better interpret our data if we identified the LILRB2 orthologue but we feel that it is beyond the scope of this manuscript. We have highlighted our text in the manuscript about the current lack of a zebrafish receptor.</p><p><italic>The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>suggest that the Angptl receptor:Notch interaction is important for Notch signaling but no functional studies are provided to support this. These need to be done. In addition, how does Angptl signaling affect signaling by canonical Notch ligands? Also, the Western blots in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>are difficult to interpret as they are extremely underexposed</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it would be more conclusive if we can disrupt the interaction between LILRB2 and Notch but because it is not known where the interacting regions between these receptors are, there are currently no blocking antibodies or drugs available that can disrupt this interaction to assess functional loss. We do however show in the now renamed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> that knocking down LILRB2 prevented the Angptl2-induced Notch cleavage, suggesting that Angptl-mediated Notch activation is at least partially through LILRB2 signaling. We have examined the expression of Notch ligands on the cell membrane in our cultured human endothelial cells and found high levels of Jag1 and lower levels of Jag2, DLL1 and DLL4, which did not seem to change when stimulated by Angptl2. To examine the effect of Angptl2 on signaling by canonical Notch ligands would require disruption between Notch and each of these ligands (by knockdown or specific blocking antibodies). While this is very interesting and adds to our understanding of Angptls signaling, we feel that this is also beyond the scope of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) The results in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>are presented in a complicated manner, and it is not clear if Angptl overexpression in the</italic> Tg(hsp70:zangptl2<italic>) affects</italic> mib <italic>function or</italic> deltaC <italic>expression, or both. It is clear that the hematopoiesis in the embryos is rescued but not clear as to the order of events that lead to the rescue.</italic></p><p>We have revised our manuscript to remove the data on <italic>deltaC</italic> in these rescue experiments in order to simplify our paper. <italic>DeltaC</italic> was examined in our original study because its normal expression overlaps with <italic>notch</italic> in the dorsal aorta during the formation of the hemogenic endothelium (at 28hpf), preceding the formation of HSPCs (36hpf). It also is a <italic>notch</italic> target gene. We hypothesized that since <italic>angptls</italic> may act early, we wanted to see if <italic>deltaC</italic> expression was also restored. Because the gene expression of <italic>deltaC</italic> during development can be regulated by a genetic loop of <italic>notch</italic> pathway self-activation (Holley et al, 2002 [Her1 and the Notch Pathway Function within the Oscillator Mechanism that Regulates Zebrafish Somitogenesis, Development 129:1175-83]), we viewed this rescue of <italic>deltaC</italic> expression as a marker for restored <italic>notch</italic> circuitry in <italic>mib</italic> by <italic>zangtl2</italic> overexpression. But the use of <italic>deltaC</italic> as a marker does raise the question of whether this ligand is involved during <italic>angptl-</italic>mediated <italic>notch</italic> activation. We understand that this may confuse the readers and have now included this only in our Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
