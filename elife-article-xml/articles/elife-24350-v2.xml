is a heterogeneously organized composite with lipid-protein micro-domains. The contractile actin cortex may govern the lateral organization of these domains in the cell membrane, yet the underlying mechanisms are not known. We recently reconstituted minimal actin cortices (MACs) (Vogel et al., 2013b) and here advanced our assay to investigate effects of rearranging actin filaments on the lateral membrane organization by introducing various phase-separated lipid mono- and bilayers to the MACs. The addition of actin filaments reorganized membrane domains. We found that the process reached a steady state where line tension and lateral crowding balanced. Moreover, the phase boundary allowed myosin driven actin filament rearrangements to actively move individual lipid domains, often accompanied by their shape change, fusion or splitting. Our findings illustrate how actin cortex remodeling in cells may control dynamic rearrangements of lipids and other molecules inside domains without directly binding to actin filaments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24350.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24350.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Minimal Actin Cortex</kwd><kwd>Myosin</kwd><kwd>Actin</kwd><kwd>synthetic biology</kwd><kwd>membrane</kwd><kwd>in vitro reconstitution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002974</institution-id><institution>Daimler und Benz Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32-09/11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vogel</surname><given-names>Sven Kenjiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vogel</surname><given-names>Sven Kenjiro</given-names></name><name><surname>Greiss</surname><given-names>Ferdinand</given-names></name><name><surname>Khmelinskaia</surname><given-names>Alena</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwille</surname><given-names>Petra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vogel</surname><given-names>Sven Kenjiro</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwille</surname><given-names>Petra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHW716/8-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vogel</surname><given-names>Sven Kenjiro</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwille</surname><given-names>Petra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Vogel et al., 2013b), it is shown that myosin-driven actin filament rearrangements actively move, split or fuse individual lipid domains and change their overall shape.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The spatiotemporal organization of lipids, proteins and other molecules at and within the cell membrane is pivotal for many fundamental cellular processes, such as signal transduction from the extracellular to the intracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Groves and Kuriyan, 2010</xref>). Recent findings suggest that the cell membrane should be considered as a heterogeneous lipid protein layer with coexisting small micro domains and clusters of lipids and proteins that are assumed to dynamically form and reorganize in response to external and internal cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Engelman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Simons and Gerl, 2010</xref>). Whether and how their spatiotemporal organization is actively regulated and maintained by the cell remains to be revealed. In vivo and in vitro studies suggest an important role of the eukaryotic actin cytoskeleton that interacts with the cell membrane via membrane-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heinemann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Köster et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Murase et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sheetz et al., 1980</xref>). Actin structures were found to mediate the lateral organization of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gudheti et al., 2013</xref>) and to modulate their diffusive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heinemann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Honigmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Murase et al., 2004</xref>). Theoretical considerations have proposed a key role of the actin motor myosin for organizing and forming distinct protein and lipid micro-domains in cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gowrishankar et al., 2012</xref>). However, direct experimental evidence for a control of lipid micro-domains by actomyosin rearrangements is still lacking.</p><p>In eukaryotic cells, the actin cortex is constantly rearranged by the motor protein myosin II and dozens of actin-binding proteins. Therefore, reducing the complexity of experimental conditions, e.g. reducing dimensionality or exploiting a minimal biomimetic system, and utilizing microscopic techniques with a high temporal resolution is beneficial for studying these processes. Phase-separated lipid bilayers with controlled lipid compositions are well-established test beds to mimic lipid micro-domains in cell membranes and biological processes, e.g. the lateral organization of proteins that are otherwise difficult to observe in vivo. Ternary mixtures of lipids below their characteristic melting temperature (Tm) can phase separate into liquid disordered (L<sub>d</sub>) and liquid ordered (L<sub>o</sub>) domains. Liu and Fletcher used phase-separated giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a model system to study the influence of branched actin networks on the miscibility transition temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu and Fletcher, 2006</xref>). They reported that the formation of localized actin networks on PIP2-containing phase-separated GUVs could act as switch for the orientation of lipid domain growth sites.</p><p>However, the effects of an actin meshwork on individual lipid domains are technically difficult to study, due to the three-dimensional architecture of the GUVs. We therefore made use of a minimal biomimetic system of planar geometry that we recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vogel et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2013b</xref>) and combined the minimal actin cortex (MAC) with supported phase-separated membranes and free-standing lipid monolayers. We then visualized and studied the effects of actin filament adhesion and myosin-driven rearrangements on the lateral organization of membrane domains with total internal reflection microscopy (TIRFM) and confocal spinning disk microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Actin filament partitioning on phase-separated membranes</title><p>The effects of adhesion and myosin-induced contraction of an actin meshwork on the lateral organization of lipid domains was studied by combining phase-separated lipid membranes with our established assay featuring contractile MACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vogel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vogel et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2013b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For the adhesion assay, a ternary lipid mixture with DOPC, DPPC and Cholesterol in a 1:2:1 molar ratio was prepared (see Material and methods).

The low miscibility transition temperature of the mixture avoids thermal degradation of proteins and allowed us to study the phase transition behavior in the presence of actin filaments. The fluorescent probe DiD (0.03 mol%) was used to label the L<sub>d</sub> phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">García-Sáez et al., 2007</xref>). The density of biotinylated actin filaments was controlled by the concentration of biotinylated lipid DSPE-PEG(2000)-Biotin (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vogel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vogel et al., 2013b</xref>]).

To this end, the ternary lipid mixture was incubated with non-labeled neutravidin and placed on a temperature-controlled microscope objective. A fluorescence image was acquired as a reference before actin filaments were added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> (left column)). A homogeneous membrane was produced by heating the microscope objective to 42°C (above Tm). Actin filaments were added to the membrane above Tm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> (middle column)), and the sample was subsequently incubated for ~45 min at 42°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The membrane was completely covered by actin filaments after approximately 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> (middle column)). As final step, the membrane was slowly cooled down to 30°C without active cooling and the fluorescence signal was recorded after complete phase separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> (right column)). While the low-density MAC did not show any influence on membrane domain properties (data not shown), the medium-dense MAC caused the formation of smaller domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right column).

Fluorescently labeled actin filaments were added to the sample chamber at specified temperatures below Tm and imaged for ~30 min using TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Because of the strong binding affinity of neutravidin and biotin, we found that the change in fluorescence intensity of labeled actin filaments (which we used as a measure for actin filament binding) was independent of the applied temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Hence, the adhesion process of actin filaments to the membrane was constant over the employed temperature range. The contour length (L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) of membrane domains was extracted and tracked over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). After ~1 min of actin filament addition, first domain deformations could be observed and the contour length was found to grow until a steady state at ~20 min was reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Actin filaments were coupled to ternary phase-separated lipid monolayers similar to the situation in the supported lipid bilayer (SLB) system via biotinylated lipids (1 mol%) and the use of neutravidin. Contrary to the situation in the SLB system, actin filaments preferentially bind to the liquid extended (disordered) (L<sub>e</sub>) phase where also the neutravidin anchor protein mainly partitioned to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). We observed this behavior for both lipid mixtures that were also used for the SLBs (see Material and methods). In low- and medium-dense monolayer MACs the liquid condensed (ordered) L<sub>c</sub> domains acquire circular shapes and the actin filaments close to the phase boundaries align to their circular shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the case of low and medium densities, we expect that the line tension energy dominates over the actin filament wetting energy at the phase boundary and hence the L<sub>c</sub> can assume an unrestricted shape with aligned actin filaments. Similar effects have been observed using bacterial cytoskeleton proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arumugam et al., 2015</xref>). The addition of myosin filaments in the presence of ATP led to the contraction of the actin layer deforming and rearranging the L<sub>c</sub> domains in both lipid mixtures similar to what we observed in the SLB systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>). The shape changes included fusion and stretching of the L<sub>c</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>). Note that these ‘active’ deformation forces were only exerted in the presence of myosin filaments and ATP. Interestingly, the obtained lipid domain shapes seemed to be stabilized after the active contraction period, probably by the remaining actin filaments. Using the monolayer system also tells us that the frictional force caused by a solid support in SLBs does not play a significant role in the observed phenomena.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24350.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Lipid monolayer domain shape changes and fusion events induced by actomyosin contractions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal spinning disk microscope images of Alexa-488-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments coupled to a ATTO655-DOPE-labeled lipid monolayer (3:3:1 DOPC:PSM:Cholesterol) in the absence of myofilaments.

Recent evidence exists that the presence of an actin meshwork influences the lateral diffusion behavior of lipids and proteins in membranes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Murase et al., 2004</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heinemann et al., 2013</xref>) and that it impacts the behavior of phase-separated membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Honigmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu and Fletcher, 2006</xref>). The important role of myosin is further supported by recent theoretical and in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gowrishankar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Köster et al., 2016</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that cortical actomyosin contractility may be a generic model for eukaryotic organisms not only to control their mechanical stability and shape but also to quickly and actively control the lateral lipid and protein organization at the cell membrane.</p><p>In our MACs that were combined with ternary lipid mixtures, we found that binding of actin filaments to a homogeneous bilayer at temperatures above Tm-induced spatial alignment of L<sub>o</sub> domains to actin-bound locations upon cooling below Tm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Here, actin filaments serve as nucleation sites for domain formation and drive their lateral spatial distribution. Already phase separated, we could show that membrane domains reorganized with the adhesion of actin filaments depending on line tension and actin filament density. We further give direct evidence that the dynamic reorganization of actin filaments by myosin motors actively changes the macroscopic organization of membrane domains in our reconstituted phase-separated lipid bilayers and monolayers. We propose that the transition energy between the L<sub>d</sub> and L<sub>o</sub> phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">García-Sáez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Honerkamp-Smith et al., 2008</xref>) enabled the lipid anchored actin filaments to exert lateral forces on the phase boundaries leading to a macroscopic motion of lipid domains that eventually resulted in splitting, fusion or deformation of the lipid domains and in their overall change in number during and after the actomyosin contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>, right panels; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">8</xref>). In a model, we would first consider a biotinylated lipid that is dragged by an actomyosin filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The actomyosin filaments are unequally associated with the lipid phases (L<sub>o</sub> and L<sub>d</sub>) with different viscosities. The drag is counteracted by friction and, through the different viscosities, leads to domain deformation and rearrangement. Here, the force propagation would be independent of phase boundaries. As a second consideration, the biotinylated lipid would need to overcome the transition barrier between phases while being dragged over a boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Since our contraction experiments primarily showed that the boundaries deformed locally at actin filament sites and that actomyosin foci formed at the vicinity of phase boundaries, the high transition energy is favored as the dictating driving force for phase deformation. Furthermore, domain deformation was commonly found to happen when actin filaments were dragged over the L<sub>d</sub> phase that impedes the free contraction process through the strong partitioning preference of DSPE-PEG(2000)-Biotin to the L<sub>o</sub> phase.</p><p>With an estimated line tension of 1 pN for a 1:2:1 DOPC:DPPC:Cholesterol membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">García-Sáez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kuzmin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Veatch and Keller, 2005</xref>) and a reported value of ~1.5 k<sub>B</sub>T for the transfer of DPPC between phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Veatch et al., 2004</xref>), the energy for one DPPC molecule to transition is roughly sixfold higher than the energy that is needed to elongate the phase boundary by 1 nm. Further experiments should elaborate on the physical model since actomyosin contraction is clearly a non-equilibrium process and line tension itself was reported to depend on the applied lateral tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akimov et al., 2007</xref>). Together with our experimental findings, we can conclude that actively rearranging actin filaments will lead to an extensive deformation of membrane domains through the physical link with a small subset of membrane constituents. A plausible mechanism is therefore apparent that explains active lateral rearrangements of membrane components by actomyosin contractions without the need of binding directly to actin filaments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Actin labeling and polymerization</title><p>F-actin preparation was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vogel et al.

Note that all protein solutions or other solutions are applied directly to the liquid subphase by dipping the pipette tip through the monolayer. Next, the subphase was washed five times with buffer (100 μl steps) to remove unbound neutravidin. Subsequently, 20 μl of Alexa-488-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments (2 μM) was added to the subphase and incubated for at least 60 min, since binding of actin filaments to the interface was assumed to occur relatively slowly. When the binding of the actin filaments was confirmed by imaging, the monolayer was thoroughly washed (7 to 10 steps of 100 μl) with reaction buffer containing 1 μM ATP and 100 μl of myofilaments (0.3 μM) containing 1 μM ATP (enzymatically regenerated see above) was added to the subphase twice. The sample was sealed by a glass cover slide with grease to avoid subphase evaporation, allowing for long sample observation. The lipid monolayer MAC system started to contract after a few minutes of incubation, resulting in the formation of actomyosin clusters and deformation of the lipid domains.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for the financial support by the Daimler und Benz foundation (Project Grant PSBioc8216), the

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, Aurelien Roux (Reviewer #1) and Matthieu Piel (Reviewer #2), and the evaluation has been overseen by Mohan Balasubramanian as the Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor.</p><p>As you will see, the expert referees have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted a series of comments that we request you respond to before we reach a binding decision. The Editor and reviewers request that you address the issue of novelty and the additional experiments they deem essential to elevate this work to the level of an Advance. Please indicate exactly how you propose to proceed and provide an estimate of the time it will take to complete this work. The Editor and the reviewers will then confer and make a recommendation.</p><p>The referees appreciated your study on the control of lipid domain organization by the actomyosin cortex. In particular, the referees found that the conclusion that an actomyosin network bound to specific lipids can reorganize lipid domains not bound to such an actomyosin network interesting. They also appreciated the physical model presented in the manuscript. However, it was felt that there were three major issues with the results and the model proposed in this manuscript, which required significant revisions (experiments, rewriting, proper citation of the literature).</p><p>Please find below consolidated comments from the referees, following discussion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Many of the results have been already published by other groups. I am not against publication of results similar or identical to the ones already published (by other groups of course) as I think documented reproducibility is essential, and usually rare in our publication system. But there must be at least either some new, unreported facts, or a different analysis proposing a different mechanism. The selectivity of the phase, and the nucleation of lipids domains by actin filaments have already been reported, with very similar in vitro conditions by Honigmann et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2014. The remodeling of lipid domains by active actomyosin network, in particular domain splitting and size selection, have been reported by Koster et al. PNAS 2016. In this manuscript, the monolayer experiments and the model proposed in the Discussion could be the new parts when compared to previous publications, but I am not (yet) convinced that the monolayer system can be easily compared to the supported bilayer (see point 3), nor that the model is supported by experimental data (see point 2). I am thus balanced on this point, as I think that a further effort form the author's on showing their point could revert my opinion.</p><p>2) Line tension and the model. I am a bit confused by the proposal of the author. If I understood well, the authors propose that the higher the line tension is, the more energy (pulling force) is necessary to induce the phase transition, which explains why the contour length is changing more for higher temperatures (lower line tension). However, I don't see which experiments or analysis in this manuscript allow to discriminate the author's hypothesis from the one of Koster et al. PNAS 2016 in which the active forces of the actomyosin allow domain splitting and domain fusion.</p><p>In fact, the authors report here size selection of domains, which was also reported by Koster et al., which proposed that small domains would preferentially fuse, and large domains would be preferentially broken, leading to a quite narrow range of sizes. Moreover, this manuscript also reports domain splitting and fusion, consistently with Koster et al. hypothesis. Finally, in Koster et al. study, increased line tension leads to lower remodeling, as it counteracts both domain splitting and domain fusion, which could explain the lower contour length increase when line tension is higher, as observed by the authors. But I don't really understand how size selection would work with the author's model that active pulling triggers a phase transition of lipids.</p><p>In short, all observations made by Koster et al. are consistent with pure remodeling of the domains, without phase transition, and all the observations are reproduced by the authors. However, I cannot see an experimental result that can discriminate between the two hypotheses, and/or prove their model right.</p><p>In Koster et al., a very convincing point is that the total area of the two phases do not change upon actomyosin addition, supporting the hypothesis of Koster et al. that actomyosin only remodel the lipid domains, and does not change the proportion of each lipid phase. This analysis lacks here, and would indeed be essential for proving the point of the authors: if actomyosin was inducing a lipid phase transition, one would expect the total area of the 2 phases (or the surface ratio of the two phases, L<sub>o</sub> and L<sub>d</sub>) to change upon actomyosin addition. I guess this analysis should be quite straight forward to do in the authors' experimental and should be conducted.</p><p>3) The monolayer assay. First, as said by the authors in the text, but not detailed (only the Materials and methods) the conditions used here are fairly different. Instead of a mix DOPC, DPPC and chol as in the bilayer assay, they used C16 shingomyelin, DOPC and chol in very different proportions than DOPC/DPPC/chol. As the chemical interactions between cholesterol and sphingomyelin that participate in phase segregation are very different from the simple, entropy driven, mechanism of DOPC/DPPC separation, I wonder how the two systems can be compared. In fact, the authors see that their lipid-actin linker (DSPE and neutravidin) do not segregate the same than in the supported bilayer assay, supporting my opinion that these two systems cannot be compared easily.</p><p>I think it would be essential to perform either the supported bilayer assay with DOPC/Shingo/Chol or the monolayer assay with DOPC/DPPC/Chol. Also in this assay, it would be very interesting to test the authors' model by following the lateral pressure within the monolayer (which can be easily done in these Langmuir films), as the phase transition proposed by the authors should lead to increased pressure. Of course, appropriate controls would also be needed (in particular actin on non-phase separated membranes, as binding of actin to membrane is also expected to act on lipid pressure).</p><p>However, measuring the lateral pressure may not reach a clear conclusion on whether actomyosin leads to a phase transition or just lipid domain remodeling. In monolayers at the water/air interface, it is not clear how densely packed the lipids are. Usually in those monolayer assays, it is very difficult to reach the same tight packing than in a bilayer, and a change of total area of each phase can be the result of a phase transition, or compaction/extension of the lipids within a phase without phase transition. Even if evolution of pressure with phase transition is easily understood for system with one lipid, with such complex system the interpretation may reveal itself difficult. And because the total area covered by each phase depends on the lipid packing, the total area analysis proposed above for the supported bilayer may give non-reliable results for the monolayer.</p><p>Thus, the monolayer assay, which is probably the newest assay in this manuscript, seems to me having intrinsic flaws for testing the authors' model. The model itself, even if very original and interesting, lacks experimental support at this point, and all other findings reported in this manuscript are consistent with previously published results and models.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24350.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Many of the results have been already published by other groups.

I am thus balanced on this point, as I think that a further effort form the author's on showing their point could revert my opinion.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer(s) for this argument, which gives us the opportunity to better emphasize the particular aspects of novelty of our study with respect to the related works by Koster et al. PNAS 2016 and Honigmann et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2014.</p><p>Most importantly, our study provides, for the very first time, a direct visualization of lipid domain fission, fusion and movements during actomyosin contractions. Although this has been proposed to occur previously and has been indirectly inferred from the experiments by Koster et al., there has not been any data provided showing the process in real time under controlled temperature conditions. Second, our study presents a technical advance in combining the minimal actin cortices (MACs) with a lipid monolayer system.</p><p>The article of Koster et al. deals with a different question and touches upon the issue of phase-separated membranes with a single paragraph and figure only. Neither the main manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> page 7) nor the Supporting Information (Figure S5 (page 8) and movie S5) presents a direct visualization of fission, fusion and directed movement of lipid domains. Koster et al. discussed (page 6, lower right) a decrease in the net area of L<sub>o</sub> domains in the presence of a remodeling actomyosin network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> page 7). It is here that they very briefly hypothesized net area domain reduction (page 7 upper left) as follows: “This is likely to be due to a loss of small domains […] by the local remodeling of the actomyosin network in combination with a cessation in growth of larger domains”. In the main body of the article, events such as lipid domain fission, fusion and movements (which we consider our most relevant experimental results) were neither mentioned nor directly visualized.</p><p>Honigmann et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2014, on the other hand, did not report on any actomyosin induced active phase remodeling process, as it deals with static actin filaments. The only changes induced here were temperature changes along the phase diagram of the membrane.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for appreciating the combination of the MAC with the monolayer system as a new technical advance. Yet, it was not our intention to employ the lipid monolayer for a quantitative comparison with the supported bilayer system, as this would be hardly possible due to its different nature. We introduced it to minimize friction effects induced by the solid support that could counterbalance the forces induced by the active MAC. Its successful introduction furthermore emphasizes the wide applicability of the MAC system in different lipid assays. We could make use of the difference in actin filament binding to the liquid extended (disordered) L<sub>e</sub> phase. In low and medium MACs on monolayers, actin filaments close to the phase boundaries align to the circular shape of the liquid condensed (ordered) L<sub>c</sub> domains because line tension dominates over the actin filament wetting at the phase boundary. Although, again, a quantitative comparison between the supported lipid bilayers and the lipid monolayer was not our intention, we emphasize that we were able to directly visualize lipid domain deformations upon actomyosin contraction in both systems.</p><p><italic>2) Line tension and the model. I am a bit confused by the proposal of the author. If I understood well, the authors propose that the higher the line tension is, the more energy (pulling force) is necessary to induce the phase transition, which explains why the contour length is changing more for higher temperatures (lower line tension).</italic> </p><p>To make the model more clear we changed the scheme of the model accordingly (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>We changed the Discussion part accordingly:</p><p>“In a model we would first consider a biotinylated lipid that is dragged by an actomyosin filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). […] Further experiments should elaborate on the physical model since actomyosin contraction is clearly a non-equilibrium process and line tension itself was reported to depend on the applied lateral tension (Akimov et al., 2007).”</p><p><italic>However, I don't see which experiments or analysis in this manuscript allow to discriminate the author's hypothesis from the one of Koster et al. PNAS 2016 in which the active forces of the actomyosin allow domain splitting and domain fusion.</italic> </p><p><italic>In fact, the authors report here size selection of domains, which was also reported by Koster et al., which proposed that small domains would preferentially fuse, and large domains would be preferentially broken, leading to a quite narrow range of sizes. Moreover, this manuscript also reports domain splitting and fusion, consistently with Koster et al. hypothesis.</italic> </p><p>In contrast to Koster et al. we found for two different lipid mixtures that the area of the L<sub>o</sub> phase remained constant over the course of actomyosin contraction. Two graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>, left panels) have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (see more detailed answers below).</p><p><italic>Finally, in Koster et al. study, increased line tension leads to lower remodeling, as it counteracts both domain splitting and domain fusion, which could explain the lower contour length increase when line tension is higher, as observed by the authors. But I don't really understand how size selection would work with the author's model that active pulling triggers a phase transition of lipids.</italic> </p><p>We changed the Discussion part accordingly (see answers above).</p><p><italic>In short, all observations made by Koster et al. are consistent with pure remodeling of the domains, without phase transition, and all the observations are reproduced by the authors. However, I cannot see an experimental result that can discriminate between the two hypotheses, and/or prove their model right.</italic> </p><p><italic>In Koster et al., a very convincing point is that the total area of the two phases do not change upon actomyosin addition, supporting the hypothesis of Koster et al. that actomyosin only remodel the lipid domains, and does not change the proportion of each lipid phase. This analysis lacks here, and would indeed be essential for proving the point of the authors: if actomyosin was inducing a lipid phase transition, one would expect the total area of the 2 phases (or the surface ratio of the two phases, L<sub>o</sub> and L<sub>d</sub>) to change upon actomyosin addition. I guess this analysis should be quite straight forward to do in the authors' experimental and should be conducted.</italic> </p><p>We performed the analysis of the changes in net domain area for both used lipid mixtures (1:2:1 DOPC:DPPC:Cholesterol and 3:3:1 DOPC:PSM:Cholesterol). We found for both mixtures that the area of the L<sub>o</sub> phase remained constant over the course of actomyosin contraction. Two graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>, left panels) have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In contrast to the work of Koster et al., we performed the analysis on two different lipid mixtures and did not observe a decrease of the total L<sub>o</sub> phase domain area in neither of the lipid mixtures.</p><p>We revised the text in the Results part accordingly:</p><p>“For both mixtures the area of the L<sub>o</sub> phase remained constant over the course of actomyosin contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>, left panels). […] In contrast to their work we did not observe a decrease of the total L<sub>o</sub> phase domain area in neither of the lipid mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>, left panels).”</p><p><italic>3) The monolayer assay. First, as said by the authors in the text, but not detailed (only the Materials and methods) the conditions used here are fairly different. Instead of a mix DOPC, DPPC and chol as in the bilayer assay, they used C16 shingomyelin, DOPC and chol in very different proportions than DOPC/DPPC/chol. As the chemical interactions between cholesterol and sphingomyelin that participate in phase segregation are very different from the simple, entropy driven, mechanism of DOPC/DPPC separation, I wonder how the two systems can be compared. In fact, the authors see that their lipid-actin linker (DSPE and neutravidin) do not segregate the same than in the supported bilayer assay, supporting my opinion that these two systems cannot be compared easily.</italic> </p><p><italic>I think it would be essential to perform either the supported bilayer assay with DOPC/Shingo/Chol or the monolayer assay with DOPC/DPPC/Chol.</italic> </p><p>We performed the suggested experiments with the two lipid mixtures for the lipid bilayer and lipid monolayer systems. The results of the new lipid mixture for the supported lipid bilayer (SLB) system (3:3:1 DOPC:PSM:Cholesterol) were added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Videos 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">7</xref>). For both lipid mixtures we directly visualized various shape changes of lipid domains upon actomyosin contractions indicating the general validity of our experimental findings. For both lipid mixtures the net area of the L<sub>o</sub> phase remained constant (see above; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>, left panels).</p><p>We revised the text in the Results part accordingly:</p><p>“For studying the effects of myofilament induced actin rearrangements we prepared two lipid mixtures for lipid mono- and bilayer experiments, namely DOPC, DPPC and Cholesterol in a 1:2:1 molar ratio and DOPC, PSM and Cholesterol in a 3:3:1 molar ratio containing 0.1 or 1 mol% DSPE-PEG(2000)-Biotin DSPE (see Materials and methods[…] In summary, we showed active lateral reorganization of lipid domains for two different lipid mixtures, indicating the general validity of our experimental observations.”</p><p>In addition, we also performed new experiments with the lipid monolayer system using the 1:2:1 DOPC:DPPC:Cholesterol lipid mixture herewith using the same lipid mixtures as for the SLB system. Also in the additional lipid mixture we found that contrary to SLB system, actin filaments preferentially bind to the liquid extended (disordered) (L<sub>e</sub>) phase where also the neutravidin anchor protein mainly partitioned to (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1A-D</xref>). We observed that in both systems actin filaments close to the phase boundaries align to the circular shape of the L<sub>c</sub> domains indicating that the line tension energy dominates over the actin filament wetting energy at the phase boundary (see Author response image 1AD and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> 13 in the revised manuscript). In both lipid mixtures the actomyosin contractions led to shape changes and rearrangement of the L<sub>c</sub> domains including fusion and stretching events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>). We implemented a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) to the revised manuscript emphasizing the domain shape changes and fusing events in the lipid monolayer system during actomyosin contraction. Since the additional lipid mixture did not add new qualitative information to the monolayer system we decided not to include the new results in the revised manuscript, yet the data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><p>We revised the text in the Results part accordingly:</p><p>“Contrary to the situation in the SLB system, actin filaments preferentially bind to the liquid extended (disordered) (L<sub>e</sub>) phase where also the neutravidin anchor protein mainly partitioned to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-D</xref>). We observed this behavior for both lipid mixtures that were also used for the SLBs (see Materials and methods) […] The addition of myosin filaments in the presence of ATP led to the contraction of the actin layer deforming and rearranging the L<sub>c</sub> domains in both lipid mixtures similar to what we observed in the SLB systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>). The shape changes included fusion and stretching of the L<sub>c</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>).”<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24350.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Confocal Spinning Disk images of the additional lipid monolayer mixture (1:2:1 DOPC:DPPC:Cholesterol).</title><p>Actin filaments close to the phase boundaries align to the circular shape of the liquid condensed (ordered) L<sub>c</sub> domains because the line tension energy dominates over the actin filament wetting energy at the phase boundary.

Of course, appropriate controls would also be needed (in particular actin on non-phase separated membranes, as binding of actin to membrane is also expected to act on lipid pressure).</italic> </p><p><italic>However, measuring the lateral pressure may not reach a clear conclusion on whether actomyosin leads to a phase transition or just lipid domain remodeling. In monolayers at the water/air interface, it is not clear how densely packed the lipids are. Usually in those monolayer assays, it is very difficult to reach the same tight packing than in a bilayer, and a change of total area of each phase can be the result of a phase transition, or compaction/extension of the lipids within a phase without phase transition. Even if evolution of pressure with phase transition is easily understood for system with one lipid, with such complex system the interpretation may reveal itself difficult. And because the total area covered by each phase depends on the lipid packing, the total area analysis proposed above for the supported bilayer may give non-reliable results for the monolayer.</italic> </p><p><italic>Thus, the monolayer assay, which is probably the newest assay in this manuscript, seems to me having intrinsic flaws for testing the authors' model. The model itself, even if very original and interesting, lacks experimental support at this point, and all other findings reported in this manuscript are consistent with previously published results and models.</italic> </p><p>We agree that a thorough study on the influence of lipid packing on the domain modulation by actin reorganization would be highly interesting. However, as correctly pointed out, this may be difficult to interpret and is beyond the scope of this article. The monolayer assay was introduced for qualitative comparison without the influence of friction and not as a better test bed for the model.</p></body></sub-article></article>
