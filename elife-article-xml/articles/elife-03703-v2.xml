However, selecting improved variants from gene libraries in living cells requires plasmid expression systems that suffer from variable copy number effects, or the use of complex marker-dependent chromosomal integration strategies. We developed quantitative gene assembly and DNA library insertion into the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genome by optimizing an efficient single-step and marker-free genome editing system using CRISPR-Cas9. With this Multiplex CRISPR (CRISPRm) system, we selected an improved cellobiose utilization pathway in diploid yeast in a single round of mutagenesis and selection, which increased cellobiose fermentation rates by over 10-fold. Mutations recovered in the best cellodextrin transporters reveal synergy between substrate binding and transporter dynamics, and demonstrate the power of CRISPRm to accelerate selection experiments and discoveries of the molecular determinants that enhance biomolecule function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03703.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03703.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03703.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Over the course of billions of years, natural evolution has produced new proteins and adapted existing ones so that they work better. Scientists have learned how to use the principles that underlie evolution to similarly engineer proteins in the laboratory. This process, known as directed evolution, is a powerful tool for improving how proteins function. Directed evolution normally involves mutating the gene that encodes the protein of interest, selecting the genes that produce the most promising proteins for another round of mutation, and repeating the process until the desired protein function is achieved.</p><p>In the first step of directed evolution, a gene is usually mutated randomly in order to create a large ‘library’ of different forms of the gene. These are joined to circular pieces of DNA known as plasmids that can replicate themselves inside cells. However, the number of plasmids than can be taken up differs from cell to cell. This complicates experiments, and the ideal directed evolution experiment would have the same number of plasmids, or target genes, being delivered into each cell.</p><p>Ryan et al. have developed a new method for performing directed evolution experiments that uses a recently developed technique called the CRISPR-Cas9 system. This can make direct changes to a DNA strand such as inserting or deleting specific sequences that code for proteins. Ryan et al. used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to create multiple DNA breaks simultaneously across the genome of yeast cells, and joined ‘barcoded’ DNA or DNA for intact genes to these breaks. This avoids the need to use plasmids to introduce foreign DNA into cells. Ryan et al. have named this method the Multiplex CRISPR (or CRISPRm) system.</p><p>Having established CRISPRm, Ryan et al. tested whether it could be used to engineer improved proteins by attempting to modify a transporter protein called CDT-1. This protein transports the sugar cellobiose into yeast cells, where it can be converted into alcohol by fermentation. This is important for making biofuel from plants. After just one round of directed evolution using CRISPRm, Ryan et al. successfully isolated a form of the CDT-1 protein that increased the rate of fermentation over 10-fold; hence this CDT-1 variant could be used to increase biofuel production.</p><p>In the future, it will be important to implement multiple selection rounds with CRISPRm, and to test how large the DNA libraries can be for directed evolution. In time, CRISPRm could find use in evolving and engineering different combinations of genes, metabolic pathways, and possibly entire genomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03703.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03703.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>directed evolution</kwd><kwd>chromosome</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>Cas9</kwd><kwd>genome editing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Energy Biosciences Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>Owen W</given-names></name><name><surname>Skerker</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name><name><surname>Maurer</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>Jordan C</given-names></name><name><surname>Poddar</surname><given-names>Snigdha</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Michael E</given-names></name><name><surname>DeLoache</surname><given-names>Will</given-names></name><name><surname>Dueber</surname><given-names>John E</given-names></name><name><surname>Arkin</surname><given-names>Adam P</given-names></name><name><surname>Cate</surname><given-names>Jamie HD</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An optimized CRISPR-Cas9 system enables multiplexed genome engineering for evolving biomolecules and pathways from chromosomally integrated DNA libraries.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Directed evolution using living systems allows selections for improved biomolecule function to be directly coupled to phenotype. However, present directed evolution systems require the use of extrachromosomal gene libraries encoded in bacteriophage or plasmids, which suffer from high levels of copy number variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yokobayashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Turner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Esvelt et al., 2011</xref>). For example, in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, common yeast centromere containing (CEN) plasmids vary widely in copy number per cell resulting in highly variable expression levels from cell to cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Ideally, the selective pressure applied to evolve improved or new biomolecule function should be limited to the DNA sequence level and not to gene copy number in a given cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). To overcome copy number variation in yeast, the standard genetic tool of integrating linear DNA into the genome by homologous recombination is too inefficient to insert DNA libraries without multiple steps that rely on dominant selectable markers for chromosomal integrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wingler and Cornish, 2011</xref>) or specialized strain backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">DiCarlo et al., 2013a</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03703.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparing noise in plasmid and genomic expression of two fluorescent proteins.</title><p>Proteins mRuby2 (false-colored red) and Venus (false-colored green) were expressed in the same cell with a strong, <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub> promoter.

Genome editing CRISPR-Cas systems require a Cas9 endonuclease that is targeted to specific DNA sequences by a non-coding single guide RNA (sgRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jinek, et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jinek et al., 2014</xref>). The Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complex precisely generates double-strand breaks (DSBs) in eukaryotic genomes at sites specified by a 20-nucleotide guide sequence at the 5′ end of the sgRNA that base pairs with the protospacer DNA sequence preceding a genomic protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sternberg et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of the Cas9-produced DSB in genomic DNA can increase the rate of homology-directed repair (HDR) with linear DNA at the DSB locus by several 1000-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Storici et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">DiCarlo et al., 2013b</xref>) potentially enabling high-throughput experimental methods. CRISPR-Cas9 could therefore be useful in probing industrial <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains, which are more robust compared to laboratory strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerr and Service, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farrell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rubin, 2008</xref>), but for which few genetic tools are available, due to the fact that these strains are often polyploid with low-efficiency mating and sporulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To optimize the efficiency of HDR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mediated by Cas9, we first constructed a plasmid expressing <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 fused to a nuclear localization signal (Cas9-NLS) that efficiently localizes to the nucleus of yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>). We used an intermediate strength promoter, <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>RNR2</italic></sub>, to express Cas9 for genome targeting experiments, because Cas9 (Cas9-NLS-His8x) expression from the <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>RNR</italic>2</sub> promoter resulted in yeast strains with near wild type fitness whereas Cas9 expressed using strong yeast promoters such as <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2013</xref>) reduced yeast fitness relative to wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Second, we designed a new sgRNA architecture in order to improve its expression and function. Cellular levels of sgRNAs correlate with the efficiency of Cas9-mediated genome targeting in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>). Controlled expression of nuclear-localized RNAs and the correlation between sgRNA levels and Cas9-editing in yeast has not been explored. To better control cellular levels of correctly folded sgRNA, we developed a modular design by fusing the sgRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mali et al., 2013a</xref>) to the 3′ end of the self-cleaving hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Webb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We reasoned that the structured ribozyme would protect the 5′ end of the sgRNA from 5′ exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Houseley and Tollervey, 2009</xref>). Additionally, the HDV ribozyme would cleave the RNA immediately 5′ of the ribozyme, removing extraneous RNA sequences and allowing flexibility in which promoters can be used, such as tRNAs whose DNA sequences also serve as RNA polymerase III promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marck et al., 2006</xref>). Ribozyme removal of the tRNA would then separate transcription initiation from within the tRNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marck et al., 2006</xref>) and tRNA nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Köhler and Hurt, 2007</xref>) from the process of forming functional sgRNA complexes with Cas9.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03703.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The engineered CRISPRm platform.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cas9 construct used for nuclear localization experiments.

The linear dsDNA, which contains a unique 20-mer barcode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>) flanked by common primer sequences and 50 base pairs of DNA homologous to the regions proximal to the PAM motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), acts as a template for DNA repair by HDR, resulting in a unique markerless and barcoded insertion allele.

We simultaneously targeted two and three unlinked genomic loci in diploid cells for loss-of-function mutagenesis by introducing a single plasmid expressing Cas9 and two or three sgRNAs with two or three gene-specific barcoded DNA molecules, respectively. The efficiency of duplex and triplex targeting (requiring four and six chromosome cuts, respectively) with two sgRNAs (<italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>LYP1)</italic> or three (<italic>URA3</italic>, <italic>LYP1</italic> and <italic>COX10</italic>) was 43% and 19%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). This multiplexed efficiency was dependent on the presence of the HDV ribozyme 5′ of the guide sequence as duplex targeting dropped to 3.5% in cells with sgRNA lacking the 5′ HDV ribozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).

These experiments demonstrate that our multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 system, which we term CRISPRm, is powerful enough to generate multiple marker-free targeted mutations in the yeast genome in a single experiment and that the 5′ tRNA-HDV ribozyme sequence is required for higher order multiplex targeting.</p><p>Having established CRISPRm for <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-multiplex targeting, we next tested its capabilities in engineering genes and pathways integrated in the yeast genome. We first tested whether CRISPRm could be used to assemble foreign genes as chromosomal integrations. We tested the efficiency of in vivo assembly of a functional nourseothricin-resistance (Nat<sup>R</sup>) gene from three overlapping PCR products encoding a transcription promoter, protein open reading frame (ORF) and transcription terminator at a single locus using <italic>cis</italic>-multiplexing in the diploid S288C strain. The efficiency of Cas9-mediated integration and assembly of these three DNA fragments to the correct (<italic>URA3</italic>) locus was measured by a combination of 5-fluoroorotic acid resistance (5-FOA<sup>R</sup>) and Nat<sup>R</sup>. We found 85% efficiency of targeting and assembly in both copies of the <italic>URA3</italic> locus in diploid yeast S288C cells, and 70% in polyploid ATCC4124 by using the tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> sequence as the sgRNA promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), whereas <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>SNR52</italic></sub>-dependent targeting was weaker in S288C cells and non-existent in ATCC4124 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Thus, CRISPRm enables the one-step markerless assembly of functional genes from multiple fragments into the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome, resulting in homozygous insertions into both diploid and polyploid yeast strains.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether CRISPRm could be used for in vivo selections of improved protein function. We targeted a cellodextrin utilization pathway from the cellulolytic fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, comprised of the cellodextrin transporter (<italic>cdt-1</italic>) and an intracellular β-glucosidase (<italic>gh1-1</italic>), to assemble in vivo in diploid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In combination, these two genes result in yeast cells capable of consuming the disaccharide cellobiose, which could be used to improve biofuel production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Galazka et al., 2010</xref>). To select for improved cellobiose utilizing strains we used error-prone PCR to amplify the <italic>cdt-1</italic> gene. We co-transformed the library of mutated <italic>cdt-1</italic> alleles, along with overlapping dsDNA fragments for the promoter and terminator, for assembly and integration into the <italic>URA3</italic> locus (<italic>ura3</italic>::<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>PGK1</italic></sub><italic>-cdt-1-T</italic><sub><italic>ADH1</italic></sub> library) of a diploid strain with a previously integrated β-glucosidase <italic>gh1-1</italic> gene (<italic>lyp1</italic>::<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub><italic>-gh1-1-T</italic><sub><italic>CYC1</italic></sub>) using CRISPRm. We then grew the transformants in medium containing cellobiose as the sole carbon source to select for functional <italic>cdt-1</italic> alleles and identified one strain with 2.6-fold (homozygous <italic>cdt-1</italic> N209S/I354N/S360P/T406S/W531L allele) and one strain with 1.7-fold (homozygous <italic>cdt-1</italic> Q45H/F262Y/F533Y allele) increased cellobiose utilization capacity over wild type <italic>cdt-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The mutations were mapped in CDT-1 onto structures of the homologous major facilitator superfamily (MFS) hexose-like transporters XylE from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sun et al., 2012</xref>) and GlcP from <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iancu et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Notably, one site maps to a site that likely interacts directly with the sugar substrate (N209S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Whereas two mutations in the second allele (Q45H, F533Y) map to non-conserved regions of the transporters, one (F262Y) maps to a site immediately adjacent to the nearly universally-conserved PESPR motif in hexose transporters that is involved in transporter dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the mutation from phenylalanine to tyrosine results in an expanded motif (PESPRY) that is present in all of the major hexose transporters in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We then used CRISPRm to introduce the N209S mutation (nucleotide G626A) in the <italic>cdt-1</italic><sup><italic>Q45H/F262Y/F533Y</italic></sup> diploid yeast background. The quadruple mutant <italic>cdt-1</italic> allele resulted in synergistic cellobiose utilization with 3.9-fold increased growth over strains expressing wild-type <italic>cdt-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Although we selected for improved protein function, as suggested by the location of the mutations in CDT-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), it is also possible that selection enriched for sequences that confer improved mRNA stability or translation efficiency, due to the fact that the selection was carried out in vivo. Future experiments will be needed to distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>CRISPRm could be used to integrate DNA libraries to interrogate <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements such as transcription promoters, 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs and 3′-UTRs) in mRNAs, or riboswitches. CRISPRm enables these types of experiments because it allows for near quantitative integration of DNA libraries, which can be a single fragment or complex assemblies of multiple fragments. This could enable integration and selection of multi-gene pathways, or specific mutation and selection of subsets of a protein or multiple DNA-encoded functions.</p><p>The ability to use chromosomally-integrated DNA libraries removes a key limitation in in vivo selection experiments by eliminating biomolecule expression variation due to variable plasmid copy numbers. Although we used a relatively small library size in the present experiments, even in this small library we observed impressive gains in transporter function. We observed 2–3 mutations per kilobase in the selected transporter genes, resulting in 3–5 amino acid substitutions per transporter. We were then able to combine the mutations in a single transporter with superior fermentation performance. Library sizes introduced by CRISPRm should be scalable to the limits of transformation efficiency, to 10<sup>7</sup> or larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kawai et al., 2010</xref>). CRISPRm should also enable multiple rounds of selection for directed evolution experiments. We envision that each cycle would involve error-prone PCR of the gene of interest, either from a starting sequence or an enriched and improved cell population, followed by CRISPRm-mediated integration of the amplified gene and selection. This cycle would compare favorably with that required for plasmid-based selections, yet would avoid the problem of plasmid copy number variation. CRISPRm should also be adaptable to screens that rely on sorting large populations of cells, that is by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. We envision that CRISPRm could improve the discovery of human therapeutics by yeast display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krugel et al., 1988</xref>), and could be used to map the importance of protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ovchinnikov et al., 2014</xref>) via multiplexed library insertion.</p><p>To achieve high efficiency multiplexing with CRISPRm, we found it was necessary to modify the sgRNA design by including a 5′ HDV ribozyme, and to assay multiple RNA polymerase III promoters for a given strain background. The ease of discovering tRNAs in any genome and the universality of the sgRNA construct means that, with few modifications, CRISPRm can be used directly in non-model fungal hosts, such as pathogens or organisms used in the biotechnology industry. The genetics of many of these organisms have not been studied in any depth due to the technological limitations of available genetic manipulation techniques. For example, industrial <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains are more stress tolerant and produce much higher yields of desired biofuel or renewable chemical end products than laboratory strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerr and Service, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farrell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rubin, 2008</xref>). However, linking genotypes of industrial yeasts to their phenotypes remains difficult. CRISPRm should serve as a rapid and high throughput means for connecting the genotypes of these organisms to their phenotypes, that is for generating marker-free barcoded alleles for large-scale pooled fitness studies of loss-of-function mutants in these organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>). In the future, CRISPRm may also be applicable to interrogating mammalian cells, if the levels of HDR are sufficiently high. Finally, the ability to use CRISPRm for multiplexed targeting paves the way for applying directed evolution to cellular pathways and genetic circuits for higher order synthetic biology applications in any host strain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning the pCAS plasmid backbone</title><p>Gibson Assembly Mastermix (E2611L) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>) was used to fuse the KANMX (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Yeastdeletionpages.com">Yeastdeletionpages.com</ext-link>) cassette to the pUC bacterial origin of replication from pESC-URA (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).

We identified 21 sequence variants across the nine <italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>LYP1</italic> targeted strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Whole genome sequencing was performed by the UC Davis Genome Center (Davis, CA) using the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, Hayward, CA) to produce 150 bp paired-end reads. The software package versions used for sequencing data analysis were as follows: BWA (v. 0.7.5ar405), Picard (v. 1.92[1464]), SAMtools (v. 0.1.19-44428cd) and the GATK (2.7-2-g6bda569). The S288C reference genome (v. R64-1-1, release date 3 Feb 2011) was obtained from the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://yeastgenome.org">yeastgenome.org</ext-link>) and prepared for use in sequencing data analysis with bwa index, CreateSequenceDictionary from Picard, and samtools faidx. Sequencing reads were processed with Scythe (v. 0.991) to remove adapter contamination and Sickle (v. 1.210) to trim low quality bases. Processed reads were mapped to the S288C reference genome using bwa mem with the—M option for picard and GATK compatibility. The mapped reads were sorted with SortSam and duplicate reads were marked with MarkDuplicates from Picard. Read alignments were refined by performing local realignment with the RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner walkers from the GATK on all samples collectively.</p><p>Variant detection for both SNPs and INDELs was performed with GATK's UnifiedGenotyper, with parameters adjusted for haploid genomes and no downsampling of coverage, for each sample independently. The resulting SNP and INDEL calls were filtered with the VariantFiltration walker from GATK (see header of the VCF file, supplemental VCF file, for details). A custom Perl script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) was written to identify all GG dinucleotide sequences in the S288C reference genome, extract every Cas9 target sequence (i.e., 20 nt sequence corresponding to the 20 nucleotides immediately 5′ of the ‘NGG’ PAM site), and obtain the genome coordinates ranging from 30 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the PAM site. Cas9 target sequences were added to VCF files as custom annotations using snpEff (v3.3h), and SnpSift (v3.3h) was used to extract desired fields into tables for analysis with a custom R script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Needleman–Wunsch global alignments between our guide sequences and Cas9 target sequences were performed using the pairwiseAlignment function (Biostrings package, Bioconductor) in R, with a substitution matrix of −1 for mismatches and 2 for matches, produced with the nucleotideSubstitutionMatrix function (Biostrings package, Bioconductor). The probability of there being a better match for the guide sequence to a given Cas9 target sequence was calculated as the frequency of Cas9 target sequences with better alignments to the same guide sequence, amongst 10,000 randomly selected Cas9 target sequences. To compile counts of all variants and various subclasses, a GATKReport was generated from the VCF files with GATK's VariantEval walker, read into R using the ‘gsalib’ library, and the desired categories were extracted with a custom R script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p>Without the repair DNA template required for HDR, the majority of mutations caused by Cas9 are expected to be INDELs, SNPs or MNPs that initiate within the protospacer sequence, which is the 20 nucleotide (nt) sequence 5′ of the PAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fu et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, for completeness, we searched for all PAM sites within 30 nt upstream and downstream for each of the 21 variants. We then compared the 20 nt <italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>LYP1</italic> guide sequences to the putative protospacer sequences within the regions flanking each variant. An end-to-end alignment identified 10 or fewer nucleotide matches between the <italic>URA3</italic> or <italic>LYP1</italic> guide sequences and the variant sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Cas9 requires at least 12 perfect base pair matches within the guide-target sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>) so it is highly unlikely that the <italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>LYP1</italic> guide sequences directed Cas9 to any of these potential protospacers that lie within variant sites. These mutations likely arose as natural variants during the course of the experiment.</p><p>As a second method to evaluate the likelihood of off-target mutations, we performed local alignments of our guide sequences to all Cas9 target sequences whose PAM site was within 30 nucleotides upstream and downstream of a detected variant, as well as to 10,000 randomly selected Cas9 target sequences from the genome. Since our guide sequences are expected to have a better match to 13% or more of all Cas9 target sequences (∼126,000 or more sites) than to the best matching Cas9 target sequence with a nearby variant, and the number of nucleotide matches in end-to-end alignments is at most 10, we argue that the variants identified in the genomes of <italic>URA3</italic>- and <italic>LYP1</italic>-targeted strains are unlikely the result of off-target Cas9 modifications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Anaerobic fermentations</title><p>Yeast strain colonies were inoculated in 20 ml of oMM (optimized minimal media) (Yuping Lin, personal communication) with 2% glucose in 50 ml Falcon tubes and grown aerobically at 30°C to saturation for 24 hr.

Although we do not request additional experiments to be performed, we would like to ask you to discuss these points in the revised version of manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their positive evaluation of our work. We will describe in more detail our changes to the main text below. We note here that we have changed the title in line with suggestions from the reviewers and <italic>eLife</italic> editors to be, “Selection of chromosomal DNA libraries using a multiplex CRISPR system.”</p><p><italic>1) In the “protein evolution” experiment, a single cycle of mutation was done and it is not clear how more complex selection procedures would be implemented</italic>.</p><p>We think there are many variations that could be envisioned. In the case of using error-prone PCR, subsequent iterations of selection would involve PCR amplification of the gene from the enriched cell population using error-prone conditions, followed by a new round of integration and selection. Each cycle would thus be:</p><p>A) Error-prone PCR amplification (either from starting plasmid or genomic DNA from cells of increased fitness isolated in the previous round).</p><p>B) CRISPRm-mediated integration of the amplicons.</p><p>C) Selection.</p><p>We have incorporated the envisioned cycle into the Discussion section, as described in our answer to major point 4, below.</p><p><italic>2) If mutated coding sequences conferring improved characteristics to the host strain were selected, the characterization of the cognate proteins has not been performed. Thus at this stage, it remains unclear whether protein activity, stability, localization or even mRNA translatability of stability was changed</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the underlying mechanism remains to be determined. We have added a statement to this effect, as a goal for future experiments, in the first paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>“Although we selected for improved protein function, as suggested by the location of the mutations in CDT-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), it is also possible that selection enriched for sequences that confer improved mRNA stability or translation efficiency, due to the fact that the selection was carried out <italic>in vivo</italic>. Future experiments will be needed to distinguish between these possibilities.”</p><p><italic>3) Also, the mutation rate resulting from the mutagenic PCR is unknown</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the optimal level of mutagenic PCR could be optimized in the future. We have added a statement addressing what we know about the mutation rate in our experiment, in the 3<sup>rd</sup> paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>We observed 2-3 mutations per kilobase in the selected transporter genes, resulting in 3-5 amino acid substitutions per transporter. We were then able to combine the mutations in a single transporter with superior fermentation performance.</p><p><italic>4) The screening of complex libraries will certainly require screening higher numbers of transformants by several orders of magnitude. (Only 1600 transformants screened here, is it meaningful?)</italic></p><p>We demonstrated a large improvement with a small library, which we would argue is a positive. Although the library size here was small, we were able to isolate in one experiment a better transporter than the entire field working on this problem had been able to achieve in the past 3-4 years. CRISPRm can be scaled simply by transforming more linear repair DNA. We believe that significant improvement within a single round of selection by using a relatively small library is a powerful proof-of-principle result. We did not want to find too many mutations to follow up as we are in an ultra-competitive CRISPR field. Obviously, increasing the scale and iterations of CRISPRm would yield more evolved proteins until one reaches an optimum. We therefore think that there is only upside potential to the approach with further optimization.</p><p>To address this point, we modified the Discussion as follows (see further our response to point 1 above):</p><p>“Although we used a relatively small library size in the present experiments, even in this small library we observed impressive gains in transporter function. Library sizes introduced by CRISPRm should be scalable to the limits of transformation efficiency, to 10<sup>7</sup> or larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kawai et al. 2010</xref>). CRISPRm should also enable multiple rounds of selection for directed evolution experiments. We envision that each cycle would involve error-prone PCR of the gene of interest, either from a starting sequence or an enriched and improved cell population, followed by CRISPRm-mediated integration of the amplified gene and selection. This cycle would compare favorably with that required for plasmid-based selections, yet would avoid the problem of plasmid copy number variation.”</p><p><italic>5) How will screening of very large numbers of transformants be achieved?</italic></p><p>The library size is scalable by transforming more linear DNA. We purposely kept it small so that we had a manageable number of improved mutants to follow up. We wanted a small library to demonstrate the efficiency. We note that the actual selection for improved transporters was carried out in small volumes of liquid media, which we think could easily be scaled up.</p></body></sub-article></article>
