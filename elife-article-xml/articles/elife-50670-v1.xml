rapidly reversible during embryonic development. This extends to the Hedgehog pathway, which primarily serves to counter GLI repression by processing GLI proteins into transcriptional activators. In investigating the mechanisms underlying GLI repression, we find that a subset of GLI binding regions, termed HH-responsive enhancers, specifically loses acetylation in the absence of HH signaling. These regions are highly enriched around HH target genes and primarily drive HH-specific transcriptional activity in the mouse limb bud. They also retain H3K27ac enrichment in limb buds devoid of GLI activator and repressor, indicating that their activity is primarily regulated by GLI repression. Furthermore, the Polycomb repression complex is not active at most of these regions, suggesting it is not a major mechanism of GLI repression. We propose a model for tissue-specific enhancer activity in which an HDAC-associated GLI repression complex regulates target genes by altering the acetylation status at enhancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hedgehog</kwd><kwd>transcriptional repression</kwd><kwd>GLI</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>limb bud</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD073151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Hongkai</given-names></name><name><surname>Vokes</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31DE027597</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lex</surname><given-names>Rachel K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006058</institution-id><institution>St. Baldrick's Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vokes</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HG009518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Hongkai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GLI3 represses Hedgehog target gene expression by regulating histone modifications at a subset of tissue-specific GLI-bound enhancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcriptional repressors are instrumental in establishing developmental lineages and preventing improper gene expression. Long-term repression is accompanied by stable modifications to DNA and chromatin that prevent rapid transcriptional changes. In contrast, transient repression is rapidly reversible, providing a mechanism for controlling gene activation during the dynamic process of embryogenesis. This control is especially important for spatially restricting gene expression until signal transduction mechanisms alleviate repressor activity. This is exemplified by the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, which ensures proper spatiotemporal regulation of its target genes through the coordination of bifunctional GLI proteins. Activation of HH signaling results in the processing of GLI proteins into transcriptional activators, which are otherwise proteolytically modified into truncated transcriptional repressors in the absence of HH ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harfe et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The importance of balancing opposing GLI functions is illustrated in the limb bud, where Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling alleviates GLI repression in a spatiotemporal manner to regulate growth of the digit-forming autopod. HH expression initiates in the posterior, distal limb, and forms a gradient along the posterior-anterior axis. Consequently, GLI activators are enriched in the posterior limb bud where many cells are exposed to HH ligands, while an inverse domain of GLI repressors in the anterior limb bud serve to spatially restrict the boundary of HH target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn and Joyner, 2004</xref>). The presence of both GLI activator and GLI repressor domains makes the limb bud an ideal model for understanding the roles of GLI proteins in regulating HH-responsive transcription.</p><p>Interestingly, the limb bud is primarily a GLI repressor-driven system, as most transcriptional targets do not actually require GLI activator for transcription, but can be activated by loss of GLI repressor alone. This property of de-repression rather than activation is exemplified by <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> limb buds (constitutive GLI repression, no GLI activation), which have a nearly complete absence of digits and a severe reduction in limb size. The phenotype is markedly improved in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup>;Gli3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> double mutants which lack SHH and the main transcriptional repressor, GLI3, and are therefore devoid of most or all GLI activity (both activation and repression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Litingtung et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">te Welscher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bowers et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, GLI de-repression is sufficient to activate most GLI target genes in the limb bud, suggesting that the primary role of the HH pathway is to alleviate GLI repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewandowski et al., 2015</xref>). The transient nature of GLI repression represents a key mechanism for the dynamic transcriptional regulation of HH targets as HH induction rapidly inactivates GLI repression, resulting in transcription of targets within 4–9 hr of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harfe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Panman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Visel et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms underlying GLI repression are unknown but could in principle function either by excluding GLI activator binding or by recruiting co-repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Although the former category provides an attractive model for how GLI proteins might interpret gradients of HH ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falkenstein and Vokes, 2014</xref>), it fails to account for the large number of GLI target genes that are fully activated upon de-repression in the absence of HH signaling, and likewise, GLI activator. In support of the latter category, several GLI co-repressors have been identified in various contexts, including Atrophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), Ski (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai et al., 2002</xref>) and tissue-specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oosterveen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>). Members of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex have also been shown to generally regulate GLI transcriptional responses but it is unclear if they specifically regulate GLI repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jagani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeon and Seong, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). Additional studies have described various interactions between Polycomb repression and HH signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wyngaarden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weiner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deimling et al., 2018</xref>), indicating the possibility that PRC2 mediates aspects of GLI repression. Since mutations in candidate repressor complexes are pleiotropic, it has been challenging to determine if they directly mediate GLI repression, a challenge compounded by the dual roles of GLI proteins as transcriptional activators and repressors.</p><p>Using a genomic approach and the developing limb as a model, we sought to determine if GLI proteins repress HH target genes through altering the chromatin environment at GLI binding regions (GBRs). We hypothesized that GLI repressors regulate gene expression by inactivating enhancers. Consistent with this, we find that GLI repression regulates enhancer modification status, and thus, activity through the de-acetylation of Histone H3K27. This repression occurs independently of Polycomb activity. Enhancers regulated in this fashion correspond to known GLI limb enhancers, are highly enriched around HH target genes, and primarily drive tissue-specific enhancer activity within HH-specific expression domains. Based on these findings, we propose that GLI repressors inhibit gene expression by altering enhancer activity, providing an explanation for the labile nature of GLI repression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A subset of GLI binding regions is epigenetically regulated by HH signaling</title><p>Since most HH targets can be activated by loss of GLI repression, we hypothesized that enhancers may be activated by HH signaling when GLI repression is relieved. To test this, we first identified active GLI enhancers in the developing limb at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5), when high levels of HH target gene expression are observed. We used an endogenously FLAG tagged <italic>Gli3</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopez-Rios et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lorberbaum et al., 2016</xref>) to identify GLI3 binding regions by ChIP-seq and then identified regions enriched for H3K27ac, a marker associated with active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heintzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cotney et al., 2012</xref>). Altogether we identified 7,282 endogenous GLI3 binding regions (GBRs), with the majority of regions enriched for H3K27ac (83%; 6,064/7,282 GBRs) in wild-type (WT) limb buds which have active HH signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Nearly all nuclear GLI3 is present in the anterior half of the limb bud in the repressor form with little or no nuclear GLI3 present in the posterior half, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1B</xref>). Therefore, the GBRs identified in this study are likely to exclusively represent GLI3-repressor binding regions.</p><p>Next, we asked if HH signaling was required for the activation of GLI enhancers by performing ChIP-seq for H3K27ac in <italic>Sonic hedgehog</italic> (<italic>Shh</italic>) null E10.5 forelimbs, prior to overt phenotypes in <italic>Shh</italic> nulls, and comparing H3K27ac enrichment to that in WT limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiang et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Since <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> forelimbs have constitutive GLI repression, we hypothesized that in the absence of HH signaling, GLI repressors may prevent activation of their enhancers. We found that most H3K27ac enriched regions were present in both WT and <italic>Shh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos (98.3%; 58,720/59,729 H3K27ac peaks); however a subset of 2,113 WT H3K27ac enriched regions had acetylation that was significantly reduced or completely lost in the absence of HH signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). We then asked whether those regions with reduced acetylation in the absence of HH signaling include GLI-bound enhancers by intersecting H3K27ac enrichment with the endogenous GBRs identified. We found that 94% of GBRs (5,715/6064 GBRs) with acetylation in WT limbs also retain H3K27ac in <italic>Shh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> limb buds, which we have termed Stable GBRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). GBRs that remain stably acetylated regardless of HH signaling likely function as active enhancers whose activity is not predominantly regulated by HH signaling. However, H3K27ac enrichment was reduced or lost in the absence of HH signaling in a smaller subset of GBRs, suggesting that GLI repressor may regulate the activity of this group of enhancers. Within this GBR class with HH-responsive acetylation, we identified populations of GBRs that had either significant reductions (termed HH-sensitive; n = 148) or a complete absence of H3K27ac enrichment (termed HH-dependent; n = 201) in <italic>Shh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> limb buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The latter two categories are henceforth collectively referred to as HH-responsive GBRs. As H3K27ac is not exclusively localized to enhancers, we also examined the enrichment of histone H3K4me1, a general marker of primed and active enhancers, at these GBRs using publicly available data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). In WT limb buds, 82% of HH-responsive GBRs are enriched for H3K4 mono-methylation, supporting that these regions are likely to act as enhancers (HH-sens: 123/148, 83%; HH-dep: 162/201, 81%).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hedgehog signaling regulates acetylation of H3K27 at a subset of GLI binding regions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pipeline for identifying different categories of GLI bound regions (GBRs).

Alternatively, GLI repressors could regulate H3K27ac specifically. To address the first mechanism, we asked if HH regulates H3K4me2, another histone modification enriched at active enhancers and most promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ernst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pekowska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with H3K4me2 being enriched at promoters and our finding that Stable GBRs are enriched around promoters, we find H3K4 di-methylation at 73% of Stable GBRs (4,172/5,715), while only 26% of HH-responsive GBRs (91/349) which are less enriched around promoters.

Since we found that most HH-responsive GBRs in wildtype limb buds are enriched for H3K4me1 (see results above), we asked if this mark was altered at HH-responsive GBRs in response to HH signaling. We performed ChIP on WT and <italic>Shh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> limb buds and assessed enrichment of H3K4me1 at several HH-responsive GBRs by quantitative PCR, selecting intergenic regions that would not overlap with promoters (regions are at least 7 kb from the nearest TSS).

Using ATAC-seq to measure regions of open chromatin, we compared the accessibility of GBRs between WT and <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> posterior limb buds, a fraction providing a more homogenous WT population of cells exposed to HH signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>).

To determine if these regions are likely to be enhancers, we analyzed the co-enrichment of the enhancer markers H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 at ATAC accessible (ATAC+) and inaccessible (ATAC-) HH-responsive GBRs. 93.5% (217/232) of ATAC+ regions are co-enriched with H3K4me1/2 while 72% (84/117) of ATAC- regions are co-enriched with H3K4Me1/2. These results suggest that most of the ATAC- regions are likely to correspond to real enhancers though at a somewhat reduced frequency compared to ATAC+ regions.

To test this, we cultured limb buds in the presence of the HDAC inhibitors FK228 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furumai et al., 2002</xref>) or SAHA for 2 hr. As expected, there were greatly upregulated levels of H3K27ac within two hours of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We then dissected the anterior halves of limb buds cultured in control or HDAC inhibitor-containing media and compared the levels of H3K27ac enrichment at HH-responsive GBRs previously shown to have enriched H3K27ac levels in posterior limb halves (+HH, no GLI repression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Inhibition of HDACs with both FK228 and SAHA resulted in increased acetylation at HH-responsive enhancers compared to untreated control anterior limb buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The increased enrichment of H3K27ac acetylation in HDAC-inhibited anterior limb buds was comparable to that seen in posterior limb buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). HDACs could regulate H3K27ac activity in a GLI-responsive fashion through a variety of different mechanisms including direct interactions with responsive GBRs, potentially mediated by a repression complex including GLI3 proteins and HDACs. We asked if GBRs were bound by HDACs, focusing on HDAC1, which along with HDAC2 is preferentially inhibited by FK228 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furumai et al., 2002</xref>). We identified HDAC1 binding regions in E11.5 limb buds by CHIP-seq and intersected them with GBRs. 78% (4,109/5,282) of stable GBRs and 41% (144/349) of HH-responsive GBRs overlapped with HDAC1 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>), consistent with a possible role for HDAC1 in regulating H3K27ac levels.

These regions are enriched for multiple enhancer markers and have enhancer activity in transgenic embryos, suggesting that they mark a population of enhancers. However, compared to WT embryos, these regions have reduced or absent levels of histone H3K27 acetylation in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos, indicating a loss of enhancer activity. Many previously validated GLI limb enhancers have HH-responsive H3K27ac, including those regulating <italic>Grem1</italic>, <italic>Ptch1</italic> and <italic>Gli1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vokes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zuniga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopez-Rios et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, HH-responsive GBRs are highly enriched near HH target genes while the much larger class of Stable GBRs are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This suggests that HH target gene regulation is primarily mediated through HH-responsive GBRs. The discovery of this response provides important information about the mechanism of GLI repression. It also provides a predictive tool for identifying enhancers regulating HH target genes in other biological contexts.</p><p>We propose a model in which GLI repression primarily regulates enhancer activity through deacetylation of histone H3K27. Because H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 levels are unchanged during maximal GLI repression, these enhancers presumably remain poised for activation, albeit in a less accessible state. Upon binding HH-responsive enhancers, GLI repressors either recruit or activate HDACs, which prevent otherwise competent enhancers from acquiring enriched H3K27 acetylation. The loss of GLI repression, either genetically (<italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup>;Gli3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or <italic>Gli3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> limb buds), or developmentally (initiation of <italic>Shh</italic> expression) results in a loss of GLI repression and accompanying HDAC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). This chromatin-based mode of regulation enables the dynamic control of a field of cells containing primed enhancers. To determine if this priming event occurs on an <italic>ad hoc</italic> basis by disparate inputs or if it is the result of coordinated, HH-independent signaling events, we examined HH-responsive GBRs for the enrichment of additional binding motifs. Besides the GLI motif itself, no other motifs are enriched at high levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>) suggesting that HH-responsive GBRs are a heterogenous population of enhancers with no predominant co-regulators.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for GLI transcriptional repression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of enhancer status at HH-responsive GBRs.

The rest are Stable GBRs with an unclear role in HH transcriptional regulation. Although these enhancers do not have significantly reduced levels of H3K27 enrichment in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> limbs, some of them show a trend toward reduced H3K27ac that suggests a continuum of GLI-bound enhancers that range from completely HH-responsive (HH-dependent) to those Stable GBRs that have no HH response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with this, Stable GBRs do have a modest overall increase in H3K27ac enrichment in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup>;Gli3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> limbs on a population level, indicating that their H3K27ac levels are regulated by GLI repressor to some extent. On the other hand, these enhancers are enriched at CpG-rich promoters, which are associated with more broadly expressed genes and have minimal enrichment near HH target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). They are also more highly conserved than HH-dependent GBRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In contrast to HH-responsive enhancers, they appear to be active in other cell types and tissues besides the limb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). One possibility is that many Stable GBRs do not have a major role in mediating Hedgehog signaling; GLI repressors at these regions are relatively inert. A second possibility is that GLI repression at Stable GBRs mediates subtle changes to acetylation that confer small reductions in transcription that are beyond the limits of our detection. Finally, it is possible that Stable enhancers are globally active, but engage in long-range collaborations with tissue specific HH-responsive enhancers to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>Previous modeling has suggested that GLI repressors within an enhancer work cooperatively through multiple GLI sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parker et al., 2011</xref>), providing another mechanism for tuning enhancer response. HH responsive GBRs contain more GLI motifs than Stable GBRs, which may make them more responsive to GLI repression, although in contrast to this model, they have high quality GLI motifs. As many GLI target genes, including <italic>Ptch1</italic> and <italic>Grem1,</italic> are regulated by multiple GLI enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vokes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zuniga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopez-Rios et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lorberbaum et al., 2016</xref>), this integration likely extends to higher level hubs of enhancer organization. For example, HH-responsive H3K27ac regions that are not bound by GLI cluster near HH-responsive GBRs, as do Stable GBRs suggesting that they may be modified based on proximity to GLI-repressor-HDAC complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The majority of HH-responsive GBRs do not have H3K27me3 enrichment even when there is maximal GLI repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This indicates that the Polycomb repressor complex is not involved in mediating most GLI repression, a conclusion that seemingly conflicts with several studies showing direct or indirect roles for PRC2 in repressing HH transcription. However, these studies largely considered the transcriptional activator targets <italic>Ptch1</italic> or <italic>Gli1</italic> or looked at genetic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wyngaarden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lorberbaum et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deimling et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with their findings, <italic>Gli1</italic> has high levels of H3K27me3 enrichment in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> limb buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Although <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> are often examined in the context of GLI de-repression, they are both GLI-activator genes in that they require the loss of GLI repression as well as subsequent GLI activation for their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Litingtung et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">te Welscher et al., 2002</xref>). GLI activator targets such as these are likely to differ fundamentally in their mode of regulation from those that are activated upon de-repression. As H3K27me3 enrichment is commonly found at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Young et al., 2011</xref>), GLI repressors on distal enhancers not directly enriched by H3K27me3 might still facilitate the recruitment of PRC2 to promoters through enhancer-promoter interactions. However, only one third of HH target genes have H3K27me3 enrichment at their promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>), arguing against this scenario. Additionally, 65% (20/31) of HH-responsive GBRs enriched for H3K27me3 in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> limbs were detected in the H3K27ac MicroChIP on <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup>;Gli3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> limbs. 17/20 of these regions maintained or increased H3K27ac enrichment in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup>;Gli3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> limbs, while the three regions that were reduced were near the GLI-activator-dependent HH pathway genes <italic>Gli1, Ptch1</italic> and <italic>Ptch2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). Thus, for rare limb GBRs requiring GLI activation, their mode of action is consistent with previously proposed models in which GLI activators recruit a complex to remove H3K27Me3, resulting in the activation of these enhancers and subsequently their cognate target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Confusingly, HDACs have been shown to have properties both consistent with and contradictory to our model. HDACs bind to and deacetylate GLI1 and GLI2 proteins, promoting their ability to act as transcriptional activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canettieri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mirza et al., 2019</xref>). HDACs have also been shown to bind cis-regulatory regions in <italic>Gli1</italic>, consistent with an additional role in positively regulating HH-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhan et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, a SKI-HDAC complex has been shown to bind to and interact genetically with GLI3 to repress anterior digit formation in the limb bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, Atrophin acts as a GLI co-repressor by recruiting an HDAC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Multiple studies with SWI/SNF BAF complex members also indicate that they regulate aspects of both GLI activation and repression, roles that have in some cases been shown to be directed by the dynamic association of BAF members with HDAC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jagani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeon and Seong, 2016</xref>). Our results indicate that HDAC1 is bound to about half of all HH-responsive GBRs. The absence of HDAC1 at such a significant percentage of GBRs could possibly be explained by transient binding of HDACs or the presence of partially redundant HDAC proteins. In support of the latter scenario, HDAC2 has been shown to preferentially bind to distal, rather than promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Although the simplest model is consistent with GLI repressors directly (via a GLI3 and HDAC-containing repression complex), we cannot exclude the possibility that HDAC1 is constitutively bound at CRMs in a GLI-independent fashion and the HDAC activity occurs indirectly . Collectively, these studies highlight the complexity of GLI regulation and the need for further studies to determine which complexes directly impact GLI repression.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The GLI3-FLAG ChIP and the H3K27ac ChIP on cultured and treated limbs were performed on E10.5 (32–35S) forelimbs from 20 to 25 pooled embryos. The HDAC1 ChIP was performed on pooled forelimbs and hindlimbs from 30 E11.5 (40–44S) embryos.

After cell lysis, chromatin was sheared. H3K27ac ChIP samples were sheared in buffer containing 0.25% SDS with a Covaris S2 focused ultrasonicator using the following settings: Duty Cycle: 2%, Intensity: 3, Cycles/burst: 200, Cycle time: 60 s, Power mode: frequency sweeping. GLI3-FLAG ChIP samples were sheared using a Branson Sonifier for 10 cycles, 30 s on/60 s off, intensity 3.5. HDAC1 samples were sheared using a Diagenode Bioruptor for 5, 10 min cycles: 30 s on/60 s off, on high power. Sheared chromatin was then split into 3 ChIP reactions and incubated with antibody-dynabead preparations overnight. The H3K27ac antibodies for conventional ChIP were from Diagenode (C15200184) and Abcam (ab4729), while the H3K27Ac antibody for MicroChIPs was from Diagenode (C15410196).

The GLI motif was mapped to the mouse genome using the motifmap_matrixscan_genome function in CisGenome software with default parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ATAC-Seq</title><p>Individual pairs of posterior forelimb fractions were dissected from 35 somite wildtype (n = 2) or <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (n = 2). ATAC used components from the Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>) with the following variations. 5,000 cells from each sample were added into each reaction and cells were lysed on ice for 8 min. prior to centrifugation. Libraries were generated using 18 cycles of PCR amplification with NEB high fidelity 2x master mix (New England Biolabs), cleaned up with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using PEx75 to a depth of 30 million reads. Peaks were called using MACS2 with a fixed window size of 200 bp and a q-value cutoff of 0.05. Differential analysis of wildtype versus <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> peak signals was performed essentially as described for ChIP above using limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Blerta Xhemalce, Samantha Brugmann, Kevin Peterson and Janani Ramachandran for comments on the manuscript.

To further find mechanistic support, this paper probes Gli Binding Regions (GBRs) and finds that GBRs enriched around Hh target genes can lose acetylation in the absence of Shh due to the presence of the repressor forms of Gli3. Although the mechanisms remain unresolved the results indicate that Histone Deacetylases interact with the repressor form of Gli3.</p><p>The initial identification of Gli3 binding regions is in WT, E10.5 limb buds, when &quot;high levels of HH target gene expression are observed&quot;. According to the release of inhibition model, under these conditions it would be predicted that the Gli3R is not bound to its targets, and would thus not be ChIP-ed. It would seem to me that differential Gli binding in A vs. P or WT vs. <italic>Shh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (or perhaps even better <italic>Smo</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) limb buds would yield a better collection of relevant GBDs, that would provide a better correlate for the ChIP-seq that is appropriately performed in WT and <italic>Shh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> limb buds. Although some elements of this approach are presented in Figure 4, these results are presented as supporting, and not as driving the question.</p><p>Using <italic>Ptch1</italic> as the prototypical target for HH signaling is reasonable but <italic>Gremlin</italic> is more complex, as in the developing neural tube its expression is restricted to the roof plate, and thus at best inhibited by Shh signaling, while in the gut there appears little evidence that it is under Shh control. In general, there is very little resolution whether the observed correlation is general (supported by <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic>) or limb bud-specific.</p><p>Figure 4D-F: I don't see the indicated p-values as described in the legend.</p><p>Figure 4G-I: What are the &quot;Selected GBRs&quot;, and what genes are they associated with?</p><p>Purmorphamine is better described as a <italic>Smo</italic> agonist. I do wander about the choice of Purmorphamine, as much more specific small molecules (e.g. SAG) but in particular <italic>Shh</italic> should be used in these experiments, as <italic>Smo</italic> downstream of <italic>Ptch1/2</italic> not necessarily equates <italic>Ptch1/2</italic> inactivation via <italic>Shh</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript, GLI transcriptional repression regulates tissue-specific enhancer activity in response to Hedgehog signaling, Lex et al. investigate chromatin modifications in wildtype and <italic>Shh</italic> mutant (undergoing constitutive Gli repression) limb buds. From these data they propose a model to explain dynamic, tissue-specific derepression of genes. Strengths of the approach include: 1) the potential physiological relevance of using a well-studied in vivo system where there is a clear role for Hh signaling and derepressive mechanisms, 2) using a fairly agnostic genome wide approach and 3) using the in vivo data of Hh-responsive enhancers (from VISTA datasets) to show that a subset of the putative enhancers may be bona fide. However, it is difficult to evaluate whether the data support the conclusions through much of the manuscript due to the lack of definitions and details.</p><p>The manuscript investigates an important question about how chromatin modifications solidify the dynamic and quick gene expression changes necessary for development and investigates one of the most complicated mechanisms at play- derepression. As written, the analysis of the VISTA enhancer database provides the only compelling evidence that the authors are, in fact, identifying relevant enhancers. The demonstration that these sites are sensitive to an HDAC inhibitor is consistent with the model that GliR recruits an HDAC but leaves open the possibility of indirect HDAC recruitment. Thus, the manuscript provides further evidence that enhancer-promoter interactions to induce transcription work as the field understands and the advance is that these data may demonstrate it in an in vivo setting.</p><p>1) The authors need to define and prove that the GBRs they are examining are, in fact, enhancers. While this possibility is consistent with the data, as currently stands the manuscript does not provide sufficient definitions and analysis for this determination to be made. For example, as stands it is possible that GBRs represent some other type of element, such as a gene body or the 3' ends of genes, or no element at all. As the authors examine H3K4me1/2, they may have appropriate data available.</p><p>2) The authors need to define terms such as &quot;around genes&quot;, &quot;in close proximity to the promoters&quot;, &quot;significantly clustered around&quot;, &quot;selecting regions that would not overlap with promoters&quot; as is standard in the field. Without clear definitions of proximity and how the associated genes are being called, these data are not interpretable/overinterpreted. One example: subsection “HH-responsive GBRs are distal enhancers containing high quality GLI motifs”, as explained this paragraph says that the stable GBRs are more likely than Hh-responsive GBRs to be near promoters; however, this does not mean that the rest of the Hh-responsive GBRs are enhancers – – and by the section title “Hedgehog signaling does not regulate other histone modifications at enhancers”, the authors are clearly referring to these distal elements as enhancers.</p><p>3) In the section &quot;Hh signaling does not regulate other histone modifications at enhancers&quot;, H3K4me1 should shift to H3K4me2 at the active enhancers. The fact that H3K4me2 does not change from <italic>Shh</italic> mutants to wildtype suggests these may not be active enhancers. In fact H3K4me2 only marked &quot;a subset of Hh-responsive GBRs&quot;- why don't they have H3K4me2? If the thought is that they might represent weak enhancers, they should show bidirectional PolII. Related to this in the subsequent section using ATAC-seq, why are the GBRs less accessible under the wild type &quot;activated&quot; condition?</p><p>4) The statement stating that the data suggest &quot;a model in which loss of an HDAC-GLI repressor complex leads to acetylation&quot; is a bit misleading as it sounds like the only possibility. In fact, the data suggest a correlation that would likely be true regardless of mechanism and the subsequent culturing with FK228 are again consistent with the model but do not prove it as the GLI-HDAC interaction need not be direct.</p><p>5) The authors should examine and report the ATAC-seq and chromatin data specifically at the enhancers from the VISTA enhancer database and discuss in regards to their model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50670.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers found the manuscript potentially interesting, they also noted that it was difficult to read and evaluate.

As H3K4Me2 marks only a minority of regions (see new Figure 7A and response to #3, below), we reanalyzed published H3K4Me1 ChIP-seq data from E10.5 limb buds from the ENCODE consortium and intersected it with GBRs. The majority of the GBRs (83% of HH-responsive GBRs and</p><p>81% of Stable GBRs) overlap with H3K4Me1 peaks in addition to being enriched for H3K27ac. Their dual status as H3K27ac+;H3K4Me1+ suggests that these are enhancers. We have added the following statement to the Results:</p><p>“As H3K27ac is not exclusively localized to enhancers, we also examined the enrichment of histone H3K4me1, a general marker of primed and active enhancers, at these GBRs, using publicly available data (Encode 2012) (Figure 1—source data 3). In wildtype limb buds, 82% of HH-responsive GBRs are enriched for H3K4 mono-methylation, supporting that these regions are likely to act as enhancers (HH-sens: 123/148, 83%; HH-dep: 162/201, 81%).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The need to define terms such as &quot;around genes&quot;, &quot;in close proximity to the promoters&quot;, &quot;significantly clustered around&quot;, &quot;selecting regions that would not overlap with promoters&quot; as is standard in the field.

Most promoter-associated Stable GBRs (90%; 3,190/3,544) are found at promoters associated with CpG islands (defined as a TSS with a CpG region within 5kb upstream to 2.5kb downstream), a quality typically associated with housekeeping genes, and genes that tend to be more broadly expressed and less tissue-specific (Zhu et al., 2008).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the section &quot;Hh signaling does not regulate other histone modifications at enhancers&quot;, H3K4me1 should shift to H3K4me2 at the active enhancers.

To address this concern more directly, we visualized the presence of several enhancer markers: ATAC-seq, H3K4Me2, H3K4Me1 in those GBRs that have enhancer activity in transgenic embryos and are, by that criteria, functional enhancers. Over half (61% – 81/144) of the Stable GBRs with enhancer activity in the limb have H3K4Me2 enrichment while 25%</p><p>(3/12) have H3K4Me2 enrichment in HH-responsive enhancers. To illustrate these findings, we have added Venn Diagrams showing the overlap of enhancer markers in transgenic embryos that drive limb expression (Figure 6D) and have also added ChIP-seq plots for a representative enhancer (Figure 6E).</p><p>The data are also summarized for all GBRs in Figure 7A and Figure 7—figure supplement 1. We have added the following section to the Results:</p><p>“While all GBRs tested in the VISTA database with limb activity are by definition enriched for H3K27ac, 91% of HH-responsive GBRs and 95% of Stable GBRs are also enriched for H3K4me1 (Figure 6D). Additionally, all GBRS are enriched for at least two markers of enhancers (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, ATAC) while most are enriched for 3-4 of these markers (67% HH-responsive GBRs; 93% Stable GBRs) (Figure 6D, E).”</p><p>To address the question concerning wild type ATAC-seq accessibility, we compared WT GBRs that have called ATAC-peaks (ATAC+) with WT GBRs that do not have ATAC-peaks (ATAC-) (Figure 3B). We have added this information to the Results:</p><p>“To determine if these regions are likely to be enhancers, we analyzed the co-enrichment of the enhancer markers H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 at ATAC accessible (ATAC+) and inaccessible (ATAC-) HH-responsive GBRs. […] These results suggest that most of the ATAC- regions are likely to correspond to real enhancers though at a somewhat reduced frequency compared to ATAC+ regions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The statement stating that the data suggest &quot;a model in which loss of an HDAC-GLI repressor complex leads to acetylation&quot; is a bit misleading as it sounds like the only possibility. In fact, the data suggest a correlation that would likely be true regardless of mechanism and the subsequent culturing with FK228 are again consistent with the model but do not prove it as the GLI-HDAC interaction need not be direct.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and to address this we performed ChIP-seq to identify HDAC1 binding regions in E11.5 limb buds (since HDAC1 ChIPs require ~30 million cells from ~30 pairs of E11.5 forelimbs, it was not feasible to use E10.5 forelimbs, which would have required ~300 embryos). A sizable number of HH-responsive GBRs are enriched for HDAC1, which supports the possibility that this interaction might be direct. We have moved the HDAC inhibitor data (with FK228 as we showed previously along with a new data using an additional HDAC inhibitor, SAHA, which shows the same trends) and HDAC 1 ChIP-seq data (summaries and representative plots) to new Figure 5 and describe these findings in the Results:</p><p>“The increased enrichment of H3K27ac acetylation in HDAC-inhibited anterior limb buds was comparable to that seen in posterior limb buds (Figure 4G). […] We conclude that GLI repressors regulate H3K27ac levels at HH-responsive GBRs through HDACs (see Discussion).”</p><p>We note that many GBRs are not enriched for HDAC1, possibly because it is difficult to identify more transient HDAC1 binding events or because they are not enriched for HDAC1. Even if these regions are enriched for another HDAC, such as HDAC2, it does not ‘prove’ that the interaction is direct and we have modified the model Figure 7B (Figure 6A in the previous version) to signify that the interaction between GLI3 and HDAC is unknown (a gray box with dashed lines between GLI3 and HDAC). We have also added the following to the Discussion:</p><p>“Our results indicate that HDAC1 is bound to about half of all HH responsive GBRs. […] Although the simplest model is consistent with GLI repressors directly (via a GLI3 and HDAC-containing repression complex), we cannot exclude the possibility that HDAC1 is constitutively bound CRMs in a GLI-independent fashion and the HDAC activity is indirect.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should examine and report the ATAC-seq and chromatin data specifically at the enhancers from the VISTA enhancer database and discuss in regards to their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed this analysis and include it as Venn Diagrams (Figure 6D). We have included these data in the Results and find that all VISTA GBRs are enriched for at least one other enhancer marker besides H3K27ac (see response to point #3 above) while most are marked multiple markers. We have added the following to the Discussion:</p><p>“We find that a subset of GLI-bound regions has chromatin modifications that change in response to HH signaling. […] However, compared to WT embryos, these regions have reduced or absent levels of histone H3K27 acetylation in <italic>Shh</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos, suggesting a loss of enhancer activity.”</p><p>In addition, we depict ATAC-seq and the other enhancer markers examined in this study as Figure 7A and Figure 7—figure supplement 1, which is directly above our model (Figure 7B), which depicts these regions as ‘Enhancer.’</p></body></sub-article></article>
