However, it is not well understood how the various actin assemblies in a cell are kept in a dynamic equilibrium, in particular when cells have to respond to acute signals. Here, we characterize a rapid and transient actin reset in response to increased intracellular calcium levels. Within seconds of calcium influx, the formin INF2 stimulates filament polymerization at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while cortical actin is disassembled. The reaction is then reversed within a few minutes. This Calcium-mediated actin reset (CaAR) occurs in a wide range of mammalian cell types and in response to many physiological cues. CaAR leads to transient immobilization of organelles, drives reorganization of actin during cell cortex repair, cell spreading and wound healing, and induces long-lasting changes in gene expression. Our findings suggest that CaAR acts as fundamental facilitator of cellular adaptations in response to acute signals and stress.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19850.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19850.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19850.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our skeleton plays a vital role in giving shape and structure to our body, it also allows us to make coordinated movements. Similarly, each cell contains a microscopic network of structures and supports called the cytoskeleton that helps cells to adopt specific shapes and is crucial for them to move around. Unlike our skeleton, which is relatively unchanging, the cytoskeleton of each cell constantly changes and adapts to the specific needs of the cell.</p><p>One part of the cytoskeleton is a dense, flexible meshwork of fibers called the cortex that lies just beneath the surface of the cell. The cortex is constructed using a protein called actin, and many of these proteins join together to form each fiber. When cells need to adapt rapidly to an injury or other sudden changes in their environment they activate a so-called stress response. This response often begins with a rapid increase in the amount of calcium ions inside a cell, which can then trigger changes in actin organization. However, it is not clear how cells under stress are able to globally remodel their actin cytoskeleton without compromising stability and integrity of the cortex.</p><p>Wales, Schuberth, Aufschnaiter et al. used a range of mammalian cells to investigate how actin responds to stress signals. All cells responded to the resulting influx of calcium ions by deconstructing large parts of the actin cortex and simultaneously forming actin filaments near the center of the cell. Wales, Schuberth, Aufschnaiter et al. termed this response calcium-mediated actin reset (CaAR), as it lasted for only a few minutes before the actin cortex reformed. The experiments show that a protein called INF2 controls CaAR by rapidly removing actin from the cortex and forming new filaments near a cell compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>CaAR allows cells to rapidly and drastically alter the cortex in response to stress. The experiments also show that this sudden shift in actin can change the activity of certain genes, leading to longer-term effects on the cell. The findings of Wales, Schuberth, Aufschnaiter et al. suggest that calcium ions globally regulate the actin cytoskeleton and hence cell shape and movement under stress. This could be relevant for many important processes and conditions such as wound healing, inflammation and cancer. A future challenge will be to understand the role of CaAR in these processes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19850.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19850.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>actin cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>cell signaling</kwd><kwd>mammalian cells</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>formins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1009-B10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pavenstädt</surname><given-names>Hermann</given-names></name><name><surname>Wedlich-Söldner</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wedlich-Söldner</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC1003-CiM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wedlich-Söldner</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KE685/4-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kessels</surname><given-names>Michael M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QU116/5-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qualmann</surname><given-names>Britta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FF-2015-08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wedlich-Söldner</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Münster</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IZKF SEED 06/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dlugos</surname><given-names>Christopher P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Calcium influx during acute cell stimulation triggers a global actin reset in mammalian cells, which is linked to plasma membrane repair and transcription and has implications for our understanding of cell migration, cancer, inflammation and cell stress response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Actin organization and dynamics are critical for most morphogenetic processes, including cell polarization, migration and division. The prominent role of the actin cytoskeleton is reflected in a host of regulators that mediate dynamic assembly of complex actin structures from filament bundles and networks. These structures in turn provide protrusive and contractile forces during physiological and pathological processes such as differentiation, wound healing and tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lecuit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pantaloni et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pollard and Cooper, 2009</xref>). While many studies in the past have focused on the molecular characterization of specific actin assemblies and their local function within cells, recent work has elegantly shown that a balance between different actin assemblies is established in cells by distinct actin nucleators. These nucleators constantly compete for a common pool of actin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke et al., 2014</xref>), and the balance between actin assemblies can be tightly controlled by regulatory factors such as profilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rotty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suarez et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, cellular F- and G-actin levels have been linked to profound and long-lasting changes in cell physiology through regulation of transcriptional cofactors such as myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTF), the Yes-associated protein (YAP) or transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Halder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miralles et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, the rapidly expanding field of mechanobiology has highlighted global integration of actomyosin-mediated forces across the cortex of single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klingner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salbreux et al., 2012</xref>), as well as within cell groups and whole tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lecuit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trepat et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the context of widespread interdependence, competition and mechanical connectivity between actin assemblies, cells face formidable challenges when undergoing a global reorganization of their actin cytoskeleton. This is exemplified by the impact of moderate perturbations of the cortical actin cytoskeleton with low doses of latrunculin, which can result in a massive imbalance of actomyosin-mediated forces and lead to large-scale fluctuations in cell cortex organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klingner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2013</xref>). How cells globally coordinate actin remodeling during rapid and profound morphological transitions has not been sufficiently addressed. Shear flow has been shown to induce rapid changes in cellular actin organization and mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rahimzadeh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verma et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, a recent study reported calcium-mediated rapid and transient formation of actin filaments at the nuclear periphery of fibroblasts exposed to mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shao et al., 2015</xref>). However, how these observations can be linked to cell cortex organization and overall cell physiology is not known.</p><p>Here we show that calcium not only induces actin polymerization at the nuclear periphery, but causes a rapid reduction of cortical actin coinciding with the formation of new filaments at the entire endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This global change in actin distribution is rapidly reversed within less than two minutes. Calcium-mediated Actin Reset (CaAR) occurs in a wide range of mammalian cell types and is initiated by a variety of physiological signals. Most importantly, we found that CaAR acts as a fundamental facilitator of acute cell responses. It is required for repair of cortical damage and coordinates the formation of actin-rich protrusions during cell spreading and cell migration. In addition, CaAR induces long-term changes in gene expression via MRTF and serum response factor (SRF). Our results have important implications for a multitude of experiments where cells are exposed to acute stress as well as for calcium-regulated processes such as wound healing, inflammation, cell differentiation and cancer progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A calcium-mediated actin reset in mammalian cells</title><p>To establish the cellular response to an acute mechanical stimulus we exposed Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells to sudden shear flow. Prior to shear stress, MDCK cells stably expressing Lifeact-GFP exhibited a typical apical actin organization with clustered microvilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klingner et al., 2014</xref>). Immediately upon exposure to fluid flow of 10–20 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> we observed the formation of a highly transient perinuclear actin ring, which only remained for a few minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). A similar phenomenon was recently reported in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shao et al., 2015</xref>), but its consequences for cell organization were not further explored. To establish the reported relevance of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shao et al., 2015</xref>) for the actin reorganization in MDCK cells, we monitored Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels with the fluorescent probe Fluo-4. Upon induction of shear stress, actin reorganization was preceded by a strong intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). To examine whether the elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels is causally linked to actin reorganization, we treated MDCK cells with the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Indeed, exposure to as little as 0.3 µM ionomycin induced the formation of perinuclear actin rings and reduction of cortical actin within 60 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to the previous report, we found a virtually simultaneous decrease of actin filaments at the apical cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As for the transient shear stress response, actin rapidly reverted to its cortical distribution within the following 60 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To test the prevalence of calcium-mediated actin reorganization, we stably or transiently expressed Lifeact-GFP in a panel of mammalian cell lines, including epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial and immune cells, and treated each with ionomycin. In all instances, rapid relocation of actin from the cell cortex to the nuclear periphery occurred within 60 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). We observed the strongest response for human MCF-7 breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) and therefore decided to focus on this cell line for further studies. Actin reorganization in MCF-7 cells was not influenced by Lifeact-GFP expression, as we observed an identical response in non-transfected cells stained with Alexa Fluor 647-phalloidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, we found that, upon calcium influx, actin filaments formed not only at the nuclear periphery, but throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and all along the endoplasmic reticulum (ER, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). If cytosolic calcium is the key regulator of rapid actin reorganization, we reasoned that other signals that induced sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx should be able to elicit the actin response. As expected, activation of calcium influx using physiological ligands for G-protein-coupled receptors, such as ATP or bradykinin efficiently induced actin rearrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In most cells release of calcium from ER stores activates store-operated calcium entry from the extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hogan and Rao, 2015</xref>). Hence, blocking uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the ER with thapsigargin - in the presence of high extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> - also induced actin rearrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Finally, perforation of the plasma membrane by localized mechanical disruption (atomic force microscopy, AFM) or laser-induced ablation efficiently induced cortex to ER actin reorganization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19850.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A calcium-mediated actin reset in mammalian cells.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) MDCK cells labeled with Lifeact-mCherry (Lifeact-RFP) and Fluo4 were exposed to 10 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> shear flow.

Due to the striking inversion of cellular actin organization that we observed (cortex-ER-cortex, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) we decided to term this process ‘Calcium-mediated Actin Reset’ or CaAR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Quantitative analysis of CaAR</title><p>We proceeded to characterize the detailed kinetics and features of CaAR to gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. In all cell types that we tested, CaAR was initiated within seconds after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and not shown). Actin concentration at the ER reached its maximum within less than 1 min and reverted back to the original state within less than 5 min. Actin recruitment to the ER followed a typical three-phase kinetics characterized by a rapid increase, a plateau and a slower decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We considered serum-starved (for 1 hr) MCF-7 cells treated with 330 nM ionomycin at RT as a control condition. The actin increase at the ER was significantly faster for cells grown in serum or at 37°C. Also, the stimulation of MCF-7 and HeLa cells with 50 µM ATP led to faster increase than for ionomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, addition of serum or ATP had little effect on the rate of decrease or the amplitude of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Finally, the CaAR plateau was shortened at 37°C, for cells grown in serum and upon stimulation with ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Treatment of HeLa cells with ionomycin induced very strong and long-lasting CaAR response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that these cells could not as efficiently remove Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol. Most importantly, despite the specific differences described above, all kinetic parameters of CaAR remained within a three-fold range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), highlighting the robust and stereotypic nature of the response.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19850.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Quantitative analysis of CaAR.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Quantification of indicated parameters during CaAR.

ratiometric dye Fura2. We found that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in MCF-7 cells increased 2- to 4-fold upon exposure to ionomycin (3.59 ± 0.84 fold, n = 31) or ATP (2.82 ± 0.67 fold, n = 54), which induced CaAR in virtually all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Induction of CaAR was completely prevented in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium, but could be restored within 1 min by addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (not shown). In Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium, release of calcium from ER stores with thapsigargin could not be enhanced by store-operated calcium entry and led to a modest cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase of 1.26 ± 0.08 fold (n = 31). This was insufficient to induce CaAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results indicate that CaAR induction requires a threshold level of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> that can only be reached by influx from the extracellular environment.</p><p>Observing such large-scale reorganization of actin, we wondered whether the mechanical properties of cells undergoing CaAR were altered. We therefore used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to probe cells with 10 µm beads attached to the cantilever. Despite the observed transient reduction of cortical actin, we found that the subcortical regions (800 nm below the plasma membrane) of MCF-7 cells treated with ionomycin became markedly stiffer during CaAR, mirroring greater levels of actin recruitment at the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, we observed that intracellular motility of organelles was transiently halted during CaAR. Random as well as directed motion of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), mitochondria and the ER network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) was abolished within a few seconds of CaAR onset and resumed after actin returned to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). When simultaneously observing CaAR and lysosome motility we found the organelles trapped within a cytosol-filling actin mesh that corresponded to the transient ER-based actin filaments (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). Lysosomes were also immobilized in cells treated with 50 µM blebbistatin arguing against a prominent role of actomyosin contractility for organelle freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-19850-media4.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19850.011</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>HeLa cell expressing Lifeact-GFP labelled with Lysotracker Red and stimulated by laser ablation.</title><p>Corresponds to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19850.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19850.011</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>When using pointy AFM tips to probe cells, we often were able to induce CaAR in individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Forces above 50 nN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) were able to robustly induce CaAR multiple times in a single cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>) with a refractory period of 30–60 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), consistent with the time scale of actin recruitment at the ER. When using localized CaAR stimulation by AFM we frequently observed that cells directly adjacent to the manipulated cells also reacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To examine this behavior in more detail, we performed ablation experiments on MCF-7 monolayers. Strikingly, we found that nearly all cells within 60–150 µm of the ablation site exhibited CaAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). This was also observed for cells that were not in direct contact with the ablated cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>).

Accordingly, both G-actin sequestration by latrunculin A (LatA) and actin filament disruption by cytochalasin D (CytoD) completely blocked CaAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>). The only actin nucleator that has been shown to be localized at the ER is inverted formin 2 (INF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chhabra and Higgs, 2006</xref>), and this nucleator has also been shown to mediate the formation of perinuclear actin filaments in 3T3 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shao et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, in MCF-7 and HeLa cells, INF2 was localized to the ER, as shown either by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or when expressing the full-length INF2-CAAX isoform fused to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A constitutively active point mutant of INF2 (A149D, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>) induced the previously shown strong actin staining at the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramabhadran et al., 2013</xref>), which was not further increased by the addition of ionomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To test a potential role of INF2 for CaAR we knocked down INF2 expression by RNA interference. While our attempts for INF2 knock down were unsuccessful in MCF-7 cells, we were able to efficiently abolish expression of INF2 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Strikingly, CaAR was completely blocked in HeLa cells that were depleted for INF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This was especially apparent in areas where some cells still retained INF2 expression and therefore were still able to nucleate actin at the ER upon treatment with ionomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, circled area). Notably, INF2 knock-down also blocked actin decrease at the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), increase in cell stiffness detected by AFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and freezing of organelle motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>. To obtain stable cell lines without INF2 expression we knocked out INF2 using the CRSPR/Cas9 system. We obtained several independent HeLa INF2-KO clones that exhibited no detectable INF2 expression by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We then transiently expressed either the CAAX- or nonCAAX human isoform of INF2 in clone 18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Upon induction of CaAR by laser ablation we observe no reaction in untransfected cells confirming that INF2 is essential for CaAR.

We therefore investigated binding of INF2 to the prototypical calcium regulator calmodulin. Co-precipitation analyses showed that GFP-INF2 expressed in HEK293 cells indeed specifically bound to immobilized calmodulin, and that this interaction was Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). While this result provides a potential molecular basis for INF2 activation, additional work will be needed to clarify the specific role of calmodulin during CaAR.</p><p>It is well documented that intracellular calcium influx also affects other cellular factors such as Myosin II, and INF2 has been linked to microtubule stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrés-Delgado et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartolini et al., 2016</xref>). These factors might therefore also play a role during CaAR. However, pretreatment of cells with the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin or with the microtubule disrupting drug nocodazole did not inhibit or slow down CaAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In summary, our results indicate that CaAR is largely dependent on a single factor – the calcium-regulated actin nucleator INF2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A stochastic model rationalizes CaAR features and kinetics</title><p>Two remarkable characteristics of CaAR are the reciprocal behavior of actin at the ER and the cell cortex and the highly transient nature of the reorganization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, INF2 is not only an actin nucleator and elongator, but also a very potent severing and actin-depolymerizing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chhabra and Higgs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gurel et al., 2014</xref>). During CaAR, these activities should also be subject to regulation by calcium and therefore potentially facilitate the observed reciprocal and transient reaction. It is important to note that CaAR does not lead to the equal reduction of all cortical actin structures. Stable actin assemblies such as stress fibers were much less affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>). Also, despite their opposite slopes, there was no apparent delay between ER and cell cortex reactions and they followed the calcium signal with the same offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, the duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was directly correlated with the kinetics of actin reorganization at both locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These observations indicate that the actin filament assembly and disassembly at the ER and cell cortex are tightly coupled. A potential mechanism for such coupling would be simple competition between different actin nucleators. To test whether such a scenario could account for the observed CaAR kinetics, we developed a particle-based stochastic model of actin dynamics that explicitly considers actin nucleation, polymerization, depolymerization, capping and severing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, Materials and Methods). We initially focused on a single actin population in equilibrium with the monomer pool. The model showed that actin turnover is mainly determined by the speed of actin depolymerization and modulated to a lesser extent by the rates of capping and severing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, actin turnover was strongly dependent on the levels of actin monomers available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The experimentally measured <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> for recovery of actin-GFP at the cortex of MCF-7 cells was quite fast, at 14.48 ± 7.21 s (n = 79). This constrained the possible values for severing, depolymerization and ratios of F- to G-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). We next included a second nucleation activity to represent INF2-mediated actin polymerization at the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). By assuming that INF2 activity follows the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> curve (See Materials and Methods), we were able to generate a transient actin peak at the ER with a corresponding decrease at the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). By increasing the INF2 nucleation rate or the amount of available G-actin in the system we were able to obtain kinetics that were reasonably close to the experimental observations (dotted curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, cortical actin never dropped below 50% of its original value, and we were unable to obtain complete reorganization of actin within less than 30 s, as seen with laser ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, the model predicted that including Ca<sup>2+</sup>- or INF2-dependent actin depolymerization into the model strongly increased the amplitude and speed of actin reorganization at both cortex and ER (solid curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To experimentally test this prediction we measured CaAR kinetics in HeLa KO cells expressing a WH2-mutant of INF2 (3L: L976A, L977A, L986A) that was reported to have strongly reduced depolymerization activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chhabra and Higgs, 2006</xref>). Strikingly CaAR kinetics were strongly reduced in cells expressing the 3L mutant. The resulting changes were comparable to the situation without Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated depolymerization predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). The amplitude and the speed of reorganization were strongly reduced for both, ER and cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19850.017</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A stochastic model rationalizes CaAR features and kinetics.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Correlation analysis of actin and calcium dynamics in MCF-7 cells undergoing CaAR.

Indeed, fractionation of MCF-7 cell extracts revealed a modest increase in the global F/G-actin ratio during CaAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, the levels of actin at the cortex of MCF-7 cells were increased after completion of CaAR relative to those at the outset of CaAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>A very sensitive readout for an increased F/G actin ratio in cells is the release of transcriptional regulators, such as the serum response factor (SRF) co-factor MRTF-A, from sequestration in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miralles et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, we found that within a minute of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and CaAR onset, MRTF-A translocated into the nucleus in &gt;95% of MCF-7 cells, and remained there for up to 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). MRTF-A translocation also occurred in HeLa cells and was blocked upon INF2 knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). When we blocked CaAR by treatment with LatA, MRTF-A translocation was also inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, treatment with CytoD induced CaAR-independent translocation of MRTF-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Descot et al., 2009</xref>). We next tested whether CaAR-induced translocation of MRTF-A indeed caused SRF-mediated transcription. RNA levels of two known SRF targets, CTGF and NR4R3, were strongly increased upon CaAR induction by ionomycin, reaching a maximum at 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We selected this time point for the analysis of CaAR-mediated changes in gene transcription. We treated MCF-7 cells with 1.5 µM ionomycin for 10 min after pre-incubation for 10 min with either LatA, CytoD or control buffer. After washout of the drugs and ionophore, we cultured the cells for another 50 min in 4-thio-uridine and collected newly synthesized mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We found that a 10 min pulse of ionomycin was sufficient to decrease the expression of 478 genes and enhance the expression of 405 genes by more than 1.5 fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). Treatment with LatA on its own had very little effect, but upregulation of 88 ionomycin-induced genes was strongly inhibited by LatA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 5—source datas 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">2</xref>). Nearly half of these genes are known SRF targets and about one third were also induced by the SRF activator CytoD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In agreement with the reported functions of SRF, many of the identified transcriptional changes were associated with genes involved in cytoskeletal organization, calcium regulation, cell signaling and regulation of cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). More than 60% of the CaAR-regulated genes have been associated with cancer and more than one-third have been implicated in cellular stress responses, cell differentiation, cell migration or inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). SRF is known to respond to actin changes mediated through Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Treisman et al., 1998</xref>). However, we found that CaAR-mediated induction of CTGF was not affected by the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) or by the CaM kinase inhibitors KN62 and KN93 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, all CaAR transcriptome experiments were performed in serum-starved cells and addition of serum did not induce CaAR in MCF-7 cells. In addition, treatment of cells with Y27632, the Rho1 inhibitor C3 transferase or with CsA did not affect CaAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

When we examined the cellular consequences of CaAR in laser ablation experiments with HeLa cells, we observed accumulation of actin at the site of membrane damage in more than 90% of the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref>). This accumulation was reminiscent of previously observed wound repair processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McNeil, 2002</xref>) and typically occurred after completion of CaAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Upon knock-down of INF2, HeLa cells did not undergo CaAR and were also completely unable to recruit actin to the site of membrane wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Importantly, membrane damage as measured by uptake of propidium iodide or FM4-64 was repaired within a few seconds of damage induction (not shown). Actin accumulation was therefore not required for membrane sealing but for a later step in wound repair, possibly cortex reassembly. Such repair mechanisms should be especially relevant for terminally differentiated cells that can no longer be replaced in vivo, such as podocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pavenstädt et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore examined CaAR in <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated human AB8 podocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saleem et al., 2002</xref>). Similar to our observations in HeLa cells, laser ablation at the periphery of podocytes induced CaAR and led to subsequent actin accumulation at the wounding site, which was then efficiently sealed without apparent loss of cellular integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>). Interestingly, actin accumulation at the wound was accompanied by simultaneous induction of lamellipodia in the immediate vicinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In both cell types examined above, the strong accumulation of actin at cortical wounding sites occurred right after completion of CaAR. Similarly, when we extended the period of observation in MCF-7 cells that had undergone CaAR upon ATP exposure, we found that they initiated extended basal protrusions that correlated with the end CaAR. Protrusions emanating from cell-cell junctions collapsed after only 5–10 min, but those appearing at free cell edges persisted for up to 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref>). To study this phenomenon in more detail we ablated a single MCF-7 cell in a monolayer. CaAR was efficiently induced in all surrounding cells and we again observed short-lived protrusions at cell-cell junctions and longer-lived protrusions at free cell edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">Video 12</xref>). In addition, some cells formed large lamellipodia, which rapidly closed the gap left by the ablated cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Considering the extended activation of cell spreading and cellular protrusion after CaAR we wondered whether this would have noticeable consequences for collective migration in a typical wound healing setting. We therefore observed MCF-7 monolayers migrating into a free area after removal of a PDMS spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). After 12 hr, untreated cells had moved in to the gap with an average speed of 3 µm/h, while cells migrating in the presence of 50 µM ATP (and therefore exhibiting CaAR at the onset of the experiment) covered a much larger area with an average speed of 7 µm/h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). A more detailed analysis revealed that ATP treatment led to an acceleration for the initial 4 hr of migration and that cells then reverted to the speed of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media13">Video 13</xref>). Our findings clearly show that ATP-mediated calcium influx and CaAR are associated with prolonged activation of protrusion and collective migration of MCF-7 cells. As we were not yet able to remove INF2 from MCF-7 cells, we cannot exclude at this time that the observed effects on protrusion could be due to a CaAR-independent effect of ATP.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19850.024</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>CaAR mediates acute cellular reorganization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A HeLa cell expressing Lifeact-GFP was damaged by laser ablation and Lifeact-GFP intensity was monitored in different regions.

How calcium signaling is linked to cellular morphogenesis is less well understood. Interestingly, a recent study reported formation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent perinuclear actin ring in 3T3 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shao et al., 2015</xref>). We have now found that increased intracellular calcium levels lead to transient and global reorganization of actin in a wide range of epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial and hematopoietic cell lines. This reorganization can be triggered by various mechanical and biochemical signals and is characterized by simultaneous actin polymerization at the ER and disassembly of cortical actin filaments. The ubiquity, sensitivity and conserved features of the observed Calcium-mediated Actin Reset (CaAR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) indicate that this is a fundamental response of mammalian cells. In agreement with this idea, we found that CaAR can act as a morphogenetic integrator during acute cellular perturbations, such as cell cortex damage and wound healing.</p><p>The highly synchronous kinetics of actin polymerization at the ER and actin disassembly at the cell cortex strongly suggests that competition for a common pool of actin monomers occurs between actin nucleators at the two locations. Such competition between different actin structures within the same cell has recently been demonstrated for fission yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suarez et al., 2015</xref>). Our stochastic model for CaAR shows that the extent and speed of actin reorganization at the cortex and ER can only be achieved if Ca<sup>2+</sup> simultaneously increases the rate of nucleation at the ER and the overall rate of actin depolymerization. Interestingly, the key regulator of CaAR, INF2, is a unique molecule that can at the same time stimulate actin nucleation, elongation, severing and depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gurel et al., 2015</xref>). We could validate our theoretical prediction, using a mutant INF2 with reduced depolymerization activity. Expression of this mutant in INF2 KO cells supported CaAR at much slower kinetics and reduced turnover. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated activation of INF2 could therefore account for all the experimentally observed kinetics. How then does calcium regulate INF2? We have found that INF2 binds to calmodulin, a highly abundant cellular regulator of calcium signaling. It will be interesting to test whether the calmodulin-INF2 interaction occurs directly, or via additional adaptor proteins such as IQGAP1. This protein has recently been shown to bind INF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartolini et al., 2016</xref>) and is a known interactor of calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that SRF/MRTF-dependent transcription is activated by Rho GTPase and mDia-mediated actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hill et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miralles et al., 2003</xref>). We have found that CaAR provides an alternative, INF2-mediated, mechanism for MRTF activation. Interestingly, although CaAR is independent of both Rho and serum, we find a strong overlap between CaAR-regulated and classical serum-induced genes. Many of the CaAR-induced genes are associated with cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion or signaling. This suggests a possible integration of transcriptional changes with the observed morphological effects of CaAR on actin protrusions, cortex repair and cell migration.</p><p>In summary, we have identified CaAR as a fundamental process linking Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, cell mechanics, actin dynamics and SRF-mediated transcription. Considering its basic constituents (calcium, actin), this process likely influences a multitude of signaling pathways and physiological processes. Thus, the observed consequences of CaAR should be considered when studying cellular perturbations that are linked to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The strong association of CaAR-induced genes with cancer, inflammation and stress point to exciting opportunities for future studies of CaAR in living organisms. Of particular note is a potential role of CaAR in kidney pathology, as INF2 is known to regulate actin dynamics in podocytes, and INF2 mutations are linked to hereditary kidney diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Cells were grown at 37°C with 10% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM-Glutamax-I; Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco).

We therefore considered two populations of polymerized actin (F-actin) coupled to a common pool of actin monomers (G-actin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We assumed that the available G-actin, characterized by the equivalent length <italic>L</italic><sub>G</sub> of actin into which it can potentially polymerize, is homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm. F-actin populations at the cortex and ER were modeled as ensembles of individual filaments. The state of these populations is characterized by their respective total lengths of polymerized actin, <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub>ER</sub>. Initially, we consider the cortical population in steady-state equilibrium with the G-actin pool. Nucleation at the ER is then activated and regulated by the calcium influx signal. The ER-mediated decrease in monomer availability in turn reduces polymerization at the cortex. Ongoing actin turnover will then drive cortical actin disassembly. When the calcium signal has dissipated, nucleation at the ER stops and ER actin disassembles. This restores the G-actin pool, allowing cortical actin to recover again.</p><sec id="s4-18-1"><title>Simulations of filament dynamics</title><p>Each actin filament is characterized by its length <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Using a mean-field description for this pre-stimulus system, a set of equations can be written describing the evolution of filament length density. Using the steady-state solution of this mean-field model, we find expressions for observables, such as filament number, actin turnover and cortical length, as a function of the steady-state size of the monomer pool. It can be shown that the total actin length for this system is conserved, which leads to a self-consistent equation for the steady-state G-actin length. With this solution, analytical observables for given model parameters can be compared to time-averaged values from simulations. We used this analytical model to validate our stochastic simulations. We studied the behavior of the steady-state as a function of different model parameters. In particular, we looked at the turnover time and the ratio of polymerized to monomeric (F/G) actin. The turnover time reflects how dynamic the cortical actin is and how fast it can reorganize. Since the amount of actin is conserved in the system, the steady-state F/G actin ratio reflects how limiting the monomer pool is when a competing F-actin population emerges.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18-5"><title>The effect of total available actin</title><p>We first examined the effect of the total amount of actin in the system, <italic>L</italic><sub>T</sub>, on the pre-stimulus steady state, given the cortical parameters shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.

If the available actin is limited, actin polymerization cannot overcome depolymerization, resulting in a low F/G ratio. For very large G-actin pools, nucleation rate and growth velocity approach constant values. The total cortical length therefore has an upper limit and surplus actin monomers only serve to decrease the F/G ratio. We found that there is a given amount of actin for which the fraction of polymerized actin in equilibrium is maximal, given a defined set of parameters. This maximal F/G ratio corresponds to the system with the smallest monomer pool and potentially with the fastest competition upon coupling with a second actin population at the ER. We therefore chose this case, with <italic>L</italic><sub>T</sub> = 4 <italic>L</italic><sub>s</sub>, to study the full model. The turnover time monotonically increases with <italic>L</italic><sub>T</sub>, with a saturation value corresponding to the saturation of growth speed. In our model the nucleation rate does not affect actin turnover. In steady state, the turnover time is equivalent to the time required for full polymerization of F-actin. The cortical half-time for the system with maximal F/G ratio is 12 s, which is in good agreement with half-times observed at the cortex for MCF-7 cells. This corresponds to a pre-stimulus system with 60% of actin in a polymerized state, which is consistent with published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suarez et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18-6"><title>Actin turnover</title><p>We next studied the influence of filament depolymerization, capping and severing on cortical actin turnover. We independently varied the respective parameter values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. Given that disassembly refills the G-actin pool, which in turn increases polymerization speed, the behavior of the turnover time is not trivial. If we assume that turnover changes monotonically in the studied parameter interval, we can estimate how strongly actin turnover depends on each rate in the physiologically relevant parameter range.</p><p>In order to simplify the comparison, we represent the varied parameter as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and its control rate in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

As expected, the cortical actin length does indeed show a more pronounced decrease in comparison to the results for the pool-size competition only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref> middle panel). The greater synchronization of the transition for all simulated parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref> lower panel) provides further confirmation of the proposed mechanism. Even if competition for a limited pool of G-actin does have an impact on the transition, as seen in the small variations across runs, the strongest influence on the cortical reaction comes from the enhancement of the overall depolymerization velocity. It should be noted that, although this has only a slight effect on ER actin assembly, a high nucleation activity ensures that rates of actin polymerization at the ER remain high. Moreover, the high turnover in the cell keeps high levels of G-actin available for polymerization, which screens the disassembly effect at the ER as long as the calcium signal is sufficiently strong.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18-10"><title>Simultaneous increase in severing and depolymerization</title><p>We further considered a calcium-mediated increase in the turnover due to a combined effect of enhanced filament depolymerization and a higher severing rate.

Introducing additional depolymerization acceleration clearly leads to a stronger and faster cortical decrease for any severing acceleration, as expected from the strong dependence of turnover on this parameter. This effect is greater for lower depolymerization since severing is length dependent. For a given value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf41"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>acc</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, extra severing also promotes higher cortical disassembly and reduces the delay with respect to ER actin polymerization. Thus the effect of a five-fold increase in the depolymerization rate can also be achieved by combining a three-fold increase in depolymerization velocity with a seven-fold increase in the severing rate. The increase in depolymerization velocity could be further reduced to two-fold if the severing rate was increased 10-fold. However, the effect of increased severing saturates at high severing acceleration, so filament depolymerization is always needed to some extent. Thus, we see that the observed transition kinetics can be reproduced by simultaneously introducing a moderate increase in depolymerization velocity and a more pronounced enhancement of severing activity. This is consistent with a mechanism that both fragments actin into shorter filaments and enhances pointed end depolymerization.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank H Oberleithner and A Schwab for access to the AFM microscope and for help with calcium measurements.

The process is reversed after a short period of time, which is termed as Calcium-mediated actin reset (CaAR). This fast and reversible actin reorganization process has recently been characterized by Shao et al., 2015 in PNAS. In the current study, Wales et al. provide detailed quantification with high temporal resolution for this process, and also generate a computational model of actin homeostasis as the mechanistic basis for CaAR. Moreover, the authors expanded the understanding of this intriguing process by documenting the molecular and cellular responses after CaAR activation. It is interesting to know that CaAR precedes and plays an important role in wound healing, when the cell membrane is damaged by laser ablation. At a longer timescale, CaAR induces expression of certain set of genes, presumably important for cellular adaptation to the environmental stresses. This study is interesting and provides novel insights into our understanding of cell stress and actin dynamics.</p><p>The actin homeostasis model to explain CaAR is only supported computationally. I do not see any experimental evidence for two pools of formin (cortex vs ER) competing for G-actin. Is there a simple experiment that can be done? i.e. increasing ER associated actin polymerization even in the absence of ionophores by knock down of cortical formin?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the present work, a global and general Calcium-dependent actin dynamics (CaAR) response is described and proposed to be required to reset the extent of actin polymerization/depolymerisation needed for various actin dependent processes including PM membrane repair, cell migration and MRTF transcription. The work extends, deepens and generalizes a set of initial, recently published, similar finding by the Shivashankar's group. Like in the previous work, INF2 is shown to be the key actin nucleator mediating the CaAR response. This notwithstanding, the manuscript advances our knowledge of a so far un-described phenomenon by showing some of the important biological consequences linked to this response.</p><p>One important issue, for which little information is provided is related to the mechanisms through which INF2 is controlled by Ca++ and how it may act in promoting a concomitant depolymerization and polymerization of actin. Numerical modelling suggests that the key to these effects rests in the competition between F and G actin amounts. Yet some additional, biochemical experiment appear necessary to support this contention and verify the model:</p><p>Mechanism of action of INF2.</p><p>INF2 actin polymerization activity is shown to be key for ER-actin polymerization and the ensuing cytosolic and cortical actin de-polymerisation. It is unclear however whether the acute elevation of any localized formin would lead to similar response. Is CaAR sensitive to the formin inhibitor Smith2? In other words, would any strongly, localized (to internal organelles) and activated actin nucleator lead to global and rapid actin dynamics changes?</p><p>It is also unclear whether INF2 localization to ER is a critical requirement for the CaAR response.</p><p>It is argued that: &quot;(Actin dynamics-CaAR responses) are consistent with a mechanism for CaAR based on simple competition between two polymerization activities for a common pool of actin monomers.&quot; However, it is also proposed that actin severing activity of INF2 might also be important for the process, but no experimental work is done to address this possibility. Numerical simulation supports the contention that the key factor of CaAR response is the result of a simple competition between two polymerization activities for a common pool of actin monomers. If this were the case than one obvious experiment to addressing this issue and verifying the validity of the numerical simulation would be the use of reconstitution of INF2 siRNA with a siRNA-resistant mutant (an experiment that has been done in the recent publication by Shao et al. PNAS 2015 thus showing its feasibility) that is impaired in severing, while it maintains its actin polymerization activity. In this respect, it was shown by Gurel et la CB, 2014 that a C-terminal region of INF2 increases severing potency by 40-fold, and that the WH2-resembling DAD motif is responsible for this increase.</p><p>How does Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase leads to activation of INF2? This issue remains unaddressed. Admittedly, various possibilities might be at play and discussion of how this might happen would at least be necessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this study, Wales et al. report a very generic response of mammalian cells to a sudden calcium influx, like that which occurs upon injury or following the addition of ATP or a calcium ionophore. This process, which they call &quot;Calcium-mediated actin reset&quot; is robust, relatively reproducible across cell types, rapid (seconds) and rapidly reversed (minutes). Importantly, the team shows that the process leads to an increase in actin filaments at ER and the nuclear envelope and a near-coincident decrease in cortical actin. Strikingly, both processes can be prevented by the silencing of INF2, an ER associated Formin in HeLa cells, suggesting that INF2 is responsible for the nucleation of the ER pool. Finally, they show that there is a longer term impact of this signalling on cells, leading to an INF2 dependent change in gene expression, which appears to be largely mediated via SRF as a result of the transient change in G/F actin levels. This may help to mediate longer term changes in F-actin organisation. Overall this is a very interesting finding that will interest a wide audience.</p><p>My major criticisms of the paper are:</p><p>1) That the images used could be more compelling and more of the image data could be better presented following quantification.</p><p>2) That there is too much data and some of it could be better served by a more detailed follow up analysis. This mostly applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, which whilst interesting do not throw much light on the process of caAR itself. Moreover, these latter experiments are not very well controlled and do not distinguish between INF2-dependent effects / the impact of actin on cortical-ER vs the actin cortex itself, and other possible effects of these perturbations.</p><p>3) Not enough has been done to test whether INF2 is really required <italic>both</italic> for nucleation and accelerated actin turnover as suggested. Nucleation and competition for G-actin seem simpler explanations. Whilst the model may suggest a need for accelerated turnover, the authors don't have a great tool by which to test this since the treatments (e.g. INF2 RNAi) may affect one or both processes. But, it is hard to understand how ER-localized INF2 directly induces cortical actin turnover, while enabling the accumulation of actin at the ER. Finally, given that there is a LOSS of G actin, the increased actin turnover idea doesn’t seem especially compelling.</p><p>Therefore, I would suggest:</p><p>1) Main Figures be simplified to make them less crowded, with better labels and easier to read. For example, 2E-G are very hard to understand and are not very convincing as presented. Some could be replaced with quantitative data.</p><p>2) Some supplemental data can be removed (this doesn't mean you have to remove the authors who generated it).</p><p>3) I would remove <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6 and 7</xref>. I would also consider removing the model and the AFM data, not of which add much to the story.</p><p>4) The authors either prove the INF2 plays a role in turnover or stick to ER-nucleation. I would suggest focusing on nucleation and keep the story simple.</p><p>With a few tweaks the paper would make a great addition to <italic>eLife</italic> and the literature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19850.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>The referees concurred that your work has uncovered an interesting phenomenon of how actin cytoskeleton undergoes a rapid and transient morphological change upon stress and how calcium mediated activation of IFN2 participates in the actin cytoskeletal reorganization (CaAR).</italic> </p><p><italic>They all concur that you need to make a further advance on calcium regulation of IFN2 and its dual role in actin polymerization and depolymerization.

To address the major criticism we have now performed the following new experiments:</p><p>1) We have teamed up with the group of Britta Qualmann and Michael Kessels, who have found that INF2 interacts with calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner. These results are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> (Results subsection “CaAR is driven by INF2-mediated actin polymerization”, second paragraph and Discussion, second paragraph.</p><p>2) We have performed the rescue experiment that was suggested by reviewer 2 but have used a CRSPR/Cas9 knock out strategy rather than siRNA-mediated knock down to obtain cleaner results.

Our new results provide strong validation for our theoretical model.</p><p>3) Again using INF2 KO cells and rescue experiments with different INF2 isoforms, we found that both, ER-resident and cytosolic INF2 were able to support CaAR.</p><p><italic>There are also concerns by all referees about the organization and presentation of the figures and have suggested ways to improve the figures.</italic> </p><p>We have addressed all of the issues raised with figure presentation.</p><p><italic>The referees’ comments are appended verbatim for your benefit.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>The actin homeostasis model to explain CaAR is only supported computationally.

Is there a simple experiment that can be done? i.e. increasing ER associated actin polymerization even in the absence of ionophores by knock down of cortical formin?</italic> </p><p>We apologize that we didn´t make this point clear enough in our manuscript. We postulate competition between the calcium- and INF2-mediated actin polymerization and all other (mostly cortical) nucleators in the cell that are active independent of intracellular calcium, including Arp2/3 and various formins. The presence of such cortical nucleators has been extensively documented in the past. In addition, we find that cortical actin returns at the time where INF2 activity is very low (no Ca<sup>2+</sup> left). Using CRSPR/Cas9 we have removed INF2 from HeLa cells and now show that cortical actin is not severely reduced by this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We now also provide evidence that ER localization of INF2 is not required for CaAR (rescue of INF2 KO with cytosolic isoform, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Finally, in support of our competition model we have now included new results using rescue of the INF2 KO in HeLa cells with a depolymerization defective INF2 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-G</xref>). A mutant in the WH2 domain (less severing activity) leads to slower overall reaction of CaAR while maintain regulation through Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These results now provide quantitative validations of our theoretical assumptions (see answer to main point of reviewer 2).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>One important issue, for which little information is provided is related to the mechanisms through which INF2 is controlled by Ca++ and how it may act in promoting a concomitant depolymerization and polymerization of actin.

To address this important issue we have generated extensive new data on the mechanism of INF2-mediated actin polymerization during CaAR. We now show that INF2 binds to calmodulin in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), providing a possible molecular link to its strong Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation. In addition, we have generated INF2-KO cells using CRSPR/Cas9 and performed rescue experiments with various INF2 mutants, to differentiate between polymerization and depolymerization activities of INF2. Those results are now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-G</xref>.</p><p><italic>INF2 actin polymerization activity is shown to be key for ER-actin polymerization and the ensuing cytosolic and cortical actin de-polymerisation.

In other words, would any strongly, localized (to internal organelles) and activated actin nucleator lead to global and rapid actin dynamics changes?</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting point. We had shown in the original manuscript that constitutive active INF2 (A1549D mutant) leads to permanent polymerization of actin at the ER indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are not required for this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We now added experiments to show that ER localization is not required for CaAR. In fact, the cytosolic isoform of INF2 can equally support CaAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Whether INF2 has unique properties that permit its function as reversible competitor is an interesting aspect. Our results using a depolymerization-deficient INF2 variant indicate that rapid reorganization of actin might require not only Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated polymerization but also Ca-activated depolymerization. Using the established KO-rescue-system we plan to further unravel the details of INF2 activities during CaAR in the future. We have also performed experiments with SMIFH2 and found that CaAR was not affected by the drug, despite the published effects of SMIFH2 on INF2. However, as we can currently not exclude cell type, time or concentration dependent effects we decided not to include these data in our manuscript.</p><p><italic>It is also unclear whether INF2 localization to ER is a critical requirement for the CaAR response.</italic> </p><p>We now show that the cytosolic INF2 isoform can also support CaAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p><italic>It is argued that: &quot;(Actin dynamics-CaAR responses) are consistent with a mechanism for CaAR based on simple competition between two polymerization activities for a common pool of actin monomers.&quot; However, it is also proposed that actin severing activity of INF2 might also be important for the process, but no experimental work is done to address this possibility.

However, we indeed did not provide experimental validation for the predicted Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated increase in depolymerization. We now performed the experiment suggested by the reviewer. We were able to rescue INF2 knock down by siRNA with resistant INF2 constructs (not shown). However, the variable reduction of INF2 in knock down experiments makes quantitative interpretations inherently difficult. We therefore decided to completely knock out INF2 via CRSPR/Cas9 and rescue the knock out cells with the depolymerization-deficient INF2 mutant (3L) from Gurel et al. that was suggested by reviewer 2. Consistent with an important role for INF2 depolymerization during CaAR, we found a significant slowdown and reduced amplitude of turnover at both, the ER and cell cortex in the 3L mutant. The new results are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-G</xref>. We thank the reviewer for his very helpful suggestion. Our new results provided strong validation for the theoretical model and show the strength of an interdisciplinary approach.</p><p><italic>How does Ca2+ increase leads to activation of INF2? This issue remains unaddressed. Admittedly, various possibilities might be at play and discussion of how this might happen would at least be necessary.</italic> </p><p>This is an important aspect of CaAR. We now included new results showing that INF2 interacts with calmodulin in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), providing a potential molecular mechanism for INF2 regulation. Whether in the cell this interaction occurs directly or via additional adaptor proteins will be a matter of future studies. We now discuss this aspect in the second paragraph of the subsection “CaAR is driven by INF2-mediated actin polymerization”.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>My major criticisms of the paper are:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) That the images used could be more compelling and more of the image data could be better presented following quantification.</italic> </p><p>We have gone through all figures.

We have tried to include quantifications wherever possible.</p><p><italic>2) That there is too much data and some of it could be better served by a more detailed follow up analysis. This mostly applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, which whilst interesting do not throw much light on the process of caAR itself. Moreover, these latter experiments are not very well controlled and do not distinguish between INF2-dependent effects / the impact of actin on cortical-ER vs the actin cortex itself, and other possible effects of these perturbations.</italic> </p><p>We agree that we have not formally proven that the observed effects on cell protrusions are indeed dependent on INF2 or CaAR. We did however show a very tight temporal correlation and showed that all protrusions formed within seconds of the return of actin to the cell cortex. As the strong effects on cell protrusions and cell migration will likely be interesting to a wide audience and provide interesting links to the long-term effects on transcription, we decided to retain these parts in the manuscript. As discussed in our response to reviewer 2 we clearly state the weaker link between CaAR and cellular protrusions (subsection “CaAR mediates acute cellular reorganization”, first paragraph) and reduced the emphasis on this aspect (removed Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><p><italic>3) Not enough has been done to test whether INF2 is really required both for nucleation and accelerated actin turnover as suggested. Nucleation and competition for G-actin seem simpler explanations. Whilst the model may suggest a need for accelerated turnover, the authors don't have a great tool by which to test this since the treatments (e.g. INF2 RNAi) may affect one or both processes. But, it is hard to understand how ER-localized INF2 directly induces cortical actin turnover, while enabling the accumulation of actin at the ER. Finally, given that there is a LOSS of G actin, the increased actin turnover idea doesn’t seem especially compelling.</italic> </p><p>To address this important issue that was also raised by reviewer 2 we have performed rescue experiments expressing various INF2 mutants in INF2 KO cells. These experiments have shown that cytosolic INF2 can also support CaAR and that the depolymerization activity of INF2 (residing in its WH2 domains) is essential to achieve the rapid and strong reorganization typical for CaAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-G</xref>). To keep our conclusion from the model simple, we now removed the aspects of synchrony between ER and cortex changes and on the involved G-actin levels, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>Therefore, I would suggest:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Main Figures be simplified to make them less crowded, with better labels and easier to read. For example, 2E-G are very hard to understand and are not very convincing as presented.

I would also consider removing the model and the AFM data, not of which add much to the story.</italic> </p><p>We think these parts cover very important aspects of CaAR. With the new data on the INF2 depolymerization mutant the model has been experimentally validated and is now a much stronger component of the story (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-G</xref>). The AFM data nicely complements our results on cell freezing, which further underscores the reset aspect of CaAR and provides important implications in the context of PM damage and cell stress response. The panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> regarding a role of CaAR during PM sealing are central to the physiological role of CaAR and should definitely stay. As discussed above and in our response to reviewer 2, we also would like to keep the correlative data on cell protrusions/cell migration in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The authors either prove the INF2 plays a role in turnover or stick to ER-nucleation. I would suggest focusing on nucleation and keep the story simple.</italic> </p><p>We have now complemented INF2 KO HeLa cells with a depolymerization deficient INF2 mutant that strongly affects CaAR kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E-G</xref>, see above). These new results strongly support the proposed dual role of INF2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
