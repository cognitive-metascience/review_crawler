Mof is the enzymatic subunit of two different HAT complexes, MSL and NSL. The individual contribution of MSL and NSL to transcription regulation in mESCs is not well understood. Our genome-wide analysis show that i) MSL and NSL bind to specific and common sets of expressed genes, ii) NSL binds exclusively at promoters, iii) while MSL binds in gene bodies. Nsl1 regulates proliferation and cellular homeostasis of mESCs. MSL is the main HAT acetylating H4K16 in mESCs, is enriched at many mESC-specific and bivalent genes. MSL is important to keep a subset of bivalent genes silent in mESCs, while developmental genes require MSL for expression during differentiation. Thus, NSL and MSL HAT complexes differentially regulate specific sets of expressed genes in mESCs and during differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02104.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02104.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02104.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Embryonic stem cells are special cells that have the ability to become many different types of cells, such as skin, muscle, or neuronal cells. This process is called differentiation. They can also undergo a process called self-renewal to produce more embryonic stem cells. These processes are controlled by a complex network of enzymes, and the production of these enzymes depends on various genes within the organism being expressed as proteins.</p><p>The DNA that holds the genetic information inside cells spends most of its time wrapped around proteins called histones: this allows the DNA molecules—which can be up to several metres long in some species—to fit inside the cell nucleus; it also protects the DNA molecules, which are quite fragile, from damage. Enzymes that attach chemical groups called acetyl groups to histones have a central role in controlling the self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem cells.</p><p>Mof is an enzyme that attaches an acetyl group to a specific position in a particular histone. It is a subunit within two larger protein complexes that were originally identified in flies: the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, which is only found in male flies, and the non-specific lethal (NSL) complex, which is found in both male and female flies. These complexes have been widely studied in flies, and the role of the Mof enzyme is also reasonably well understood in mammals. However, the roles of the MSL and NSL protein complexes in mammals are not fully understood.</p><p>Ravens et al. have now used a combination of a technique called ChIP-seq (which can identify binding sites anywhere in the genome) and genetic ‘knock down’ experiments to explore the roles of these two complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells.</p><p>There is some overlap between the genes that the complexes act on. However, NSL acts on some genes than MSL does not act on, and vice versa. NSL mostly acts on genes that have ‘housekeeping’ functions and are expressed in many different cell types. MSL binds more to genes that are specific to embryonic stem cells, and acts on genes required for the development of neuronal progenitor cells. This means that NSL regulates the growth of embryonic stem cells, whereas MSL controls their development and differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02104.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02104.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>histone acetyltransferase</kwd><kwd>Mof (KAT8)</kwd><kwd>H4K16ac</kwd><kwd>pluripotency</kwd><kwd>bivalent domain</kwd><kwd>ChIP-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche (L’ Agence Nationale de la Recherche)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-09-BLAN-0266; ANR-09-BLAN-0052, Investissements ANR-10-IDEX-0002-02: ANR-10-LABX-0030-INRT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tora</surname><given-names>Làszlò</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two complexes that contain the histone acetyl transferase MOF have distinct regulatory roles in the growth and development of pluripotent embryonic stem cells</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) have the ability to self-renew or to differentiate into all cell types. Specific transcription factors like Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog form a core transcriptional network, which is required for the maintenance of mESC pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Orkin et al., 2008</xref>). Chromatin-modifying enzymes further regulate transcriptional mESCs networks and cellular differentiation processes and can be associated with activation or repression of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Orkin and Hochedlinger, 2011</xref>). Histone acetylation is important for mESC pluripotency and is regulated by the concerted action of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meshorer and Misteli, 2006</xref>). Acetylation of histone proteins leads to an open and dynamic chromatin conformation allowing an active transcription state, which is also a signature of mESC pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meshorer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Niwa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Efroni et al., 2008</xref>). During differentiation of mESCs, the overall transcription rates decrease, whereas the chromatin structure becomes more compact with a global reduction of histone H3 and H4 acetylation. In line with the requirement of histone acetylation in mESC maintenance and differentiation, genetic deletion or knockdown of several HATs affects mESC pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fazzio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gupta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhong and Jin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>HATs can be classified into two predominant families: the GCN5-related <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family (i.e. Gcn5 and p300) and the Moz-Ybf2/Sas3-Sas2-Tip60 (MYST) family (i.e., Tip60 and Mof [male absent on the first]) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimura et al., 2005</xref>). These enzymes often function as part of multi-protein co-activator complexes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee and Workman, 2007</xref>). Mof (also known as Kat8 or Myst1), is a MYST-type HAT specific for histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hilfiker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taipale et al., 2005</xref>) and has been shown to be the catalytic subunit of two distinct protein complexes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (d) and mammals: the male-specific lethal (MSL) and the non-specific lethal (NSL) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mendjan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raja et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the dMSL complex is targeted to transcribed regions of male X-chromosomal genes, where it mediates dosage compensation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Straub and Becker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gelbart and Kuroda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conrad and Akhtar, 2011</xref>). In contrast, dNSL is present at gene promoters of male and female chromosomes, where it regulates transcription of housekeeping genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prestel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raja et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lam et al., 2012</xref>). Mof itself and subunits of the Mof-containing dMSL and dNSL HAT complexes are required for the binding of the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mof-containing complexes at promoters and gene bodies, which leads to H4K16 acetylation and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raja et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kadlec et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>Inactivation of Mof</italic> in mice (m) leads to early embryonic lethality as <italic>Mof</italic><sup>−/−</sup> embryos fail to develop beyond the expanded blastocyst stage and die at implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gupta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>). Mof deletion correlated with cell cycle defects and cell death. Moreover, mESCs could not be derived from <italic>Mof</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse embryos. In agreement, it was shown that Mof plays an essential role in the maintenance of mESC pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>). H4K16 acetylation levels were undetectable in <italic>Mof</italic><sup>−/−</sup> embryos, whereas the acetylation of other histone lysine residues was unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>). Surprisingly, loss of H4K16 acetylation upon neuronal differentiation of mESCs did not alter higher-order chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover H4K16ac and Mof were reported to be present at the transcription start sites (TSSs) of expressed genes in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Details on the function of the mammalian Mof-containing MSL and NSL complexes have only recently started to emerge and revealed that Mof fulfils different functions within the two HAT complexes. Human (h) MSL complex is composed of the subunits MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, and MOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mendjan et al., 2006</xref>), while the hNSL complex is composed of nine subunits: NSL1, NSL2, NSL3, MCRS1, WDR5, PHF20, HCF1, OGT1, and MOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mendjan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2010</xref>). Mammalian NSL complex appears to have broader substrate specificity than the MSL complex, as it is also able to acetylate non-histone targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2009</xref>). However, the function of MSL and NSL complexes in mammalian cells and especially their role in establishing mESC pluripotency in not well understood.</p><p>To better understand the role of MSL and NSL in gene regulation and their individual contribution in epigenetic changes in mESCs, we have analysed these two Mof-containing complexes by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and by shRNA knockdown (KD) experiments in mESCs. The obtained genome-wide binding maps show that MSL and NSL locate to a large number of expressed genes and each complex has a distinct binding profile at promoters or gene bodies. Our combined ChIP-seq and KD data indicate that MSL and NSL have a combinatorial effect on a given set of genes, whereas some specific loci are only MSL- or only NSL-dependent. Our data indicate that NSL binds exclusively at promoters, while MSL binds more in gene bodies. We show that in mESCs NSL regulates cell growth whereas MSL is the main HAT complex acetylating histone H4K16. MSL is present at mESC-specific genes. Moreover, MSL binds to and regulates developmental genes in mESCs and during differentiation. Altogether our data demonstrate that MSL and NSL complexes are present at expressed genes in mESCs, but that MSL is essential for regulation of key mESC-specific and bivalent developmental genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Both Msl1 or Nsl1 incorporate in their respective Mof-containing HAT complexes in mESCs</title><p>To understand the global role of the two Mof-containing complexes in chromatin remodelling and how this regulates genes linked to self-renewal, proliferation, and/or differentiation, we set out to analyse the genome-wide binding of MSL and NSL in mESCs. To this end, we raised antibodies targeting Msl1 or Nsl1, which are specific subunits of the MSL or NSL complexes, respectively, and are known to play a role in the assembly and the regulation of these complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raja et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kadlec et al., 2011</xref>). The specificity of the purified antibodies was demonstrated by western blot assays and immunoprecipitations followed by mass spectrometry using the multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Western blot assays indicated that both of the generated antibodies are specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In addition, both antibodies immunoprecipitated (IP-ed) the endogenous MSL and NSL complexes with the previously described polypeptide composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, Mof was identified in both IP-ed MSL or NSL complexes, in the same range of abundance than Msl1, or Nsl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> for all identified proteins by MudPIT). Gel filtration followed by western blot analyses further indicated that Msl1 and Nsl1 are only present in Mof-containing complexes as they have eluted from the Superose 6 column in the same molecular weight containing fractions as their respective entire endogenous MSL (about 240 kDa), or NSL (about 800 kDa) complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Of note the enzymatic subunit Mof was detected in the respective MSL and NSL complexes, but in addition as a potentially free form in the 50 kDa range fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results together demonstrate the incorporation of all nuclear Msl1, or Nsl1, together with Mof, in their respective endogenous complexes and a fraction of ‘free’ Mof that is not present in either MSL or NSL.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02104.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Msl1 and Nsl1 incorporate into endogenous complexes in mESCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Western Blot analysis using the raised anti-Msl1 (3208) or anti-Nsl1 (3130) antibodies on nuclear extracts.

The Msl1 and Nsl1 enrichments at five different loci as detected by ChIP-qPCR faithfully reflected the tag densities measured by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). To further verify the specificity of the Msl1 and Nsl1 ChIP-seq results, we used lentiviral small hairpin (sh) RNA vectors to knockdown (KD) Msl1 or Nsl1 in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>) and tested by ChIP-qPCR the decrease of Msl1 or Nsl1 binding at the TSSs and in the GBs of two genes that were co-bound by these factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E,D</xref>). The predominant binding of Msl1 to GBs was lost upon Msl1 KD, whereas Nsl1 binding to TSS was reduced following Nsl1 depletion. These results confirm our ChIP-seq analyses.</p><p>Next, we asked whether the two complexes bind to common or different loci. A pairwise comparison of the MSL or NSL enrichment at all high confidence binding loci revealed that the binding of both complexes show two populations and have a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.23 (p-value=1.88 × 10<sup>−160</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This indicates a significant overlap between Msl1 and Nsl1 binding populations, but suggests also a differential genome-wide binding of MSL and NSL. To know at which genomic regions the identified peaks localize, each peak was annotated either to promoter, GB (containing introns, exons, untranslated regions and transcription termination sites together) or intergenic regions. 74% of all Msl1 peaks are detected at GBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the majority of identified Nsl1 peaks are present at promoter regions (67%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, only about 10% of all Msl1- or Nsl1-binding sites map to intergenic regions (as defined above, excluding introns). The majority of the 9890 Msl1-, or 6251 Nsl1-specific binding sites are at promoter and/or GB regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and after removal of redundant genes, we defined 5844 Msl1- and 4755 Nsl1-bound genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>).

In good agreement with our results showing that in mESCs Msl1 and Nsl1 incorporate in the endogenous MSL or NSL complexes, respectively, genome-wide Mof binding overlaps with that of Msl1 and Nsl1 around most of the TSSs, which are also H4K16ac positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, at promoters, MSL and NSL complexes have distinct binding profiles. Nsl1 and Mof show a sharp binding peak centred at the TSSs, while the average Msl1 binding profile is similar to H4K16ac (see below) and extends downstream from the TSSs in the GB regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, the Msl1 and Mof signals are enriched downstream of promoters at GBs, whereas the control and the Nsl1 signals are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Altogether our results demonstrate that MSL and NSL bind mostly to distinct sites in mESCs.

Msl1- or Nsl1-positive genes were divided into five categories according to their expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). As a control, in the same five categories densities of Pol II peaks at promoters correlated with gene expression with decreasing Pol II densities from highly to poorly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barski et al., 2007</xref>).

In contrast, there is no significant difference of the Nsl1 median values between the five groups, indicating that Nsl1-binding to promoters is not proportional with the level of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Our results thus demonstrate that both Msl1 and Nsl1 bind to active genes, but that only the binding strength of Msl1, and not that of Nsl1, correlates with mRNA levels, suggesting a different dynamic and/or functional behaviour of the two complexes at the regulated loci.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The localization of MSL, but not that of NSL, overlaps with the presence of H4K16ac</title><p>As H4K16 is a known target of Mof in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hilfiker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taipale et al., 2005</xref>), we compared Msl1 or Nsl1 binding sites with the presence of H4K16ac. Our scatter plot analyses indicate that there is a general overlap of Msl1 or Nsl1 with H4K16ac, whereas the correlation between Msl1 binding sites and H4K16ac is better (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.57) than between Nsl1 and H4K16ac (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.32), which is also reflected in the corresponding p-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). The comparison of the distribution patterns of Msl1, Nsl1, Pol II and H4K16ac around the TSSs (±2 kb) of all Msl1- and Nsl1-bound genes further indicates that the Msl1 binding profile is more similar to the genome-wide presence of H4K16ac, than that of Nsl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

To address this question, we analysed the global acetylation of H4K16 after Msl1 or Nsl1 KD and also quantified acetylation of H4K5 and H4K8, two other proposed substrates for hNSL in differentiated human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2010</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) As the reduction of cell numbers under the KD conditions was not due to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we next carried out cell cycle analyses. These FACS measurements demonstrated that mESCs treated with shMSL1, shNsl1 and shMsl1/shNsl1 accumulate in the G1-phase of the cell cycle, with shNsl1 and shMsl1/shNsl1 being more severe than shMsl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results together suggest that Nsl1 might be more required for regulating housekeeping genes involved in cellular homeostasis of mESCs, as reflected in higher number of G1-phase cells and decreased cell proliferation of shNsl1 and shMsl1/Nsl1 mESCs.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02104.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>NSL influences cell growth and cell cycle of mESCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell proliferation analyses by cell counting over 6 days of control, or indicated KD mESCs.

Note however, that the relatively weak overlap between Msl1- and/or Nsl1-bound genes on one side and Msl1- and/or Nsl1-regulated genes on the other, may reflect that either the KDs were not sufficiently efficient, and/or that the global gene expression analysis detected only changes in the steady state levels of the mature mRNAs and not the changes in the neosynthesized pre-mRNAs. Along these lines, in our experimental system Msl1, or Nsl1 single, or double KD mESCs do not loose Oct4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), a common marker of mESC pluripotency.</p><p>Since MSL and NSL are transcriptional co-activators, we were interested in the biological function of downregulated genes upon KD of either Msl1 or Nsl1.

Analysing the biological function of Msl1, Nsl1, or Mof downregulated genes, we observed GO terms like metabolic processes, gene expression, cell death, or cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, only downregulated genes in <italic>Mof</italic> KO mESCs are significantly enriched for GO terms like stem cell differentiation or maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

Moreover, these genes are bound by Msl1 and Mof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Moreover, the gel filtration experiment indicated the potential existence of ‘free’ Mof that may not be present in either MSL or NSL. Together, the proteomic analyses suggest that there is no free Msl1 or Nsl1 in the nuclei of mESCs and that Msl1 and Nsl1 are specific to the MSL and NSL complexes, respectively.</p><p>This observation is important for our study as it indicates that the ChIP binding profiles obtained with either anti-Msl1 or anti-Nsl1 antibodies represent the behaviour of the corresponding endogenous Mof-containing MSL, or NSL HAT complexes. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with previous observations, which suggested that Msl1 and Nsl1 directly interact with Mof in their respective complexes, to stabilize the assembly of these complexes and to regulate their HAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raja et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kadlec et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Similarly to <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prestel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raja et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kadlec et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lam et al., 2012</xref>), our results demonstrate that mouse MSL and NSL have mainly distinct binding profiles at transcribed genes in mESCs. NSL binding overlaps with Pol II binding and DHSs at TSSs, while MSL locates more downstream of promoters towards the GB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These evolutionary conserved binding profiles further suggest that the function of the MSL and NSL complexes in transcriptional regulation are also conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>MSL is the main H4K16 HAT in mESC</title><p>Surprisingly, in mESCs the KD of Msl1, but not that of Nsl1, leads to a global loss of H4K16ac, without reducing H4K5ac and H4K8ac levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In differentiated human cells Mof, and subunits of MSL (i.e. Msl1, Msl3) or the Nsl1 subunit of NSL have been reported to be crucial for global H4K16 acetylation by either MSL or NSL, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, while the subunit composition of the two Mof-containing MSL and NSL complexes is conserved between mESCs and differentiated human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2010</xref>), the function of the NSL complex seems to be differently regulated in pluripotent mESCs than in differentiated cells. Our observation that the KD of the Nsl1 subunit of NSL does not abolish global H4K16ac levels in mESCs suggests that in these pluripotent cells NSL may have a very localized HAT activity around TSSs of bound genes and the acetylation at these loci cannot be detected in total histone preparations, in contrary to the Msl1 KD. This difference may also be due to the more dynamic recruitment of NSL by mESC-specific factors. In contrast to MSL, NSL binding to promoters does not correlate with RNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). This further suggests that the two Mof-containing complexes have different mechanisms of action in transcriptional regulation in mESCs. Moreover, the depletion of MSL function is supposed to recapitulate those chromatin perturbations and related cellular changes that are caused by the Mof KO and are linked to H4K16ac loss.</p><p>Strikingly, the gene expression of only a small number of MSL or NSL bound genes was directly affected when either Msl1 or Nsl1 was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). This might be due to either inefficient KDs, or the measurement of steady-state mature mRNA levels under our experimental conditions. As contrary to Msl1 and Nsl1, ‘free’ Mof was detected in mESC nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we cannot exclude the possibility that to certain extent Mof alone could compensate for the function of the MSL or NSL complex under Nsl1 and Msl1 KD conditions. However, the abolished global H4K16ac levels in shMsl1 mESCs would rather propose that other transcriptional co-activators, modifying other histone residues than H4K16, could compensate the role of H4K16ac in transcriptional activation.</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrating that MSL is the main HAT complex responsible for global H4K16ac in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), together with the finding that genome-wide binding profiles of Msl1 and Mof overlap with H4K16ac, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) suggest that the co-activator role of MSL is linked to its H4K16 acetylation function at the bound genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>MSL and NSL have different functions in pluripotent mESCs</title><p>The transitions between distinct chromatin states, from the open acetylated chromatin of the pluripotent mESCs to the more compact deacetylated chromatin of the differentiated cells, suggest the requirement for a tightly regulated chromatin acetylating/deactylating balance that participates in defining pluripotency on one hand and the consequent commitments for distinct differentiation pathways on the other hand. The HAT Mof is important for mESC pluripotency. Mof-deficient embryos have slight cell cycle defects and undergo cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>). Under our experimental conditions, KD of Msl1 and Nsl1 alone or together did not affect expression of key transcription factors of the pluripotency network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our observation that in mESCs Nsl1 KD leads to decreased cell numbers during proliferation and an increase in cells in the G1-phase of the cell cycle shows that NSL might influence mESC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). This further indicates that NSL might be required for the homeostasis of mESC, either by directly regulating transcription or through acetylation of non-histone targets.</p><p>H4K16ac was shown to promote chromatin fibre decompaction in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robinson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allahverdi et al., 2011</xref>). Our data showing that Msl1 KD abolishes global H4K16ac levels, together with the aberrant chromatin compaction observed in the Mof-deficient embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>), suggest that the MSL complex is an important factor in establishing high acetylation levels required for more open chromatin conformation and consequent mESC pluripotency. In addition to its role as a general regulator of H4K16ac in mESCs, the MSL complex seems to be recruited to ESC-specific loci to regulate different steps in the transcription process, such as (i) chromatin accessibility, (ii) pre-initiation complex formation and/or (iii) Pol II transcription elongation rates. Importantly, the Msl1-bound mESC-specific genes are regulated by Mof. Note however, these Mof- and Msl1-bound and Mof-regulated genes were not affected by the KD of Msl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). As above explained this may be due to the different experimental systems used here and the <italic>Mof</italic> KO study. Nevertheless, we assume that these genes are regulated by the whole MSL complex. Altogether, the exclusive co-binding of Msl1 and Mof to pluripotency genes suggests that the MSL complex is a regulator of the pluripotency network in mESCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>MSL is required at bivalent genes to silence them in pluripotent ESCs and to upregulate them during ESCs differentiation</title><p>Bivalent genes, which are either repressed or expressed at very low levels in mESCs can be directly upregulated or completely silenced upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azuara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>). So far, little is known about the function of HATs at bivalent genes. Interestingly, we show that a subset of bivalent genes (about 350 genes) is bound by MSL in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and consequently that the KD of Msl1 results in the upregulation of a subset of bivalent genes in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Consistent with our study, Mof has also been shown to be present at bivalent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>). It seems that the MSL complex, probably in concert with HDACs and/or other chromatin remodelling factors, can have a silencing function at these bivalent genes. In contrast, the same genes require MSL for expression during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Even though the morphology of NPCs was not obviously influenced under Msl1 KD conditions, expression of key developmental NPC genes, such as Pax6 and Hes5, were downregulated during NPC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Thus, our findings together with the observation that Mof is also binding to bivalent genes in mESCs, strongly suggests that the presence of MSL at bivalent loci is important for keeping these bivalent genes poised in pluripotent mESCs, allowing a quick transcriptional upregulation of the same genes during mESC differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Summary</title><p>In summary, MSL and NSL are key transcriptional co-activators at a large number of expressed genes in mESCs, whereas each complex has a distinct binding profile either at promoters (NSL) or gene bodies (MSL). MSL and NSL have overlapping and distinct roles in transcriptional regulation in mESCs. NSL binds mostly to genes with housekeeping functions and mediates mESC proliferation suggesting that NSL is important for the cellular homeostasis of mESCs. MSL is the main acetyltransferase complex acetylating H4K16. Moreover, MSL binds to mESC-specific genes, which are de-regulated in <italic>Mof</italic> ablated mESCs. Moreover MSL is present at bivalent domains in mESCs, where it may poise genes for activation during mESC differentiation. Importantly, expression of those genes is directly regulated by MSL in differentiated NPCs. In the future, it will be interesting to investigate how the genome-wide function of MSL and NSL changes during distinct mESC differentiation pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Wild-type male mESCs (E14.wt) were cultivated on 0.1% gelatine (Sigma, France) and CD1 feeder cells (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in DMEM (4.5 g/l glucose) w-Glutamax-I, 15% foetal calf serum ESC-tested, leukemia inhibiting factor (5 μg) (Sigma), 50 mM ß-Mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen, France), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 200 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), and non-essential amino acids (GIBCO, France).

In summary, protein mixtures were TCA precipitated, urea-denaturated, reduced, alkylated, and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche) followed by modified trypsin digestion (Promega). Peptide mixtures were loaded onto a triphasic 100 μm diameter fused silica microcapillary column described as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDonald and Yates, 2002</xref>). Loaded microcapillary columns were placed in-line with a Quaternary Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC pump and a LTQ Velos linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization source (ThermoFischerScientific). A fully automated 12-steps MudPIT run was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Florens et al., 2006</xref>) during which each full MS scan (from 300 to 1700 m/z range) was followed by 20 MS/MS events using data-dependent acquisition. Proteins were identified by database searching using SEQUEST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eng et al., 1994</xref>) within ThermoProteome Discoverer 1.3 and 1.4 (ThermoFischerScientific). Tandem mass spectra were searched against a <italic>Mus musculus</italic> protein sequence database containing 16,604 entries (from the Swissprot 2013-04-03 release). In all searches, cysteine residues were considered to be fully carboxyamidomethylated (+57 Da statically added) and methionine considered to be oxidized (+16 Da dynamically added). Proteins were considered as specific in a given IP data set if they were absent or 10-fold minimum enriched as compared to a MOCK IP, performed on the same protein input by using a non-specific antibody targeting yeast TAF90. Relative protein abundance for each protein in either the anti-Msl1, or the anti-Nsl1 IPs was estimated by the calculation of a Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor (NSAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zybailov et al., 2006</xref>). NSAF values were calculated from the spectral counts of each identified protein. To account for the fact that following enzymatic digestion larger proteins result in more peptides/spectras than small proteins, each given spectral count was divided by the corresponding protein length to provide a spectral abundance factor (SAF). To obtain NSAF, SAF values were normalized against the sum of all SAF values in the corresponding run. Thus, NSAF values obtained from a given protein mixture, such as immunoprecipitated protein complexes, allow the comparison of the abundance of a given protein/subunit to another in the same mixture/complex.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Gel filtration</title><p>For gel filtration a Superose 6 (10/300) column pre-equilibrated in 25 mM Tris pH 7.9, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2,</sub> 150 mM KCl, and 5% Glycerol was used. 250 μl calibration mix containing Dextran Blue (2 MDa) and Biorad calibration kit (ref 151-1901) with marker sizes of 670 kDa, 158 kDa, 44 kDa, 17 kDa, and 1.35 kDa were injected at 0.3 μl/min. 500 μl of mESC nuclear extract containing 1 mg protein was injected and run at 0.3 μl/min. 40 fractions were collected and analysed by western blot.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were generally supportive of the paper but felt that there were still some fairly significant issues that would need to be addressed before the paper could be considered for publication. Most important relate to the biological functions of the complexes. What is the phenotype of the Msl1 or Nsl1 knockdown and how does this compare to Mof knockdown/depletion? Is all the Mof really in the NSL or MSL complex, as you claim? If you can address the reviewers’ comments (summarized below) in a timely manner we would be happy to consider a revised version.</p><p>1) Genetic mutation of Mof has a lethal phenotype in mice and ES cells. The authors apply depletion of Msl1 and Nsl1 but do not seem to provide data on how these affect stem cell behaviour. Self-renewal and differentiation potential need to be analysed carefully. Also if lethality is caused by loss of either complexes (NSL or MSL, the latter more likely seems to be the major factor in ES cells) then changes in gene expression could be due to cell death. This needs to be carefully considered and discussed. Alternatively, does combined Msl1 and Nsl1 depletion recapitulate the Mof mutation?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> H4K16as shows peaks (right most H4K16ac peak) where neither Nsl1 nor Msl1 are enriched. This indicates that other complexes also act. A Mof chromatin IP would be useful to see if H4K16ac overlaps with Mof as would be expected.</p><p>3) The authors conclude that there is no free Nsl1 and Msl1 protein as all would associate in Mof complexes. I wonder if the data allows this conclusion. To make this point the authors would need to demonstrate that their measurements would in principle allow detecting 10% free Msl1 or Nsl1 protein. To conclude from “Msl1 or Nsl1, incorporate in their respective complexes with similar abundance as does Mof” is too vague to make this point.</p><p>4) The overlap between MSL/NSL and bivalent genes appears not very significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> – only cluster C contains bivalent genes). The large majority of Msl1 and Nsl1 bound genes are not H3K27me3. Throughout the manuscript genes are categorized but statistical testing seems to be not performed. Rigorous statistical tests and control groups need be included to establish meaningful correlations.</p><p>5) Acetylation of other residues than H4K16ac is suggested (Discussion) as a redundant mechanism. It is not clear how to reconcile this speculation fits with the Mof phenotype.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02104.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Genetic mutation of Mof has a lethal phenotype in mice and ES cells.

This needs to be carefully considered and discussed. Alternatively, does combined Msl1 and Nsl1 depletion recapitulate the Mof mutation?</italic></p><p>As required we have included following experiments in our revised manuscript to address the reviewers’ first points:</p><p>a) To analyse whether Msl1 and Nsl1 play a role in maintenance of ESC pluripotency, we have conducted single Msl1 (shMsl1), or Nsl1 (shNsl1) or combined of Msl1 and Nsl1 (shMsl1/Nsl1) knockdowns (KDs) in mESCs (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1A</xref>). First we determined total cell numbers of ESCs, in which we depleted either Msl1, or NSL1, or both. Under these conditions we observed that especially shNsl1 and shMsl1/Nsl1 ESCs had a much slower cell proliferation rate, when compared to control ESCs, whereas the morphology of these ECS was not altered (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). Next we measured whether the observed reduction of cell numbers was due to apoptosis. However, we did not find any increase in apoptotic cells under these KD conditions (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore next we tested whether the KD ESCs would be blocked in any particular cell cycle phase by using FACS analyses (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In agreement with the above observed cell numbers, we found that KD ESCs accumulated in G1-phase of the cell cycle and that this increase was more severe in shNsl1 and shMsl1/Nsl1 ESCs. We have further described these new observations in the Results section “NSL influences cellular proliferation of mESC”.</p><p>b) Note, however, that we do not observe detectable changes in Oct4 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1A</xref>) and alkaline phosphatase (data not shown) protein levels in shMsl1, shNsl1 and shMsl1/shNsl1 KD mESCs. As described in the Results and Discussion sections of our revised version, we cannot exclude that the lentiviral KDs are only partially efficient or the compensation of MSL and/or NSL function by “free” Mof (see also new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and our answer to point 3). Even though the pluripotency state does not seem to be affected (as judged by the expression of the used markers) and the double knockdown does not entirely recapitulate the Mof KO phenotype, our new results suggest that Nsl1 is more required for regulating housekeeping genes involved in cellular homeostasis of mESCs. As required these new observations are further discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>c) Since we observed MSL binding at developmental bivalent genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>), which are also upregulated in shMsl1 mESCs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), in agreement with the reviewers question, we have further analysed the differentiation potential of mESCs depleted for Msl1. For this, mESCs were differentiated into neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) under control and Msl1 KD conditions (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1C</xref>). First, we analysed expression profiles of bivalent as well as developmental genes, such as Pax6, Hes5, Mapt2 and Nestin, which are also considered as key markers of NPC differentiation. Importantly, our new results show that while these key developmental marker genes, including several bivalent genes, become upregulated in pluripotent mESC under Msl1 KD conditions (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), their expression are in contrary downregulated in NPCs in which Msl1 was silenced during NPC differentiation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Note however, that Msl1 KD cells morphologically are still able to form NPC-like cells (Figure 8–figure supplement 8D). These new results indicate the important regulatory requirement of the MSL complex for the expression of bivalent genes, known to become upregulated during cellular differentiation, in mESC and further differentiated NPCs. These new observations and figures are described in the Results section and further discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that Nsl1 regulates proliferation and cellular homeostasis of mESCs. Knockdown of Msl1 leads to a global loss of histone H4K16ac indicating that MSL is the main HAT acetylating H4K16 in mESCs. MSL is enriched at many mESC-specific genes, but also at bivalent domains. Interestingly, MSL is important to keep a subset of bivalent genes silent in pluripotent ESCs, while the same genes require MSL for expression during differentiation. In agreement, during neuronal differentiation MSL is essential for the regulation of key developmental genes.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref> <italic>H4K16as shows peaks (right most H4K16ac peak) where neither Nsl1 nor Msl1 are enriched. This indicates that other complexes also act. A Mof chromatin IP would be useful to see if H4K16ac overlaps with Mof as would be expected</italic>.</p><p>By using the commercially available anti-MOF antibody batches we obtained only very low enrichment values by ChIP-qPCR at defined genomic loci (such as the region shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The differences between our Mof ChIP-qPCR results and the available Mof ChIP-seq data might be due to different experimental setups or antibody batches.</p><p>Thus, as suggested we included the published Mof ChIP-seq results (Li et al. (2013) in our analyses (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, D, E and F</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that the “right most H4K16ac peak” (with a very low tag density) in the Cdk19 gene overlaps with Mof binding. However, at this specific loci neither Nsl1, nor Msl1 can be detected. This can be explained by several ways: a) the “free” Mof detected in ESC nuclear extracts (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and our answers to point 3) is binding at these sites, b) the anti-mMof antibody used in the ChIP-seq study, in addition to mouse Mof, is also recognizing another protein (with a similar epitope) that may also bind to DNA, or c) due to their specific conformation and/or involvement in special chromatin structures neither MsL1, nor Nsl1 can be crosslinked at these sites. Along the same lines, Straub et. al. (2013 Genome Research), when comparing ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq profiles, suggested that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Msl1 and Mof might not be detectable by ChIP-seq approaches in genebodies due to the extensive fragmentation of chromatin (to obtain very small DNA fragments (200 bp)), which are then used for sequencing. Thus, extensive fragmentation might result in disruption, or at least partial disruption, of large chromatin-bound complexes, resulting in ChIP-seq signal loss of proteins not directly associated with the chromatin. If Mof would be closer to the DNA than Msl1, or Nsl1, respectively, in MSL or NSL complexes at certain loci, the sole detection of Mof could be explained by the suggestion of Straub et al (2013).</p><p>Importantly however, our new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D, E and F</xref> together show that the genome-wide Mof binding profile at promoters and in genebodies is very similar to Nsl1 (at promoters) or Msl1 (at regions downstream from promoters) binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>These new results are now described in the Results section.</p><p><italic>3) The authors conclude that there is no free Nsl1 and Msl1 protein as all would associate in Mof complexes. I wonder if the data allows this conclusion. To make this point the authors would need to demonstrate that their measurements would in principle allow detecting 10% free Msl1 or Nsl1 protein. To conclude from “Msl1 or Nsl1, incorporate in their respective complexes with similar abundance as does Mof” is too vague to make this point</italic>.</p><p>We apologize if our conclusion obtained from our mass spec results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) were not well explained. Therefore, we improved the description of the meaning of the NSAF abundance calculations in our revised version (see Results section and Materials and methods).</p><p>Briefly, the development of non-gel-based, “shotgun” proteomic techniques such as Multidimensional Protein Identification (MudPIT) has provided powerful tools for studying large-scale protein characterization in complex biological systems. As during enzymatic digestions of protein mixtures for proteomic analyses large proteins contribute more peptide/spectra than small ones, a normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) was defined to account for the effect of protein length on spectral count for comparing protein abundance in the different samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zybailov et al. 2006</xref>, Journal of Proteome Research; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Florens et al. 2006</xref>, Methods). NSAF is calculated as the number of spectral counts (SpC) identifying a protein, divided by the protein’s length (L), divided by the sum of SpC/L for all proteins in the experiment. Thus, NSAF allows the comparison of abundance of individual proteins in multiple independent samples and has been applied to quantify the subunit abundance in various protein mixtures and in multiprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Florens et al. 2006</xref>, Methods; Paoletti et al. 2006, PNAS; Bieniossek et al. 2013, Nature). This NSAF counting method provides an easy way of identifying proteins with similar (or different) abundances in immunoprecipitated (IP-ed) protein complexes using MudPIT. This is the method we used. As the NSAF values of Msl1 (7,8) and Mof (13,5), or Nsl1 (9,3) and Mof (14), were in a comparable range (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) in either the anti-Msl1, or the anti-Nsl1 protein immunoprecipitations, we concluded that all the IP-ed Msl1, or Nsl1 associated with comparable amounts of Mof in mESCs, respectively. If free Msl1 or Nsl1 had been present in mESCs, the NSAF values would have been much higher for Msl1 than for Mof, or for Nsl1 than for Mof, which was clearly not the case.</p><p>In addition, as required we further addressed the reviewers’ concern and performed a gel filtration (GF) experiment using nuclear extracts prepared from mouse ESCs as described by the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. This new data (shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) now further indicates that Msl1 and Nsl1 incorporate in their respective complexes (together with Mof), which elute from the GF column at their respective molecular weights (250 kDa for MSL and 760 kDa for NSL). Moreover, we did not detect any free Msl1, or Nsl1 (in the 65 kDa and 130 kDa range), respectively) present in mESC nuclear extracts. Thus, we can assume that Msl1 and Nsl1 ChIP-seq profiles are representative for MSL and NSL complex binding (however see also answer to point 2). Moreover, our new GF results showing the elution of Mof in the 50 kDa range (without Nsl1 and Msl1), suggest the existence of a small “free“ Mof pool in ESCs.</p><p>We think that we have now convincingly demonstrated (as originally stated) that Msl1 or Nsl1 are exclusively present in their respective HAT complexes, in which Mof is present with similar abundance (with a close to 1:1 subunit ratio) than either Msl1, or Nsl1.</p><p><italic>4) The overlap between MSL / NSL and bivalent genes appears not very significant (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref> <italic>– only cluster C contains bivalent genes). The large majority of Msl1 and Nsl1 bound genes are not H3K27me3. Throughout the manuscript genes are categorized but statistical testing seems to be not performed. Rigorous statistical tests and control groups need be included to establish meaningful correlations</italic>.</p><p>The overlap between MSL and NSL with bivalent sites is now included in our revised manuscript in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>. We focused on all MSL and NSL binding sites and analysed the overlap with H3K27me3, Ezh2 and H3K4me3, which are common markers for bivalent genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Following the reviewers’ concerns we have conducted Bootstrap statistical analysis, which is explained in the Materials and methods section. Indeed, our statistical analyses demonstrated that the identified number of bivalent genes is significantly enriched compared to a random selection of genes (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1B</xref>). The analysis, the result and the obtained p-value are further described in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) Acetylation of other residues than H4K16ac is suggested (Discussion) as a redundant mechanism. It is not clear how to reconcile this speculation fits with the Mof phenotype</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that our speculation did not fit with the Mof phenotype. Therefore, as required we have now deleted the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">supplementary Figure 6</xref> and have re-written the corresponding paragraph “MSL is the main H4K16 HAT in mESCs” in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
