are pulled by membrane-associated cortical force-generating machinery. However, in contrast to the chromosome-bound kinetochore structure, how the diffusion-prone cortical machinery is organized to generate large spindle-pulling forces remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a light-induced reconstitution system in human cells. We find that induced cortical targeting of NuMA, but not dynein, is sufficient for spindle pulling. This spindle-pulling activity requires dynein-dynactin recruitment by NuMA’s N-terminal long arm, dynein-based astral microtubule gliding, and NuMA’s direct microtubule-binding activities. Importantly, we demonstrate that cortical NuMA assembles specialized focal structures that cluster multiple force-generating modules to generate cooperative spindle-pulling forces. This clustering activity of NuMA is required for spindle positioning, but not for spindle-pole focusing. We propose that cortical Dynein-Dynactin-NuMA (DDN) clusters act as the core force-generating machinery that organizes a multi-arm ensemble reminiscent of the kinetochore.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36559.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Almost every time a cell divides, it must share copies of its genetic material between two new daughter cells. A large molecular machine called the mitotic spindle makes this happen. The spindle is made of protein filaments known as microtubules that radiate out from two points at opposite ends of the cell. Some of these filaments attach to the genetic material in the center of the cell; some extend in the other direction and anchor the spindle to the cell membrane.</p><p>The anchoring filaments – also known as astral microtubules – can position the mitotic spindle, which controls whether the cell splits straight down the middle (to give two identically sized cells) or off-center (which gives cells of different sizes). The force required to move the spindle comes from complexes of proteins under the cell membrane that contain a molecular motor called dynein, its partner dynactin, and three other proteins – including one called NuMA. The astral microtubules interact with this force-generating machinery, but it was unclear how these proteins are arranged at the membrane.</p><p>One way to explore interactions in a protein complex is to use a light-induced reconstitution system. This technique involves molecules that will bind together whenever a light shines on them. Fusing these molecules with different proteins means that experimenters can control exactly where, and when, those proteins interact.</p><p>Okumura et al. have now used a light-induced reconstitution system to understand how the force-generating machinery positions the spindle in human cells. One of the system’s molecules was fused to a protein located at the cell membrane; the other was fused to either the dynein motor or NuMA protein. Using light to move dynein around on the membrane did not move the spindle. Yet, changing the position of NuMA, by moving the light, was enough to rotate the spindle inside the cell.</p><p>Understanding how these complexes of proteins work increases our understanding of how cells divide. Using the light-induced system to move the spindle could also reveal more about the role of symmetric and asymmetric cell division in organizing tissues. In particular, being able to manipulate the position and size of daughter cells will provide insight into how cell division shapes and maintains tissues during animal development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spindle positioning</kwd><kwd>cortical pulling forces</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>NuMA</kwd><kwd>optogenetic

of microtubules drive directional movement of chromosomes and the mitotic spindle to achieve successful cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoué and Salmon, 1995</xref>). During animal mitosis, dynamic plus-ends of microtubules emanating from the spindle interact with two macro-molecular complexes; kinetochores and the cortical force-generating machinery. Kinetochores consist of more than 100 different proteins assembled on centromeric DNA and surround dynamic microtubule plus-ends using multiple fibril-like microtubule-binding proteins and/or ring-like couplers to harness the energy of microtubule depolymerization for chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheeseman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dimitrova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McIntosh et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, the cortical force-generating machinery assembles on the plasma membrane and pulls on the dynamic plus-ends of astral microtubules to define spindle position and orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galli and van den Heuvel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gönczy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grill and Hyman, 2005</xref>). Spindle positioning determines daughter cell fate by controlling the distribution of polarized cell fate determinants and daughter cell size during both symmetric and asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">di Pietro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiyomitsu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morin and Bellaïche, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams and Fuchs, 2013</xref>). In metaphase human cells, the cortical machinery consists of evolutionary conserved protein complexes, including the cytoplasmic dynein motor, its binding partner dynactin, and the cortically-anchored NuMA-LGN-Gαi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>). Prior work has conceptualized that the cortical complex is distributed along the cell cortex and individually pulls on astral microtubules using dynein-based motility and/or by controlling microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kotak and Gönczy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laan et al., 2012</xref>). However, compared to the focal kinetochore structure, how this diffusion-prone membrane-associated complex efficiently captures and pulls on dynamic plus-ends of astral microtubules remains poorly understood. Here, we sought to understand the mechanisms of cortical pulling-force generation by reconstituting a minimal functional unit of the cortical force-generating complex in human cells using a light-induced membrane tethering. We found that cortical targeting of NuMA is sufficient to control spindle position, and that NuMA makes multiple, distinct contributions for spindle pulling through its N-terminal dynein recruitment domain, central long coiled-coil, and C-terminal microtubule-binding domains. In addition, we demonstrate that NuMA assembles focal clusters at the mitotic cell cortex that coordinate multiple dynein-based forces with NuMA’s microtubule binding activities. We propose that the cortical Dynein-Dynactin-NuMA clusters (hereafter referred to as the cortical DDN clusters) act as the core spindle-pulling machinery that efficiently captures astral microtubules and generates cooperative pulling forces to position the mitotic spindle.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36559.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic targeting of NuMA to the mitotic cell cortex is sufficient for dynein-dynactin recruitment and spindle pulling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram summarizing cortical complexes in the indicated conditions.

When the endogenous NuMA-mACF was degraded, 80% of mitotic cells (n = 63) displayed abnormal spindles with unfocused microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> #2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>), consistent with the NuMA KO phenotypes in human hTERT-RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hueschen et al., 2017</xref>). However, both NuMA WT and the 5A-3 mutant were able to rescue these abnormal spindle phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> #3 and #4), suggesting that clustering of NuMA is dispensable for microtubule focusing at the spindle poles.

Consistent with this model, LGN-independent pathways that target NuMA to the cell cortex have been reported, such as Dishevelled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ségalen et al., 2010</xref>) and phospho-lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we propose that the Dynein-Dynactin-NuMA (DDN) complex is a universal core unit that constitutes the cortical force-generating machinery, whereas LGN and other receptors specify the targeting of the DDN complex to the membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>NuMA acts as a force-amplifying platform at the mitotic cell cortex</title><p>Our work demonstrates four distinct functions for NuMA at the mitotic cell cortex. First, NuMA recruits dynein-dynactin through its N-terminal region. We found that the conserved Spindly-like motif in NuMA is required for dynein recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). NuMA may directly interact with the dynactin pointed-end complex through this Spindly-like motif similarly to other dynein cargo adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gama et al., 2017</xref>), and activate dynein motility at the mitotic cell cortex. Second, the central long coiled-coil of NuMA is required for spindle pulling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Purified NuMA displays a long (~200 nm) rod-shaped structure that shows flexibility with a main flexible-linker region near the middle of central coiled coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harborth et al., 1999</xref>). Longer flexible arms of NuMA may increase the efficiency of astral microtubule capture by the dynein-dynactin complex, similarly to fibril-like Ndc80 complexes and CENP-E motors at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McIntosh et al., 2008</xref>). Third, NuMA contributes to cortical force generation with its own C-terminal microtubule-binding domains (MTBDs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), particularly MTBD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Because this region is also required to prevent hyper-clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref> right), and is sufficient for cortical localization in anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref> C#3, T.K. unpublished observation), this region may play multiple roles for cortical pulling-force generation. Interestingly, a NuMA C-terminal fragment containing MTBD1 (aa: 1811–1985, called NuMA-TIP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) accumulates at microtubule tips, and remains associated with stalled and/or deploymerizing microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>). By using its two microtubule-binding domains, NuMA may harness the energy of microtubule depolymerization for pulling on astral microtubules similar to the human Ska1 complex or yeast Dam1 ring complex at kinetochores, both of which track with depolymerizing microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Westermann et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we demonstrate that NuMA generates large pulling forces by clustering the DDN complexes through its C-terminal clustering domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>), similar to lipid microdomains on phagosomes that achieve cooperative force generation of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rai et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that the 1700–2003 region of NuMA is required for oligomerization in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harborth et al., 1999</xref>). We defined the 1700–1801 region of NuMA as a clustering domain (CD) required for clustering of NuMA-C 3A, and found that the CD containing 1700–1895 region of NuMA is sufficient for NuMA fragments to form clusters at the mitotic cell cortex when targeted as a Nano fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Because this 1700–1895 fragment itself localizes to the cytoplasm, and showed no punctate signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and G</xref> #C6), the clustering activity of this region may be enhanced by its recruitment and concentration at membranes, as observed for CRY2 clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Che et al., 2015</xref>). Consistently, NuMA’s clustering function is required for spindle pulling at the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), but not for microtubule focusing at spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, spindle pole focusing requires both NuMA’s C-terminal microtubule binding and N-terminal dynein-dynactin binding modules, but not its central long coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hueschen et al., 2017</xref>). Whereas NuMA-dynein complexes generate active forces within cells, NuMA’s multiple modules appear to be differently utilized depending on the context.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanisms of astral-microtubule capture and pulling by the cortical DDN clusters</title><p>Our live-cell imaging revealed that DDN clusters gradually assemble at the cell cortex and then displace the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>). Based on the results obtained in this study, we propose a multiple-arm capture model of astral microtubules by the DDN clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Following nuclear envelope break down, cytoplasmic NuMA and DDN complexes are recruited to the mitotic cell cortex by binding to the LGN/Gαi complex, and then assemble DDN clusters on the cell cortex via the NuMA C-terminal domain. In vitro, up to 10–12 NuMA dimers self-assemble and form ring-like structures with an average diameter of 48 ± 8 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harborth et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>), which are similar to those of the central hub of yeast kinetochores (37 ± 3 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gonen et al., 2012</xref>), and of the Dam1 ring complex (about 50 nm) which encircles a single kinetochore microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miranda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Westermann et al., 2005</xref>). Given that the NuMA MTBD interacts with depolymerizing microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>), dynein-dynactin moves along the lattice of microtubules, and astral microtubules tends to interact with the cell cortex through an end-on configuration in pre-anaphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kozlowski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Samora et al., 2011</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that the DDN cluster encircles or partially wrap the plus tip of a single astral microtubule with NuMA’s MTBDs, and holds the lateral wall of the astral microtubule with multiple dynein/dynactin-containing arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Future work using super-resolution imaging and in vitro reconstitution will reveal the precise architecture of the interaction between astral microtubule tips and the cortical DDN cluster. This multiple-arm capture by the DDN cluster leads to larger cooperative pulling forces by increasing the number of both dynein-dynactin containing modules and NuMA’s microtubule binding per an astral microtubule. Additionally, this clustering may contribute to force generation by increasing both the stability of the DDN complex at the membrane, and the frequency for dynein-dynactin to capture or re-bind to astral microtubules. Alternatively, astral microtubule binding of the DDN complex may also assist cluster formation on the cell cortex. To produce pulling forces at dynamic plus-ends of microtubules, the cortical force-generating machinery appears to develop multiple molecular and structural features analogous to the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheeseman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dimitrova et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our optogenetic reconstitution and AID-mediated replacement reveal that the cortical DDN cluster acts as a core spindle-pulling machinery in human cells. Analyzing the structure and regulation of the DDN cluster will provide further information to understand the basis of spindle positioning in both symmetric and asymmetric cell division, and the general principles for microtubule plus-end capture and pulling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">SiR-tubulin</td><td valign="top">Spirochrome</td><td valign="top">Cat# SC002</td><td valign="top">50 nM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">SiR-DNA</td><td valign="top">Spirochrome</td><td valign="top">Cat# SC007</td><td valign="top">20 nM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">SiR-actin</td><td valign="top">Spirochrome</td><td valign="top">Cat# SC001</td><td valign="top">50 nM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">SNAP Cell 647-SiR</td><td valign="top">New England BioLabs</td><td valign="top">Cat# S9102S</td><td valign="top">0.1 μM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">SNAP Cell TMR-star</td><td valign="top">New England BioLabs</td><td valign="top">Cat# S9105S</td><td valign="top">0.1 μM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Hoechst 33342</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# B2261</td><td valign="top">50 ng/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Nocodazole</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# M1404</td><td valign="top">330 nM (high dose) for <break/>18–24 hr and 30 nM <break/>(low dose) for 1–4 hr</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Paclitaxel</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# T7402</td><td valign="top">10 μM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Cytochalasin D</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# C8273</td><td valign="top">1 μM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">MG132</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# C2211</td><td valign="top">20 μM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">RO-3306</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# SML0569</td><td valign="top">9 μM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Imatinib mesylate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# SML1027</td><td valign="top">10 μM for 24 hr</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Ciliobrevin D</td><td valign="top">Calbiochem</td><td valign="top">Cat# 250401</td><td valign="top">75 μM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Puromycin <break/>dihydrochloride</td><td valign="top">Wako Pure Chemical <break/>Industries</td><td valign="top">Cat# 160–23151</td><td valign="top">1 μg/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">G-418 solution</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">Cat# 04727894001</td><td valign="top">800 μg/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Hygromycin B</td><td valign="top">Wako Pure Chemical <break/>Industries</td><td valign="top">Cat# 084–07681</td><td valign="top">200 μg/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Blasticidin S <break/>hydrochloride</td><td valign="top">Funakoshi Biotech</td><td valign="top">Cat# KK-400</td><td valign="top">8 μg/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Doxycycline hyclate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat #

To construct donor plasmids containing homology arms for NuMA (~500 bp homology arms), p150 (~200 bp arms) and DHC (N-terminal,~500 bp arms), a gene synthesis service (Genewiz, South Plainsfield, NJ) was used. To construct the donor plasmid for DHC (C-terminal), a ~2,000 bp sequence was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and then cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector. A BamHI site was introduced at the center of the 2,000 bp fragment to facilitate the subsequent introduction of cassettes encoding tag and selection marker genes. To express Mem-BFP-iLID from the AAVS1 locus, membrane-targeted BFP2 (‘Mem’ from Neuromodulin; Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was fused to the N-terminus of iLID (#60411, Addgene) with a 53-amino acid (aa) linker derived from pIC194 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>) (#44433, Addgene), and the resulting fusion construct was introduced between the AfeI and HindIII sites in pMK231 (AAVS1 CMV-MCS-Puro, #105924, Addgene). Note that the Venus-iLID-caax construct (#60411, Addgene) was able to recruit RFP-Nano, but not NuMA-RFP-Nano to the membrane. To construct the RFP-Nano-NeoR cassette, a tagRFPt-Nano fragment (#60415, Addgene) was introduced between the SacI and MfeI sites in pMK277 (#72793, Addgene). The RFP-Nano-NeoR cassette was excised by BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site in the donor plasmid containing NuMA’s homology arms. A 24-aa linker sequence containing 4 × GGGS was introduced between the last codon of NuMA and the first codon of RFP. To construct the Nano-mCherry cassette, the Nano coding sequence was fused to the N-terminal region of mCherry from pIC194 with a 2 × GGGS linker. To express Nano-mCherry-DHC, the BSDR sequence from pIC242 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>) (#44432, Addgene) was linked to the Nano-mCherry sequence with a P2A sequence, and the resulting BSDR-P2A-Nano-mCherry cassette, which contained a BamHI site at each end, was inserted into the BamHI site of the donor plasmid for DHC (N-terminal). A 47-aa linker sequence derived from pIC 194 was introduced between the last codon of mCherry and the start codon of DHC.

An RFP-Nano coding sequence was integrated between MluI and AgeI in the MCS, and NuMA fragments were subsequently inserted into the MluI site. NuMA truncation fragments and mutants were generated by PCR using NuMA cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Compton and Luo, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>) as a template, and the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

The microscope and attached devices were controlled using Metamorph (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunofluorescence and live cell imaging</title><p>For immunofluorescence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, cells were fixed with PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice, and pretreated with PBS containing 1% BSA for 10 min at room temperature after washing with PBS. Microtubules and DNA were visualized using 1:1000 anti-α-tubulin antibody (DM1A, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 1:5000 SiR-DNA (Spirochrome), respectively. Images of multiple z-sections were acquired by spinning-disc confocal microscopy using 0.2 μm spacing and camera binning 1. Maximally projected images from 15 z-sections were generated with Metamorph.</p><p>For time-lapse imaging of living cells, cells were cultured on glass-bottomed dishes (CELLview, #627870, Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmünster, Austria) and maintained in a stage-top incubator (Tokai Hit) to maintain the same conditions used for cell culture (37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Three z-section images using 0.5 μm spacing were acquired every 30 s with camera binning 2. Maximally projected z-stack images were shown in figures unless otherwise specified. Microtubules and actin were stained with 50 nM SiR-tubulin and 50 nM SiR-actin (Spirochrome), respectively, for &gt;1 hr prior to image acquisition. DNA was stained either 20 nM SiR-DNA (Spirochrome) or 50 ng/mL Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich) for &gt;1 hr before observation. To visualize SNAP-tagged proteins, cells were incubated with 0.1 μM SNAP-Cell 647 SiR or TMR-STAR (New England BioLabs) for &gt;2 hr, and those chemical probes were removed before observation.</p><p>For drug treatment, cells were incubated with drugs at the following concentrations and duration: nocodazole, 330 nM (high dose) for 18–24 hr and 30 nM (low dose) for 1–4 hr; paclitaxel, 10 μM for 1–10 min; cytochalasin D, 1 μM for 1–10 min; MG132, 20 μM for 1–4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>); RO-3306, 9 μM for 20 hr; imatinib, 10 μM for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsumura et al., 2012</xref>); doxycycline hyclate (Dox), 2 μg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>); Ciliobrevin D, 75 μM.</p><p>To express NuMA-RFP-Nano constructs from the Rosa 26 locus in LGN-depleted cells, cells were treated with LGN siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>) and Dox at 24 hr and 48 hr, respectively, according to the procedure described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>. RO-3306 was added at 48 hr to cells that were then synchronized at G2 at 68 hr. The NuMA-RFP-Nano fusion protein was expressed in most cells, but its expression frequency was reduced in cells that expressed longer NuMA fragments. siRNAs targeting Gαi-1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>) were obtained from Dhamacon.</p><p>To compare the intensities of cortically targeted NuMA-Nano fusions, images of NuMA-Nano fusions and DHC-SNAP were acquired using the same parameters (Exposure time: NuMA, 1000 msec; DHC, 500 msec), except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (NuMA, 1500 msec; DHC, 500 msec). To optimize image brightness, same linear adjustments were applied using Fiji and Photoshop. Supplemental movie files were generated using Metamorph and Fiji.</p><p>To activate the auxin-inducible degradation of NuMA-mAID-mClover-3FLAG (mACF), cells were treated with 2 μg/mL Dox and 500 μM indoleacetic acid (IAA) for 20–24 hr. Cells with undetectable mClover signals were analyzed. A small population of cells showed mClover signals even after being treated with Dox and IAA. For replacement experiments, either mCherry-NuMA WT or the 5A-3 mutant was expressed from the Rosa 26 locus following Dox treatment. This caused the cells to simultaneously express OsTIR1 from the AAVS1 locus to initiate the auxin-inducible degradation of endogenous NuMA-mACF.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Light-inducible targeting</title><p>Except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, HCT116 cells expressing Mem-BFP-iLID and NuMA-Nano fusion proteins were treated with RO-3306 and MG-132 according to the procedure described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> to increase the proportion of metaphase-arrested cells.</p><p>To target Nano fusion proteins at the metaphase cell cortex, cells were illuminated using a Mosaic-3 digital mirror device (Andor Technology) at the indicated regions (circles with a diameter of 1.95 μm for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, and that of 2.82 μm for other figures) with a 488 nm laser pulse (500 msec exposure, 25 mW). To manually control the frequency of the light pulse and the position of the illuminated region during time-lapse experiments, a custom macro was developed using Metamorph. Using this macro, indicated regions were illuminated ~10 times with the light pulse during time intervals (30 s) between image acquisitions. The illuminated position was adjusted to precisely illuminate the cortical region of each cell. In response to the expression level of the Nano fusion proteins, the frequency of the light pulse was reduced to prevent the targeting of Nano fusion proteins throughout the cell cortex.</p><p>To reposition NuMA-RFP-Nano at the mitotic cell cortex in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,</xref> a cortical region adjacent to the spindle axis was illuminated. The light-illuminated region was changed once the spindle started to move but before the spindle was completely attached to the cell cortex. Spindles that rotated by approximately 90° within 15 min were counted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification of cortical fluorescent signals and spindle displacement</title><p>Cortical and cytoplasmic fluorescence intensities were determined using Fiji by calculating the mean pixel intensity along three different straight lines (length 3 μm, width three pixels) drawn along the cell cortex showing Nano signals or the cytoplasm near the cell cortex but without any aggregations. The background intensity was subtracted from each measurement. The distance from the pole to the cell cortex was measured using Metamorph or Fiji. Line scans for cortical fluorescence intensity were generated using Fiji by calculating the mean pixel intensity along the segmented line (width three pixels) drawn along the cell cortex. Kymographs were generated using Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).</p><p>Spindle displacement was judged by the definition given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>. In addition, cells that satisfied the following conditions were analyzed; (1) NuMA-RFP-Nano fusion proteins were asymmetrically recruited at the light-illuminated region, but not distributed to a whole cell cortex. (2) The cortical intensities of NuMA-Nano fusion proteins were higher than that of NuMA Δex24-RFP-Nano (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). (3) DHC-SNAP was detectable at the light-illuminated region except for the case of the cortical targeting of NuMA-C (#13). (4) The spindle was monitored for &gt;10 min, and not vertically rotated. (5) The bipolar spindle was properly formed without severe membrane blebbing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To determine the significance of differences between the mean values obtained for two experimental conditions, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests or Mann-Whitney tests (Prism 6; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) were used as indicated in the figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank I M Cheeseman and G Goshima for advice and critical reading of the manuscript, R Inaba, M Nishina, K Murase, and Y Tsukada for technical assistance, T Nishiyama and A Sasaki for reagents, and PRESTO members for discussion.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers were strongly supportive of your manuscript. You use of an elegant optogenetics approach to systematically dissect the molecular requirements for dynein-mediated cortical pulling on astral microtubules, which determines the position of mitotic spindles. Direct light-induced targeting of NuMA to the cortex bypasses the requirement for NuMA's cortical receptor LGN and allows the precise definition of the domains and motifs in NuMA required for dynein-dynactin recruitment and cortical force generation. The generation of the innovative experimental toolbox is carefully documented, and the technical standard of the experiments is high.</p><p>Using these tools, with proteins at endogenous levels, you dynamically control spindle position and orientation. You determine that astral microtubule depolymerization is not required for pulling, and test the function of a large panel of NuMA truncations and mutants. You also identify a motif in NuMA's N-terminus that is required for cortical dynein recruitment, and show that a motif in NuMA's C-terminus is required for the punctate foci of NuMA and dynein seen at the cell cortex. Mutations that prevent the formation of punctate foci also prevent cortical pulling, so you conclude that NuMA-mediated clustering of dynein-dynactin-NuMA is required for cortical pulling and spindle positioning. This is a conceptually novel point and constitutes the main advance of the paper.</p><p>In addition, this work opens questions on NuMA's multimeric organization (e.g., the regulation and function of oligomerization at the cortex vs. within the spindle), and it provides insight into the big picture question of how active forces within cells are spatially organized. The work is characterized by careful experimental design and thorough controls, and the manuscript and figures are clear and well presented (with helpful schematics and organization).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Experimental:</p><p>The reviewers ask for two pieces of experimental data. The first needs to be addressed if possible. The second would clearly add to the paper, but the reviewer leaves it up to you as to whether you want to include it – if not then you should address the reviewers questions.</p><p>1) Most of the experiments presented are conducted in an LGN silenced background, thus it seems that pulling forces do not require LGN nor Gαi. For the sake of completeness, it would be beneficial to show LGN levels at the end of the experiments, i.e. after 72 hours from siRNA treatment, and at the same time test the effect of removing Gαi.</p><p>2) Dynein-dynactin recruitment requires a Spindly-like motif in NuMA's N-terminal region. This is an intriguing finding that suggests mechanistic similarities between functionally diverse dynein adaptors. However, the authors also show that NuMA's N-terminal region is not sufficient for cortical force generation. This raises the question of how good NuMA's N-terminal region really is at activating dynein. For comparison, it might be interesting to check whether cortical targeting of the N-terminal BICD2 region, which robustly activates dynein-dynactin motility in vitro and in vivo, is sufficient for force generation in this assay.</p><p>Manuscript revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have also identified a number of points that need clarification in order to improve the manuscript. I attach the list of these below. Please address these points in your response to the reviewers and make changes to the manuscript where appropriate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>- Robust spindle displacement is observed after addition of taxol (Figure 2). This is surprising given the end-on microtubule binding by NuMA clusters proposed by authors, which requires shortening of microtubules to pull the spindle towards the cortex. The authors should comment on how the taxol result is compatible with their model.</p><p>- The authors show that direct targeting of dynein to the cortex (which also results in dynactin recruitment) is not sufficient per se for the generation of cortical pulling forces and that cortical force generation requires the second microtubule binding domain of NuMA. These findings are in agreement with the results of Seldin, Muroyama, and Lechler (2016), who showed that the microtubule-binding activity of NuMA is required for mitotic spindle positioning in cultured mouse keratinocytes and the epidermis. This should be explicitly acknowledged by the authors.</p><p>- The generation of cortical pulling forces requires the central coiled-coil region of NuMA. This contrasts with the observation that the same NuMA region is dispensable for spindle pole focusing, as shown by Hueschen et al. (<italic>eLife</italic> 2017). The context-dependent requirement for NuMA's central coiled-coil region is interesting and should be commented on.</p><p>- The generation of cortical pulling forces requires clustering of NuMA at the cortex, which is mediated by a highly conserved patch in NuMA's C-terminal region. This is perhaps the most important conclusion of this study and suggests a mechanism similar to the one used by the kinetochore, where multiple microtubule-binding activities are concentrated for stable end-on attachment. The authors should clarify the following points: does NuMA clustering occur independently of astral microtubules? In the model (Figure 7D), LGN clusters with NuMA – but is there evidence for this?</p><p>- Figure 4C: the number of cells examined in the 'spindle displacement' assay for NuMA fragments #3 and #6 is too low (2 and 3, respectively).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>- The light-induced system adopted in the article enables local recruitment of NuMA-RFP-Nano (or Dynein-RFP-Nano) to the cortex by hetero-dimerization of the fusion proteins with activated membrane-bound iLID. It is known that NuMA cortical levels are critical in determining the extent of spindle pulling forces. What are the levels of NuMA-RFP-Nano and Dynein-RFP-Nano recruited at the cortex upon light induction compared to the levels of endogenous cortical NuMA and Dynein in metaphase? Also, in Figure 1B-F, the authors show that illuminating a tiny portion of the cortex is sufficient to recruit extended cortical crescents of NuMA. How do the authors explain this extended NuMA cortical distribution molecularly?</p><p>- In Figure 4, the authors engineer RFP-Nano NuMA fragments and test their ability to recruit Dynein at the cortex and position the spindle. As a positive control they use NuMA-Δ-NLS explaining that it does not dimerize with endogenous NuMA. Can the authors explain why NLS removal would prevent dimerisation?</p><p>- A major finding of the manuscript is the identification of cortical NuMA/Dynein clusters that are required for astral MT-pulling forces. A critical issue is to which extent the clustering might be affected by the protein engineering used to visualise and localise the proteins.</p><p>In the presented experiments, the levels of NuMA at the cortex seem to vary significantly depending on the construct (see Figure 4 and Figure 5). In addition, in the Figure 5—figure supplement 1 the authors report that the construct 1-1985 tends to aggregate at the cortex. Can the authors comment on the specificity of the dotted pattern they see – i.e. whether the constructs are stable and soluble? One consideration that comes to my mind is that the 5A-2 and 5A-3 residue stretches of NuMA that are responsible for clustering correspond to hydrophobic residues, that might be engaged in intramolecular interactions maintaining the protein stability. Of note, for some reasons, the dotted pattern does not seem evident in Figure 1.</p><p>On the same line of thoughts, in Figure 6B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, the authors use GFP-NuMA-C-3A mutant that localizes at the cortex as it lacks the inhibitory cdk1 phosphorylation sites. In a wild-type background, this construct should be recruited at the membrane by LGN. Is the dotted structure of GFP-NuMA-C visible upon LGN cortical recruitment? In Figure 6—figure supplement 1C the authors show that the punctuated NuMA-3A pattern intercalates with the cortical actin pattern. This is an interesting observation, can the authors comment on this?</p><p>- One of the issues connected to the idea of NuMA clusters relates to the molecular events underlying their formation under physiological conditions. The authors identify NuMA residues responsible for the clustering: do they think these residues mediate self-oligomerization of NuMA? In the experiments of Figure 7B and Figure 7—figure supplement 1F, in which endogenous NuMA is replaced with full-length NuMA either wild-type or 5A-3, the cortical clustering does not seem very evident.</p><p>- In the Discussion, the authors propose that NuMA clustering works within a DDN network to promote end-on attachment of astral microtubules to the cortex. To my knowledge, no compelling evidence for end-on attachment in this process has been provided. This model, although possible, tends to reflect what known for the attachment of microtubules to kinetochore. Therefore, in the absence of specific evidence, it might be preferable to down-state the model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>1) The idea that NuMA may activate dynein in addition to regulating its localization is an attractive hypothesis, which has been proposed by others but not carefully tested. Similarly, this work includes no direct data related to dynein activation. The authors show that the Spindly-like motif is required for dynein recruitment, but they do not decouple recruitment (localization) and activation. Thus, the use of language throughout the paper referring to dynein activation could be misleading; it should be softened and mostly confined to the Discussion. It should be made clear that the authors did not test whether NuMA activates dynein.</p><p>2) In the experiments in Figures 4 and 5, why is NuMA 1-2115 ΔNLS used instead of the full-length protein? In the subsection “A Spindly-like motif in NuMA is required for cortical dynein recruitment, but not sufficient for spindle pulling”, the authors state that the NLS is removed to prevent dimerization with endogenous protein, but do not state a source. Do they believe this to be true, and due to what published or unpublished data? Published work (e.g., Harborth et al., EMBO 1995) suggests that dimerization will still occur through NuMA's coiled-coils.</p><p>3) Relatedly, dimerization with endogenous NuMA presumably occurs with NuMA truncations in Figures 4 and 5 that include some or all of the central coiled-coil. Could the authors comment on how this dimerization could affect their conclusions based on these data? As one example, could the inability of fragment #12 reflect an inability to form a functional dimer with endogenous protein due to absence of big part of the central coiled-coil?</p><p>4) In Figure 4C and 5B, the application of a z-test to &quot;yes/no&quot; data (not normally distributed) with low &quot;N&quot; is likely inappropriate. We suggest using the actual pole displacement distances (as a percentage of starting pole-to-cortex distance) for each condition, and then analyzing those data using an ANOVA (or, at least, a t-test between the control (#1) and each condition). Consulting a statistician may be helpful.</p><p>5) Relatedly, directly reporting the actual pole displacement distances for NuMA fragments #1-14 (Figure 4-5) would be interesting and important for the reader to interpret the data. These data could be displayed as &quot;beeswarm&quot; plots like Figure 7C, for example, and they would help the reader better interpret the significance of your findings (for example, it would better display the degree of spindle displacement difference between NuMA fragment #11 (3/8) and fragment #14 (1/13)).</p><p>6) In model Figure 7D (and related Figure 7—figure supplement 1), the main features of the cartoon should stay as close to what was shown in the paper as possible. If there is key speculation not supported by data, it should be made clear that it is speculation. In particular, whether LGN forms a ring does not seem to be based on data and drawing LGN and NuMA's C-terminus as more disorganized may avoid readers being biased towards a ring-like model (alternatively, if a ring-like model is supported by data, it should be made clear what data supports it).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36559.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Experimental:</p><p>The reviewers ask for two pieces of experimental data. The first needs to be addressed if possible. The second would clearly add to the paper, but the reviewer leaves it up to you as to whether you want to include it – if not then you should address the reviewers questions.</p><p>1) Most of the experiments presented are conducted in an LGN silenced background, thus it seems that pulling forces do not require LGN nor Gαi. For the sake of completeness, it would be beneficial to show LGN levels at the end of the experiments, i.e. after 72 hours from siRNA treatment, and at the same time test the effect of removing Gαi.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a Western blot to demonstrate the reduction of LGN protein level after siRNA treatment. This data is now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 1H. In addition, we conducted light-induced NuMA targeting in a Gαi (1+2+3) silenced background. The metaphase spindle was displaced toward the light-illuminated region in 71.4% of cells (n=7), similarly to in LGN-depleted cells. These data are now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 2E-F. Taken together, these results indicate that cortical pulling forces do not require LGN or Gαi in our optogenetic system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Dynein-dynactin recruitment requires a Spindly-like motif in NuMA's N-terminal region. This is an intriguing finding that suggests mechanistic similarities between functionally diverse dynein adaptors. However, the authors also show that NuMA's N-terminal region is not sufficient for cortical force generation. This raises the question of how good NuMA's N-terminal region really is at activating dynein. For comparison, it might be interesting to check whether cortical targeting of the N-terminal BICD2 region, which robustly activates dynein-dynactin motility in vitro and in vivo, is sufficient for force generation in this assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now cloned human N-terminal BICD2 region (1-400 aa) and generated cell line that conditionally expresses BICD2-N-RFP-Nano in the presence of Dox. Unexpectedly, light-induced targeting of the BICD2-N construct was not sufficient to recruit dynein (DHC-SNAP) to the mitotic cell cortex (n=10), although the BICD2-N construct was able to partially recruit dynein to the plasma membrane in interphase (n=5/8 cells) (Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). These results suggest that interaction between dynein and BICD2-N is during cell cycle, and thus BICD2-N targeting is not a feasible way to dissect dynein-based force generation during mitosis. Because of these reasons, we did not include these data in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36559.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36559-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Alternatively, to understand whether light-induced NuMA-dynein complexes require dynein activity for spindle displacement, we analyzed the effect of ciliobrevin D on force generation. This drug inhibits dynein-dependent microtubule gliding and ATPase activity, but not the association between ADP-bound dynein and microtubules in vitro (Firestone et al., 2012). In HCT116 cells, we found that ciliobrevin D treatment in interphase caused mitotic phenotypes including chromosome misalignment similar to dynein degradation (Natsume et al., 2016) under 0.5%, but not 10% FBS culture conditions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-D), consistent with previous reports (Firestone et al., 2012). We next added ciliobrevin D to metaphase-arrested cells. Although dynein activity is required to maintain spindle bipolarity, we found that spindle bipolarity was maintained for ~30 min following the treatment of ciliobrevin D, and was gradually disrupted during the subsequent 30-60 min (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E-G). Thus, we next sought to perform spindle pulling assay during the initial 60 min according to the Procedure depicted in Figure 3A. In control cells, light-induced targeting of NuMA displaced the spindle in 80% of cell (n=10, Figure 3B and D). In contrast, the spindle was not displaced in 75% of ciliobrevin D-treated cells (n=12, Figure 3C-D), whereas dynein was normally recruited to the cell cortex and the spindle structure was maintained during the assay. These results suggest that light-induced NuMA activates dynein and its activity is required for generating cortical pulling forces. These data are now included in Figure 3A-D, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-G.</p><p>We also performed the same assay using cells expressing NuMA’s N-terminal fragment (1-705 aa; Figure 4B, C #3) to test whether asymmetric spindle-pole enrichment of the NuMA N-terminal fragment (Figure 4F) depends on dynein activity. However, in 0.5% FBS culture condition, the N-terminal NuMA fragment displays large cytoplasmic aggregation, which accumulates around spindle poles during mitosis, and prevented us from analyzing asymmetric spindle-pole enrichment of this fragment after light-induced cortical targeting.</p><p>In total, our results indicate that NuMA not only recruits dynein-dynactin to the mitotic cell cortex but also activates dynein at the cell cortex to generate cortical pulling forces. Although it is still unclear how good NuMA’s N-terminal region activates dynein, we believe that these new additions provide a strong evidence that dynein is activated following NuMA-mediated cortical recruitment to generate functional spindle-pulling forces.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Manuscript revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have also identified a number of points that need clarification in order to improve the manuscript. I attach the list of these below. Please address these points in your response to the reviewers and make changes to the manuscript where appropriate.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>- Robust spindle displacement is observed after addition of taxol (Figure 2). This is surprising given the end-on microtubule binding by NuMA clusters proposed by authors, which requires shortening of microtubules to pull the spindle towards the cortex. The authors should comment on how the taxol result is compatible with their model.</p></disp-quote><p>In taxol-treated cells, the velocity of the spindle movement was slower than that observed in control cells (Figure 2I), suggesting that depolymerization of astral microtubules may also contribute to force generation as described in the model. Of course, this reduced velocity may be due to other reasons such as cortical pushing by stabilized astral microtubules. Thus, we have added comments to the revised manuscript as described below.</p><p>“In these taxol-treated cells, the velocity of the spindle movement was slower than that observed in control cells (Figure 2F-I), suggesting that depolymerization of astral microtubules may also contribute to force generation, although the reduced velocity might be caused alternatively by cortical pushing by stabilized astral microtubules.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors show that direct targeting of dynein to the cortex (which also results in dynactin recruitment) is not sufficient per se for the generation of cortical pulling forces and that cortical force generation requires the second microtubule binding domain of NuMA. These findings are in agreement with the results of Seldin, Muroyama, and Lechler (2016), who showed that the microtubule-binding activity of NuMA is required for mitotic spindle positioning in cultured mouse keratinocytes and the epidermis. This should be explicitly acknowledged by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cited this paper as follows:</p><p>“… direct binding of NuMA to astral microtubules may generate cooperative forces in parallel with dynein-dynactin recruitment as recently proposed by Seldin et al. (Seldin, Muroyama, and Lechler, 2016).”</p><p>In addition, we have added comments for why NuMA Δex24, which corresponds to the mouse NuMAΔex22 mutant used in Seldin et al. paper, is still be able to generate pulling forces in our assay as follows.</p><p>“Because the corresponding mouse NuMA Δex22 mutant shows spindle orientation defect in mouse keratinocytes and the epidermis (Seldin et al., 2016), this region may have specific roles in different cell types. Alternatively, weak defects in the NuMA Δex24 mutant may be suppressed by targeting increased levels of cortical NuMA Δex24 in this assay.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The generation of cortical pulling forces requires the central coiled-coil region of NuMA. This contrasts with the observation that the same NuMA region is dispensable for spindle pole focusing, as shown by Hueschen et al. (2017). The context-dependent requirement for NuMA's central coiled-coil region is interesting and should be commented on.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. The following sentences are now included in Discussion:</p><p>“Interestingly, spindle pole focusing requires both NuMA’s C-terminal minus-end binding and N-terminal dynein-dynactin binding modules, but not its central long coiled-coil (Hueschen et al., 2017). Whereas NuMA-dynein complexes generate active forces within cells, NuMA’s multiple modules appear to be differently utilized depending on the context.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The generation of cortical pulling forces requires clustering of NuMA at the cortex, which is mediated by a highly conserved patch in NuMA's C-terminal region. This is perhaps the most important conclusion of this study and suggests a mechanism similar to the one used by the kinetochore, where multiple microtubule-binding activities are concentrated for stable end-on attachment. The authors should clarify the following points: does NuMA clustering occur independently of astral microtubules?</p></disp-quote><p>The GFP-NuMA-C 3A fragment shows punctate signals in nocodazole-arrested cells (Figure 6B). In addition, NuMA forms oligomers in vitro (Harborth et al., 1999). Thus, we believe that NuMA is able to cluster independently of astral microtubules. We have now added (+Nocodazole) in Figure 6B. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that astral microtubules assist NuMA clustering in cells. We have now included the following sentence in the Discussion:</p><p>“Alternatively, astral microtubule binding of the DDN complex may also assist cluster formation on the cell cortex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the model (Figure 7D), LGN clusters with NuMA – but is there evidence for this?</p></disp-quote><p>We generated a NuMA-mACF and SNAP-LGN double knock-in HCT116 cell line, and visualized both NuMA and LGN. We found that LGN also displays punctate cortical signals as observed in Rpe1 cells (Figure S4b in Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012). We now included this data in Figure 7—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 4C: the number of cells examined in the 'spindle displacement' assay for NuMA fragments #3 and #6 is too low (2 and 3, respectively).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now repeated this experiment using the NuMA #3 cell line, and increased the number of cells up to 7 in the spindle displacement assay. Together with the results of NuMA #2 construct (n=14), these data indicate that NuMA’s N-terminal fragment is not sufficient for spindle displacement. For the NuMA #6 cell line, we have changed this to n.d. (not determined) in Figure 4C because of the low number of cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>- The light-induced system adopted in the article enables local recruitment of NuMA-RFP-Nano (or Dynein-RFP-Nano) to the cortex by hetero-dimerization of the fusion proteins with activated membrane-bound iLID. It is known that NuMA cortical levels are critical in determining the extent of spindle pulling forces. What are the levels of NuMA-RFP-Nano and Dynein-RFP-Nano recruited at the cortex upon light induction compared to the levels of endogenous cortical NuMA and Dynein in metaphase?</p></disp-quote><p>Although we have quantified the level of NuMA-RFP-Nano and DHC-SNAP in the previous Figure 1—figure supplement 1, we did not clearly describe these data. We now describe this data as follows.</p><p>“The level of light-induced cortical NuMA is about 3 times higher than that of endogenous NuMA in metaphase, but similar to that in anaphase (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I-J).”</p><p>The level of cortical Nano-mCherry-DHC is also quantified in Figure 3G. This Nano-mCherry- DHC level is higher than that of endogenous SNAP-DHC in Figure 1C, suggesting that failure of force generation by light-induced dynein targeting is not due to its lower level of cortical dynein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, in Figure 1B-F, the authors show that illuminating a tiny portion of the cortex is sufficient to recruit extended cortical crescents of NuMA. How do the authors explain this extended NuMA cortical distribution molecularly?</p></disp-quote><p>One reason for the illumination of a small region promoting crescent formation is the diffusion of NuMA-RFP-Nano/ Mem-BFP-iLID complex on the plasma membrane. These complexes can move about 5 μm within 60 sec when a diffusion constant (D = 0.1 μm<sup>2</sup>/sec) for a typical membrane bound protein is used for the calculation. In addition, this illumination may be affected by technical reasons related to the optics. In principle, the laser is focused and illuminated at the defined region on the focal plane with maximum power. However, the laser also penetrates its vertical region with wider breadth. Because mitotic cells have a round shape compared to interphase cells, such wider vertical illumination may stimulate its vertical region, and cause wider distribution of NuMA-RFP-Nano on the focal plane following diffusion. Other reasons such as light scattering by unknown cellular components may also cause a wider illumination. Nonetheless, endogenous NuMA and dynein normally extend along the cell cortex as shown in Figure 1B left. Thus, we believe that the extended NuMA cortical distribution is similar to its native localization and is appropriate to assess its ability for cortical force generation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 4, the authors engineer RFP-Nano NuMA fragments and test their ability to recruit Dynein at the cortex and position the spindle. As a positive control they use NuMA-Δ-NLS explaining that it does not dimerize with endogenous NuMA. Can the authors explain why NLS removal would prevent dimerisation?</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the NLS to spatially separate exogenously expressed NuMA constructs from endogenous NuMA, which dominantly localizes to the nucleus in interphase cells. In fact, based on our synchronized expression protocol as described in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, exogenously expressed NuMA constructs localized to the cytoplasm before G2 release (at 68 hr), and separated from endogenous NuMA in the nucleus, suggesting that the large majority of exogenously expressed NuMA mutants form homo-dimers through its coiled-coil in the cytoplasm, but not with endogenous NuMA. The following sentences are now included:</p><p>“the NLS was deleted to reduce dimerization with endogenous NuMA by spatially separating exogenously expressed constructs from nuclear-localized endogenous NuMA before G2 release.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A major finding of the manuscript is the identification of cortical NuMA/Dynein clusters that are required for astral MT-pulling forces. A critical issue is to which extent the clustering might be affected by the protein engineering used to visualise and localise the proteins.</p><p>In the presented experiments, the levels of NuMA at the cortex seem to vary significantly depending on the construct (see Figure 4 and Figure 5). In addition, in the Figure 5—figure supplement 1 the authors report that the construct 1-1985 tends to aggregate at the cortex. Can the authors comment on the specificity of the dotted pattern they see – i.e. whether the constructs are stable and soluble? One consideration that comes to my mind is that the 5A-2 and 5A-3 residue stretches of NuMA that are responsible for clustering correspond to hydrophobic residues, that might be engaged in intramolecular interactions maintaining the protein stability. Of note, for some reasons, the dotted pattern does not seem evident in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>At present, we do not have data regarding the stability and solubility of each NuMA construct. To answer this question, future work will be necessary to express these constructs in vitro and analyze their structural and biochemical properties, which we believe is beyond the scope of this study. Regarding the dotted pattern, smaller constructs such as NuMA-C show more visible punctate signals. Although we repeatedly observe punctate signals for full length NuMA, it is difficult to recognize clear dots as for NuMA-C. This may indicate dynamic assembly and/or reorganization of NuMA clusters in addition to their lateral diffusion on the cell cortex. Alternatively, NuMA-C may form additional oligomeric structure. We have now included the following sentence in the Results section.</p><p>“… we found that NuMA constructs containing its C-terminal region displayed punctate cortical signals, which tend to be more evident in smaller constructs (e.g. Figure 5H-I)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the same line of thoughts, in Figure 6B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, the authors use GFP-NuMA-C-3A mutant that localizes at the cortex as it lacks the inhibitory cdk1 phosphorylation sites. In a wild-type background, this construct should be recruited at the membrane by LGN. Is the dotted structure of GFP-NuMA-C visible upon LGN cortical recruitment?</p></disp-quote><p>Although NuMA-C contains the LGN binding domain, GFP-NuMA-C WT is hardly detectable at the metaphase cell cortex (Please see Figure 1F and 1G in Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013), suggesting that NuMA-C is not sufficient to interact with LGN. In fact, LGN was not detected as a GFP-NuMA-C 3A binding proteins in our previous mass spectrometry analysis (Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013), and is dispensable for punctate signal formation of GFP-NuMA-C-3A (Figure 2C in Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 6—figure supplement 1C the authors show that the punctuated NuMA-3A pattern intercalates with the cortical actin pattern. This is an interesting observation, can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. We have now added following comments to the text:</p><p>“Interestingly, the punctate NuMA-C 3A patterns intercalated with cortical actin localization, and still existed following actin disruption (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). These results suggest that the NuMA C-terminal fragment self-assembles on the membrane independently of its cortical binding partners and actin cytoskeleton.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- One of the issues connected to the idea of NuMA clusters relates to the molecular events underlying their formation under physiological conditions. The authors identify NuMA residues responsible for the clustering: do they think these residues mediate self-oligomerization of NuMA? In the experiments of Figure 7B and Figure 7—figure supplement 1F, in which endogenous NuMA is replaced with full-length NuMA either wild-type or 5A-3, the cortical clustering does not seem very evident.</p></disp-quote><p>Under physiological condition, cortical NuMA signals at metaphase are weak, and thus it is difficult to see punctate signals, especially when NuMA was visualized with the less intense mCherry. However, when we visualize endogenous NuMA with the brighter mClover, we repeatedly observed clear punctate NuMA signals as shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-C. Because we think these residues mediate self-oligomerization of NuMA, for future work will conduct in vitro reconstitution of NuMA and selected mutants to visualize their structure as described by Harborth et al., 1999. However, this work is beyond the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the Discussion, the authors propose that NuMA clustering works within a DDN network to promote end-on attachment of astral microtubules to the cortex. To my knowledge, no compelling evidence for end-on attachment in this process has been provided. This model, although possible, tends to reflect what known for the attachment of microtubules to kinetochore. Therefore, in the absence of specific evidence, it might be preferable to down-state the model.</p></disp-quote><p>By analyzing the dynamics of EB3 and tubulin, Kozlowski et al., demonstrated that astral microtubule ends tend to interact with the cell cortex through an end-on configuration in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos. Similar results were reported in metaphase human cells by Samora et al. and Kwon et al. Thus, we propose that astral microtubule tips are captured by cortical force-generating machinery as an end-on configuration. However, as suggested by the reviewer, it is still unclear how the DDN clusters interact with astral microtubule plus-ends compared to the more advanced understanding of plus end interactions at kinetochores. Thus, according to the suggestion, we have reworded our model to provide caution as indicated below, and have highlighted that the ring-like structure for a NuMA cluster is an imaginary structure based on Harborth et al., in Figure 7—figure supplement 1G.</p><p>“… and astral microtubules tend to interact with the cell cortex through an end-on configuration in pre-anaphase cells (Kozlowski, Srayko, and Nedelec, 2007; Kwon, Bagonis, Danuser, and Pellman, 2015; Samora et al., 2011), it is tempting to speculate that the DDN cluster encircles or partially wraps the plus tip of a single astral microtubule …”</p><p>“The ring-like structure for a NuMA cluster is an imaginary structure based on Harborth et al., (Harborth et al., 1999).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The idea that NuMA may activate dynein in addition to regulating its localization is an attractive hypothesis, which has been proposed by others but not carefully tested. Similarly, this work includes no direct data related to dynein activation. The authors show that the Spindly-like motif is required for dynein recruitment, but they do not decouple recruitment (localization) and activation. Thus, the use of language throughout the paper referring to dynein activation could be misleading; it should be softened and mostly confined to the Discussion. It should be made clear that the authors did not test whether NuMA activates dynein.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. To answer this question, we have now tested the effect of ciliobrevin D, an inhibitor of dynein activity, on spindle displacement caused by light-induced NuMA targeting. We carefully optimized the experimental conditions and found that ciliobrevin D treatment disrupts spindle displacement following cortical NuMA targeting. This result suggests that NuMA activates dynein. This data is now included in Figure 3A-D and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the experiments in Figures 4 and 5, why is NuMA 1-2115 ΔNLS used instead of the full-length protein? In the subsection “A Spindly-like motif in NuMA is required for cortical dynein recruitment, but not sufficient for spindle pulling”, the authors state that the NLS is removed to prevent dimerization with endogenous protein, but do not state a source. Do they believe this to be true, and due to what published or unpublished data? Published work (e.g., Harborth et al., EMBO 1995) suggests that dimerization will still occur through NuMA's coiled-coils.</p></disp-quote><p>As also described above in response to reviewer #2:</p><p>We removed the NLS to spatially separate exogenously expressed NuMA constructs from endogenous NuMA, which dominantly localizes in the nucleus of interphase cells. In fact, based on our synchronized expression protocol as described in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, exogenously expressed NuMA constructs localized in cytoplasm before G2 release (at 68 hr), and separated from endogenous NuMA in the nucleus, suggesting that large majority of exogenously expressed NuMA mutants form homo-dimers through coiled-coil in the cytoplasm, but not with endogenous NuMA.</p><p>“… the NLS was deleted to eliminate dimerization with endogenous NuMA by spatially separating the exogenously expressed constructs from nuclear-localized endogenous NuMA before G2 release.”</p><p>In addition, we have performed these experiments with NLS containing full-length protein. In this case, exogenously expressed NuMA-RFP-Nano accumulated in the nucleus before G2, but was unable to displace the spindle efficiently (11.1%, n=9) during mitosis. We think that exogenously expressed full length NuMA forms heterodimers with endogenous NuMA lacking RFP-Nano, which leads to an inability of force generation due to weaker cortical anchorage. We have now added following comments to the text:</p><p>“In contrast, exogenously expressed NLS containing NuMA-RFP-Nano (1-2115) accumulated in the nucleus before G2, but was unable to displace the spindle efficiently (11.1%, n=9), likely due to weak cortical anchorage by hetero-dimerization with endogenous NuMA lacking RFP-Nano.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Relatedly, dimerization with endogenous NuMA presumably occurs with NuMA truncations in Figures 4 and 5 that include some or all of the central coiled-coil. Could the authors comment on how this dimerization could affect their conclusions based on these data? As one example, could the inability of fragment #12 reflect an inability to form a functional dimer with endogenous protein due to absence of big part of the central coiled-coil?</p></disp-quote><p>All constructs except for NuMA-C #13 localized to the cytoplasm prior to G2 release in our synchronized protocol. Thus, we believe that these exogenously expressed constructs are spatially separated from endogenous NuMA before entering mitosis, and thus the majority of exogenously-expressed NuMA would not form heterodimers with endogenous NuMA during mitosis. NuMA-C #13 localized to the nucleus before G2 release, but this construct lacks the coiled-coil region required for dimerization, and thus we think that this construct does not dimerize with endogenous NuMA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 4C and 5B, the application of a z-test to &quot;yes/no&quot; data (not normally distributed) with low &quot;N&quot; is likely inappropriate. We suggest using the actual pole displacement distances (as a percentage of starting pole-to-cortex distance) for each condition, and then analyzing those data using an ANOVA (or, at least, a t-test between the control (#1) and each condition). Consulting a statistician may be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>According to this suggestion, we have now plotted the actual spindle displacement distance as a percentage of starting pole-to-cortex distance for each condition in Figure 4—figure supplement 1J. Because these samples do not show a clear Gaussian distribution, we performed a Mann-Whitney test, which can be applicable for such samples with low N (N&gt;4). Although #2 and #11 are not significantly different, other samples show statistical difference (p&lt;0.05) compared to control (#1). This data is now included in Figure 4—figure supplement 1J and mentioned in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Relatedly, directly reporting the actual pole displacement distances for NuMA fragments #1-14 (Figure 4-5) would be interesting and important for the reader to interpret the data. These data could be displayed as &quot;beeswarm&quot; plots like Figure 7C, for example, and they would help the reader better interpret the significance of your findings (for example, it would better display the degree of spindle displacement difference between NuMA fragment #11 (3/8) and fragment #14 (1/13)).</p></disp-quote><p>According to this suggestion, the data is now included in Figure 4—figure supplement 1J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In model Figure 7D (and related Figure 7—figure supplement 1), the main features of the cartoon should stay as close to what was shown in the paper as possible.
