potential ﬂuid management mechanisms. Here, we investigated angiopoietin-4 (Angpt4, also known as Ang3), a poorly characterized ligand for endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2, in mouse retina model. By using genetic reporter, fate mapping, and in situ hybridization, we found <italic>Angpt4</italic> expression in a specific sub-population of astrocytes at the site where venous morphogenesis occurs and that lower oxygen tension, which distinguishes peripheral and venous locations, enhances Angpt4 expression. Correlating with its spatiotemporal expression, deletion of <italic>Angpt4</italic> resulted in defective venous development causing impaired venous drainage and defects in neuronal cells. In vitro characterization of angiopoietin-4 proteins revealed both ligand-specific and redundant functions among the angiopoietins.

Defects in supporting mechanisms result in macular edema that is the major cause of vision loss in common vascular and inﬂammatory diseases including diabetes, retinal vein occlusions and neovascularization affecting millions of people globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daruich et al., 2018</xref>). While vascular barrier disruption resulting in excessive leakage has been extensively studied, much less is known about the importance of fluid-removal mechanisms of neural retina that lacks lymphatic draining system.</p><p>The endothelial receptor tyrosine kinases Tie1 and Tie2 and the angiopoietin ligands (Angpt1–4) form a signaling pathway for blood and lymphatic vessel development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eklund et al., 2017</xref>). Angiopoietin family studies thus far have focused on Angpt1 and Angpt2. As a significant limitation, the physiological importance of mouse Angpt4 (previously also named as Ang3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 1999</xref>], Angpt4 in accordance with the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee and Mouse Genome Informatics) and its human orthologue ANGPT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valenzuela et al., 1999</xref>) have remained unknown. No gene-targeted model for Angpt4 has been published and ANGPT4 has not yet been linked to any human disease.</p><p>Thus far, controversial results regarding Angpt4 functions have been reported showing action as a Tie2 agonist or antagonist in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kesler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valenzuela et al., 1999</xref>). In mouse, excess of exogenous Angpt4 or ANGPT4 similarly induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2004</xref>) and ANGPT4 improved vascular function in streptozotocin-induced model for diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that Angpt4, ANGPT4 and Angpt1 have similar functions. In mouse tumor transplantation studies, exogenous Angpt4 has been reported to either inhibit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 2004</xref>) or promote tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunckhorst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kesler et al., 2015</xref>), and similarly to Angpt2, Angpt4 expression has been reported to increase in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulmalek et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>To clarify the physiological importance of Angpt4, we generated independently targeted mouse alleles to investigate cellular source, regulation of expression and the effect of Angpt4 deficiency in mouse retina that provides a widely used model for blood vessel growth, remodeling, maturation and vascular pathologies. In addition, <italic>Angpt1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Angpt2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gale et al., 2002</xref>)<italic>, Tie1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D’Amico et al., 2014</xref>), and <italic>Tie2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chu et al., 2016</xref>) deletions are thoroughly investigated in postnatal mouse retina providing a comprehensive reference for assessing Angpt4 in vivo functions among the angiopoietins. Pathophysiological relevance of Angpt4 deficiency was evaluated in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model and using histopathological and ultrastructural analysis of postnatal and aged mice. Visual and venous functions were investigated using flash electroretinography and fluorescent tracers. We found Angpt4 expression in a specific population of hypoxia-regulated astrocytes that were enriched in the peripheral segment of the retina and locating close to the developing veins. Correlating with the strictly regulated expression pattern, genetic deletion of Angpt4 resulted in defective venous development and alterations in neural retina in adult mice secondary to impaired venous remodeling. Angpt4 deficiency did not affect capillaries or arteries either in physiological development, during aging or in retinopathy in OIR model, indicating a venous-specific function. Comparison of biochemical properties and cellular responses of Angpt4 and ANGPT4 to those of ANGPT1 and ANGPT2 provided novel mechanistic insights into the roles of Angpt4 and ANGPT4 and indicated both ligand-specific and redundant functions among the angiopoietins. Collectively, we identify Angpt4 as the first growth factor having a vessel-type-specific effect on venous development. Our data also reveals functional importance of a specific vein type in the peripheral retina, novel aspects of the complex Angpt/Tie pathway and complementary roles for angiopoietins in the establishment of the retinal circulatory system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Angpt4 is expressed in a distinct population of glial cells located close to the developing veins in the peripheral segment of postnatal mouse retina</title><p>In mice, the primary capillary plexus reaches the retinal periphery approximately at postnatal day (P) 8.

To investigate if different vascular phenotypes may reflect differential molecular and cellular characteristics between the ligands, we next compared angiopoietins in in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–H</xref>).

Similarly to ANGPT1, but opposite to ANGPT2, Angpt4 and ANGPT4 induced TIE2 phosphorylation in inter-endothelial junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–B</xref>). In sparse migrating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukuhara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saharinen et al., 2008</xref>) and spreading ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pietilä et al., 2012</xref>), ANGPT1 and ANGPT2 induce TIE2 translocation to specific ECM contact sites to regulate EC adhesion and migration. In contrast to ANGPT1 and ANGPT2, Angpt4 and ANGPT4 did not bind to EC ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). After prolonged stimulation, the majority of ANGPT1-bound TIE2 is translocated into retraction fibers that represent former EC-ECM adhesions. Interestingly, ANGPT2/TIE2 was mainly located in the cell rear and not incorporated into permanent EC-ECM contacts, while ANGPT4 did not induce TIE2 translocation to ECM contacts to a significant extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). When substrate-bound by solid phase antibody, Angpt4 and ANGPT4 failed to promote EC spreading that was induced by substrate-bound ANGPT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E–F</xref>). To test if differences in adhesion are related to differential binding characteristics to TIE2, angiopoietins were compared in ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G–H</xref>). In both assays, Angpt4 and ANGPT4 showed lower affinity to TIE2 than ANGPT1 and ANGPT2. We further evaluated the diffusion and kinetics of the ANGPT/TIE2-GFP complexes by the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Among the ligands, recovery rate was highest in Angpt4- and ANGPT4-stimulated cells, whereas ANGPT1 stimulation resulted in slowest recovery. Collectively, in vitro characterization indicated that similarly to ANGPT1, Angpt4 and ANGPT4 activated TIE2 in EC–EC junctions. When compared to other angiopoietins, binding to TIE2 and EC ECM was weaker, likely resulting in less stable ligand/TIE2 complexes evident in FRAP and prolonged stimulation experiments. To further compare biochemical characteristics of angiopoietins used in this study, purified recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and their potency to induce TIE2 tyrosine phosphorylation (activation) was quantified by immunoprecipitation and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). As previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valenzuela et al., 1999</xref>), ANGPT4 induced TIE2 tyrosine phosphorylation in HUVECs. In comparison, Angpt4 was less oligomerized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>) and induced relatively low TIE2 activation in human ECs when total TIE2 proteins were analyzed in western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). This was consistent with immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) of Angpt4-stimulated HUVECs, where TIE2 activation was observed as punctuate staining specially locating in EC-EC junctions, while a vast majority of TIE2 was evenly located on plasma membrane and was not stained with antibody specific for phosphorylated TIE2-Tyr992 on the kinase activation loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nätynki et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37776.023</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Ligand-specific and redundant functions of Angpt4 and ANGPT4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Angiopoietin-induced TIE2 translocation and activation in cell–cell junctions.

Lack of known growth factor(s) to initiate venous specification has hindered understanding the determination of venous fate, and therefore it is often considered as a default. Vascular SMCs are heterogenic cells that arise from multiple different origins in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In the retina, vein SMCs can develop from neural crest origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hughes and Chan-Ling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trost et al., 2013</xref>); however, thus far the molecular pathway(s) needed to initiate maturation of venous SMCs has been unknown. Our study identifies Angpt4 as the first growth factor having a venous-specific function in the mouse retina, thus providing new insights into poorly characterized developmental processes. From a translational perspective, identification of new molecules that regulate the formation of functional vasculature in the eye is necessary for the development of novel therapies that can have a major impact on the treatment of patients with limited treatment options. More broadly, understanding the mechanisms to establish an efficient circulatory loop involving functional veins is also crucial for development of regenerative medicine in general. Main findings and the mechanisms involved in the phenotypes observed in this study are presented in a graphical summary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37776.028</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Graphical summary.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole mount staining of the superficial vascular plexus of adult mouse retina, one quarter is shown.

A, artery; V, vein; ON, optic nerve head. Framed area is represented in (<bold>B</bold>) and (<bold>C</bold>). (<bold>B</bold>) Angpt4 is expressed in a specific subpopulation of hypoxia-regulated astrocytes that are enriched in the peripheral retina and locate close to the developing veins to promote venous remodeling and SMC maturation via endothelial cell-expressed Tie2. Potential fluid removal mechanisms from neural retina include retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell pumps, venous drainage and diffusion to vitreous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daruich et al., 2018</xref>). (<bold>C</bold>) Angpt4 deficiency leads to defective circumferential growth and SMC maturation in early postnatal development that secondarily leads to neuronal cell damage due to impaired venous drainage.

Formation of astrocyte network in the superficial retinal layer occurs between embryonic day 19 and first postnatal day thus preceding vascular development. Astrocytes have a special function to form a template for sprouting ECs, and together with retinal ganglion cells astrocytes express growth factors for angiogenic guidance and EC survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Selvam et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, astrocytes are known to be a heterogeneous cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayraktar et al., 2015</xref>) and our data indicates that Angpt4<sup>+</sup> astrocytes represent a specific subpopulation among the glial cells. Intriguingly, genetic deletion revealed that Angpt4 is especially important in the far peripheral segment that may develop via different pathway than central neural retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Venters et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, clinical wide-field fundus imaging has identified a number of vascular diseases in humans in the peripheral retina that can affect also macula even though primary defect is peripheral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajwa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wessel et al., 2012</xref>). Despite its emerged clinical importance, until now no mechanism specially regulating vascular remodeling in this domain has been described.</p><p>Angpt4 expression was not found in mouse brain astrocytes, which further strengthens our conclusion that Angpt4<sup>+</sup> astrocytes represent a specific subpopulation. Outside of retina, we found <italic>Angpt4</italic> expression in arterial SMCs. These results (negative brain astrocytes, expression in certain SMCs) are in line with a recent comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic study of the mouse brain vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, in addition to retinal neuronal cells, Angpt1-GFP is also reported to be expressed in perivascular mural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2017</xref>). The data is currently limited but suggests that both Angpt1 and Angpt4 can be expressed in certain vascular SMCs, raising interesting questions regarding ligand-specific and possible synergistic or additional effects of these Tie2 ligands. Binding affinity of purified recombinant ANGPT4 protein to TIE2-Fc was considerably low when compared to ANGPT1 that binds TIE2 with high affinity. Nevertheless, ANGPT4 to TIE2 binding was sufficient for TIE2 phosphorylation (activation) in cell culture assays. In the case both ligands are present, the higher affinity may favor ANGPT1/TIE2 binding in tissues. Originally, ANGPT4 was identified as a TIE2 agonistic ligand in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valenzuela et al., 1999</xref>). In the first reports, mouse Angpt4 did not significantly induce TIE2 phosphorylation in human ECs when analyzed in western blot that suggested a species-specific effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valenzuela et al., 1999</xref>). However, in mice, excess of both Angpt4 and ANGPT4 similarly induced angiogenic remodeling in corneal micropocket assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2004</xref>) and in the trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that Angpt4 and ANGPT4 have similar in vivo functions. In our study, Angpt4 promoted lumen formation of human ECs with somewhat lower extent, but we observed no differences in Angpt4 and ANGPT4 binding characteristics to ECM, ECs or TIE2. Collectively, this suggests that despite relatively low average sequence homology (65% identity) between Angpt4 and ANGPT4, certain functional characteristics are still conserved.</p><p>Interestingly, observed spatiotemporally regulated expression of Angpt4 in astrocytes in the peripheral retina close to the developing veins significantly differed from other angiopoietins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gale et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hackett et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hackett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the venous-specific phenotype we characterize in <italic>Angpt4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice also differs from defects in <italic>Angpt1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Angpt2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> retinas; <italic>Angpt1</italic> deletion at P2–4 (analyzed at P5) caused reduced vascular density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), and <italic>Angpt2</italic> deficiency decreased sprouting of the primary plexus and delayed regression of the embryonic hyaloid vasculature at P10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gale et al., 2002</xref>). Although Angpt4 expression was induced in OIR model for ischemic retinopathy, Angpt4 deficiency did not affect microvascular proliferation, as has been found in <italic>Angpt1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>Angpt2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hackett et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting that Angpt4 is functionally different. On the other hand, in addition to ligand-specific effects, our in vitro characterization also revealed redundant functions between angiopoietins 1 and 4, suggesting that differential, spatiotemporally regulated expression provides an important mechanism for complementary and sequential roles of angiopoietins to establish retinal circulation system. Moreover, based on reported venous-specific effects of inducible Tie2 deletion in retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chu et al., 2016</xref>) and over-activating TIE2 mutations in venous malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kangas et al., 2018</xref>), Tie2 signaling appears particularly important to venous development that may contribute to the vessel-type-specific phenotype in <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><p>In Angpt4-deficient mice, we observed defective circumferential growth of peripheral veins postnatally and changes in neuronal cell organization and function in adult mice. Based on Poiseuille's equation, vessel flow is proportional to its radius. In line with this suggestion, functional tests using fluorescent tracers showed decreased venous flow in <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> retinas and we propose that alterations in neural cells are secondary to venous remodeling defect. While ultrastructural changes in neural cell somas closely resembled intracellular edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Łotowska et al., 2009</xref>), in Müller cells we observed discontinuation of cellular processes in the affected areas but no increase in Müller cell volume in the INL. Changes in Müller cells occur in retinal pathologies involving edema and are associated with altered expression of AQP4 water or Kir4.1 potassium channel, that may result in dysfunction in water homeostasis in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daruich et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> retinas, we found no changes in either AQP4 or Kir4.1, suggesting that water balance in Müller cells may be retained. Other neuronal cells in the INL (including amacrine and bipolar cells) may lack efficient water transport mechanism and thus be more vulnerable for alterations in fluid homeostasis due to diminished venous drainage that can be aggravated by the alterations in Müller cell architecture. We did not find evidence of interstitial edema, either. In literature, there is no similar pathology than what we observe in <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (congenital decrease in vein diameter, venous SMC abnormality, diminished vein flow, but no inflammation or leakage), making direct comparison to the better characterized retinal pathologies (such as diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion) difficult. It may be possible that interstitial edema is prominent in retinal vascular diseases in which vascular barrier is disrupted, which causes large increase in fluid entry that is excessive for exit mechanisms.</p><p>Overall, our study unraveled unknown physiological functions of poorly characterized Angpt4 in venous development and identified ligand-specific and redundant functions among the family of angiopoietins. Angpt/Tie signaling pathway has emerged as an important target for drug development in ophthalmological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saharinen et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to providing novel insights into developmental angiogenesis, thorough investigation of all angiopoietin ligands is necessary to fully evaluate the therapeutic potency of this signaling system.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <break/>C57BL/6N)</td><td valign="top">WT</td><td valign="top">Charles River Laboratories</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <break/>C57BL/6N)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>LacZ</sup></td><td valign="top">This Paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Generation described in detail in Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, <break/>strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <break/>C57BL/6N)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>Cre</sup></td><td valign="top">This Paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Generation describedin detail in Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, <break/>strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <break/>C57BL/6N)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>Cre</sup>; <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>mTmG</sup></td><td valign="top">This Paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Generation describedin detail in Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <break/>C57BL/6N)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Egln1</italic><sup>loxP</sup></td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">A gift from Prof. Johanna Myllyharju, University of Oulu</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(human)</td><td valign="top">Human umbilical <break/>vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)</td><td valign="top">Promocell</td><td valign="top">C-12203</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(human)</td><td valign="top">TIE2-WT HUVEC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saharinen et al.

The cells were imaged with LSM780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) with a Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.4 objective, and ratio of pTIE2/total TIE2 staining intensity at cell–cell junctions was quantified by using ZEN 2012 (blue edition) software (Carl Zeiss).</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation and western blotting</title><p>Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (9.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.7 mM NaH2PO4, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (P8340 and P5726, Sigma-Aldrich). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysate was incubated with TIE2 antibody (sc-324, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 hr at +4°C in rotation, after which Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (sc-2003, Santa Cruz biotechnology) was added and incubation continued overnight at +4°C in rotation, followed by washing three times with RIPA buffer. For western blot analysis, proteins were either left non-reduced or reduced by boiling for 5 min with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). Proteins were separated with SDS-PAGE and transferred into nitrocellulose membrane, followed by blocking in 5% milk powder in 0.05% Tween-PBS for 1 hr and incubation with penta-HIS (34660, Qiagen), phosphotyrosine (4G10, Merck Millipore) or TIE2 (Ab33, Merck Millipore) antibody dilutions overnight at +4°C.

His-tagged angiopoietins (500 ng/ml) in M200 basal medium were allowed to bound to the HUVEC ECM for 1 hr at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Penta-His (34660, Qiagen) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Qiagen) were used to detect ECM bound angiopoietins. Washes between steps were performed with 1xPBS (with Ca and Mg), 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.4. TMB X-tra substrate (Kem-En-Tec Diagnostics) was added for 13 min, the reaction was stopped with 0.2 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm with VICTOR<sup>3</sup>V 1420 Multilabel Counter (Perkin Elmer). Anti-TIE2 antibody (Merck Millipore) was used as a control for successful removal of TIE2 positive cell membrane, and anti-FN antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a positive control for the presence of ECM in the preparations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Cell spreading assay on substrate-linked angiopoietins</title><p>Coverslips were first coated with penta-His antibody (2.1 µg/ml) (34660, Qiagen) overnight at 4°C, followed by blocking with 1% heat-inactivated BSA-PBS for 2 hr at room temperature. Recombinant His-tagged angiopoietins (500 ng/ml in blocking buffer) were bound overnight at 4°C. For negative controls, coverslips were only coated with penta-HIS antibody (34660, Qiagen). For positive controls, coverslips were coated with fibronectin (FN, 20 µg/ml, R &amp; D systems). 20,000 TIE2 WT-HUVECs per coverslip were allowed to spread for 1 hr in M200 basal medium at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jeremy Nathans as Reviewing Editor and Harry Dietz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see, all of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work. Reviewer #3 did have a major concern expressed in his point #3 which he guessed could take more than the usual 2 months we allow for return of a revised manuscript. Please let us know if you will be able to accommodate this recommendation.</p><p>I am including the three reviews at the end of this letter, as there are a variety of specific and useful suggestions in them.</p><p>We appreciate that the reviewers' comments cover a broad range of suggestions for improving the manuscript. Please use your best judgment in deciding which of these can be accommodated in a reasonable period of time, e.g. 2-3 months.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Eklund et al. describe experiments aimed to study the function of Angiopoietin-3 (Ang3) in retinal vascular development. Using mouse Knock-in technology, they produce mouse strains that allow them to detect Ang3 expression in a subset of peripheral surface astrocytes in the developing mouse retina. Targeted deletion of Ang3 coding sequences result in loss of Ang3 expression and a specific effect on retinal peripheral veins and retinal edema. The authors also describe in vitro experiments in which the activity of mouse Ang3 and its human orthologue, Ang4, is compared to that of Ang1 and Ang2. They show that although all of these related ligands function through interactions with the Tie2 receptor, they probably interact with different affinities and dynamics that result in different functionality.</p><p>This manuscript describes a large amount of elegant work. It provides the first description of Ang3 function in retinal vasculature development and the first growth factor for venous specific development. However, the manuscript contains multiple typos, redundancies, and less than clear or accurate descriptions that will have to be addressed before publication.</p><p>Below are some specific notes.</p><p>1) Is the peripheral retina in Ang3-/- mice hypoxic due to reduced circulation?</p><p>This could be addressed using Hypoxyprobe (pimonidazole HCl) injections or by monitoring the number of GFP positive cells in the retinas of Ang3cre/cre; Rosa26mTmG mutant mice. Hypoxia will result in increased number of GFP positive astrocytes.</p><p>2)The authors state that &quot;In addition, no alterations were observed in the vasculature of the intermediate or deep vascular plexus postnatally or in adults.&quot; but provide no data to support this assertion. How was the density of the vascular plexus measured?</p><p>3) In the subsection “Ang3 deficiency results in neuronal edema”, the authors state that they did not observe cystoid edema, inflammation, or vascular leakage. The evidence for these observations is not presented or described in any details.</p><p>4) The first sentence of the Results section provides an inaccurate description of mouse retinal vascular development. Arteriovenous differentiation in the mouse retina occurs as the vessels grow on the retinal surface, beginning as early as P1 to P2.</p><p>5) Redundancies: the phrase &quot;… human Ang4 (orthologue for mouse Ang3).…&quot; appears at least 3 times in the figure legends.</p><p>6) Typos: Figure 1 legend, the sentence &quot;Note that Ang3 expressed cells in Ang3+/Cre; Rosa26mTmG mice….&quot; should read &quot;…Ang3 expressing cells…&quot; Also, the authors should add that all that GFP positive cells may just be progeny of Ang3 expressing cells.</p><p>7) Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, the annotation Ang3;GFP for cells in which the mTmG locus has been recombined by the Ang3cre allele seems inaccurate and confusing. It is also not used anywhere else in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript entitled: Angiopoietin-3-dependent venous maturation and fluid drainage in the peripheral retina, the authors describe the generation of 3 new transgenic mouse lines targeting the Angiopoietin-4 locus and provide data on its role in activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor, Tie2 and its function in the retina. Given the importance of the angiopoietin-tie2 system, the generation of new lines targeting Angiopietin-3 is valuable. In addition, identification of venous-specific functions are intriguing and provide important new information.</p><p>A few comments for consideration by the authors are listed below:</p><p>1) The retinal phenotype is quite subtle as shown. Do the authors have any additional functional data on flow in the retina, or neural function (e.g. ERGs etc. to support a functionally significant role of Angiopoietin-4 in the retina)?</p><p>2) While the authors state that fluid drainage of the retina is affected by loss of Angiopoietin-4, it is not clear from the phenotype observed (i.e. smooth muscle effect or the neuron swelling) that this is due to poor drainage. The authors do comment on the absence of lymphatics in the retina and suggest that Angiopoietin-4 helps to promote drainage. Clarification of model and mechanisms involved leading to the phenotype would be helpful. As it is written, it is confusing to understand how the observed defects are related to 'retinal edema' and fluid drainage.</p><p>3) The smooth muscle cell phenotype is descriptive -is there anything known about potential mechanism?

The authors show that Ang3 is expressed by retinal astrocytes during a (so far poorly characterized) vascular remodeling event that only occurs in a specific subtype of retinal veins. The findings are interesting because they demonstrate how retinal astrocytes can contribute to retinal vasculature patterning. However, the study contains several major shortcomings.</p><p>1) The mouse retinal vasculature initially develops as alternating artery-vein loops at the inner surface of the retina, i.e. there are the same number of veins as arteries. Subsequently, the deeper plexus develops and some of the veins are remodeled, ending up in the deeper plexus. Nevertheless, usually two veins stay at the surface, draining superficial flow. They bifurcate into a large annular vein at the peripheral edge of the retina (as indicated by Figure 2D). The authors should distinguish between these two types much more carefully throughout the manuscript in text as well as in figures.</p><p>2) Edema/neuronal swellinga) Only the INL was assessed in Figure 5A. However, based on the location of the vein remodeling defect, one could also anticipate reduced fluid drainage in the superficial plexus, particularly in the periphery. This should also be assessed (e.g. in the IPL).</p><p>b) It is surprising that the cellular swelling only affected the neurons and not the Müller cells (which are usually considered to be the main contributors of water drainage in the inner retina). What mechanism do the authors propose here?</p><p>c) It is also surprising that the authors did not find evidence of interstitial edema. Wouldn't one expect that from a lack of venous drainage?</p><p>d) In general, the authors should tone down their references to edema. The absence of extracellular fluid accumulation does not work well with this narrative. Furthermore, the in vivo data from the KO mice clearly points towards a vascular remodeling defect, which only secondarily leads to what may or may not be caused by reduced drainage.</p><p>3) The second part of the paper (Figure 7/8) does not link well to the first part. Firstly, the data (shown in Figure 7/8) is too superficially explained in the Results section. Secondly, I struggle to see how this relates on a mechanistic level to the phenotypes described in the KO mice and in the in vitro lumen formation assay. Yes, the authors introduce this section with the intention to demonstrate differences between Ang1 and Ang3/4 regarding Tie2 signaling, and they do show some differences. Although, the functional readout differences are not really that impressive considering Ang3/Ang4 have much lower binding affinity to Tie2 than Ang1 (Figure 7G, H). Furthermore, I fail to see how these differences relate to expansion of venous lumen in vivo, in particular when Ang1 and Ang3/4 have a similar effect (expansion of lumen) in the in vitro lumen formation assay (Figure 6).</p><p>4) Please indicate the age of the mice in Figure 2.</p><p>5) A simple, second line of evidence to demonstrate oxygen-regulated Ang3 expression (Figure 2) would be exposure to hyperoxia.

The authors do comment on the absence of lymphatics in the retina and suggest that Angiopoietin-4 helps to promote drainage. Clarification of model and mechanisms involved leading to the phenotype would be helpful. As it is written, it is confusing to understand how the observed defects are related to 'retinal edema' and fluid drainage.</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>Angpt4</italic>-deficient mice, we observe defective circumferential growth of veins. Based on Poiseuille's equation, vessel flow is proportional to its radius. In line with this suggestion, functional tests using fluorescent tracers showed decreased venous function in <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (Figure 7F-H). We propose that smooth muscle defect occurs independently from decreased venous flow as it is evident earlier than peripheral venous circulation is fully established. Alterations in neural cells are not visible in postnatal mice but appear later, suggesting that structural and functional changes in the INL occur secondary to defective venous flow and reduced venous-dependent fluid exit mechanisms. A graphical summary to clarify the model and mechanisms involved is now presented in new Figure 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The smooth muscle cell phenotype is descriptive -is there anything known about potential mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>Using definite markers for SMC maturation (αSMA, SM22, myofilament structures and fibrillar collagen matrix) in different developmental stages, we demonstrate that Angpt4 is required for retinal vein SMC maturation in vivo. A limitation of our work is that we could not dissect the whole molecular pathway how Angpt4 induces SMC maturation starting from Angpt4 producing astrocytes and ending to the expression of SMCs maturation markers. In-depth in vitro mechanistical studies were hindered by the lack of SMC precursor cells and tissue culturing model that could faithfully represent SMC maturation that occurs in the retina involving endothelial cells and astrocytes.</p><p>To mechanistically better understand Angpt4 signaling pathway in vivo, we have now investigated the expression of Angpt4 receptor Tie2, as well as Angpt1 and Angpt2 in the peripheral retina at the time of venous maturation (new Figure 3A-E). Based on close location of Angpt4-expressing astrocytes to both SMCs and ECs, we consider two signaling mechanisms possible, either 1) directly from astrocytes to SMCs or 2) to SMCs via EC-produced factor. Previous studies have indicated Angpt4 receptor Tie2 expression preferentially in EC, but also in some SMC precursor cells (Iurlaro et al., J Cell Sci. 2003, 116:3635-3643). In in situ hybridization experiments, however, we found Tie2 mRNAs only in ECs (new Figure 3E). Therefore, direct signaling from astrocytes to SMCs is not likely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the smooth muscle phenotype only found in the periphery of veins given the expression of Angiopoietin4 in the periphery only?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question exhaustively, we investigated Angpt4 spatiotemporal expression using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization in additional (earlier) developmental stages and analyzed venous αSMA expression and diameters close to optic nerve head (new panels in Figure 4, and new Figure 3). These analyses verified enhanced Angpt4 expression in the peripheral retina at P12, as we observed in genetic models. At P3 (the earliest time point we found consistent Angpt4 expression), Angpt4 was expressed in astrocytes preceding the vascular front in the mid- to peripheral retina. In contrast, Angpt4 was not expressed in central retina near to the optic nerve head (Figure 3A). In central retina, venous SMCs were not affected, thus confirming the spatial correlation of the SMC phenotype in <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with Angpt4 expression in WT mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also – it is not clear how the smooth muscle cell defect relates to the enlarged HUVEC diameter in vitro – is the effect on Tie2 in smooth muscle cells, on endos or both?</p></disp-quote><p>To investigate more carefully the Angpt4 signaling pathway involving ECs, SMCs and possible signaling loops between these cells, we analyzed Angpt4 receptor Tie2 expression in the retina and effects of Angpt4 in single and co-culture models of ECs and SMCs. We show that in the developing retina, Tie2 is expressed in ECs and not in SMCs (new Figure 3E). This suggested a model in which Angpt4 stimulates SMC maturation via ECs, rather than direct signaling from astrocytes to SMCs. This is in line with the results that in fibrin gel spheroid model, Angpt4-induced lumen enlargement is not enhanced by SMCs (Figure 8—figure supplement 1A), and that in single SMC culture Angpt4 did not affect SMC proliferation, survival, migration or stimulated SMC spheroids (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C and Figure 8—figure supplement 1B). As pointed out above, it is noteworthy that direct comparison between in vivophenotype and in vitro experiments is difficult, since currently SMC precursor cells and tissue culturing models to faithfully represent venous SMC maturation in the retina are lacking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similar to comments in #2 above, it would be helpful if the authors provided a clear model for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on new datawe proposed a model (a graphical summary in Figure 11) in which Angpt4 is produced by astrocytes, and signals via Tie2/Akt to ECs to promote venous remodeling.

Stimulation time was same than in immunofluorescence staining (Figure 9A) and TIE2 activation potency of mouse Angpt4 and human ANGPT4 was compared to native ANGPT1 (natural agonistic ligand), COMP-ANGPT1 (designed agonistic ligand), and Angpt2 (context-dependent antagonist/low agonist). As previously published (Lee et al., 2004), mouse Angpt4 showed a species-specific effect as it induced relatively low TIE2 tyrosine phosphorylation in human ECs when total TIE2 proteins were analyzed in WB. As shown in Figure 9A, TIE2 activation is observed in Angpt4-stimulated HUVECs as a punctuate staining specially in EC-EC junctions while a vast majority of TIE2 is evenly located on plasma membrane and not activated (negative for immunostaining for phosphorylated Tyr992 on the kinase <italic>activation loop</italic>). We have validated earlier the specificity of used antibody; it detects angiopoietin-stimulated TIE2-WT and over-activating TIE2-L914F mutation but does not stain TIE2 with kinase-inactivating mutation K855R (Nätynki et al., 2015). In Angpt4-stimulated HUVECs, fraction of cell-cell junction translocated and activated TIE2 is relatively small and may not be easily debatable in WB, nevertheless it is sufficient to stimulate lumen formation in a spheroid assay (Figure 8A-B). Why human ANGPT4 is more potent than mouse Angpt4 to induce TIE2 activation in human ECs is currently not known, but it may relate to lower oligomerization state of Angpt4 (Figure 9—figure supplement 2C-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The identification of a subpopulation of astrocytes is interesting.

It is also currently unknown if their origin is the same as other astrocytes. The tools we have generated in this study allow isolation and characterization of Angpt4 positive astrocytes. In-depth investigation of origin, specific characteristics and importance of Angpt4 positive astrocytes requires extensive additional experiments and will be focused on in another study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Based on structure, is there anything known about the order of oligomerization of Angiopoietin 4 to help explain its weaker agonism of Tie2?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now compared purified recombinant angiopoietin proteins used in this study in reducing and non-reducing conditions in SDS-PAGEs and Western blots (new Figure 9—figure supplement 2C-D).

Interestingly, mouse Angpt4 was less potent to induce TIE2 activation in WB and this may relate to lower oligomerization state of Angpt4 (Figure 9—figure supplement 2A-D). This is now included in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The size of the lumen appears larger after Angiopoeitin4 treatment than after Angiopietin1 treatment – is this the case?

We show here that Angpt4 and Angpt4 are not ECM bound like ANGPT1 and do not promote TIE2 translocation into EC-ECM contact sites that previously have shown to preferentially activate Erk signaling (Saharinen et al., 2008; Fukuhara et al., 2008). Differential ECM binding we found in this study may alter TIE2 signaling and bioavailability of ligands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Is angiopoeitin4 limited to retina?</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we primarily focused on retina as a widely used model for angiogenic growth, remodeling and maturation. As the neural retina can be considered as a part of central nervous system (CNS), we were also interested in whether Angpt4 expressing astrocytes are also present in the brains. To support this suggestion, ANGPT4 protein was reported to be expressed in normal, unselected population of human astrocytes at low level and increased in human glioma (Brunckhorst et al., 2010). However, in mouse brain astrocyte cultures we did not find Angpt4 expression (new Figure 10—figure supplement 1A). Astrocytes are known to be heterogeneous cells, and these results further strengthen our conclusion that Angpt4<sup>+</sup> astrocytes represent a specific subpopulation among the glial cells.</p><p>To investigate non-central nervous tissue, we have now analyzed mesenteric whole-mounts, where vasculature is readily visible for microscopic analysis.

Furthermore, Angpt1-GFP is reported to be expressed in the neuronal cells at P5 in mouse retina, but also in perivascular mural cells in choroidal vessels. The data is currently somewhat limited but suggests that in non-retinal tissue expression of Angpt1 and Angpt4 may be overlapping in some perivascular mural cells. This raises interesting questions regarding specific/synergistic/additional effects of these Tie2-agonistic ligands in non-CNS tissues that will be addressed in subsequent studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Is there any circulating Angiopoietin4?</p></disp-quote><p>The presence of Angpt4 was invested in P12 serum using commercially available ELISA.

Ultrastructural changes suggestive for neuronal cell swelling (increased volume of cell organelle free cytoplasm, disordered cellular organization) were observed in the INL, but not in other retinal layers. Defective vein development in <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice shares some similarities with retinal vein occlusions (RVO) (i.e. reduced venous drainage) but is less severe and does not result in inflammation or leakage that further increases excessive fluid in RVO. In the peripheral retina Angpt4 receptor Tie2 is expressed only in endothelial cells (new Figure 3E), suggesting that direct Angpt4 signaling from astrocytes to neuronal cells is unlikely. Furthermore, we observe alterations in the INL in mature eye after venous remodeling defect and high Angpt4 expression at P12. Based on our data, we propose that ultrastructural changes in the INL are secondary to reduced vein function. Distance between the superficial vasculature and the INL is about 50 μm (roughly equals with the average distance between capillaries in the retina). Functional venous flow may be especially important for INL, while diffusion to the vitreous in the most superficial layer and pigment epithelial cell pumps in outer layer may provide additional/compensatory mechanisms. Schematic model is presented in new Figure 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It is surprising that the cellular swelling only affected the neurons and not the Müller cells (which are usually considered to be the main contributors of water drainage in the inner retina). What mechanism do the authors propose here?</p></disp-quote><p>In electron microscopic analysis of INL, we observe changes in the normal architecture of Müller cells (discontinuation of Müller cell processes)that normallyspan across the retina, but no increase in Müller cell volume. Swelling of Müller cells occur in retinal pathologies and associated altered expression of AQP4 water or Kir4.1 potassium channel in Müller cells that may result in dysfunctional water homeostasis in these cells. In <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> retinas, we found no changes in AQP4 nor Kir4.1, suggesting that water balance in Müller cells may be retained. Neuronal cells (amacrine and bipolar cells in the INL), may lack efficient water transport mechanism and be more vulnerable for alterations in fluid homeostasis due to diminished venous drainage. This can be aggravated by the alterations in Müller cell architecture. This assumption is now included in Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) It is also surprising that the authors did not find evidence of interstitial edema. Wouldn't one expect that from a lack of venous drainage?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we investigated the severity of venous dysfunction in <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> retinas. In fundus angiography, venous filling is slower in <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and carotid artery injected fluorospheres accumulated in the peripheral annular vein in the <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (new Figure 7). Based on these functional assays, venous drainage is impaired, but not completely blocked. As also pointed above, in literature we found no similar pathology than we observe in <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (i.e. decrease in vein diameter, diminished peripheral vein flow, venous SMC abnormality, no inflammation, no leakage), making direct comparison to other retinal vascular pathologies (i.e. diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion) difficult. It may be possible that interstitial edema is prominent in vascular diseases in which vascular barrier disrupted, which causes large increase in fluid entry that is excessive for exit mechanisms. Those neuronal cells that lack efficient water pumping mechanism may make them more vulnerable for passive influx of fluid that may be increased in <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> retinas. This is now discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) In general, the authors should tone down their references to edema. The absence of extracellular fluid accumulation does not work well with this narrative. Furthermore, the in vivo data from the KO mice clearly points towards a vascular remodeling defect, which only secondarily leads to what may or may not be caused by reduced drainage.</p></disp-quote><p>This is done. In <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we first observe venous remodeling defect in postnatal mice and we propose that other phenotypes (impaired venous drainage and neuronal cell changes) are secondary. The model is now presented in schematic summary (new Figure 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The second part of the paper (Figure 7/8) does not link well to the first part. Firstly, the data (shown in Figure 7/8) is too superficially explained in the Results section. Secondly, I struggle to see how this relates on a mechanistic level to the phenotypes described in the KO mice and in the in vitro lumen formation assay. Yes, the authors introduce this section with the intention to demonstrate differences between Ang1 and Ang3/4 regarding Tie2 signaling, and they do show some differences. Although, the functional readout differences are not really that impressive considering Ang3/Ang4 have much lower binding affinity to Tie2 than Ang1 (Figure 7G, H). Furthermore, I fail to see how these differences relate to expansion of venous lumen in vivo, in particular when Ang1 and Ang3/4 have a similar effect (expansion of lumen) in the in vitro lumen formation assay (Figure 6).</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we observed venous SMCs abnormality and smaller diameter of annular veins. Possible molecular and cellular pathway by which Angpt4 may promote luminal growth and EC to SMC signaling were investigated in vitro either as single cell type or in co-culture models. Another motivation for detailed in vitro comparison of angiopoietins was that it has been controversial how well human and mouse Angpt4functions are conserved due to divergence in their primary structures. Reviewer 2 foundstudies comparing angiopoietins important and strengthening the manuscript. In addition, we were also requested for some additional in vitro comparisons of angiopoietins that we have faithfully done (Figure 9—figure supplement 2). Please find below, how in vitro and in vivo experiments are linked together, and how in vitro experiments help mechanistically understand in vivo results. Also, the data is now explained more extensively in the Results section.</p><p>Tie2 is mainly expressed in ECs, however, its expression is also reported in vascular mural cell precursors (Iurlaro et al., J Cell Sci. 2003, 116:3635-3643), and therefore we considered it possible that astrocytes may directly signal to SMCs. In line with this suggestion we found some TIE2 expression in SMC lines isolated from maturated veins and arteries (Figure 5K). Excesses of ANGPT4, however, had no effect on SMCs cellular functions (proliferation, migration, survival) (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>As SMC lines isolated form maturated veins may not well represent SMC precursor cells in the developing retina, we further investigated Angpt4 receptor <italic>Tie2</italic> mRNA expression in retinas using in situ hybridization at P12, when Angpt4 expression is high and venous remodeling of large annular vein occurs. As shown in new Figure 3E, <italic>Tie2</italic> expression is detected only in ECs in peripheral retina. Collectively, based on in vitro and in vivo data, direct Angpt4 signaling from astrocytes to SMCs via Tie2 is not likely.</p><p>Possible molecular pathway by which ANGPT4 may increase expansion of luminal structure was investigated in fibrin gel model, either using ECs alone or co-culture model of EC/SMC spheroids (Figure 8 and new Figure 8—figure supplement 1A). ANGPT4 and Angpt4 expanded lumen structure in ECs and addition of SMCs had no effect, also proposing that ANGPT4 and Angpt4 may primarily signal to ECs via TIE2. In line with this suggestion, TIE2 shRNA silenced HUVECs did not respond to ANGPTt4 in a spheroid assay, indicating the dependence of endothelial TIE2 in expansion of luminal structure in vitro.</p><p>Comparison of ANGPT1, Angpt4 and ANGPT4 in the spheroid assay revealed that despite their divergent primary structures and differences in biochemical properties, we found that they all are competent to increase luminal structure via the same signaling pathway. In addition, careful analysis of EC-EC junctions revealed that they all activated TIE2 in this specific subcellular compartment that is important for TIE2/AKT signaling (Saharinen et al., 2008; Fukuhara et al., 2008). These results suggest that functions of ANGPT1, Angpt4 and ANGPT4 are partly conserved. This is in line with a previous study in mouse, in which excess of these ligands similarly induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling (Kim et al., 2007).</p><p>In the far peripheral retina, Angpt2 and Angpt4 (new Figure 3) were both expressed at P12 when venous maturation occurred in this domain. in vitro, ANGPT2 did not induce TIE2 activation in EC-EC junctions and did not enhance lumen formation, indicating that ANGPT2 less potent to functionally compensate ANGPT4 to promote venous growth, thus partly explaining specific phenotype in Angpt4 deficient mice.</p><p>Collectively, combination of in vitro and in vivo results suggested a model in which Angpt4 primarily signals via endothelial Tie2 to enhance EC to SMC signaling for SMCs maturation (new Figure 11). The previously observed vascular phenotype in Angpt4 deficient retinas was clearly different from that observed in mice lacking Angpt1 or Angpt2 and based on our data we propose that differentially regulated expression of angiopoietins is an important mechanism to generate ligand-specific functions in the developing eye.</p><p>ANGPT1 is an obligatory agonistic ligand and binds to TIE2 with a high affinity (Kd 3.7 nM, Davis et al., Cell, 1996, 8:1161–1169). We show that although binding affinity of human ANGPT4 to TIE2 is lower, it is still sufficient for TIE2 activation in Western blot and in cell-cell junctions. In this specific compartment, also mouse Angpt4 activated human TIE2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please indicate the age of the mice in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>This is done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A simple, second line of evidence to demonstrate oxygen-regulated Ang3 expression (Figure 2) would be exposure to hyperoxia. Why has this not been done?</p></disp-quote><p>We were originally interested in ischemia that is considered to be more relevant for many vascular diseases. <italic>Angpt4</italic> gene promoter contains hypoxia response element and based on our data we are confident that <italic>Angpt4</italic> expression in positively regulated by low oxygen. Nevertheless, hyperoxia experiment is now done; WT and <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>Cre</sup> ; <italic>Rosa</italic>26<sup>mTmG</sup> mice were placed in a 75% oxygen chamber for 5 days and euthanized at P12 together with control mice that were raised under normoxic conditions. As shown in new Figure 2—figure supplement 2, <italic>Angpt1</italic> mRNA expression was decreased while <italic>Angpt2</italic> and <italic>Angpt4</italic> increased. In addition, there was a trend for increased number of <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>+</sup> astrocytes. The results are not straightforward to interpret as raising newborn mice in hyperoxia may not be a simple negative control for hypoxia: Hyperoxia has reported to paradoxically cause retinal hypoxia by blocking vascular development (West et al., Development, 2005) that may perhaps explain increase in <italic>Angpt2</italic> and <italic>Angpt4</italic> expression. In addition, hyperoxia has toxic effects in the retina causing retinal degeneration (Yamada et al., J Cell Physiol. 1999) and it may be possible that increase in <italic>Angpt4</italic> may relate to more general stress reaction in the retina. Finally, a short-term hyperoxia promotes astrocytic differentiation (Duan et al., Sci Reports, 2017) and may also affect <italic>Angpt4</italic><sup>+</sup> astrocytes. In addition to hypoxia, other mechanism to regulate <italic>Angpt4</italic> expression also likely exists.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please indicate the staining/visualization method in Figure 5B.</p> </disp-quote><p>This is now done.</p></body></sub-article></article>
