During infection, the parasite invades the host cells and replicates inside a specialized cell structure called a ‘parasitophorous vacuole’ until the host cell bursts.

It was unclear how the parasites coordinated this process, but some researchers suggested that the parasites remained connected to each other to communicate by exchanging material and information.

The pathological manifestation is caused in a large part by repeated rounds of the parasite’s lytic cycle, beginning with active invasion of the host cell by the parasite, replication within a specialized vacuole termed the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), followed by egress and lysis of the host cell. Replication occurs via a unique process of endodyogeny, where two daughter parasites are constructed within the mother, before elongating and budding, leading to the breakdown of the maternal parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Francia and Striepen, 2014</xref>). Remnants of the mother cell remain at the posterior end of the daughter parasites in a structure known as the residual body (RB), which has a role in organizing the parasites into their characteristic rosette pattern within the PV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muñiz-Hernández et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2002</xref>). Membrane connections persist between the RB and the parasites until host cell lysis and parasite egress, presumably to allow inter-parasite communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muñiz-Hernández et al., 2011</xref>). To date little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes. Previous studies focused on the role of microtubules during parasite replication, since treatment with microtubule inhibitors leads to structural collapse of the parasite, while actin-modulating drugs are thought to cause only slight defects in replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, research on parasite actin focused on its crucial role during host cell invasion and egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobrowolski and Sibley, 1996</xref>). However, recent studies have also implicated actin and myosins in intracellular processes including apicoplast division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egarter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andenmatten et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jacot et al., 2013</xref>), secretory organelle (dense granule) transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heaslip et al., 2016</xref>) and parasite replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haase et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Actin is a highly conserved protein, which forms dynamic filaments in eukaryotic cells. Through an association with actin-binding proteins, these filaments are themselves organized into higher order structures that play important roles in a wide variety of cellular functions including muscle contraction, vesicle transport and cytokinesis. <italic>T. gondii</italic> actin is encoded by a single gene, <italic>act1</italic> and has only ~80% sequence identity with mammalian actin isoforms but shares 93% similarity with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ACT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dobrowolski et al., 1997</xref>). Apicomplexan ACT1 is clearly essential, and compared to its counterparts in higher eukaryotes is believed to be intrinsically unstable, resulting in the formation of only short filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skillman et al., 2011</xref>). Biochemical assays indicate that 97% of the parasites actin is present in the globular form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">(Dobrowolski et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skillman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wetzel et al., 2003</xref>). It has been proposed that apicomplexan actin is unique amongst actins as it polymerizes in a highly unusual, isodesmic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skillman et al., 2013</xref>). According to the isodesmic polymerisation model, monomer addition is governed by a single equilibrium constant, meaning that no (unfavourable) activation step is required to initiate the formation of the first dimer leading to polymerisation. In this instance, nucleation and elongation are equally favourable. This contrasts to cooperative polymerisation, where the activation step is the formation of the first dimer/trimer, which has a higher equilibrium constant than polymer elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smulders et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore polymer formation can only occur above a critical concentration (Cc) of monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pantaloni et al., 1985</xref>). It is this activation step that is regulated by actin nucleators, such as the Arp2/3 complex or formins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlier et al., 2015</xref>). Puzzlingly, formins and other actin nucleating proteins have been shown to have essential roles in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium,</italic> begging the question of their function if they are not required to initiate actin polymerisation or accelerate filament elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jacot et al., 2013</xref>). A recent study suggested that the polymerization process of apicomplexan actin needs to be reinvestigated, as heterologously expressed apicomplexan actin, the basis for many of the previous studies, is incorrectly folded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olshina et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that conditional deletion of <italic>act1</italic> in <italic>T. gondii</italic> results in complete abrogation of known actin functions, long before G-actin levels are fully depleted, suggesting that in vivo the formation of F-actin depends on a critical monomer concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Whitelaw et al., 2017</xref>). This raises concerns about previous studies of actin polymerization kinetics based on mis-folded actin. Furthermore, imaging studies on different life cycle stages of the apicomplexan parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum,</italic> demonstrated the formation of an extensive F-actin cytoskeleton in both gametocytes and ookinetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hliscs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siden-Kiamos et al., 2012</xref>). Using 3D-SIM it was demonstrated in gametocytes that these filaments appear to be organized in the cytoplasm, below the Inner Membrane Complex (IMC; a specialised structure found in apicomplexans that consists of membranous vesicles and structural components located just beneath the plasma membrane) of the parasite rather than between the IMC and the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hliscs et al., 2015</xref>), where it is thought to power parasite gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meissner et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To further address the role of ACT1 in parasite growth, we characterized a recently generated conditional actin knockout parasite line (<italic>act1 cKO</italic>) during the intracellular portion of the parasites lytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andenmatten et al., 2013</xref>). We demonstrate that <italic>act1</italic> cKO parasites lack a residual body and grow in an asynchronous and disorganized manner within the PV. Further investigation of actin functions required imaging the filamentous actin cytoskeleton. Previous attempts to visualise F-actin within the parasites have largely been unsuccessful, since conventional actin labelling techniques such as Life-Act, Phalloidin and SiR-Act do not allow detection of F-actin within the parasites. GFP-actin shows a high signal to noise ratio in parasites causing the inability to differentiate actin filaments from the monomeric form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angrisano et al. (2012a)</xref>. Thus we sought a new approach to image F-actin in intracellular parasites by expressing actin-chromobody, a single chain anti-actin camel antibody that has been successfully employed in diverse eukaryotes, including plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rocchetti et al., 2014</xref>) and animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plessner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panza et al., 2015</xref>). Chromobodies (Cb) were found to have several advantages compared to other actin probes, such as lower toxicity, less influence on F-actin dynamics and a high signal to noise ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panza et al., 2015</xref>). Using this probe, we were able to visualise filamentous actin in live parasites. While some filamentous structures were seen within the parasite cytosol as expected, we were surprised to observe extensive F-actin networks in the RB and F-actin-containing membranous tubules linking parasites within a vacuole. These tubules appear to be involved in the transport of material between parasites and recycling of the mother IMC at the end of the replication cycle. Collectively, these data identify new roles for actin in the intracellular phase of the parasites lytic cycle and provide a robust new tool for imaging parasitic F-actin dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Depletion of actin results in the loss of the residual body</title><p>We previously characterised a conditional knockout for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> actin (<italic>act1 cKO</italic>) and found that, in addition to its important role during gliding motility and host cell invasion, parasite actin is essential for maintenance of the apicoplast, dense granule motility and host cell egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egarter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heaslip et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, a recent study demonstrated a role for actin in parasite replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haase et al., 2015</xref>) and thus we used the <italic>act1 cKO</italic> to further examine the role of actin in parasite growth. Although initially intracellular <italic>act1 cKO</italic> parasites replicate at comparable rate to wild-type parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egarter et al., 2014</xref>), they grew asynchronously and appeared disorganised, without the characteristic rosette organization of parasites in the parasitophorous vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). While parasites replicate normally up to the 4 cell stage, later divisions are not tightly synchronised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), meaning that within the same PV parasites can be identified that are at different stages of endodyogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, arrow). In addition, the intravacuolar network, as visualised using Gra2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mercier et al., 1993</xref>), appeared disorganised and malformed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of intracellular parasites, we observed that in wild-type (RH) <italic>T. gondii</italic> a membranous network connects parasites at their posterior pole whereas no obvious connections between individual parasites were observed in the <italic>act1</italic> cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, imaging of extracellular parasites by SEM and immunofluorescence showed aberrant morphology at the posterior pole in the <italic>act1</italic> cKO parasites, which appears generally flattened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, arrow). Together, these data suggest a role of actin in the formation of the RB, the organization of parasites within the PV and the intravacuolar network. Furthermore, asynchronous replication of parasites within the PV may indicate a loss of signalling between individual parasites.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24119.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of intracellular development of <italic>act1</italic> cKO.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conditional null mutants for <italic>act1</italic> were induced as previously described in order to excise <italic>act1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egarter et al., 2014</xref>). 96 hr post induction, parasites were fixed and stained with anti-Gra2 to visualise the intravacuolar network.

Using actin-modulating drugs, the actin cytoskeleton was either depolymerized with Cytochalasin D (Cyt-D) or stabilized with Jasplakinolide (Jas). Treatment of intracellular parasites with Cyt-D led to the disintegration of the inter-parasite connections with only punctate spots remaining, which were also identified with anti-actin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Using default settings of the Ridge Detector plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steger, 1998</xref>) we determined the apparent number, maximum length and average filament size of PVs treated with Jas, Cyt-D or untreated PVs (control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> right panel). In Jas-treated PVs, and in contrast to Cyt-D treated PVs, there is an increase in average and maximum filament size, together with a decrease in total number of short filaments supporting the stabilisation and depolymerisation of Cb-Halo detected filaments in the presence of Jas and Cyt-D respectively. An intermediate situation occurs in untreated PVs with long filaments and high number of short filaments supporting a dynamic regulation in actin polymerisation in control samples. Overall, these results support that filaments detected with Cb-Halo behave as typical actin filaments in the presence of actin regulatory drugs. This supports the evidence that Cb-Halo is specifically labelling F-actin filaments and that Cb binding to actin does not prevent depolymerisation caused by Cyt-D.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24119.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Chromobodies specifically stain parasite F-Actin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 3D-SIM imaging of parasites transiently expressing Cb-Halo (red) and stained using actin antibody (green) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angrisano et al., 2012b</xref>).

Using these parasites, we found that as early as 24 hr after excision of the <italic>act1</italic> gene, the filamentous network collapsed, leaving punctate actin spots visible only in the RBs (similar to vacuoles treated with Cyt-D). By 48 hr onwards, no F-actin structures could be observed and Cb-Halo was completely cytosolic, as expected due to cytosolic expression of this reagent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The loss of filaments within the <italic>act1</italic> cKO over-time follows the down-regulation of ACT1 in <italic>act1</italic> cKO, indicating a polymerisation mechanism similar to eukaryotic actins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Whitelaw et al., 2017</xref>). To exclude a role of host cell actin in the formation of the inter-parasite connections, we treated infected host cells with the actin-disrupting drug latrunculin A, which specifically inhibits polymerization of host cell, but not parasite, actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hegge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Whitelaw et al., 2017</xref>). We found that latrunculin A treatment for 3 hr led to complete disruption of host cell F-actin (visualised using Phalloidin<sub>488</sub>), while the parasite F-actin network remained unaffected. This confirms that Cb-positive filamentous structures were not derived from host cell actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Next we wished to compare F-actin dynamics in a conditional mutant for the actin depolymerisation factor (ADF; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mehta and Sibley, 2011</xref>]). Previous studies demonstrated that the knockdown of ADF leads to stabilisation of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mehta and Sibley, 2011</xref>) and apicoplast loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haase et al., 2015</xref>). When we expressed Cb-Emerald in <italic>adf</italic> cKD to compare actin dynamics, we found that in absence of anhydrotetracycline (ATc) - when ADF is expressed - parasite F-actin shows a highly dynamic behaviour similar to wt parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, compare <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Videos 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">7</xref>). In stark contrast, incubation of parasites with ATc for 96 hr leads to depletion of ADF and consequently F-actin dynamics is significantly diminished. Under these conditions F-actin filaments accumulate at the posterior and to a lesser extent at the apical pole of the parasites. However, no dynamic behaviour can be detected and no filaments can be detected within the cytosol of the parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> (red arrows), <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Videos 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">7</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media6" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-24119-media6.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24119.017</object-id><label>Video 6.</label><caption><title>Analysis of actin dynamics in <italic>adf</italic> cKO expressing Cb-Emerald in absence of ATc.</title><p>Note the highly dynamic F-actin within the cytosol of the parasites.

Thin sections of the same network were then imaged with transmission electron microscopy (squares). This demonstrated that extracellular F-actin filaments reside within membranous tubules of 50–60 nm in diameter. Within these tubules, several ~5 nm thick filaments (arrows) extending over 100 nm in length were observed (highlighted in magenta). Taken together these results confirm the presence of bundles of actin filaments bound within a membranous network, which connects individual parasites within the PV.

Since then, polymerization kinetics of heterologously expressed apicomplexan actin showed that it polymerized in an unusual isodesmic process, in contrast to conventional eukaryotic actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skillman et al., 2013</xref>). These findings have been recently questioned, as heterologously expressed apicomplexan actin was shown to be misfolded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olshina et al., 2016</xref>). In parallel, a number of recent genetic studies have demonstrated important functions of parasite actin during intracellular development, including maintenance of the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andenmatten et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egarter et al., 2014</xref>), daughter cell replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haase et al., 2015</xref>) and motility of secretory organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heaslip et al., 2016</xref>). These findings cannot be easily reconciled with the current view of parasite actin being incapable of efficient polymerization, and would instead predict the presence of F-actin filaments within the parasite cytosol. Furthermore, there are 11 putative myosin motors within the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foth et al., 2006</xref>), driving diverse cellular processes from cell division to motility, which require actin filaments to function.</p><p>A major impediment to resolving this controversy has been the lack of appropriate reagents for specifically labelling F-actin. Parasite actin does not bind phalloidin, the gold standard reagent in other eukaryotic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skillman et al., 2011</xref>) and, attempts to use genetically encoded actin sensors, such a LifeAct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riedl et al., 2008</xref>) or Utrophin-CH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkel et al., 2007</xref>) have failed thus far (our and others unpublished data). Using a novel tool based on camelid nanobodies, Chromobody, we have visualized F-actin in <italic>T. gondii</italic> for the first time in live parasites and demonstrated it has important and previously unforeseen roles during the intracellular development of the parasite. While individual actin filament kinetics could not be easily defined, due to their highly dynamic nature within the parasite cytosol (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Videos 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">7</xref>), a relatively stable F-actin network was clearly visible that linked individual parasites within the vacuole. Chromobodies have been used successfully in diverse eukaryotes to analyse actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plessner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rocchetti et al., 2014</xref>) and appear to have less toxicity than other F-actin sensors. However, we were concerned that Cb expression in <italic>T. gondii</italic> would perturb actin polymerisation, especially given the proposed dynamic and unstable nature of <italic>T. gondii</italic> actin. Indeed, high levels of transiently expressed Cb inhibited dense granule motility, likely by stabilizing F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, upon stable expression of Cb-Halo or Cb-Emerald, no effect on the actin-dependent processes of invasion, replication and egress were observed, while only small alterations in dense granule movement and parasite motility were detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The reason for these discrepancies is currently unknown, but may be related to differing sensitivities of actin dynamics for these processes. Additionally, we demonstrated that the total amount of F-actin in the parasite does not change upon expression of Cb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), indicating that while actin dynamics may be modulated, the overall polymerization state of actin does not change. We show that parasite actin remains susceptible to depolymerising and stabilizing agents Cyt-D and Jas. Moreover, the localization of Cb to filamentous structures in the residual body and inter-parasite network critically depends on the presence of actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These data confirm that genetically encoded Cb-Halo and Cb-Emerald does not significantly alter actin dynamics within the parasite and so is an appropriate and robust tool for examining F-actin in this system.</p><p>The presence of actin in the RB and inter-parasite tubules has not previously been observed or predicted, and so we sought to independently verify that this localization was not an artefact of Cb expression. Labelling parasites with α-actin that preferentially recognises F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angrisano et al., 2012b</xref>) allowed the detection of actin positive structures connecting individual parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), though the stain appeared more diffuse. When actin filaments were stabilised by the presence of Jas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) this stain becomes more prominent and this was not dependent on the expression of Cb. This suggests that F-actin is less accessible to exogenously added antibodies after fixation, perhaps due to epitope alterations during fixation or the association of actin binding proteins to filaments. Interestingly, while actin has never been previously associated with this membranous network in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, it appears very similar to structures recently described for the related parasite <italic>Theileria annulata</italic>, which was shown to contain F-actin in a similar configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kühni-Boghenbor et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Using a combination of imaging and reverse genetics, we demonstrate that F-actin is required for the formation and/or maintenance of the residual body. Parasites lacking actin do not contain a residual body and are disorganized within the PV. In addition, we show that these extracellular actin-containing structures are required for the transport of material between parasites within a vacuole. The residual body and inter-parasite network allow both the free diffusion of cytoplasmic material between parasites, and transport of membrane bound vesicles between parasites. Further work will be required to determine if these membrane bound vesicles are then taken up by other parasites or are simply transported to the RB to remove them and if a myosin motor powers this for its transportation, as is the case of dense granule transport within the parasite cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heaslip et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The organization of F-actin within the parasites and vacuole is highly dynamic throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). In interphase parasites, long inter-parasite contentions extend throughout the PV. At the beginning of the replication cycle this network collapses and is found concentrated in the residual body (or bodies). Within the parasites, F-actin is found concentrated at the IMC of growing daughter cells during elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). As the daughters bud from the mother cell, the inter-parasite connections again extend throughout the PV. As would be expected, the network also collapses in response to calcium ionophore, freeing the parasites and allowing egress. As motile parasites leave the PV, actin appears concentrated at the basal end of parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24119.027</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>(1) After successful invasion, tachyzoites establish a parasitophorous vacuole and initiate replication.</title><p>(2) During daughter cell formation, actin labelling is observed at the IMC of the daughter cells and at the posterior pole of the mother.

We speculate that this network consists of either short F-actin bundles that are cross-linked via unknown actin-binding proteins (based on the formation of short actin filaments in vitro) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skillman et al., 2011</xref>) or that the presence of actin binding proteins such as formin, profilin, and coronin may coordinate their activities in vivo to produce longer actin filaments than those formed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skillman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olshina et al., 2016</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salamun et al., 2014</xref>). While this study focuses on the characterization of the membranous network within the PV, it is worth nothing that highly dynamic actin filaments have been also detected within the cytosol of the parasite, and we show that these dynamics are almost completely abolished upon depletion of ADF in good agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haase et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mehta and Sibley, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Videos 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">7</xref>). Defining the organization of cytosolic filaments will be critical to further elucidating the role of F-actin both during intracellular processes such as vesicle transport and extracellular processes such as motility and invasion, where the role of the parasites acto-myosin system is currently readdressed, since parasites devoid of detectable actin remain invasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Whitelaw et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, it appears that host cell membrane dynamics, driven by host cell actin, appears to be modulated by the parasite, enabling invasion in the absence of a functional parasite acto-myosin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bichet et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that F-actin is organized into distinct, higher order structures, perhaps forming large stable bundles in the tubules while existing as single filaments or small bundles in the cytosol. Future work will be needed to further define the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and to identify the actin binding proteins which contribute to the formation of these structures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The Cb-Halo plasmid consists of a sequence encoding actin chromobody (Cb) from Chromotek followed downstream by an in frame sequence encoding Halo (Promega).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Isabelle Tardieux (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript addresses the organization of actin filaments in the protozoan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. The authors use an actin probe based on camelid antibodies (chromobody, Cb) to trace endogenous actin during intracellular life cycle. This approach has already proved successful in monitoring actin dynamics in various systems ranging from mammalian cell lines to the whole zebrafish. This approach is highly relevant in the context of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and related parasites, since the understanding of actin dynamics (i.e. assembly/disassembly/2D and 3D organization) remains quite elusive in this organism and the processes of formation and turnover of polymerized actin pool are subject of controversy. Use of a chromobody helps to avoid the drawbacks of direct tagging or overexpression. This study clearly brings novelty to the field but also challenges the existing data in particular concerning the amount of F-actin, localization and network architecture in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. While the authors do not yet provide mechanistic explanations on how a particular F-actin bundle-like network that spreads in the vacuolar space, could nucleate, maintain the polarity of the progeny within the vacuole and possibly assist daughter cell individualisation, the first identification of this actin-based population provides a new angle for future dissection of the features of actin dynamics during <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> replication and possibly for uncovering additional F-actin sub-populations of distinct dynamics.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The strength of the tool/approach and the high informative value of some experiments (some live and static assays, especially the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, which is gorgeous) are somewhat weakened by inaccuracies in the text and also by limited sampling (quantitative data and statistics are not presented). To make this contribution stronger, we thus recommend to improve the clarity in the introductive part, to reorganize data presentation (the authors might consider showing the static study first, followed by the live study), to correct some editing errors throughout the text and to provide additional information as requested below. Please also check that for each figure presenting graphs, the definition of the error bars, the n numbers, the number of experiments and the statistical test used are included in the corresponding figure legends. Please also confirm that the statistical test used was appropriate (e.g., a t-test can be applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution).</p><p>1) The Abstract needs to be rewritten to help the reader on the rationale of the experimental approach (the actin chromobody approach is not mentioned) and the main results.</p><p>2) Abstract and Introduction:</p><p><italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasite needs to be introduced.</p><p>Egress needs to be introduced.</p><p>It is difficult to understand why the possible role(s) of actin described is/are unexpected?

This is also puzzling for the loxActin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) where few filaments (bundles as nicely seen later <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) are observed among the tachyzoites in the vacuole. The description of the network that here looks as lying between tachyzoites within the vacuole is a little different from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, which shows a network in the connecting posterior structure throughout the replication cycle.

Does it really seem likely that the actin is as rare a protein as previous studies have suggested if 2% can be assembled into such extensive networks?

In particular, we performed additional assays to quantify the amount of asynchronous replication of <italic>act1cKO</italic> parasites and added data for a conditional mutant for the actin depolymerisation factor (ADF) to further demonstrate formation of F-actin and F-actin dynamics in intracellular parasites. We considered to rearrange the data presentation, but felt that it would disrupt the “flow” of the study, since we organised data according to the characterisation of F-actin function (intracellular replication and formation of a F-actin network within the parasitophorous vacuole, transport of material in between individual parasites and egress).</p><p>The definition of error bars, n numbers, number of experiments and statistical tests are now included in the figure legends.</p><p><italic>1) The Abstract needs to be rewritten to help the reader on the rationale of the experimental approach (the actin chromobody approach is not mentioned) and the main results.</italic> </p><p>We introduced the Chromobody in the Abstract.</p><p><italic>2) Abstract and Introduction:</italic> </p><p><italic>Toxoplasma parasite needs to be introduced.</italic></p><p><italic>Egress needs to be introduced.</italic> </p><p>We rewrote huge parts of the Introduction and elaborate on <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and its asexual life cycle in more detail.</p><p><italic>It is difficult to understand why the possible role(s) of actin described is/are unexpected?

However, it requires probably a full review to address all the implications and questions appropriately. We briefly introduced isodesmic vs. cooperative assembly mechanisms and the implication for actin binding proteins.</p><p>It now reads:</p><p>“According to the isodesmic polymerisation model, monomer addition is governed by a single equilibrium constant, meaning that no (unfavourable) activation step is required to initiate polymerisation. […] Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that conditional depletion of actin in <italic>T. gondii</italic> results in complete abrogation of known actin functions, long before G-actin levels are fully depleted, suggesting that in vivothe formation of F-actin depends on a critical monomer concentration (Whitelaw, 2017 #1277).”</p><p><italic>3) Results:</italic> </p><p><italic>General remarks:</italic> </p><p><italic>It is unclear whether Cb binds to F-actin, G-actin or both. It appears in some places to be argued one way and at times the other way. A normal anti-actin antibody staining would be expected to give background whereas Cb doesn't.</italic> </p><p>We made this clearer in the revision. The Cb itself is specific for F-actin, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, 7. The reason we obtain also a certain amount of cytosolic Cb-signal is that it is expressed within the parasite and so excess of CB will remain cytosolic. This can best be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> for CytoD treatment or act1cKO parasites. Loss of F-actin filaments results in more cytosolic stain of parasites with CB. However, this is not due to G-actin binding, but due to cytosolic expression of CB.</p><p>We now mention “Filamentous structures were observed within the parasites. In addition, Cb was somewhat diffuse in the parasite cytosol, corresponding to unbound CB expressed in the cytosol of the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).”</p><p>And:</p><p>“By 48 hours, no F-actin structures could be observed and Cb-Halo was completely cytosolic, as expected due to cytosolic expression of this reagent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).”</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the authors may be correct that Cb may not adversely affect actin functions too much but they should be careful in interpreting this as evidence that it has no effect on actin polymerisation etc. in the cell. One might be affected without the other, and they have no direct measurement of actin in the cell.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers. Like all F-actin binding reagents, we would expect to influence actin dynamics. However, given that we can obtain parasites stable expressing CB and that the observed phenotypic consequences caused by this expression are relatively weak (though detectable) gives us confidence that our analysis of F-actin behaviour is correct.</p><p>We addressed this concern in the initial submission. To make it clearer to the reader we have now added:</p><p>“In summary expression of CB is well tolerated by the parasite indicating that it does not adversely affect actin functions in general. However, it cannot be ruled out that actin dynamics is locally affected within the cell due to expression of CB.”</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>:</italic> </p><p><italic>Please keep the same scale between WT and KO panels. It seems that the KO tachyzoites are longer despite they have a flat end. This is also visible in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (FRAP). If this is real, please comment this point.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We corrected the size bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In general we agree that there are morphological changes upon depletion of Act1 (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, the size of parasites is in general comparable.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Depletion of actin results in the loss of the residual body”: If there is a loss of progeny synchronisation, it needs to be shown more convincingly, i.e. qualitatively and quantitatively (number tachyzoite/ vacuoles for n vacuoles and zoom staining).

We removed the Gra1 stain, since it is redundant to the Gra2 stain (a marker of the intravacuolar network). The IMC labelling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> has been somewhat misinterpreted by the reviewer. We do not see any defects in early IMC formation during replication (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). However, the onset of replication within a PV is not synchronous. As an example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> a vacuole with 4 parasites is depicted, where each individual parasite is at a different stage during replication. The arrow depicts a parasite, where replication is almost complete, whereas other parasites are at an early stage of replication (or resting).</p><p>We also clarified the labelling (red arrow). We interpret the data as a defect in IMC maturation, leading to a collapsed posterior pole in good agreement with the live imaging analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>:</italic> </p><p><italic>It should be explained why the bleached cell does not recover.

The exposure time for both FRAP experiments was identical. In the initial submission we chose 2 different time scales, since recovery of wt parasites was very rapid (within 20 seconds), while act1cKO showed no recovery. We now chose the same time scale.</p><p>We also mention in the legend: “FRAP experiment is representative for several biological replicates (n&gt;3)”.</p><p><italic>Could the authors clarify the following statement which as it is now, seems to lack real ground “Of note, digital tracking of vesicles suggested movement along a tubular or filamentous structure”.</italic> </p><p>We are not sure what the reviewer refers to. The experiment we performed aimed to image transport of YFP-positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) in wt parasites (not expressing a CB). Tracking of these vesicles with tracking software suggested that they are transported along filaments. We included this experiment to demonstrate that this vesicle transport is seen irrespective of CB expression.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>:</italic> </p><p><italic>Panel B, on the right: the scale bar shows 10 micron unlike all the other figures.</italic> </p><p>We updated this figure.

We now added additional data to demonstrate that:</p><p>The network that can be detected outside of the parasites (but still within membrane tubules) is indeed variable from vacuole to vacuole and depends on the size of the PV. It usually appears, once the PV contains at least 8 parasites. See also revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We added a new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to demonstrate this in more detail. The jasplakinolide treatment does result in actin polymerisation in all parasites, however the occurrence of the network is still variable, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. We now chose to show parasites that were transient transfected with Cb, since this allowed us to compare parasites expressing Cb and not expressing Cb in parallel. As can be seen in the larger panel, both parasites show identical staining with α-actin, irrespective of Cb expression. In case of <italic>act1cKO</italic> a network can never be observed irrespective of vacuole size, once actin is depleted (72-96hours post-induction). We now added quantifications for both assays.</p><p>We also decided to include our analysis of F-actin dynamics in a conditional knockdown for TgADF (Mehta et al., 2011) and demonstrate that F-actin dynamics is completely abrogated and F-actin accumulates at the RB. Importantly CB signal in the cytosol is almost completely lost, providing further evidence that CB is specific for F-actin.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and the accompanying text:</italic> </p><p><italic>Subsection “Cb specifically binds to parasite actin and does not alter the total amount of F-actin”. 2% of actin is in the F actin form: the authors might do a calculation (even a ballpark one) of the amount of actin they estimate as a percentage of the total protein, then the number of molecules and then the amount of F-actin that would be likely.

Does it really seem likely that the actin is as rare a protein as previous studies have suggested if 2% can be assembled into such extensive networks?</italic> </p><p>We thank for this suggestion. We did indeed try to calculate and correlate amount of F-actin to signal. However, the complication here is that the coIPs can only be performed on extracellular parasites that do not form a network and where majority of actin appears non-polymerised (as published previously). This is in good agreement with our data, since in extracellular parasites CB-signal is diffuse and cytosolic, though filaments can be observed (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> for an example of the signal in a freshly egressed, extracellular parasite). Unfortunately, co-IP on intracellular parasites is not feasible, since after preparation of the lysate the CB expressed within <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is mixed with host cell lysate and hence we precipitate also huge amounts of host cell actin. Therefore, we cannot estimate at this point how much actin is polymerised during intracellular replication. The main reason, why we wanted to mention this result is to demonstrate that in extracellular parasites the expected amount of F-actin can be detected using CB, further demonstrating that expression of CB has minimal effects on F-actin dynamics.</p><p><italic>It is hugely unlikely that MS proteomics detected no other proteins in the pull down. The statement “could not be identified&quot; is ambiguous, please describe the results more clearly.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the initial description is somewhat misleading. We did indeed identify several proteins in this precipitation along with parasite actin. The important point however is that no host cell actin or any of the parasite actin-like and actin-related proteins was detected, demonstrating specificity for F-actin. We were contemplating to publish the whole list of identified proteins, which likely represent novel F-actin interacting proteins. However, at this point we would not like to share this set of data, since we are currently analysing them in detail.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>:</italic> </p><p><italic>What is the reason for qualifying the network as tubules (subsection “Inter-parasite actin tubules are dynamic during parasite replication and egress”)?</italic> </p><p><italic>In the first paragraph of the aforementioned subsection.

We are however happy to discuss other alternatives.</p></body></sub-article></article>
