DOI: 10.7554/eLife.03722 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hermundstad et al., 2014</xref>]) how a normative theory based on the efficient coding principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barlow, 1961</xref>) can account for the allocation of resources for the representation of complex sensory features. Specifically, we analyzed the local statistics of natural images, and compared the variability of these statistics with their perceptual salience. The statistics that were the most variable—that is, the least predictable and therefore the most informative—were the most salient perceptually. This relationship, in which greater resources are allocated to more variable features, emerges from the efficient coding principle in the regime that the main constraint is input sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barlow, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">van Hateren, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Doi and Lewicki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hermundstad et al., 2014</xref>). The observed relationship contrasts with the more familiar ‘whitening’ regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Srinivasan et al., 1982</xref>), which emerges when the main constraint is output capacity (e.g., with regard to the retina and the optic nerve bottleneck); the whitening regime predicts that fewer resources are allocated to more variable features. We note that the results of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hermundstad et al., 2014</xref>) provide empirical support for the hypothesis that input sampling, rather than output capacity, is the main constraint—since a transmission limit would have predicted a lower sensitivity for image statistics that were the most variable, the opposite of what we found.</p><p>To reach this result, we analyzed natural images via their multipoint correlations, that is, the statistics of the combinations of luminance values that appear in several points of the image. This approach has several advantages. First, it reduces the dimensionality of the space of image statistics that need to be considered, since it can be applied to binarized images, and it separates informative from uninformative statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tkačik et al., 2010</xref>). Second, the approach enables rigorous tests of theoretical predictions, since the individual kinds of informative and uninformative multipoint correlations can be isolated in synthetic image sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Victor and Conte, 2012</xref>). In contrast, the multipoint correlations in natural images covary in a complex manner that is difficult to capture or control. Synthetic image sets that isolate individual kinds of multipoint correlations are highly un-natural, but here this is an advantage: our predictions, which are derived from natural images, are tested in an out-of-sample fashion.</p><p>The information-theoretic framework of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hermundstad et al., 2014</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tkačik et al., 2010</xref>) played a key role in this analysis, and we briefly summarize it here. We used a two-stage model: first, the informative multipoint features (as identified by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tkačik et al., 2010</xref>]) are extracted from a visual image by a set of local nonlinear processing elements. Then, the output of this stage, that is, the frequency of each feature in patches of the image, is represented and transmitted by central visual areas, to serve as the basis for visual inferences (Figure 4C of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hermundstad et al., 2014</xref>]). We used a linear channel with additive Gaussian noise as an approximation for this latter process. While obviously a simplification, this leads to an analytic solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">van Hateren, 1992</xref>) for the allocation of resources that maximizes the mutual information between stimuli and their central representation—and the analytic solution accurately accounted for dozens of independently-determined psychophysical parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hermundstad et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Unaddressed, however, was where the extraction of multipoint correlations takes place. Several lines of evidence suggested that selective sensitivity to multipoint correlations arises in visual cortex (discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hermundstad et al., 2014</xref>]), but a direct demonstration was lacking.</p><p>Here, we report single-unit recordings in macaque V1 and V2, showing that neuronal selectivity for multipoint correlations is infrequent in V1, and becomes prominent in V2, especially in its supragranular layers. Well-recognized characteristics of V2 neurons, including sensitivity to corners, junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Das and Gilbert, 1999</xref>), illusory contours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">von der Heydt et al., 1984</xref>), figure/ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Qiu and von der Heydt, 2005</xref>), and ‘naturalness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Freeman et al., 2013</xref>) all entail sensitivity to multipoint correlations; here we show that this sensitivity is present even when these correlations are separated from their natural context.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded the extracellular activity of 421 individual neurons (269 in V1, 152 in V2) in the anesthetized, paralyzed macaque to stimulus sets that isolate the multipoint correlations previously studied in natural images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tkačik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hermundstad et al., 2014</xref>) and psychophysically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Victor and Conte, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2012</xref>).</p><p>The stimulus sets are illustrated in the top row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details).

We focused on three- and four-point correlations, since one- and two-point statistics (luminance and spatial contrast) are well-known to modulate responses throughout the visual system, beginning in the retina.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06604.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Example responses to multipoint correlations in V1 and V2.</title><p>Top row: examples of the stimulus sets used to isolate the different kinds of multipoint correlations.

In each column, the row of PSTH's shows responses of a single neuron to 1024 examples of stimuli drawn from the seven sets. Responses are generally dominated by a transient increase or decrease in firing, occurring 70 to 100 ms after the onset of each stimulus. In some cases, the size or configuration of this transient depends on the type of multipoint correlation (for example, the units in the second row). The asterisks indicate responses to the structured stimulus sets (black) that are significantly different (see ‘Materials and methods’) from the responses to the random stimuli (light gray, beginning of each row). Decremental responses following contrast onset were present in both areas, but more often in V2. However, a decremental response was not a requirement for discriminating among multipoint correlations: outside of supragranular V2, there were many neurons that had incremental responses to the stimulus transient and distinguished among the types of multipoint correlation (for example, the third and fourth rows on the right).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06604.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06604.002</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06604-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows post-stimulus histograms (PSTHs) of typical neurons in V1 and V2. Responses have a prominent transient after each stimulus transition, when on average half of the checks change from black to white or from white to black. For some neurons (e.g., the first, third, fourth, and sixth examples in V1), this transient is nearly identical for each of the stimulus sets. For other neurons (e.g., the second and fifth examples in V1, and most of the V2 examples), the transients differ in magnitude or configuration, suggesting a differential response to multipoint correlations.</p><p>To quantify these differences, we applied a shuffle test to the smoothed firing rates (see ‘Materials and methods’). Significant differences between responses to structured and random stimuli (the asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were more common in V2 than in V1. For a more thorough characterization, we defined the ‘multipoint correlation discrimination index’ (MCDI), which counted not only the comparison between structured and random stimuli, but also comparisons among pairs of different structured stimuli. The MCDI was defined as the fraction of the 21 pairwise comparisons that differed by the above statistical criterion. An MCDI of 0 means that a neuronal response to all stimulus types is indistinguishable; an MCDI of 1 means that a neuronal response distinguishes between all stimulus pairings, and therefore, between all of the structured stimulus sets.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (upper row) summarizes the MCDI across the neuronal population.

The difference between the MCDI in supragranular V2 and each of the other compartments was significant, except for the comparison with granular V2 (p = 0.053). The median value of the MCDI in supragranular V2 was 0.12, meaning that the ‘typical’ neuron responded differentially for 2 or 3 of the 21 pairwise comparisons. In all other compartments (in V1 and V2), the median was 0, that is, the ‘typical’ neuron did not distinguish between any of the stimulus types. Atypical neurons in V1 did distinguish among multipoint correlations. These were primarily neurons in the infragranular layer and with large receptive fields (RFs)—see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. But overall, the mean MCDI was lower in V1 (0.027) than in V2 (0.081), especially in its supragranular compartment (0.162).</p><p>Sensitivity to multipoint correlations was not restricted to specific cell types. Specifically, the MCDI was not significantly associated with the simple vs complex distinction, nor with the distinction between regular-spiking and fast-spiking neurons, as determined by extracellular action potential shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Niell and Stryker, 2008</xref>). Sensitivity to multipoint correlations was also present in isolated units that did not have overt RFs by hand-mapping or by reverse correlation (81/269 in V1 and 65/152 in V2); these units had waveforms that were isolated by the tetrode recordings, and likely include many of the ‘unresponsive’ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Olshausen and Field, 2004</xref>) that would not have been selected for study with single-electrode methods. There was no significant difference in the MCDI between these neurons and the simultaneously-recorded neurons with mappable RFs, either in V1 or V2. Among the neurons with mappable RFs, the MCDI was not significantly different for neurons whose RFs were above vs below the median size for their laminar compartment. Thus, the sensitivity to multipoint correlations does not require a precise match between the RF size and the spatial scale of the correlations. In sum, sensitivity to multipoint correlations was widely distributed across V2 neurons.</p><p>The difference in sensitivity to multipoint correlations between V1 and V2 was not due to a difference in RF size, nor to stimulus scaling (i.e., the number of stimulus checks within the RF). The upper left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> compares MCDI across V1 and V2 as a function of RF area; across the entire range of sizes, the MCDI is higher in V2 than in V1. The upper right panel makes this comparison as a function of the number of checks within the RF, which also equates neurons whose RFs covered the same fraction of the stimulus area. Here too, the MCDI in V2 was larger than in V1. The remaining rows of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> break the analysis down by laminar compartment. In granular and supragranular layers, the above observations hold, but there is a suggestion of a subset of V1 neurons with large RFs (lower left panel) that are sensitive to multipoint correlations. However, it is unlikely that this subpopulation underlies the high MCDI seen in V2: the targets of infragranular V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>) are the superior colliculus (layer 5) and the lateral geniculate (layer 6), while the inputs to V2 arise mainly from layers 2, 3, and 4b, where the MCDI is low. Moreover, the difference between supragranular V2 and the V2 input layer strongly suggests that the behavior in supragranular V2 is a result of intrinsic processing in V2, not a feature of signals passed on by V1 (which would already have been present in the granular layer).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that the multipoint correlations that contribute to the MCDI are the ones previously identified as being informative about natural images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tkačik et al., 2010</xref>) and perceptually salient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Victor and Conte, 1991</xref>), namely, the <italic>even</italic>, <italic>odd</italic>, <italic>white triangle</italic>, and <italic>black triangle</italic> stimuli. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> further breaks down the MCDI into the individual pairwise comparisons. Few neurons, either in supragranular V2 or across the population, discriminated among pairs of the stimuli with uninformative multipoint correlations (<italic>random</italic>, <italic>wye</italic>, and <italic>foot</italic>). To visualize the pattern of discrimination across the neuronal population, we applied multidimensional scaling to the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. This led to a three-dimensional representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) in which the seven stimulus types are represented by points, and the distance between the points corresponds to the fraction of neurons that distinguishes between them (i.e., the average pair-specific MCDI across the population). In V1, points are clustered near the origin, since most neurons cannot distinguish between any stimulus types. In V2, the representation expands into a multidimensional space. The two opposite stimulus pairs (<italic>even</italic> vs <italic>odd</italic>, and <italic>white triangle</italic> vs <italic>black triangle</italic>) are separated along different axes. Correspondingly, psychophysical studies show that the <italic>even</italic>-vs-<italic>odd</italic> gamut, and the <italic>white triangle</italic>-vs-<italic>black triangle</italic> gamut are independent perceptual axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Victor and Conte, 2012</xref>) (Figure 8 panel 2 of reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Victor and Conte, 2012</xref>], and the [<italic>θ</italic>, <italic>α</italic>]-panels of Figure 3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hermundstad et al.

First, the points corresponding to the uninformative stimuli are close to, but not superimposed on, the random stimulus. Additionally, while psychophysical sensitivity to the <italic>odd</italic> stimulus is only about 25% less than sensitivity to the <italic>even</italic> stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Victor and Conte, 2012</xref>), the MCDI for the <italic>odd</italic> stimulus is much lower. We note that the <italic>odd</italic> stimulus contains <italic>even</italic> correlations when analyzed at spatial scales larger than a single check (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Victor and Conte, 1989</xref>), so neuronal mechanisms sensitive to the <italic>even</italic> correlation will also contribute to the perceptual salience of the <italic>odd</italic> stimulus. More generally, the discrepancies between V2 neuronal activity and perception may reflect the simple measure used for quantifying discrimination at the population level (the average MCDI and multidimensional scaling), as well as further neural processing between V2 and perception.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Building on recent findings that the perceptual salience of complex (multipoint) image statistics is governed by their informativeness in natural images, here we show that selective sensitivity to these image statistics arises primarily in V2. Within V2, the greatest sensitivity is in the supragranular layers, where the typical (median) neuron can distinguish between two or three of the stimulus pairs. In contrast, typical neurons in V1 do not distinguish between any of the stimuli, although there appears to be a subpopulation of large-RF neurons in infragranular V1 with a modest level of selective sensitivity. The overall pattern of neuronal sensitivity to image statistics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) resembles the sensitivity of human observers, driven primarily by the multipoint statistics that are visually salient.</p><p>We speculate that sensitivity to informative multipoint correlations is the computational underpinning of many of the changes in neural characteristics from V1 to V2 that have previously been noted—sensitivity to corners, junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Das and Gilbert, 1999</xref>), illusory contours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">von der Heydt et al., 1984</xref>), figure vs ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Qiu and von der Heydt, 2005</xref>), and ‘naturalness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Freeman et al., 2013</xref>). The distinction between informative and uninformative multipoint correlations emerged from a formal information-theoretic analysis of natural images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tkačik et al., 2010</xref>). While this analysis did not relate ‘informativeness’ to these other characteristics, inspection of the examples of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> suggests several points of contact. With regard to junctions and contours, examples of the <italic>odd</italic> ensemble images contain large numbers of corners, while examples of the <italic>even</italic> ensemble contain large numbers of crossings. The extended contours evident in the <italic>even</italic> ensemble are a kind of illusory contour, since the polarity changes that define them undergo random flips, which would confound a linear edge detector. With regard to figure vs ground, stimuli in the <italic>black triangle</italic> and <italic>white triangle</italic> ensembles appear to contain, respectively, black figures on white backgrounds, vs white figures on black backgrounds—even though the stimulus sets are matched for spatial frequency content and the number of black and white checks. Thus, informative multipoint correlations result in images that are enriched for junctions, contours, and objects, compared to images that have the same first- and second-order statistics but lacking these correlations. While the extent to which these local features account for ‘naturalness’ remains for future work, the present results show that selective sensitivity of V2 neurons for informative multipoint correlations persists even when they are removed from the context of a natural image.</p><p>It is unclear to what extent it is necessary to match the scale of a multipoint correlation with that an illusory contour or junction in order for the visual feature to be extracted. However, the distinction between informative and uninformative multipoint statistics holds over at least a fourfold range of length scales (the entire range analyzed, SI figure 14 of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tkačik et al., 2010</xref>]). Human sensitivity to these correlations is present over at least a similar range of check sizes (0.03–0.25 deg, Figure 2, 8 of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Victor and Conte, 1989</xref>]; also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conte et al., 2014</xref>]) comparable to the range of check sizes used in this study (0.08–0.5 deg). This broad range of sensitivities is found even when stimuli are restricted in eccentricity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Victor and Conte, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> (right column) shows that V2 sensitivity to multipoint correlations also does not require a close match between RF size and the scale of the multipoint correlation; this sensitivity is present over a threefold range of length scales (i.e., a 10-fold range of the number of checks per receptive field). Thus, it is likely that the entire range of scales relevant to perception can be accounted for by the properties of individual neurons, along with the variation in RF sizes at each eccentricity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hubel and Wiesel, 1968</xref>).</p><p>Neurons whose RFs are difficult to map are often ignored in physiologic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Olshausen and Field, 2004</xref>). We were able to analyze their responses here because of the tetrode recording method, and found that many V2 neurons whose RFs could not be mapped nevertheless often showed selective sensitivity to multipoint correlations. We consider some possible reasons for this here. As defined in this paper, a neuron is considered to have a mappable RF if the reverse correlation of the neuron's responses to the stimulus passes a statistical criterion (see ‘Materials and methods’). Standard practice is to use random binary stimuli for this mapping procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Reid et al., 1997</xref>); here we include stimuli with high-order correlations in the mapping computation. The rationale is that inclusion of these stimuli allows some kinds of nonlinear responses to emerge in a first-order cross-correlation between stimulus and response, because of correlations within the stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schmid et al., 2011</xref>). But even an expanded stimulus set may not reveal the RFs of all neurons that respond to multipoint correlations. Reverse correlations may not exceed our statistical threshold because of response variability, or because the neuron is only responsive to stimulus configurations that occur very rarely in the stimulus set. We also note that from a computational point of view, our assay for sensitivity to multipoint correlations is independent of whether the neural response is correlated with the state of any single check: for each of the ensembles that probe a different kind of multipoint correlation, the number of black and white checks are equated, at each location. Thus, it is quite possible for a neuron to process information in a localized region of space (as manifest by its sensitivity to multipoint correlations) yet fail to have a RF that is measurable by reverse correlation methods, as we show here.</p><p>Finally, our findings carry implications for neural mechanisms. Many biologically-plausible mechanisms can extract multipoint correlations, including a simple linear-nonlinear cascade (provided that the nonlinearity is more than quadratic), and modulatory surrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmid and Victor, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Self et al., 2014</xref>). But models need to account for the specificity of the responses, not just their existence. In this regard, we note (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Victor and Conte, 1991</xref>) that the specificity we observe can be produced by a two-stage (linear-nonlinear-linear-nonlinear) cascade, in which the first linear-nonlinear element detects local edges, and the second one combines signals from collinear edges via a second threshold. Removal of either component of the second stage—either its linear or the nonlinear element—eliminates this specificity. The finding that responses to multipoint correlations are more prominent in supragranular V2 than in its input layers or in V1 suggests possible correspondences between this cascade and neural circuitry. One possibility is that the first stage is in V1 and the second stage is in V2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rust et al., 2005</xref>). Alternatively, the two linear-nonlinear stages may represent two loops of signal passage through a recurrent network within a single cortical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Joukes et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All procedures conformed to the guidelines provided by the US National Institutes of Health and Weill Cornell Medical College Animal Care and Use Committee.

Tetrodes were placed on opposite sides of the V1/V2 boundary, and typically within 1 mm of each other within each region, so that the units recorded by the tetrodes generally had neighboring or overlapping RFs. This yielded a total dataset of 421 neurons (269 in V1, 152 in V2), following spike sorting and selection for firing rate criteria (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Initial neuronal characterization</title><p>Tetrodes were independently lowered until they recorded visually-driven extracellular action potentials. After initial hand-mapping, tuning properties were determined from responses to 3–4 s presentations of drifting sinusoidal gratings. Stimulus parameters were successively refined in the order of orientation, spatial frequency, temporal frequency and contrast, based on on-line analysis of the responses of the target unit. When the recorded cluster had well-isolated units that preferred an orientation other than the preferred orientation for the target unit, this process was repeated for a second, and rarely a third, orientation as well.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Characterization of sensitivity to multipoint correlations</title><p>To determine neuronal responses to multipoint correlations, we measured responses to a sequence of black-and-white checkerboards that isolated the individual kinds of correlation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (<italic>top</italic>) shows three examples of these seven stimulus types. Each stimulus consisted of a 16 × 16 array of black and white checks. In the ‘<italic>random</italic>’ stimulus set, check colors were assigned independently, with an equal chance of being white or black. In the other stimulus sets, the coloring rule isolated a single kind of multipoint correlation. In the ‘<italic>even</italic>’ set, there was always an even number of white (or black) checks in any 2 × 2 neighborhood of checks. In the ‘<italic>odd</italic>’ set, there was always an odd number of white (or black) checks in a 2 × 2 neighborhood. <italic>Even</italic> and <italic>odd</italic> sets are the opposite extremes of the visually salient four-point correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hermundstad et al., 2014</xref>), α. In the ‘<italic>white triangle</italic>’ set, there were always one or three white checks within a triangular region; in the ‘<italic>black triangle</italic>’ set, there were always one or three black checks within a region of the same shape. These two sets correspond to opposite extremes of the visually salient three-point correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hermundstad et al., 2014</xref>), θ. We also examined responses to four-point correlations in two other spatial configurations, ‘<italic>wye</italic>’ and ‘<italic>foot</italic>.’ Multipoint correlations in the <italic>wye</italic> and <italic>foot</italic> configurations are predictable from simpler quantities in natural images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tkačik et al., 2010</xref>), and, in keeping with predictions of efficient coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hermundstad et al., 2014</xref>), they are not visually salient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Victor and Conte, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Check size was scaled to the RF size of the target neuron so that approximately two checks corresponded to one lobe of the optimal spatial frequency, and orientation was set according to the orientation preference of the target neuron. This resulted in about 8 checks within the classical RF (V1: mean 7.40, median 6.00, SD 5.33; V2: mean 8.68, median 7.00, SD 5.46; statistics across all mappable units and not just the target; see below for details on RF mapping and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for the distribution of number of checks in the RF); thus, the checks are within the resolution limits of the neuron, and the stimulus patch covers an area that is substantially larger than the RF. Across all recordings (including mappable and un-mappable units), check sizes ranged from 0.08 to 0.5 deg (V1: mean 0.18, median 0.20, SD 0.05; V2: mean 0.22, median 0.20, SD 0.12).</p><p>For each type of stimulus, we presented 1024 examples (two repetitions each) for 320 ms, interleaved in a pseudorandom sequence. This large set size was chosen so that we can distinguish average responses to each of the stimulus sets (our focus) from responses that might be driven to the specific white or black checks or edges present in particular examples (a potential confound).</p><p>Stimuli were generated via a Markov recurrence rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Victor and Conte, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2012</xref>), so that other than the constraint of their defining multipoint correlation, they are as random as possible (maximum-entropy). This yields stimulus sets that enable testing of each kind of multipoint correlation in isolation. In each set, there are no two-point correlations—checks at any pair of locations are colored independently—so that the sets have the same power spectra, and therefore the same spatial frequency content. The four kinds of correlations (the <italic>even</italic>/<italic>odd</italic> axis, the <italic>black triangle</italic>/<italic>white triangle</italic> axis, <italic>wye</italic>, and <italic>foot</italic>) are independently controlled: each set extremizes one of these correlations, while keeping all the others at 0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gilbert, 1980</xref>). Thus they provide a way to assay responsiveness to each kind of multipoint correlation in isolation.</p><p>All stimuli were rendered on a 1280 × 1024-pixel display at 100 Hz, using either a 21-inch ViewSonic G225f monitor (mean luminance 47 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, gamma-corrected) or a Sun GDM5410 monitor (mean luminance 46 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, gamma-corrected) at 114 cm.

(2014)</xref>. The 17 features consisted of peak and trough amplitudes (8 features), the first 8 principal components, and time. All neurons whose mean firing rates across all stimuli were ≥ 1 Hz were analyzed for their responsiveness to the multipoint correlation stimuli described above.</p><p>To classify extracellular spike waveforms as narrow-spiking (putative inhibitory) and broad-spiking (putative excitatory), we used a method similar to that of refs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Niell and Stryker, 2008</xref>). For each single unit, the waveforms from each tetrode channel were averaged and the channel with the largest signal to noise ratio (SNR) was selected for the spike width measurement. Two parameters of spike width were measured: (1) trough to peak width—the duration from the trough to the peak of the waveform, and (2) half-peak width—the duration from the peak of the waveform to half its height. The distribution of both measurements across the 1856 waveforms from the laboratory database were significantly bimodal (p &lt; 0.01 by the Hartigan dip test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hartigan and Hartigan, 1985</xref>]). Based on the notch in the distribution, we classified extracellular waveforms as narrow-spiking (&lt;405 µs) and broad-spiking (&gt;430 µs). Next the averaged waveforms themselves were clustered using k-means. The clusters were separated identically by k-means of the waveforms, and the distribution of the spike width parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Localization of recording sites</title><p>At the conclusion of the experiment, we made small lesions at locations that bracketed the recording sites along each tetrode track, via current passage through the most distal tetrode contact.

For sites for which the laminar assignment was uncertain, neurons were included in the tallies for V1 and V2 (e.g., top rows of each panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and the statistical comparisons between them, but not in the breakdown by layer or statistical comparisons between layers. This amounted to &lt;10% of the units.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Tuning curves were computed in the standard fashion from the Fourier components of the spike train elicited by each grating stimulus, as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schmid et al. (2014)</xref>. Tuning curve peaks were determined from the DC response (F0) or the first harmonic (F1), whichever was larger. We classified neurons as simple or complex according to whether their response to a drifting grating was primarily at the period of the grating (simple) or primarily a maintained elevation (complex), as quantified by the F1/F0 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Skottun et al., 1991</xref>). F1 is the first harmonic of the response to the optimal grating tested, F0 is the maintained firing rate of the response, after subtraction of the average firing rate in response to a uniform field at the mean illumination. Note that since grating parameters were chosen according to the preference of neurons whose waveforms could be discriminated online, some neurons may not have been stimulated at the optimal orientation or spatial frequency.</p><p>RF maps were determined by correlating the neural response (1 for white checks, −1 for black checks) to the checkerboard stimuli (16 × 16 checks). The response measure was the total number of spikes over the duration of each presentation (320 ms) averaged across both repetitions; this is equivalent to computing the spike-triggered-average and then summing over the stimulus duration. Maps were separately computed for each of the seven stimulus types; as reported previously, some neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schmid et al., 2012</xref>) that did not have mappable RFs for random checkerboards nevertheless had mappable RFs for the other stimulus types. Statistical significance for each of these seven maps was determined by a shuffle test: we recomputed maps from 500 surrogate data sets in which the responses to each stimulus type were permuted, determined the mean and standard deviation of these surrogate maps at each check, and then used the corresponding Gaussian distribution to determine which actual map values were significant at p &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed, correcting for multiple comparison via the Benjamini-Hochberg method, that is, false discovery rate [FDR] method) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). We then determined the union of the seven maps obtained from each stimulus. Usually this yielded a single connected component, and the RF was taken to be its convex hull. When more than one connected component was present, smaller components were merged with the largest one if they were separated by no more than a single check, and the convex hull of the resulting region was taken as the RF. The number of checks in this convex hull was taken as the measure of RF size. If none of the seven classes of stimuli yielded a significant RF map by the above criteria, the neuron was considered not to have a mappable RF. As an alternative procedure, we also computed RF maps by correlating the responses with all (7 × 1024) stimuli, and this yielded very similar results.</p><p>To measure sensitivity to multipoint correlations, we proceeded as follows (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For each of the stimulus types, we accumulated a PSTH across all 1024 examples (and 2 repeats), and then determined the smoothed firing rate via local linear regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Loader, 2012</xref>). Significance of the difference between two firing rate functions was determined by a shuffle test, in which 3000 surrogate data sets were created by randomly exchanging responses among a pair of stimulus types. The exchanges were limited to responses that were recorded in adjacent trials (within 4 s of each other), to avoid confounds due to slow changes in firing rate over time. The difference between the smooth firing rates of the actual data was compared to the distribution of differences seen in the surrogate datasets at each 5 ms bin, from 55 to 250 ms. The number of times the actual difference was exceeded by any of the 3000 surrogates yielded a raw two-tailed p-value at each of these 40 time points. If the raw p-value was below the false-discovery-corrected threshold of p = 0.05, the neuron was considered to have a different response to the two kinds of stimuli at that time point. For each neuron, the MCDI at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) was defined as the fraction of stimulus pairs that elicited statistically different responses as determined by the above procedure; the MCDI was therefore <italic>n</italic>/21, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of stimulus pairs that elicited statistically different responses. For each of the seven stimuli, we also calculated a stimulus-specific MCDI, considering only the six pairs of discriminations involving that particular stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); this was therefore a quantity <italic>n</italic>/6. Finally, to detail the pattern of pairwise discriminations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), we computed a ‘pair-specific’ MCDI—either 0 (no discrimination) or 1 (discrimination), and averaged it across the population. For this purpose, we considered a neuron to distinguish a pair of stimuli if a difference was present at any time during the 55–250 ms period, again using the above statistical criteria.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06604.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Procedure for determination of differential sensitivity to multipoint correlations for a stimulus pair.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A smoothed firing rate is constructed from the responses to examples of each stimulus type (1024 examples, each presented twice).

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Visual processing of informative multipoint correlations arises primarily in V2” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Michael Landy, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The editor and reviewers agree that the finding of neural correlates of multipoint correlations reflects an important advance over your previous behavioural findings and are enthusiastic about the potential publication of this Research Advance.</p><p>For example:</p><p>This paper takes the previous work of this group on which 2-, 3- and 4-point correlations are visually salient and to which the visual system is sensitive, and shows that some differential responses to these correlations arise first in area V2. As the authors are aware, I'm pretty familiar with this line of work (having reviewed several of the earlier papers in the series). Tying this story to the physiology is certainly a logical and useful next step.</p><p>In the current manuscript Yu et al. add to previously published findings that human observes are more sensitive to more informative multi-point correlations in images. Here they provide a candidate for the neural substrate of this sensitivity: supragranular layers of V2. I think the manuscript is an interesting addition to the previous paper.</p><p>Overall, this Research Advance is clearly written and nicely complements the founding article by providing neuronal correlates for multipoint correlation stimuli that have theoretical significance and perceptual relevance.</p><p>However, there were several questions that the review panel would like addressed before we could consider publication of the study.</p><p>During discussion the panel agreed that the most critical issue to address before the paper can be published is the issue of the scaling of the stimuli.</p><p>Since receptive fields are larger in V2 and you are adjusting the stimulus to the receptive field size, aren't you effectively presenting two different stimulus ensembles to the V1 and the V2 population, respectively? Could that explain the differential response between V1 and V2? Do you have control data, where you, instead of upscaling the 16x16 patch, simply increased the number of pixels to match the receptive field size? Alternatively, you could drive the V1 population with the upscaled stimuli for the V2 neurons and see whether your results change. If you do not have such data readily to hand, do you have other means of ruling out that the stimulus scaling confounds the results?

With the current presentation, it's hard to tell whether V2's representation of multipoint correlations is new or enhances a representation already present in a small subpopulation of V1.

I have two comments. First, in panel a, the “even and odd” correlation structure picks out the corners of the black bars. As such, the association of this correlation with the illusory contour is a consequence of the fact that the bars are spaced by the same distance that defined the “even and odd” correlation structure. Can the authors say anything about whether there is an association between the spatial scales of illusory contour detection and the “even and odd” correlation structure? For example, do humans perceive illusory contours over the same length scales that “even and odd” correlation structures are informative for natural images? Has V2 previously been shown to be sensitive to illusory contours on the spatial scale that the authors use in the “even and odd” correlation structure? Second, the “white and black triangle” correlation structure is the only correlation structure that can distinguish between the two stimuli in panel b because it's the only odd-ordered correlation. This is why I earlier alluded to the point that it would have been helpful to include an uninformative third-order correlation stimulus. Also, in the specific example shown, couldn't one just use the mean (i.e. a first-order structure) to discriminate between the stimuli?

Because of space limitations in the original submission, we had only touched on this, mentioning that responsiveness to multipoint correlations was similar for neurons with large and small receptive fields (RF’s); we now devote a new figure to this issue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>), and add material describing this analysis to the Results section, after <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Briefly, the new figure shows that the difference between V1 and V2 cannot be explained merely by a difference in RF size, or a difference in the number of checks within the RF: whether one compares the MCDI for V1 and V2 neurons with comparable RF sizes, or for V1 and V2 neurons stimulated with comparably scaled stimuli, the V2 neurons have a larger MCDI. The upper left panel shows the MCDI is plotted as a function of RF area, showing a difference in MCDI for V2 vs. V1 neurons across the entire range. So, V2 neurons are not simply larger versions of V1 neurons. But, as the reviewers point out, since we adjust the stimulus to match the resolution of the neural activity at one of the tetrodes (i.e., at one brain site), there is the possibility that the V2 vs. V1 difference relates to the number of the checks in the receptive field, or, equivalently, the fraction of the 16 x 16 stimulus array that is “seen” by the RF. The upper right panel rules out this possibility as well: when compared on the basis of equal number of checks within the RF, V2 neurons have a larger MCDI than V1 neurons. The remaining rows of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> supplement break the analysis down by laminar compartment; there are no surprises in the supra‐ and granular layers but the analysis of the infragranular compartment (see below) suggests that there is a subset of V1 neurons with large receptive fields that are sensitive to multipoint correlations. We now mention this point at the end of the new paragraph devoted to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, but (as discussed below) it does not change our basic finding, that sensitivity to multipoint correlations arises primarily in V2.</p><p>We also want to mention (see point below concerning number of checks in the RF) that the number of checks considered to be within the RF (median, ∼8) is probably an underestimate for the actual RF size, as a check is only to be considered to be “within” the RF if reverse‐correlation analysis passes a criterion level of statistical significance; a substantial fraction of the dataset has neurons that did not meet this criterion but still had clear responses to the stimuli, as manifest by a large MCDI.</p><p><italic>A related question about the relationship between V1 and V2 coding was also raised</italic>:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref> <italic>shows that at least 75% of V1 cells have no selectivity for multipoint correlation stimuli, yet the mean MCDI of all cells is ∼0.05.

How do the response properties of these</italic> “<italic>special</italic>” <italic>V1 neurons compare to a</italic> “<italic>typical</italic>” <italic>V2 neuron? With the current presentation, it's hard to tell whether V2's representation of multipoint correlations is new or enhances a representation already present in a small subpopulation of V1. As such, the first sentence of the Discussion, which says</italic> “<italic>arises primarily in V2</italic>” <italic>seems imprecise. This distinction is also relevant to the authors' Discussion hypothesis that higher-order correlation specificity might emerge from a two-stage cascade from V1 to V2</italic>.</p><p>There are two related points here, and both are interesting: (a), given that average MCDI in V1 is driven by a small subset of cells with large MCDI’s, does this subset constitute a subpopulation with definable features? And (b), should one view V2 as merely enhancing a representation of multipoint correlations that are already present in V1? With regard to (a), the new analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> provides an important clue, which we now mention in the Results where the summary statistics are described: the infragranular layer contains a subset of V1 neurons, with large receptive fields, and this subpopulation has a large MCDI. With regard to (b), we don’t think that the existence of these neurons changes the basic conclusion that sensitivity to multipoint correlations arises primarily in V2: these units make up only a small subset of one laminar compartment in V1, and even among these neurons, the median MCDI does not approach the levels in supragranular V2. Independently, anatomical evidence supports this view: the targets of infragranular V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Felleman and Van Essen (1991)</xref>) are the superior colliculus (layer 5) and the lateral geniculate (Layer 6); while the inputs to V2 arise mainly from layers 2, 3, and 4b, where the MCDI is low. Finally, the difference between supragranular V2 and the V2 input layer strongly suggests that the behavior in supragranular V2 is a result of intrinsic processing in V2, not a feature of signals passed on by V1 (which would already have been present in the granular layer). We now mention these points in the main text concerning <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>. Finally, to add precision to the broad statement that sensitivity to multipoint correlations arises primarily in V2, we add mention of the subpopulation of infragranular V1 neurons to the opening paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>The reviewers were also concerned about the illusory contour figure</italic>:</p><p><italic>At present, the connections between higher-order correlations and previously hypothesized roles for V2 seem tenuous and insufficiently detailed to warrant a full figure in the main text</italic>.</p><p>Our main reason for presenting this figure was to provide an intuition as to why only some kinds of multipoint correlations are informative, as an aid to readers who might not be comfortable with the technicalities of the approach taken in Hermundstad et al. and Tkacik et al. (PNAS, 2010). But we agree that the argument made by the figure is intuitive and un‐rigorous, rendering it unhelpful for the more sophisticated reader, so we removed it. Nevertheless it is useful to speculate about why these multipoint correlations are important, and we retain these comments, which we clearly mark as speculative. These comments, which are in a rewritten second paragraph of the Discussion, use the stimulus examples in the retained <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to illustrate the points made.</p><p><italic>For example</italic>:</p><p><italic>The authors use</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>to argue that V2's selectivity to multipoint correlations helps explain its involvement in the detection of illusory contours and the discrimination of figure and ground.

As the reviewer notes, the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> suggests that this is the case, but of course one expects that illusory contours are present across a wide range of scales too.</p><p>On the other hand, our findings do not rest on a narrow range of RF sizes or correlation scales, and the broad range of spatial scales to which neurons are sensitive to multipoint correlations corresponds to that of human perceptual sensitivity. Specifically, the distinction between informative and uninformative four‐point correlations persists across over a fourfold range of length scales (the entire range analyzed, see SI of Tkacik et al., PNAS 2010, Figure 14). The characteristics of human perception are approximately constant over a similar range of length scales (.03 to 0.25 deg checks, a range similar to that used in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and 8 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Victor and Conte 1989</xref> [four‐point correlations]; also Victor, Thengone, Rizvi, and Conte et al., VSS Abstracts 2014 [two‐ and three‐point correlations as well]). Sensitivity across this range of scales is present even when eccentricity is restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Victor and Conte 1989</xref>). While individual neurons may not subtend the entire range, the population of V1/V2 neurons as a whole is likely to do, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> shows that V2 sensitivity to multipoint correlations does not require a close match between RF size and the scale of the correlations. We now add a paragraph about this to the Discussion, and add further specifics about check size to the Methods section.</p><p><italic>Second, the</italic> “<italic>white and black triangle</italic>” <italic>correlation structure is the only correlation structure that can distinguish between the two stimuli in panel b because it's the only odd-ordered correlation. This is why I earlier alluded to the point that it would have been helpful to include an uninformative third-order correlation stimulus. Also, in the specific example shown, couldn't one just use the mean (i.e. a first-order structure) to discriminate between the stimuli? I wonder if there might be a better choice of stimuli for this panel</italic>.</p><p>The “earlier alluded” passage seems to have been omitted from the consolidated reviews, but we think we understand the point. We agree that it would have been a good control to include an uninformative third‐order correlation, but previous work on natural image statistics did not identify any such configurations (and didn’t seek to do so). We agree with the comment that other third‐order correlations could distinguish figure from ground. But the reviewer is incorrect about first‐order statistics—they would not have been able to make this distinction, as the fraction of black and white checks in the figure/ground component of the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> was each 50% (this is not at all apparent to casual viewing).</p><p><italic>The reviewers also had several questions that we believe can be addressed by changes to the manuscript text</italic>.</p><p><italic>In</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"><italic>Hermundstad et al. 2014</italic></xref> <italic>the second order stimuli (beta) are more informative than the fourth order stimuli (alpha), which are more informative than the third order stimuli (theta). However, the authors only present data for alpha and theta stimuli (that were less informative in the Hermundstad paper) while not presenting the beta stimuli (that were more informative in the Hermundstad paper). I would like to know whether the authors (i) performed experiments with beta stimuli, (ii) if so why they did not report them, or (iii) why they did not consider them. I am sure the authors had a good reason which should be mentioned in the paper</italic>.</p><p>The reason that we did not include them in the paper was that our focus was on determining the origin of sensitivity to three‐ and four‐point statistics, and the study was designed to concentrate the experiment time on that issue. Second‐ and first‐order statistics, which affect, respectively, the mean luminance and spatial frequency content of the stimuli, will modulate responses even at the level of retinal ganglion cells, so clearly there’s no mystery as to where responses to such statistics arise. We now state this rationale in the first paragraph of Results.</p><p>On the other hand, we agree that the extent to which the pattern of sensitivities in V1 and V2 accounts for the pattern of human sensitivities to local image statistics of all orders (e.g., the shape and orientation of the isodiscrimination contours in Hermundstad et al.) is interesting and important, and we are carrying out experiments in the macaque to look at this. Preliminary results confirm the expectation of sensitivity to first‐ and second‐order statistics in V1 and V2 (as well as the current findings about third‐ and fourth‐order sensitivities primarily in V2), and also indicate that neurons have preferences pointing in many oblique directions in the space. But this goes far beyond the current manuscript, and we think deserves its own paper.</p><p><italic>It would be nice if you could mention more explicitly how the rank order of the MCDI relate to the sensitivity order found in the psychophysical experiments of the previous paper</italic>.</p><p>We now add this material to the final two paragraphs of the Results section, underscoring that the V2 results are not a precise match for perception, but this is not surprising, as further processing may well intervene.</p><p><italic>I was interested by the finding that the MCDI was unassociated with mappable receptive fields and would be interested in hearing some thoughts from the authors in their Discussion section</italic>.</p><p>We add a paragraph concerning this to the Discussion. In brief, there are several ways in which neurons that are not “mappable” could, nevertheless, participate in form vision tasks in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Olshausen and Field 2004</xref>) , or, in particular, discriminate among multipoint correlations (as we show here). As defined in this paper, a “mappable” RF requires that reverse correlation of the neuron’s responses to the stimulus passes a statistical criterion. Standard practice is to use random binary stimuli for this mapping procedure; here we include stimuli with high‐order correlations in the mapping computation. The rationale is that this allows some kinds of nonlinear responses to emerge in a first‐order cross‐ correlation between stimulus and response, because of correlations within the stimuli (Schmid, Yu, and Victor, SfN Abstracts, 2012). But there is no reason to believe that this expanded stimulus set reveals all RFs. For example: (i) reverse correlations may not exceed threshold because of response variability; (ii) a neuron may only be responsive to stimulus configurations that occur very rarely in the stimulus set; or (iii) a neuron may be selectively responsive to one or more of the multipoint correlations tested, but since the occurrence of this configuration is not correlated with whether a check is white or black, there will be no correlation of the response to the state of individual checks. Our data do not permit us to determine which of these explanations dominate, but we suspect that (i) and (iii) contribute.</p><p><italic>Can the authors clarify how they determined the p-value threshold in Figure 4D? Since the authors declare significance</italic> “<italic>if any of these p-values</italic>” <italic>falls below the FDR threshold, is the Benjamini-Hochberg correction equivalent to a Bonferroni correction? If so, then 40 comparisons would lead to a p-value correction less than that displayed. Or do the authors somehow correct for fact that their temporal smoothing effectively leads to fewer than 40 comparisons</italic>?</p><p>Sorry for being unclear on this. As is standard, the FDR threshold for a given significance level alpha is a data‐ determined quantity q, for which it can be anticipated that less than a fraction alpha of the values below q are false‐ positives. Typically q is substantially less than alpha (in the case shown in the Figure, alpha is 0.05 but q is &lt;0.01). We clarify this by labeling the significance threshold in panel d as “q”, and adding text to the caption to highlight that the FDR threshold q is distinct from, and more stringent than, the un‐corrected significance threshold of alpha=0.05. With regard to positive correlations among the individual values, the false discovery correction procedure we used takes this into account: under conditions of positive correlation, the standard procedure reduces to the FDR procedure we used (Benjamini &amp; Yekutieli, (2001), “The control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency”, Annals of Statistics 29 (4): 1165–1188. doi:10.1214/aos/1013699998. MR 1869245). [Note: previous Figure 4, the subject of these changes, is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.]</p><p><italic>There were also questions about the underlying assumptions in the model. We understand that these comments pertain equally to the already-published paper, but we nevertheless hope that you will be able to deal with them in a few sentences, which we felt would help the current manuscript</italic>.</p><p><italic>What justifies the authors to assume the regime of sampling limitation rather than transmission limitation? You write that your results fit into the efficient coding framework if sampling an image is the main limitation. What is the empirical evidence that justifies this assumption as opposed to the transmission limited regime many other studies are based on</italic>?</p><p>The empirical evidence for the “sampling limitation” hypothesis is that it predicts the main finding of Hermundstad et al., relating psychophysical sensitivities of local features to statistics of natural images: greater sensitivity for image statistics that are more variable. Had output capacity (transmission) been the main limitation, psychophysical sensitivities would have been large for image statistics that were less variable—the opposite of what we found (Figure 4B vs. Figure 4C of Hermundstad et al.). We now add this point to the first paragraph of the Introduction.</p><p><italic>If I understand correctly, the fact that humans/neurons should be more sensitive to more variable features is derived using a linear model with Gaussian input and channel noise. However, the mapping from images to multi-point correlations does not seem to be linear. How do you know that this result still holds in the non-linear case, in particular if the sampling regime is characterized by dominating input noise (which would get nonlinearly transformed)</italic>?</p><p>The model in Hermundstad et al. consists of local, nonlinear extraction of features, followed by analysis of how the statistics of these features are represented. The model did not attempt to analyze those nonlinear processes but simply considered their outputs to be “tokens”, which, once extracted, need to be represented and transmitted by central visual areas (Figure 4C of Hermundstad et al.). To apply principles of efficient coding to this process of representation and transmission, we assumed that once the tokens are extracted, the rest of the process is linear and noise is Gaussian. Obviously this is a simplification, but it is one that appears to account for the data. We now summarize this framework in a new paragraph (the third paragraph) in the Introduction.</p><p><italic>How do you justify that more variable features contain more information? In the discrete case, I can see that. However, in the limit of infinitely many images, the multi-point correlations become continuous. In that case I could transform all features by a pointwise monotonic transformation (histogram equalization) that would not change the information content but make all features equally variable</italic>.</p><p>As the reviewer indicates, the Hermundstad et al. analysis was predicated on binarizing the continuum of gray levels in natural images, and naturally leads to the question of how the analysis would “scale up” to the full continuum of gray levels. But the notion that histogram equalization would make all features equally variable is not correct, on several grounds. First, although it would equalize first‐order statistics, it would not equalize higher‐order statistics. Second, even for first‐order statistics, histogram equalization is only information‐preserving if one ignores limitations on discriminating nearby gray levels that are arbitrarily close. We know from the work of Chubb et al. that with only 16 gray levels in play (limiting consideration to first‐order statistics), there are only three perceptual coordinates. So something much more interesting than histogram equalization is going on. We’ve begun to look at the three‐gray‐level case with multipoint statistics. Here, there are 66 possible feature dimensions in a 2x2 local neighborhood, and at least a dozen of these are visually perceptible, but not nearly all 66. In any case, this is a complex and interesting matter, and would take us far beyond the scope of this paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
