The SMC-ParAB-<italic>parS</italic> system is widely employed for chromosome segregation in bacteria. A DNA-binding protein ParB nucleates on <italic>parS</italic> sites and must associate with neighboring DNA, a process known as spreading, to enable efficient chromosome segregation. Despite its importance, how the initial few ParB molecules nucleating at <italic>parS</italic> sites recruit hundreds of further ParB to spread is not fully understood. Here, we reconstitute a <italic>parS</italic>-dependent ParB spreading event using purified proteins from <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and show that CTP is required for spreading. We further show that ParB spreading requires a closed DNA substrate, and a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator can act as a roadblock to attenuate spreading unidirectionally in vitro. Our biochemical reconstitutions recapitulate many observed in vivo properties of ParB and opens up avenues to investigate the interactions between ParB-<italic>parS</italic> with ParA and SMC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic></kwd><kwd>ParB-parS</kwd><kwd>CTP</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>chromosome organization</kwd><kwd>spreading</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P018165/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le</surname><given-names>Tung BK</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UF140053</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le</surname><given-names>Tung BK</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBS/E/J/000PR9791</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tran</surname><given-names>Ngat T</given-names></name><name><surname>Le</surname><given-names>Tung BK</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG150448</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jalal</surname><given-names>Adam SB</given-names></name><name><surname>Le</surname><given-names>Tung BK</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBS/E/J/000PR9778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le</surname><given-names>Tung BK</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A biochemical reconstitution shows that the accumulation of <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> ParB on DNA requires cytidine triphosphate and a closed DNA substrate in vitro.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Faithful chromosome segregation is essential in all domains of life if daughter cells are each to inherit the full set of genetic information.

ParB specifically nucleates on <italic>parS</italic> before spreading outwards to the flanking DNA and bridges/cages DNA together to form a nucleoprotein network in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breier and Grossman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Debaugny et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broedersz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Funnell, 2016</xref>).

Engineered strains harboring a nucleation-competent but spreading-defective mutant of <italic>parB</italic> are either unviable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohl et al., 2001</xref>) or have elevated number of anucleate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harms et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawalek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin and Grossman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lagage et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jecz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attaiech et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Grossman, 2006</xref>). Despite the importance of spreading for proper chromosome segregation, the mechanism by which a few <italic>parS</italic>-bound ParB can recruit hundreds more ParB molecules to the vicinity of <italic>parS</italic> to assemble a high-molecular-weight nucleoprotein complex is not fully understood.</p><p>Since the first report in 1995 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lynch and Wang, 1995</xref>), ParB spreading has been observed in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation in multiple bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tran et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lagage et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breier and Grossman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodionov et al., 1999</xref>). The nucleation of ParB on <italic>parS</italic> has also been demonstrated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harms et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breier and Grossman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Surtees and Funnell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ah-Seng et al., 2013</xref>); however, <italic>parS</italic>-dependent ParB spreading has resisted biochemical reconstitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019</xref>). Unsuccessful attempts to reconstitute spreading in vitro suggests that additional factors might be missing. Recently, works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soh et al.Â (2019)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio-Valeriano et al. (2019)</xref> on <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> ParB, respectively, showed that ParB binds and hydrolyzes cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to cytidine diphosphate (CDP), and that CTP modulates the binding affinity of ParB to <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). A co-crystal structure of <italic>Bacillus</italic> ParB with CDP and that of a <italic>Myxococcus</italic> ParB-like protein (PadC) with CTP showed CTP binding promotes a new dimerization interface between N-terminal domains of ParB subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). Crucially, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soh et al.Â (2019)</xref> showed by single-molecule imaging and cross-linking assays that <italic>Bacillus</italic> ParB, in the presence of CTP, forms a self-loading protein clamp at <italic>parS</italic> and slides away to spread to neighboring DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). While reproducing a key result from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Easter and Gober (2002)</xref> that showed <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> ParA-ATP dissociated pre-bound ParB from <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Easter and Gober, 2002</xref>), we found that CTP could also modulate the nucleation of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB on <italic>parS</italic>. Personal communication with Stephan Gruber and the recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio-Valeriano et al. (2019)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soh et al.Â (2019)</xref> encouraged us to take steps further to investigate the role of CTP for ParB spreading in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>.</p><p>Here, we reconstitute a <italic>parS</italic>-dependent ParB spreading on DNA in real-time, using a label-free purified protein from <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>.

We further provide evidence that the accumulation of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB requires a closed DNA substrate, and that a DNA-binding transcription factor, TetR, can act as a roadblock to attenuate ParB accumulation unidirectionally in vitro. Our real-time and label-free reconstitution has successfully recapitulated many well-known aspects of ParB behaviors in vivo and might open up avenues to investigate further the roles of the ParB-<italic>parS</italic> nucleoprotein complex in ensuring faithful chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CTP reduces the nucleation of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB on <italic>parS</italic></title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Easter and Gober (2002)</xref> reported that ATP-bound <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParA dissociated ParB from <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Easter and Gober, 2002</xref>); however, the authors did not control for the effect of ATP alone on ParB-<italic>parS</italic> binding. NTPs are highly negatively charged and could have affected protein-DNA interactions by binding non-specifically to the often positively charged DNA-binding domain. To determine if ATP or other NTP alone affects ParB-<italic>parS</italic> interaction, we attached a linear 20 bp biotinylated <italic>parS</italic> DNA to a streptavidin-coated probe to measure the bio-layer interference (BLI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). BLI assay monitors wavelength shifts (responses) resulting from changes in the optical thickness of the probe surface during association or dissociation of the analyte (see Materials and Methods). We monitored in real-time interactions between immobilized <italic>parS</italic> DNA and purified <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB or a premix of ParB + NTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tran et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Figge et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB bound site-specifically to <italic>parS</italic> but not to non-cognate DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In the presence of ATP, GTP, or UTP, we observed a small reduction in ParB-<italic>parS</italic> binding at steady state regardless of whether Mg<sup>2+</sup> was included in binding buffer or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB is slightly sensitive to highly negatively charged compounds or to counter-ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) in NTP solutions. However, we noted that CTP had a pronounced effect on ParB-<italic>parS</italic> interaction, specifically in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). An increasing concentration of CTP (but not CMP or CDP) gradually reduced the binding of ParB to <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, neither CTP nor other NTPs affected the binding of another protein-DNA pair, for example, the well-characterized TetR-<italic>tetO</italic> interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saenger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). On closer inspection, we noted that ParB + CTP slowly dissociated from <italic>parS</italic> even before the probe was returned to a protein-free buffer (a gradual downward slope between 30<sup>th</sup> and 150<sup>th</sup> sec, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that CTP facilitated ParB removal from a 20 bp <italic>parS</italic> DNA. To investigate further, we monitored the dissociation rates of pre-bound CTP-free ParB-<italic>parS</italic> complexes after probes were returned to a protein-free buffer with or without CTP, we found ParB dissociatingÂ ~seven times faster in buffer with CTP than in buffer only solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Given the short length of a 20 bp <italic>parS</italic> DNA duplex that has only sufficient room for nucleation, our results suggest that CTP might decrease ParB nucleation on <italic>parS</italic> or liberates pre-bound ParB from <italic>parS</italic> site.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CTP reduces the nucleation of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB at <italic>parS</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The domain architecture of ParB (dark green) and TetR (grey), and their respective DNA-binding sites <italic>parS</italic> and <italic>tetO</italic>.

We noted that the BLI signal was not as high as with a 20 bp <italic>parS</italic> probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) due to a less efficient immobilization of a longer DNA fragment on the BLI probe. Premixing ATP, GTP, or UTP with ParB did not change the sensorgrams markedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the addition of CTP significantly increased the response byÂ ~12 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that more ParB associated with a 169 bp <italic>parS</italic> probe at steady state than by nucleation at <italic>parS</italic> alone. We observed that DNA-bound ParB was salt sensitive and dissociated readily to the solution when the BLI probe was returned to a low-salt protein-free buffer without CTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, dissociation phase). However, the dissociation of pre-bound ParB-CTP from DNA was slowed down byÂ ~fivefold if the probe was returned to a buffer supplemented with CTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). The effect on the BLI response was not seen if Mg<sup>2+</sup> was omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C</xref>), neither did we observe an equivalent increase in response when a 169 bp dual biotin-labeled DNA containing a scrambled <italic>parS</italic> was employed instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

To investigate this possibility, we constructed a 170 bp dual biotin-labeled DNA fragment that contains a single <italic>parS</italic> site, a <italic>tetO</italic> operator, and flanking restriction enzyme recognition sites for <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bam</italic>HI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). With this closed DNA substrate, we observed an enhanced ParB association with DNA in the presence of CTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Again, we generated a free DNA end via restriction enzyme digestion. Consistent with previous experiments with a restricted 169 bp DNA probe, the addition of ParB + CTP had no effect on the BLI response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, it can be partially rescued by incubating a <italic>Bam</italic>HI-restricted DNA probe with a premix of ParB + CTP + TetR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We reason that TetR binding at <italic>tetO</italic> capped the open DNA end, essentially generated a closed DNA substrate. Our conclusion was further supported by results from an experiment in which a premix of ParB + CTP + TetR was tested against an <italic>Eco</italic>RI-restricted DNA instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Here, we did not observe an enhanced association of ParB with DNA even when TetR was included, most likely because of a persistent open DNA end that could not be blocked by TetR-<italic>tetO</italic> binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, we observed that the TetR could attenuate ParB-CTP accumulation on a closed DNA substrate (magenta line vs. orange line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This blocking effect is specific to TetR-<italic>tetO</italic> binding since the addition of anhydrotetracycline (ahTc), a negative effector of TetR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saenger et al., 2000</xref>), allowed ParB-CTP to regain its accumulation on DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Hence, it is most likely that the effect of CTP on ParB spreading is universal among plasmid and chromosomal ParB orthologs. A classical mutant whose arginine-rich patch (G<sup>101</sup>ERRxR) has been mutated to alanine forÂ example ParB (R104A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin and Grossman, 1998</xref>) was not responsive to CTP, suggesting that CTP is bound to the N-terminal domain of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB.

There might be two different modes of action of ParB on DNA: one for bridging DNA together (that does not require CTP) and another for the lateral spreading of ParB on DNA (that requires CTP). Investigating the relative contribution of these two different modes of action to chromosome segregation in vivo is an important challenge for the future.</p><p>The requirement of a DNA substrate with blocked ends for ParB accumulation in vitro is suggestive of a lateral ParB diffusion along the DNA thatÂ is ParB can escape by running off a free DNA end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Inside cells, the spreading and bridging/caging of ParB have been inferred from the compact foci of fluorescently labeled ParB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harms et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lagage et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thanbichler and Shapiro, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kusiak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glaser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erdmann et al., 1999</xref>), presumably resulting from the concentration of fluorescent signal to a defined location in the cytoplasm.

It might be that only apo-ParB or a transiently formed CDP-bound ParB (from CTP hydrolysis) are able to nucleate on <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Supporting this interpretation, preincubation of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB with a non-hydrolyzable analog CTPÎ³S promoted efficiently the cross-linked form of ParB and subsequently reduced ParB nucleation and spreading on DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

We showed that <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB-<italic>parS</italic> complex binds CTP, and this facilitates ParB dissociation from <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Our observation of a low BLI response with an open DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) implies that ParB proteins dissociate off the free end well before the next ParB escapes from the <italic>parS</italic> nucleation site. We suggest that the transition from a <italic>parS</italic>-bound ParB to a spreading ParB might be the rate-limiting step.</p><p>Stage 3: ParB spreads or diffuses to non-specific DNA flanking <italic>parS</italic>. Our observation that <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB did not accumulate on an open DNA suggests that <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB diffuses laterally along the DNA. Similarly, cross-linking experiments on <italic>Bacillus</italic> ParB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soh et al., 2019</xref>) proposed that the ParB-CTP complex forms a sliding clamp that moves along the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). From our experiments with CTPÎ³S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soh et al.Â (2019)</xref>, we suggest that the diffusive <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB along the DNA is CTP bound. The low CTP hydrolysis rate of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB (~3 CTP molecules per ParB per hour) while ParB spreading could be observed by BLI within minutes also lends support to the interpretation that the diffusive spreading form of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB is most likely CTP-bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7BâC</xref>). For <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB, CTP hydrolysis is not required for ParB to escape from the nucleation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB could still spread on a DNA when incubated with a non-hydrolyzable CTPÎ³S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), even though spreading, at least in vitro, was less stable over time in comparison to when CTP was employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). As suggested for <italic>Bacillus</italic> ParB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soh et al., 2019</xref>) and supported by our results with <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB, CTP hydrolysis might contribute to ParB recycling instead. It is possible that ParB recycling in vivo is achieved via several routes: (i) CTP dissociation from its weak binding pocket, (ii) CTP hydrolysis, (iii) a possible enhanced CTP dissociation/hydrolysis via collisions with DNA-bound roadblocks, or (iv) a transient clamp opening even when ParB is CTP bound. Additional work is required to investigate the dynamics of ParB clamp opening/closing, and whether both CTP molecules on opposite subunits of a ParB dimer are concertedly hydrolyzed/dissociated for ParB to escape from the chromosome or a heterodimer state of ParB with a single CTP bound exists in vivo.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Final perspectives</title><p>In this work, we showed the enhancing effect of CTP on <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB accumulation on DNA and further demonstrated that ParB spreading requires a closed DNA substrate and that a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator can act as a roadblock to attenuate spreading unidirectionally in vitro. Our real-time and label-free reconstitution of ParB spreading has successfully recapitulated many well-known aspects of ParB behaviors and is consistent with pioneering works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soh et al.Â (2019)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio-Valeriano et al.

Beyond the biological significance of the findings, our label-free approaches to biochemical reconstitution obviate the often time-consuming and challenging task of site-specifically labeling proteins with fluorophores/chemical crosslinkers without affecting the function of proteins. Here, we have demonstrated the medium-throughput capability of our methodology by investigating the effect of CTP on the spreading of eight additional chromosomal ParB proteins. The ease and medium-throughput manner of our methodology is likely to facilitate future works by the community. Important areas of research in the future are to investigate (i) the effect of ParB-CTP spreading on the supercoiling state of the DNA and vice versa, and (ii) how ParA and SMC interact with ParB-CTP in vivo to organize and faithfully segregate replicated chromosomes to each daughter cell.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

The crosslinked fractions were averaged, and their standard deviations calculated in Excel.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Plasmids, DNA, and protein sequences used in this study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-53515-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-53515-transrepform-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>No deep sequencing data or X-ray crystallography data were generated during this study.

The authors present a series of biochemical experiments that are some of the first to shed light on the molecular mechanism of CTP-dependent spreading by the ParB protein. Particularly, the authors biochemically differentiate <italic>parS</italic> binding versus ParB spreading on a variety of topologically open or closed DNA substrates. This work immediately follow works published by the groups of Stephan Gruber (Nov. 2019) and Martin Thanbichler (Dec. 2019) which show that ParBs from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>M. xanthus</italic>, respectively, are CTP-binding proteins, CTPases, and CTP is required for ParB spreading. Here the authors show that <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB also shares these activities. There is a mechanistic focus on ParB spreading in the manuscript, thus the perspective is slightly different and the detailed biochemical dissection complements and enriches the results described in the other two studies. Unique to this paper, the authors show how ParBs, from a number of bacteria, require a topologically closed DNA substrate for spreading to be detected in vitro, providing strong evidence that this is likely a shared requirement amongst all ParBs. Based off the DNA binding and release kinetics and CTPase activity of ParB, a model for CTP-dependent ParB spreading is provided.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1: The final sentences of the Introduction are exclusive to those that have an intimate knowledge of the field. The authors need to spell-out their rationale for this paper given the findings of Easter and Gober, 2002; Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019; and Soh et al., 2019. What is confirmatory and what is new in this paper compared to these recent publications. I recommend the authors use many of the points they make in the cover letter to make a more reader-friendly end to the Introduction.</p><p>2) All three reviewers independently identified several issues with the model figure that are either misleading or potentially incorrect based off the data presented in the paper. Since this is one of the first papers describing a detailed molecular mechanism for CTP-dependent ParB spreading, the authors should be incredibly careful, and specific, as to what the data has shown thus far, and what remains speculative. Refer to the reviewer comments below for details regarding specific concerns:</p><p>Reviewer 1: Figure 6 â the model makes assumptions that should be addressed in the legend or main-text. (i) CTP binding sites are shown to always react in concert with each other. Is there justification for this? It is possible that one fires and then hangs on (or releases) CDP+Pi, while the other monomer of ParB remains bound to CTP. These heterodimer states are not even considered. (ii) The model suggests only the Apo form of ParB can bridge DNA. Indeed, ParB has only been shown (by many) to bridge DNA without CTP. But the authors have not formally shown whether or not CTP-ParB shares this bridging activity â in addition to being able to spread.</p><p>Reviewer 2: The authors have convincingly demonstrated that <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> ParB hydrolyses CTP and that <italic>parS</italic> stimulates the hydrolysis seven fold. However, CTP hydrolysis is not contemplated in the model. The authors state that CTP hydrolysis is not required for ParB to escape from the nucleation site and report the experiment performed with CTPÎ³S, which show ParB spreading. If so, then what is the role of CTP hydrolysis in the system? This is not entirely clear to me. Secondly, if there is no double-strand break in the DNA, so no open end, how do the diffusing ParB dimers come off the DNA? Is the CTP hydrolysis invoked at this stage of the process maybe? But at this point, the ParB molecules are not bound to <italic>parS</italic>, thus the CTPase activity would be very weak. Thirdly, does ParB dimer form a completely closed ring upon CTP binding? Is it known? Overall I think that the model would benefit from some clarifications.</p><p>â Reviewers 1 and 3 independently identified critical pieces of data that, upon reviewer consultation, was deemed as necessary for supporting the author's conclusions and therefore necessary for publication:</p><p>3) Reviewer 3: The authors document <italic>parS</italic>-dependence of the constrained (169 bp) substrates, but not of the 20 bp substrate. Is ParB binding to the 20 bp DNA in BLI dependent on <italic>parS</italic>? This is an important question in part because the authors imply that binding is specific by repeatedly referring to the ParB-<italic>parS</italic> complexes, and also because they discuss this as a &quot;nucleation event&quot; at <italic>parS</italic>. Testing specificity is an easy experiment â measure ParB binding to the <italic>tetO</italic> substrates used in Figure 1C. Does CTP promote dissociation without <italic>parS</italic>? By the models presented, this should be confirmed.</p><p>4) Reviewer 3: Figure 1 â The data that ATP, GTP or UTP have any effect are not convincing. First, the effects are very small and second, all other ParB binding properties are unaffected by these dNTPs. The TetR control might just signal that ParB is more sensitive to salt than TetR. Also, are the counterions with the dNTPs controlled for? Most of these are sold as sodium or lithium salts (this is not mentioned in the paper). If the DNA binding is not specific for <italic>parS</italic>, one possibility for example, is that the non-specific DNA binding properties of ParB are more salt sensitive than its site-specific DNA binding properties. If the authors believe the effects of ATP, GTP and UTP are significant, they need to show that all salt is properly controlled. This is not a difficult experiment. It is possible that nucleotide effects would affect <italic>parS</italic> and non-specific DNA binding differently, and salt would need to be considered. The authors may already have done these experiments and controls, just not reported them in the paper.</p><p>5) Reviewer 1 and reviewer 3: &quot;Spreading&quot; â The authors are measuring DNA binding by ParB, and interpreting that this is spreading. In essence, the authors have shown <italic>parS</italic>-dependence if CTP is present and if the DNA is topologically tethered. This does not necessarily equate to spreading, which implies that multiple molecules of ParB associate and then slide away. The change in BLI signal with the larger substrates is consistent with this view, but a secondary confirmation that the ParB-<italic>parS</italic> complexes are larger would add to the confidence of the result. The authors could also be more cautious in their use of the term spreading. For example, &quot;CTP is required for the extensive <italic>parS</italic>-dependent ParB spreading in vitro&quot;. How extensive is this on a 169 bp substrate? Reviewers suggest that <italic>at least one</italic> of the three possible experiments suggested below should be performed to support the &quot;spreading&quot; argument. Again, <italic>not all</italic> experiments below are required:</p><p>Reviewer 1: An in vitro ChIP assay to show that ParB is indeed spreading to DNA flanking the <italic>parS</italic> site on the topologically closed DNA substrate on the beads would be a useful addition to the interpretation of the BLI data. This is not possible with the BLI DNA because of how small the DNA fragment is. However sonication of the 2.8kb fragment down to ~250bp fragments will provide ~11 fragments in the ChIP assay with ParB antibody. This can be compared to ChIP of apo-ParB which should be sitting only on the fragments containing the <italic>parS</italic> site.</p><p>Reviewer 1: Not as direct as the experiment suggested above, but perhaps more feasible for the authors â Move the <italic>tetO</italic> site closer to and farther from the <italic>parS</italic> site to show a corresponding shift in the BLI shift. A closer <italic>tetO</italic> with TetR shown produce a lower signal. A <italic>tetO</italic> site with TetR bound right beside the anchor shown produce a shift similar to that of the topologically closed DNA without <italic>tetO</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer 3: The experiments using restriction enzyme digestion to manipulate the 169 bp substrate are a convincing way to examine the role of ends. What happens if the restriction enzyme is added <italic>after</italic> ParB binds? If this is feasible in the BLI context (i.e. move the probe into wells with everything plus the RE), it would be a nice way to establish that ParB slides off an end (right now it is inferred).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53515.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This well-written manuscript &quot;ParB Spreading on topologically closed DNA requires cytidine triphosphate in vitro&quot; by Jalal et al. addresses the long-standing question of the mechanism by which ParB spreads onto DNA flanking the parS site.

In the original manuscript, we used the conventional definition of topology i.e. how constituent parts are linked together. However, a strict mathematical definition of DNA topology implies a specific linking number. While the conventional definition of topology has been used extensively in the literature, we agree with them that this terminology might be misinterpreted to a supercoiling-dependent DNA-binding activity by ParB-CTP in the context of our manuscript. For that reason, we replaced the term âtopologically open/closed DNAâ with simply âopen/closed DNAâ throughout the manuscript. We added sentences to the Results section to clarify this terminology:</p><p>âImmobilizing a dual biotin-labeled DNA on a streptavidin-coated BLI probe created a DNA substrate where both ends were blocked (a closed DNA) (Onn and Koshland, 2011) (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1).â</p><p>âNext, we investigated whether a DNA substrate with a free end (an open DNA) can also support ParB accumulation in vitro.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer: The final sentences of the Introduction are exclusive to those that have an intimate knowledge of the field.

Overall I think that the model would benefit from some clarifications.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised important points and we felt it is prudent to perform further experiments with CTPÎ³S to clarify the model:</p><p>Experiment 1 (Figure 6A): We fortuitously discovered that a long preincubation of purified ParB and CTPÎ³S (but not CTP) had a negative effect on ParB accumulation on a closed DNA substrate. To investigate further, ParB was preincubated with CTP or CTPÎ³S for 1, 5, 15, 30, or 60 min before binding to a 169-bp closed DNA substrate (Figure 6A). We observed that <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB could accumulate on DNA in the presence of CTPÎ³S, but in contrast to when CTP was employed, a longer preincubation time between ParB and CTPÎ³S gradually reduced ParB accumulation on DNA (Figure 6A). Our results suggest the possibility that CTPÎ³S, in the absence of <italic>parS</italic> DNA, gradually converts apo-ParB in solution to a nucleation-incompetent form over time. This observation is reminiscent of a time-course experiment in which CTPÎ³S efficiently promoted the engagement between N-terminal domains of <italic>Bacillus</italic> ParB in the absence of <italic>parS</italic> DNA (Soh et al., 2019). The engagement of N-terminal domains was shown to convert <italic>Bacillus</italic> ParB from an open to a closed protein clamp (Soh et al., 2019). If not already bound on DNA, the closed form of ParB presumably cannot self-nucleate/load onto <italic>parS</italic> due to its now inaccessible DNA-binding domain (Soh et al., 2019).</p><p>Experiment 2 (Figure 6B): We wondered if CTPÎ³S also catalyzes the N-domain engagement in <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB in the absence of <italic>parS</italic> DNA. To investigate this possibility, we employed site-specific cross-linking of a purified <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB (Q35C C297S) variant by a sulfhydryl-to-sulfhydryl crosslinker bismaleimidoethane (BMOE) (Figure 6B, same strategy as pioneered by the Gruber lab; Soh et al., 2019). We performed controls to confirm that Q35C and C297S mutations did not impair ParB activity in vitro (Figure 6âfigure supplement 2). We then performed a time-course cross-linking of ParB (Q35C C297S) + CTP or CTPÎ³S in the absence of <italic>parS</italic> DNA (Figure 6B). CTPÎ³S was twice as efficient as CTP in promoting the cross-linked form between N-terminal domains of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB (Figure 6B). The rapid increase in the nucleation-incompetent closed form of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB might explain the overall reduction in spreading over time when ParB was preincubated with CTPÎ³S (Figure 6A).</p><p>Experiment 3 (Figure 6C): To further investigate the effect of CTPÎ³S on ParB spreading on a longer time scale, we extended the association phase between a 169-bp <italic>parS</italic> DNA and a freshly prepared premix of ParB + CTP or CTPÎ³S from 120 sec to 60 min (Figure 6C). In the presence of CTP, the reaction reached a steady state after 120 sec and remained stable for the duration of the association phase (Figure 6C). However, in the presence of CTPÎ³S, ParB accumulation rapidly reached the maximal level after 200 sec, then declined slowly over the course of 60 min. We reason that DNA-bound ParB-CTPÎ³S complexes gradually dissociated from DNA into solution but were not replenished by a new cycle of nucleation-spreading-dissociation because over time most ParB-CTPÎ³S in solution was in a nucleation-incompetent closed form. ParB-CTPÎ³S could possibly escape the DNA via transient ring opening or CTPÎ³S leaving its weak binding pocket rather than by hydrolysis.</p><p>Taken together, we suggest that CTP hydrolysis is <italic>not</italic> required for <italic>parS</italic>-bound ParB to escape the nucleation site <italic>parS</italic> to spread, but possibly contributes to the stability of spreading by recycling ParB.</p><p>We hope these new data shed further light on the possible role of CTP hydrolysis and answer some of the questions that the reviewer asked. Nevertheless, we have been cautious with the interpretation in the revised manuscript and only suggest that âCTP hydrolysis possibly contributes to ParB recyclingâ. We also refrained from saying âParB forms a completely closed ring upon CTP bindingâ, since the dynamics of ring opening and closing (when CTP is bound) are not yet known. Specifically, we added the following sentences to the Discussion:</p><p>âIt is possible that ParB recycling in vivo is achieved via several routes: (i) CTP dissociation from its weak binding pocket, (ii) CTP hydrolysis, (iii) a possible enhanced CTP dissociation/hydrolysis via collisions with DNA-bound roadblocks, or (iv) a transient clamp opening even when ParB is CTP bound. Additional work is required to investigate the dynamics of ParB clamp opening/closing, and whether both CTP molecules on opposite subunits of a ParB dimer are concertedly hydrolyzed/dissociated for ParB to escape from the chromosome or a heterodimer state of ParB with a single CTP bound exists in vivo.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Reviewers 1 and 3 independently identified critical pieces of data that, upon reviewer consultation, was deemed as necessary for supporting the author's conclusions and therefore necessary for publication. All three reviewers think the experiments suggested below can be done in 2 months:</p><p>3) Reviewer 3: The authors document parS-dependence of the constrained (169 bp) substrates, but not of the 20 bp substrate. Is ParB binding to the 20 bp DNA in BLI dependent on parS? This is an important question in part because the authors imply that binding is specific by repeatedly referring to the ParB-parS complexes, and also because they discuss this as a &quot;nucleation event&quot; at parS. Testing specificity is an easy experiment â measure ParB binding to the tetO substrates used in Figure 1C. Does CTP promote dissociation without parS? By the models presented, this should be confirmed.</p></disp-quote><p>Unlike <italic>Bacillus</italic> ParB, which has an additional non-specific DNA-binding activity at its C-terminal domain (Taylor et al., 2015, Graham et al., 2015, Fisher et al., 2019), the C-terminal domain of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB lacks this non-specific DNA-binding activity (Tran et al., 2018). Therefore, <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB distinguishes well between <italic>parS</italic> and non-specific DNA via its central DNA-binding domain (Tran et al., 2018). In the context of this manuscript, we have performed the suggested experiment; we measured the binding of a range of concentrations of purified <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB with 20-bp <italic>parS</italic> or 28-bp <italic>tetO</italic> and between TetR and <italic>parS</italic> or <italic>tetO</italic> DNA (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). Consistent with the literature, <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB and TetR are specific to their cognate binding sites. We have added these results to Figure 1âfigure supplement 1. Finally, because <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB does not bind non-<italic>parS</italic> DNA to begin with, we cannot test whether CTP promotes dissociation without <italic>parS</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reviewer 3: Figure 1 â The data that ATP, GTP or UTP have any effect are not convincing. First, the effects are very small and second, all other ParB binding properties are unaffected by these dNTPs. The TetR control might just signal that ParB is more sensitive to salt than TetR. Also, are the counterions with the dNTPs controlled for? Most of these are sold as sodium or lithium salts (this is not mentioned in the paper). If the DNA binding is not specific for parS, one possibility for example, is that the non-specific DNA binding properties of ParB are more salt sensitive than its site-specific DNA binding properties. If the authors believe the effects of ATP, GTP and UTP are significant, they need to show that all salt is properly controlled. This is not a difficult experiment. It is possible that nucleotide effects would affect parS and non-specific DNA binding differently, and salt would need to be considered. The authors may already have done these experiments and controls, just not reported them in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the effect of ATP, GTP, and UTP was small and did not affect other binding properties of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB. We further performed BMOE cross-linking experiment to investigate the effect of NTPs on the N-domain engagement of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB, and indeed ATP, GTP, and UTP had a negligible effect (Figure 6âfigure supplement 2B).</p><p>We have also performed additional experiment to investigate the sensitivity of ParB to salts/counterions (Na<sup>+</sup>)/other contaminants that came with the purchased NTP solutions. Specifically, we measured binding of ParB to a 20-bp <italic>parS</italic> DNA with/without NTPs in buffer lacking Mg<sup>2+</sup>. All NTPs (in buffer lacking Mg<sup>2+</sup>) decreased ParB-<italic>parS</italic> interaction very slightly (but reproducibly), suggesting that ParB might be slightly sensitive to salt/counterions/contaminants in the purchased NTP solutions. Again, given that the effect of ATP, GTP, or UTP (in buffer with or without Mg<sup>2+</sup>) in all different types of experiments (bio-layer interferometry/BMOE cross-linking/DRaCALA/NTP hydrolysis) was small, we toned down our interpretation and focused solely on the specific effect of CTP on <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB properties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Reviewer 1 and reviewer 3: &quot;Spreading&quot; â The authors are measuring DNA binding by ParB and interpreting that this is spreading. In essence, the authors have shown parS-dependence if CTP is present and if the DNA is topologically tethered. This does not necessarily equate to spreading, which implies that multiple molecules of ParB associate and then slide away. The change in BLI signal with the larger substrates is consistent with this view, but a secondary confirmation that the ParB-parS complexes are larger would add to the confidence of the result. The authors could also be more cautious in their use of the term spreading. For example, &quot;CTP is required for the extensive parS-dependent ParB spreading in vitro&quot;. How extensive is this on a 169 bp substrate?</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent points and we agree with the reviewers. In the revised manuscript, we are more cautious in using the term âspreadingâ.

After adding BamHI, ParB binding to DNA reduced gradually over the course of 30 minutes, while it was unaffected when an inactivated BamHI was used instead (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2).

Also, the binding of ParB-CTP to DNA was performed in NEB buffer 3.1 [100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 Âµg/ml BSA, pH 7.9] instead of the low-salt binding buffer used throughout the manuscript [100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.005% Tween20, pH 8.0]. NEB buffer 3.1 was used to ensure BamHI digested DNA as optimally as possible while keeping <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB stable. Due to the change in buffers, the BLI response of ParB-CTP with DNA was higher in buffer NEB 3.1 than in the usual binding buffer used throughout the manuscript. Materials and methods section has been updated to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer: Not as direct as the experiment suggested above, but perhaps more feasible for the authors â Move the tetO site closer to and farther from the parS site to show a corresponding shift in the BLI shift. A closer tetO with TetR shown produce a lower signal. A tetO site with TetR bound right beside the anchor shown produce a shift similar to that of the topologically closed DNA without tetO.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a variant of the suggested experiment (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1): a premix of ParB, CTP, and TetR was allowed to bind to a closedDNA substrate and, after the system reached steady state, anhydrotetracycline was added to remove bound TetR from the DNA. After the roadblock (TetR) was removed by anhydrotetracycline, we observed that ParB binding to the closed DNA increased (dotted magenta line, Figure 4âfigure supplement 1), consistent with the âspreadingâ phenomenon. We have performed a control showing that ParB-CTP binding to DNA is insensitive to added anhydrotetracycline in the absence of TetR (solid and dotted orange lines, Figure 4âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1: An in vitro ChIP assay to show that ParB is indeed spreading to DNA flanking the parS site on the topologically closed DNA substrate on the beads would be a useful addition to the interpretation of the BLI data. This is not possible with the BLI DNA because of how small the DNA fragment is. However sonication of the 2.8kb fragment down to ~250bp fragments will provide ~11 fragments in the ChIP assay with ParB antibody. This can be compared to ChIP of apo-ParB which should be sitting only on the fragments containing the parS site.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted this experiment for the original manuscript but were not successful, most likely because fixing <italic>Caulobacter</italic> ParB to DNA (+/- CTP) in vitro with 1% formaldehyde inactivated most of ParB protein. We have not optimized the concentration of formaldehyde for fixation any further due to time constraints. In previous work, we were successful in performing a non-crosslinking version of in vitro ChIP-seq (IDAP-seq) using sonicated genomic DNA and purified ParB (Tran et al., 2018). However, this methodology is inappropriate in the presence of CTP since we now have ample evidence that ParB-CTP slides off the ends of sonicated DNA.</p><p>N.B.While assembling source data to upload to <italic>eLife</italic>, I found that some parts of Figure 2âfigure supplement 3 were mislabeled in the original manuscript. Specifically, <italic>Morella thermoacetica</italic> His<sub>6</sub>-MBP-ParB should be <italic>Dechloromonas aromatica</italic> His<sub>6</sub>-MBP-ParB, and 0.01 mM CTP was used for <italic>Zymomonas mobilis</italic> and <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> ParB instead of 1mM CTP used for all other ParB samples. To double check, we purified these eight proteins again using batch purification and redid the experiments for Figure 2âfigure supplement 3. I apologize for the oversight. These two mislabellings have been corrected and the figure legend updated in the revised manuscript. The conclusion that âwe performed BLI experiments for eight additional chromosomal ParB proteins from a diverse set of bacterial species and consistently observed the specific effect of CTP on enhancing ParB association with a closed DNA in vitro (Figure 2âfigure supplement 3). It is most likely that ParB-CTP interaction with DNA is conserved among ParB orthologsâstands.</p><p>A higher concentration of CTP was inhibitory to <italic>Zymomonas</italic> and <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> ParB, presumably because most of these apo-ParB was converted to the closed clamp form before exposure to tested DNA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
