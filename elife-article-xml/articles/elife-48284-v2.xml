Because MuSC behaviors in these two environments have not been considered separately, MuSC behaviors in overloaded muscle remain unexamined. Here, we show that most MuSCs in overloaded muscle, unlike MuSCs in regenerating muscle, proliferate in the absence of MyoD expression. Mechanistically, MuSCs in overloaded muscle sustain the expression of <italic>Heyl</italic>, a Notch effector gene, to suppress MyoD expression, which allows effective MuSC proliferation on myofibers and beneath the basal lamina. Although <italic>Heyl</italic>-knockout mice show no impairment in an injury model, in a hypertrophy model, their muscles harbor fewer new MuSC-derived myonuclei due to increased MyoD expression and diminished proliferation, which ultimately causes blunted hypertrophy. Our results show that sustained HeyL expression is critical for MuSC proliferation specifically in overloaded muscle, and thus indicate that the MuSC-proliferation mechanism differs in overloaded and regenerating muscle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>satellite cells</kwd><kwd>hypertrophy</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukada</surname><given-names>So-ichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007428</institution-id><institution>Naito Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukada</surname><given-names>So-ichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008731</institution-id><institution>Nakatomi Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukada</surname><given-names>So-ichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003837</institution-id><institution>Ichiro Kanehara Foundation for the Promotion of Medical Sciences and Medical Care</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukada</surname><given-names>So-ichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009438</institution-id><institution>National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Grant for Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukada</surname><given-names>So-ichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18am0101084j</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsujikawa</surname><given-names>Kazutake</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proliferating muscle stem cells in overloaded muscle require special molecular mechanisms that differ from well-known myogenic differentiation model.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle consists of multinuclear cells named myofibers and exhibits the ability to regenerate. When myofibers are damaged, mitotically quiescent mononuclear cells known as muscle satellite (stem) cells (MuSCs) exit quiescence and become activated and immediately start expressing MyoD (a myogenic determination gene), followed by entry into the cell cycle to yield daughter cells (myoblasts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>). To generate multinuclear cells, the proliferated myoblasts fuse with each other or with existing myofibers through the action of the fusion proteins âmyomakerâ and âmyomixer/myomerger/minionâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Millay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quinn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). The indispensable role and behaviors of MuSCs in muscle regeneration have been comprehensively investigated, leading to the establishment of an MuSC-differentiation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lepper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang and Rudnicki, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Another ability possessed by skeletal muscle is the capacity to adapt its size in response to new milieus. A loss of muscle mass (i.e., muscle atrophy) occurs in bedridden people, patients with cancer cachexia or sepsis, or during aging, whereas an increase in muscle mass (i.e., muscle hypertrophy) is induced by resistance training. Although MuSC requirement for myofiber hypertrophy has been debated, MuSCs are required for long-term muscle hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Egner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukada, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh and Millay, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, MuSCs are indispensable for supplying new nuclei to myofibers during overload-induced muscle hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Egner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh and Millay, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McCarthy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schiaffino et al., 1976</xref>). Similar to the regeneration process, myomaker is necessary for MuSC fusion with myofibers during muscle hypertrophy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh and Millay (2017)</xref>Â showed that the addition of new myonuclei derived from MuSCs was severely hampered in overloaded muscle from myomaker-deficient mice. Before this cell fusion, MuSCs must escape from their quiescent state, become activated, and proliferate; however, compared with MuSC behavior during muscle regeneration, MuSC-activation/proliferation mechanisms during hypertrophy remain poorly investigated. One reason for this is that damage to skeletal muscle arises from resistance training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarkson and Hubal, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ebbeling and Clarkson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuipers, 1994</xref>); therefore, previous studies have not considered whether hypertrophic muscle requires special mechanisms for MuSC activation/proliferation.</p><p>Specific forms of exercise (e.g., eccentric contraction) can result in disruption of the myofibrillar structure and leakiness of the myofiber membrane (sarcolemma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">FridÃ©n et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grounds, 1998</xref>). However, these disruptions depend on the intensity, duration, and frequency of the administered exercise and do not unfailingly lead to lethal/substantial injury to the myofiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grounds, 1998</xref>). Intriguingly, studies conducted by Darr and Schultz suggested that MuSCs became activated and replicated, even on myofibers not overtly necrotic in eccentrically exercised soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles of rats. This finding suggests that the existence of lethal damage to myofibers is not necessary for MuSC activation and proliferation in overloaded muscle. Given that this mechanism underlying MuSC activation/proliferation in overloaded muscle differs from that in regenerating muscle, elucidation of MuSC behaviors in overloaded muscle could facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for the muscle wasting or atrophy that occurs in the absence of muscle damage (as in chronic diseases and aging).</p><p>Under steady state conditions, MuSCs are maintained in an undifferentiated and quiescent state in their niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukada, 2018</xref>), with the molecules and pathways that maintain MuSCs in the dormant state having been recently revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baghdadi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheung and Rando, 2013</xref>). Among the pathways involved, the canonical Notch signaling pathway is crucial for sustaining the undifferentiated state in MuSCs. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling system required for cell-fate decisions and patterning events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lai, 2004</xref>). The most widely recognized primary targets of canonical Notch signaling are the (hairy and enhancer of split) <italic>Hes</italic> and (Hes-related; also known as Hesr/Herp/Hrt/Gridlock/Chf) <italic>Hey</italic> families of bHLH transcriptional-repressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iso et al., 2003</xref>), which function to suppress MyoD and myogenin expression in MuSCs. Recently, Lahmann et al. indicated that Hes1 controls oscillatory <italic>Myod</italic> expression in activated/proliferating MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lahmann et al., 2019</xref>). We previously reported that neither <italic>Hey1</italic> (Hey1-KO) nor <italic>Heyl</italic> single-knockout (HeyL-KO) mice show abnormalities in regenerative ability, MyoD and myogenin expression, or MuSC number; however, double-KO mice exhibit severe regenerative defects due to a reduction in MuSC number resulting from increased MyoD and myogenin expression in the MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Noguchi et al., 2019</xref>). When MuSCs respond to muscle injury, <italic>Hey1</italic> and <italic>Heyl</italic> expression levels are drastically decreased; therefore, activation/proliferation of MuSCs in injured muscle do not require <italic>Hey1</italic> and <italic>Heyl</italic> expression. However, <italic>Hey1</italic> and <italic>Heyl</italic> expression and function in proliferating MuSCs in hypertrophic muscle remain unknown.</p><p>To investigate the mechanism of MuSC activation/proliferation during muscle hypertrophy, we first examined the protein-expression patterns of MyoD and Ki67 in MuSCs in overloaded muscle. During MuSC activation in acute injury or in vitro culture, almost all MuSCs initially express MyoD at the protein level and then express Ki67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogawa et al., 2015</xref>). However, we found that in overloaded muscle, the majority of MuSCs proliferated in the absence of MyoD protein expression. Notably, gene-expression analyses indicated that <italic>Hey1</italic> expression in proliferating MuSCs was decreased to the same extent as that observed in the injury model, whereas <italic>Heyl</italic> expression was sustained in overloaded MuSCs, suggesting that the requirement of HeyL in MuSCs differed between regenerating and overloaded muscle. Accordingly, HeyL-KO mice showed no marked defects in a muscle-injury model but exhibited decreases in the number of proliferating MuSCs, MyoD-negative cells, and incorporated myonuclei in overloaded muscle, indicating that sustained HeyL expression is critical for MuSC expansion in overloaded muscle. Finally, both muscle weight and myofiber size were attenuated in the overloaded muscle of HeyL-KO mice at 9 weeks after synergist ablation. Collectively, our findings indicate that sustained HeyL expression is necessary for effective proliferation of MuSCs in overloaded muscle, and that the MuSC-proliferation mechanism in overloaded muscle differs from that in injured muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proliferation of MuSCs during muscle hypertrophy</title><p>To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which MuSCs become activated and proliferate in overloaded muscle, the Achilles tendon in mice was cut to induce compensatory hypertrophy in plantaris muscle (tenotomy). This model relies on the compensatory adaptation of the plantaris muscle following cutting of the functionally synergistic muscles of the Achilles tendon (i.e., the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles). Surgical ablation of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles [synergist ablation; SA] leads to more marked increase in muscle weight than after tenotomy alone; however, the incidence of muscle damage is also increased. The rate of increase in muscle weight in the tenotomy model was lower than that in the SA model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), although muscle weight increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, areas of muscle damage were rarely detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, even under conditions of diminished muscle damage, we observed an increased number of Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

In this scenario, MuSCs would proliferate in a restricted area and on a few myofibers. Conversely, if MuSCs respond to other stimuli (e.g., mechanical stimulation), MuSCs on almost all myofibers would escape from the quiescent state and proliferate on undamaged myofibers. To investigate this, we determined both the number and properties of Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells on single myofibers by using isolated single myofibers in the assays. Because damaged myofibers could be lost during the preparation of single myofibers due to their hyper-contraction, the observed Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells were considered to be present on undamaged myofibers. Under this experimental condition, the number of Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells per myofiber was increased overall in the overloaded muscles but not in only limited areas of the myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We then examined the properties of Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells on single myofibers. In this analysis, if all five Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells present on a myofiber were found to be in the quiescent state (MyoD<sup>â</sup>Ki67<sup>â</sup>), they were categorized into 100% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and 0% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, respectively. However, if zero to one of the five Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells on the myofiber were in the quiescent state, the cells were categorized into the 0% to 20% range in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, whereas if three to four of the five Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells were MyoD<sup>â</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup>, they were categorized into the 60% to 80% range in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. As expected, almost all sham-operated myofibers harbored only quiescent MuSCs (MyoD<sup>â</sup>Ki67<sup>â</sup>). By contrast,&gt;80% of overloaded myofibers harboredÂ &lt;40% quiescent MuSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), andÂ ~60% of the myofibers harboredÂ &gt;40% MyoD<sup>â</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These results suggested that escape of MuSCs from quiescent state did not occur in a restricted area of the overloaded myofibers, and that almost all myofibers responded to the overload. Collectively, these data suggest that MuSCs proliferate during hypertrophy in a manner distinct from that during muscle injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Heyl</italic> expression is sustained in proliferating MuSCs in overloaded muscle</title><p>In contrast to what occurs during the regenerative process, myofibers are retained in overloaded muscle. Accordingly, we observed proliferating MuSCs between myofibers and the basal lamina in overloaded myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Canonical Notch signaling is a critical pathway for suppressing MyoD expression in MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bjornson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mourikis et al., 2012</xref>), and myofibers are considered a source of Notch ligand.

To determine the expression of Notch target genes, we performed RNA-seq analyses and found that their expression was overall sustained in overloaded MuSCs at 4 days after tenotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Therefore, the mechanism of MuSC proliferation in overloaded muscle differs from those described in regenerating muscle and in vitro culture systems, which have provided the basis for concepts of MuSC proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukada, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zammit et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zammit et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we showed that in overloaded muscle, MuSCs proliferated between the basal lamina and myofibers. By contrast, in regenerating muscle, MuSCs proliferate beneath the retained basal lamina (âghost fibersâ), where damaged myofibers have been removed by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). Single-myofiber culture does not allow MuSCs to proliferate beneath the basal lamina, because MuSCs escape from the niche and proliferate outside the basal lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Siegel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamaguchi et al., 2015</xref>).

In cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced regenerating muscle, MuSC activation (MyoD expression) occurs quickly, and at least 50% of MuSCs are Ki67<sup>+</sup> at 1 day after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogawa et al., 2015</xref>). At 2 to 3 days after injury, MuSCs proliferate vigorously and begin to express myogenin to promote MuSC fusion. In overloaded muscle, MuSC activation (Ki67 expression) is initiated 2 days after tenotomy, followed by MuSC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, proliferating and differentiating MuSCs co-exist for long periods, resulting in gradually increasing numbers of MuSC-derived myonuclei until 14 days after tenotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). RNA-seq data supported this model based on elevated expression of both cell cycle-related genes and <italic>myogenin</italic> in overloaded MuSCs.</p><p><italic>Hey1</italic> and <italic>Heyl</italic> are effector genes of canonical Notch signaling in MuSCs. In muscle-injury experiments, Hey1-KO and HeyL-KO mice showed normal muscle-regeneration ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukada et al., 2011</xref>); however, in overloaded muscle, HeyL-KO mice exhibited impaired cell proliferation, which resulted in a decreased number of new myonuclei during muscle hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These results strongly support the notion that the MuSC-proliferation mechanism in the overload model differs from that in the injury model. This study did not yield direct evidence indicating active Notch signaling in MuSCs in overloaded muscle, because real-time imaging of Notch signaling is challenging. However, the following results suggested that Notch signaling was activated in proliferating MuSCs of overloaded muscle at 4 days after tenotomy (when MuSCs proliferate actively): 1) in addition to <italic>Heyl</italic>, proliferating MuSCs expressed Notch-related genes and <italic>Col5a1</italic>, <italic>Col5a3</italic>, and <italic>Col6a1</italic>, which are direct target genes associated with canonical Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baghdadi et al., 2018</xref>); and 2) MuSCs proliferated on myofibers, which are presumed to express Notch ligands. If active Notch signaling is responsible for the sustained expression of <italic>Heyl</italic> via Rbp-J, a key question that remains unanswered is how MuSCs suppress <italic>Hey1</italic> expression. Although RNA-seq data strongly suggested active Notch signaling in the overloaded MuSCs, we cannot exclude the possibility that Notch signaling is inactive in proliferating MuSCs, and that a Notch-independent mechanism induces <italic>Heyl</italic> expression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence indicating that expression of Notch effector genes is differentially regulated in MuSCs. Elucidation of the detailed mechanisms by which <italic>Hey1</italic> and <italic>Heyl</italic> expression are regulated will promote an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of MuSC proliferation during muscle hypertrophy.</p><p>Exercise-induced muscle damage are reportedly involved in skeletal muscle hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Damas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schoenfeld, 2012</xref>). Because MuSCs are indispensable for repairing damaged myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lepper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>), MuSCs are likely involved in cases of exercise that produces substantial damage to myofibers. Our experimental methods involved tenotomy, which causes less damage than SA. Additionally, we used isolated single myofibers in order to allow examination of MuSCs on undamaged myofibers. We found that almost all overloaded myofibers harbored proliferating MuSCs rather than quiescent MuSCs, suggesting that even if local injury had occurred, the locally injured areas were not responsible for the MuSC activation and proliferation observed here. Collectively, our results demonstrated that MuSCs could become activated and proliferate and ultimately supply new nuclei, even in environments producing minimal myofiber damage, indicating that substantial damage is unnecessary for MuSC activation/proliferation in hypertrophic muscles.</p><p>Our results showed that in overloaded muscle, fewer proliferating MuSCs were present in HeyL-KO mice than in control mice, because the MuSCs were directed toward differentiation; however, the percentage of total Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells among MuSCs in HeyL-KO mice was similar to that in control mice, which suggests that MuSC activation was unaffected by the absence of <italic>Heyl</italic>. This result suggested that MuSCs require activation/proliferation-inducing factors; however, the mechanisms underlying MuSC activation from the quiescent state in overloaded muscle remain unclear. Muscle-derived nitric oxide-stimulated secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) from the extracellular matrix is a potential pathway for MuSC activation/proliferation in overloaded muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Pilipowicz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tatsumi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamada et al., 2008</xref>). Using mice in which the HGF receptor (c-Met) was specifically deleted in MuSCs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Webster and Fan (2013)</xref> showed that HGF-specific signaling did not affect MuSC activation/proliferation in an injury model. However, compared with the hypertrophy model, the injury model could potentially involve several complementary factors that contribute to MuSC activation/proliferation; consequently, the contribution of HGF might be obscured in the injury model. Therefore, MuSC-specific c-Met-deleted mice could potentially exhibit defects in MuSC activation and proliferation in overloaded muscle.</p><p>Even in overloaded muscle, inflammation is a candidate pathway for inducing MuSC activation and proliferation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mackey et al. (2007)</xref>Â reported that treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (inhibitors of synthesis of prostaglandins, including PGE2) suppressed MuSC activity in overloaded human muscle. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ho et al. (2017)</xref> showed that PGE2 promotes MuSC proliferation in an injury mouse model. In the present study, we observed no marked increase in macrophage number at 2 days after tenotomy, when some MuSCs were already activated, which suggests that macrophage infiltration is no required for MuSC activation in overloaded muscle. At 4 days after tenotomy, macrophage number was only slightly increased (data not shown), although their number at this stage is already extremely high in an injury model. Macrophage-depletion models could help ascertain whether MuSCs require inflammation for their proliferation in an undamaged overloaded muscle.</p><p>Additionally, a mechanical stimulus could provide insight into a possible pathway for MuSC activation/proliferation in overloaded muscle. In developing myofibers, mechanical-stimulus-dependent Yap1 activation induces the expression of a Notch1 ligand, Jag2, which maintains the pool of myogenic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Esteves de Lima et al., 2016</xref>). Whether Yap1 is activated in MuSCs in response to mechanical stimuli remains unclear; however, the possibility exists that mechanical overload directly promotes the transition of MuSCs from the quiescent state and induces their proliferation. Investigation of these possibilities in future studies will support acquisition of a comprehensive understanding of the behaviors of MuSCs in overloaded muscle in which non-lethal damage to myofibers has occurred.</p><p>Because the ratio of myofiber nuclear content to myofiber mass remains constant during hypertrophy (known as the myonuclear domain theory), addition of new myonuclei derived from MuSCs is considered essential for increasing muscle mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheek et al., 1965</xref>). However, using a MuSC-depleted model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McCarthy et al. (2011)</xref> showed that MuSCs play dispensable roles in muscle hypertrophy at an early stage of the hypertrophy. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Egner et al. (2016)</xref> argued against this finding by presenting results demonstrating that plantaris muscle fails to undergo overload-induced hypertrophy in the absence of MuSCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al. (2013)</xref> reported that neuronal nitric oxide synthase was rapidly activated (within 3 min) by overload induced using tenotomy, and that this stimulation eventually triggered the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, which is a recognized protein-synthesis pathway. In the present study, HeyL-KO mice showed no difference in muscle weight relative to control mice at 1 week after tenotomy, when increased myofiber size was already observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2013</xref>). However, the loss of <italic>Heyl</italic> affected both muscle weight and myofiber size at 9 weeks after SA. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fry et al. (2014)</xref> noted that the absence of MuSCs affected the late stage (8 weeks) of SA-induced muscle hypertrophy. Collectively, the results of the present study indicated that the early stage of muscle hypertrophy does not require MuSCs, but that the addition of new MuSC-derived myonuclei was responsible for long-term increases in myofiber mass.</p><p>In summary, our findings reveal an essential mechanism underlying MuSC proliferation during muscle hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Identification of factors and mechanism that induce MuSC activation/proliferation under HeyL expression could lead to the development of MuSC-based therapeutic strategies for muscle-wasting

Functional overloading of plantaris muscle was induced as described in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, a midline incision was made in the skin on the hindlimbs, and the distal tendons of both gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were transected (tenotomy). In the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the overloading of plantaris muscle was induced by excising the distal half of both the gastrocnemius and the soleus (i.e., SA was performed). The incision was closed using a 7â0 silk suture (Matsuda Ika Kogyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). For the sham-operated group, similar incisions were made in the skin, but the tendons were not transected. Muscle weights were normalized against body weights.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Muscle-injury model</title><p>Muscle regeneration was induced by injecting 10 Î¼M CTX (Latoxan, Valence, France) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into the tibialis anterior muscle (50 Î¼l).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Muscle fixation and histologic analysis</title><p>Isolated plantaris or tibialis anterior muscles were frozen in liquid-nitrogen-cooled isopentane (Wako Pure Chemicals Industries, Osaka, Japan) for 1 min and then placed on dry ice for 1 hr to vaporize the isopentane.

For embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMyHC) staining, sections were fixed with cooled acetone for 10 min at â20Â°C. Detailed information on antibodies used in this study is provided in Key Resource Table. For mouse anti-Pax7 and -eMyHC staining, a M.O.M. kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, VT, USA) was used to block endogenous mouse IgG before reacting with the primary antibodies.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including a guest Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as Senior Editor.

It remains an open question how much from injury-model can be applied to more physiological settings. Unexpectedly, the authors find different features in the overloading model â specifically, the stem cells are activated / proliferate / fuse while <italic>MyoD</italic> is weakly induced. Mechanistically, one of the Notch pathway targets, <italic>HeyL</italic>, is sustained in overload model, which in turn might suppress <italic>MyoD</italic>. Loss of <italic>HeyL</italic> decreases stem cell activation and fusion in the overload model, and the authors interpret that accumulation of <italic>MyoD</italic> forces the stem cells to differentiate. Overall, this is a potentially interesting paper trying to address an important question. However, there are some unclear points and potentially alternative explanations about what the authors are observing. Additional experiments are needed in order to substantiate the conclusions.</p><p>Major concern:</p><p>The interpretation that <italic>HeyL</italic> KO mouse fails to induce <italic>MyoD</italic> is ambiguous. In CTX injury model, both <italic>HeyL</italic>/Hey1 goes down leading to an stronger <italic>MyoD</italic> induction. An alternative explanation is that all the pathways are just less strongly activated in the overload model compared to injury â not necessarily that there is a completely different mechanism of activation. Indeed, the extent of stem cell number increase is small in overload compared to injury (Figure 1D). This could be the reason why <italic>MyoD</italic> induction is also weaker. Further, Hey1 might be just a less efficient target of Rbpj, and that could be the reason why only Hey1 is down-regulated while <italic>HeyL</italic> is sustained. In this point of view, it would be much more convincing if the authors could perform unbiased transcriptome analysis of the stem cells in injury versus overload, and show that there are actually a group of genes that goes up in overload model.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript is well written, interesting and timely and might help find a new mode of activation of satellite cells in the absence of aggressive muscle damage such as cardiotoxin-induced injury. We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors mentioned that <italic>MyoD</italic>- MuSCs undergo cell proliferation during muscle overloading within the intact myofibers. However, this data is still missing. Please show <italic>MyoD</italic>, EdU and laminin staining, and possibly in combination with Pax7 in overloaded muscle sections. Especially, the authors should analyze time course-dependent kinetics of MuSC activation, entering cell cycle and exiting cell cycle, and fusion to intact myofibers during muscle overloading. This data will confirm that MuSC located underneath the basal lamina can enter cell cycle and contribute to myonuclei during overloading. Similar immunodetection should be performed for overloaded muscle sections in <italic>HeyL</italic> KO mice.</p><p>2) &quot;importantly, at 4 days after tenotomy, the percentage of Pax7+Ki67+ cells among Pax7+ cells (~70%) was higher than that of Pax7+<italic>MyoD</italic>+ cells (~35%), which suggested that most of these MuSCs proliferated in the absence of <italic>MyoD</italic> expression.&quot; This statement is a gross oversimplification, since it is unclear whether the majority of Pax7+Ki67+ cells are proliferating. Maybe only half are cycling?</p><p>3) Subsection âProliferation of MuSCs during muscle hypertrophyâ, last paragraph: These results suggested that MuSC proliferation does not occur in a restricted area of the overloaded myofibers and that almost all myofibers respond to the overload, which awakens MuSCs from quiescence. Again the authors use Ki67 expression as synonym with proliferation- which it is not. It is an indication that cells are not quiescent.</p><p>4) In Figure 3, <italic>Hes1</italic> expression should be included since MuSC can express <italic>Hes1</italic> according to the publication (Lahmann et al., 2019).</p><p>5) Changes in gene expression in the overload model. Only <italic>Hey/HeyL</italic> and a couple of collagen genes are tested. Please provide a rational for selecting these collagens. The authors should analyze a broader set of Notch target genes and other myogenic markers. Best would be to provide RNAseq data, or at least a broad set of Notch target genes including more members of the Hes/Hey family, Notch ligands and receptors, <italic>MyoD</italic> and other myogenic transcription factors (<italic>Myf5</italic> etc.). Please provide SEM / error bars for experiment Figure 3B and C.</p><p>6) The finding suggests that MuSCs proliferate under activation of canonical Notch signaling in the overload mouse model and that MuSCs lose Hey1 expression despite Notch signaling being active. This is an over-interpretation of the scarce data provided. The fact that one gene (<italic>HeyL</italic>) is upregulated provides no evidence that Notch signaling is active. The authors could equally argue that Notch signaling is absent since Hey1 is downregulated.</p><p>7) Figure 4: The effects of the <italic>HeyL</italic> mutations on Ki67 and <italic>MyoD</italic> expression are mild; the ratio of <italic>MyoD</italic>+/<italic>MyoD</italic>- cells is larger but extremely variable; it would be nice if n could be increased in this experiment.</p><p>8) Subsection âSupply of new myonuclei is diminished in <italic>HeyL</italic>-KO-mouse overloaded muscleâ: Approximately 20 or 60 myonuclei were labeled per cross-section from control/Hey1-KO mice at 4 or 7 days after surgery. The quantification of this is unclear since the muscle diameter might be highly variable depending on the section: please quantify not per cross-section but per myofiber or per 100 myofiber nuclei.</p><p>9) Figure 5B â In the <italic>HeyL</italic> KO image, there are a lot of EdU positive nuclei that are not assigned as myonuclei.

Since <italic>MyoD</italic> staining in sections is sometimes difficult to judge, we mainly analyzed MuSCs with single myofiber technique. In revised Figure 3, we added results indicating proliferating Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells beneath the basal lamina. To describe the kinetics of MuSC behavior, we added the following information obtained during muscle overload:</p><p>During activation (day 2), ~10% of MuSCs were Ki67<sup>+</sup> (Figure 1E), and EdU<sup>+</sup>Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells were not detected (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B), indicating that MuSCs were initially activated at day 2 after tenotomy.</p><p>During MuSC proliferation (days 4â7), ~50% to 70% and a half of MuSC were Ki67<sup>+</sup> (Figure 1E) and EdU<sup>+</sup>, respectively (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B), indicating that MuSCs proliferated between 4 and 7 days after tenotomy.</p><p>Upon exit of cell cycle/fusion (days 4â14), EdU<sup>+</sup> myonuclei were detected at 4 days after tenotomy, and this number gradually increased until 14 days after tenotomy (Figure 5C and Figure 7âfigure supplement 1C). These results indicated that MuSCs exited from the cell cycle and fused with myofiber over a long period of time. Results from <italic>HeyL</italic>-KO mice are shown in Figure 5C.</p><p>Therefore, compared to regenerating muscle, vigorous proliferation and differentiation occurred simultaneously in overloading muscle. This result explains the attenuated number of MuSCs in overloaded muscle based on the decreased accumulation of proliferating MuSCs. Furthermore RNA-seq data indicated simultaneous expression of cell cycle-related genes and <italic>myogenin</italic>.</p><p>At 14 days after tenotomy, we rarely detected Ki67<sup>+</sup> MuSCs (Figure 1E). Additionally, the number of MuSCs was similar to that in sham muscle (Figure 1D), indicating that these MuSCs returned to a quiescent state at 14 days after tenotomy.</p><p>Moreover, all Pax7<sup>+</sup>EdU<sup>+</sup> cells were located beneath the basal lamina, including in <italic>HeyL</italic>-KO mice. The frequency of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>HeyL</italic>-KO mice was similar to that in control mice. On the other hand, the number of MuSCs was reduced in <italic>HeyL</italic>-KO mice (Figure 4E), indicating that the reduced number of new myonuclei resulted from impaired MuSC proliferation but not activation.</p><p>The following was added to the revised manuscript:</p><p>âBased on our results, the kinetics of MuSC behavior in overloaded muscle also differ from those in regenerating muscles (Figure 7A; Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A). âfigure supplement[â¦] RNA-seq data supported this model based on elevated expression of both cell cycle-related genes and <italic>myogenin</italic> in overloaded MuSCs.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) &quot;importantly, at 4 days after tenotomy, the percentage of Pax7+Ki67+ cells among Pax7+ cells (~70%) was higher than that of Pax7+MyoD+ cells (~35%), which suggested that most of these MuSCs proliferated in the absence of MyoD expression.&quot; This statement is a gross oversimplification, since it is unclear whether the majority of Pax7+Ki67+ cells are proliferating.
