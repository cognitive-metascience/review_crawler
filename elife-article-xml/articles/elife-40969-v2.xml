For example, bacteria can secrete chromatin modifiers or proteins such as methyltransferases that cause chromatin silencing in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshida et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rolando et al., 2013</xref>). As an early example, we discovered that the silent secondary metabolite (SM) gene cluster for orsellinic acid (<italic>ors</italic>) in the filamentous fungus <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> is activated upon physical interaction with the bacterium <italic>Streptomyces rapamycinicus</italic>. The interaction of the fungus with this distinct bacterium led to increased acetylation of histone H3 lysines 9 and 14 at the <italic>ors</italic> gene cluster and thus to its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schroeckh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nützmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nützmann et al., 2013</xref>).

In order to obtain a holistic view on the fungal-bacterial interaction that, in the future, might allow predicting interaction partners and discovering the molecular elements involved, we developed a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq analysis specifically during co-cultivation. This led to the discovery of major alterations of epigenetic marks in the fungus triggered by the bacterium and to the identification of BasR as key regulatory node required for linking bacterial signals with the regulation of SM gene clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide profiles of H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> change upon co-cultivation with <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic></title><p><italic>A. nidulans</italic> with and without <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> was analyzed by genome-wide ChIP-seq for enrichment of acetylated (ac) histone H3 at lysines K9 and K14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; Appendix 1 – Details of ChIP analysis).

Some areas, such as a region in the first half of chromosome four, were particularly enriched in these acetylation marks, potentially indicating distinctive acetylation islands, which are short loci with continuous enrichment of histone modifications. Such islands have been identified previously in the intergenic and transcribed regions of the human genome, and some of these have been shown to colocalize with known regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roh et al., 2005</xref>). An island that is particularly enriched for H3K9ac was found around the <italic>ors</italic> gene cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and 2</xref>), thus supporting our previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nützmann et al., 2011</xref>).

In particular, the promoter region of the genes <italic>orsD</italic> and <italic>orsA</italic> showed reduced nucleosome occupancy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This could be due to a redistribution of nucleosomes that ultimately changes the distribution of histone marks. Such nucleosome rearrangements might represent the prevailing driver of H3K14ac change which is associated with a reduction in overall acetylation level. This might explain the local H3K14ac decrease at the translation start sites (TSSs) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>. In comparison to the changes to H3K14ac, the changes to H3K9 acetylation levels are stronger, leading to an increase in H3K9 acetylation despite nucleosome rearrangements. This finding is supported by the observation that unmodified H3 was depleted throughout the <italic>ors</italic> cluster, especially at the <italic>orsA</italic> and <italic>orsD</italic> TSSs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40969.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Normalized read counts derived from differential chromatin state (DCS) analysis obtained for the <italic>ors</italic> genes based on H3, H3K14ac and H3K9ac ChIP-seq.</title><p>Data were generated for the area 500 bp down- and 1000 bp upstream of the TSSs.

This formed the basis for a quantitative comparison between monocultures and co-cultures using standard read-counting methods for sequencing data (see 'Materials and methods'). Throughout this study, we refer to this method as differential chromatin state (DCS) analysis. The second analysis was based on a first round of peak-calling and subsequent quantification of the peaks. Comparison of the generated data sets showed 84 ± 1.7% similarity. The data obtained from the gene-based DCS method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were used for both further analyses and comparisons of the culture conditions using a false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off of 0.01. This does not include further filtering on the log-fold changes (LFCs) to capture the possible biological relevance of the detected changes. Quality and the absence of possible biases introduced by the co-culture or other sources were further investigated by MA plots.

Most of them (18 genes) showed significantly higher acetylation in co-culture, whereas only four genes had lower acetylation. Among the genes with increased acetylation in co-culture were <italic>cpcA</italic>, coding for the central transcriptional activator of the cross-pathway control CpcA, as well as the bZIP transcription factor gene <italic>jlbA</italic> (<italic>j</italic>un-<italic>l</italic>ike <italic>b</italic>ZIP).

We examined the transcription profiles of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> with and without <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic>, and compared it to those of the <italic>basR</italic> overexpression strain with and without the addition of doxycycline. Obvious candidate gene clusters, regulated by BasR, were the eight differentially acetylated gene clusters found in the ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Five of the eight differentially acetylated SM gene clusters, namely the <italic>dba</italic>, <italic>cic</italic>, <italic>eas</italic> and microperfuranone gene clusters, were also differentially transcribed in response to the streptomycete as well as in the <italic>basR</italic> overexpression strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), emphasizing the importance of BasR in bacteria-induced secondary metabolite regulation.

In an attempt to characterize the general distribution of nucleosomes and acetylation marks over the genome, we compared the intensity of chromatin states with gene density. A lower gene density was typically found in heterochromatic regions such as the centromeres and telomeres, creating a repressing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allshire and Ekwall, 2015</xref>). We found reduced H3 occupancy in heterochromatic regions, indicating either replacement of H3 by the centromere-specific H3 CENP-A or reduced nucleosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allshire and Ekwall, 2015</xref>).</p><p>We observed distinct peaks for H3K9ac in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> grown in co-culture with <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic>. One of the areas with the greatest increase in H3K9ac was the <italic>ors</italic> gene cluster, nicely confirming our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nützmann et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Furthermore, previous ChIP qRT-PCR experiments indicated a distinct increase of H3K9ac inside the cluster borders, which did not expand to neighboring genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nützmann et al., 2011</xref>). By contrast, the H3K14ac modification seemed to be of a more global nature and not exclusively confined to specific regions such as the <italic>ors</italic> gene cluster. These conclusions were extended here by the pattern detected in the genome-wide ChIP-seq data, which showed no spreading of H3K9ac to genes adjacent to the <italic>ors</italic> gene cluster, thereby demonstrating the quality of the genome-wide ChIP data generated here. Furthermore, these results are also consistent with our previous finding of reduced expression of SM cluster genes as a consequence of the lack of H3K14 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nützmann et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to H3K14ac, H3K9ac is less uniformly distributed over the genome. It only showed strong enrichment in the promoters of certain genes. Especially high levels of acetylation were found at <italic>orsA</italic> and in the bidirectional promoters of <italic>orsD</italic> and <italic>orsE</italic>. This observation was recently confirmed by the finding that H3ac and H3K4me3 were increased at the <italic>orsD</italic> gene only when the <italic>ors</italic> cluster was transcriptionally active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gacek-Matthews et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40969.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of <italic>S. rapamycinicus – A. nidulans</italic> interaction.</title><p>Co-cultivation leads to activation of the <italic>basR</italic> gene.

For H3K9, an enrichment of acetylation ~500 bp downstream of the TSSs as well as immediately upstream of the TSSs was observed. This was expected as similar results were obtained with an antibody targeting the acetylated N-terminus of histone H3 in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gacek-Matthews et al., 2016</xref>) and in other fungi such as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haynes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mews et al., 2014</xref>). Increased acetylation coincides with reduced levels of H3 around the TSSs, which are most probably due to a depletion of nucleosomes at the promoter. The profile plots for H3K14 acetylation are similar, although not as highly enriched around the TSSs as those for H3K9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5 a</xref>). As expected, a comparison of LFCs for both modifications showed high similarity, suggesting that the modifcations are established interdependently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gacek and Strauss, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Waters et al., 2015</xref>). At the 3’ end of the ORF, H3 density drastically increased accompanied by reduced levels of H3K9ac and H3K14ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). Likewise, reduced acetylation at the TTSs was observed in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gacek-Matthews et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mews et al., 2014</xref>). It is interesting to notice that the increase in nucleosome density directly correlated with a decrease in the gene expression rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6e</xref>). Previous studies suggested a direct correlation between the presence of nucleosomes and the stalling of RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grosso et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Increased gene expression directly correlates with histone H3K9 acetylation</title><p>Acetylation is generally regarded as an activating chromatin mark that promotes the transcription of eukaryotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011</xref>). Our study suggests a more differentiated picture. When we compared data from this study with microarray data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nützmann et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">4</xref>), the acetylation of H3K9 directly correlated with gene expression levels. A similar finding was reported for other fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wiemann et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, this was not observed for the acetylation of H3K14. This could partly result from the low number of targets for this modification. By contrast, gene promoters showed a distinct increase of H3K14ac at the TSSs in dependence on the average transcription level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6c</xref>). The low correlation between active gene transcription and acetylation at H3K14 confirmed earlier results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reyes-Dominguez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nützmann et al., 2011</xref>). Previously, we showed that a mimicry of a hypo-acetylated lysine 14 on histone H3 drastically altered the phenotype and the expression of SM gene clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nützmann et al., 2013</xref>). This effect was overcome, however, when later time points of cultivation were considered. Taken together, the primary location at the TSSs and the major defect in SM production at earlier stages indicate a role for H3K14ac in transcriptional initiation. Hyper-acetylation at H3K14 could be also relevant for marking active genes and providing a docking site for regulatory proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title><italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> silences fungal nitrogen metabolism</title><p>A substantial number of genes that are involved in primary and secondary nitrogen metabolism were strongly depleted for H3K9ac upon co-cultivation with<italic> S. rapamycinicus</italic>. This correlated with reduced expression of the respective genes.

This was in fact observed for the intracellular concentration of amino acids in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> when the fungus was co-cultured with the bacterium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix—figure 7</xref>). Thus, in presence of <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> but not of non-inducing streptomycetes such as <italic>S. lividans</italic> the fungus is in a physiological state of nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Nitrogen limitation has been shown before to represent a trigger for the activation of a number of SM gene clusters including the <italic>ors</italic> gene cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scherlach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Studt et al., 2012</xref>). Nitrogen starvation also activates the expression of the anthrone (<italic>mdp</italic>) gene cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scherlach et al., 2011</xref>), which we also observed in our data. However, induction of orsellinic acid production by nitrogen starvation took about 60 hr, whereas co-cultivation with <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> had already triggered expression of the cluster genes after 3 hr. Therefore, it is unlikely that the bacteria-triggered activation of the cluster is exclusively achieved by restricting nitrogen availability for the fungus. Furthermore, shortage of nitrogen leads to de-repression of genes that are involved in the usage of secondary nitrogen sources, which was not supported by our data. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, it has been reported that a shift from growth under nutrient sufficiency to nitrogen starvation induced the degradation of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eiyama et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, decreased acetylation and transcription of genes with mitochondrial function were also detected upon contact of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> with the bacterium. This was further supported by a lower mitochondrial respiratory activity in the fungal cells during co-cultivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>BasR is a central regulatory node for integrating bacterial signals leading to regulation of SM gene clusters</title><p>Another consequence of nitrogen starvation is the reduced availability of amino acids in the cell. Consequently, as shown here, the amino-acid biosynthetic pathways represented a major group of de-regulated genes at both the acetylation and expression levels. Amino-acid biosyntheses in fungi are regulated by the CPC system upon starvation for distinct amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tudzynski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krappmann and Braus, 2005</xref>).

In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, other regulators such as the heterodimeric transcription factor complex Bas1p/Bas2p, which is even bound by Gcn5p, have also been shown to induce the CPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valerius et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daignan-Fornier and Fink, 1992</xref>).

This might be due to the fact that the available genome data lack the <italic>basR</italic> gene due to missing annotation or, alternatively, because a different regulatory response mechanism to <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> is present in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>.</p><p>Genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis also indicated that the interaction of <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> with <italic>A. nidulans</italic> influenced other SM gene clusters and leads to a downregulation of the fungal nitrogen metabolism (Figure 3 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which might be regulated via BasR.

The <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> NRRL 5491 genome was obtained from NCBI (GI 521353217). Both genomes were concatenated to a fused genome which served as the reference genome for subsequent mapping. Raw ChIP-seq reads were obtained using FastQC v0.11.4. Trimming and filtering were achieved by applying Trim Galore utilizing Illumina universal adapter and phred +33 encoding. Reads were not de-duplicated because the duplication rate was &lt;15% for most libraries. Bowtie2 (version 2.2.4) using default parameters was employed to map reads to the fused genome. Quantification of reads was carried out using the Bioconductor 'GenomicAlignments’ package forming the basis for three subsequent approaches. First, a genome-wide equi-spaced binning across the genome with different resolutions (50 k and 2 k bp bins) counting reads overlapping each bin was applied. Library normalization on bin counts was performed by only considering reads mapping to the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> genome. Second, reads overlapping genes were counted, using the AspGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerqueira et al., 2014</xref>) annotation. They formed the basis for the subsequent DCS analysis (see below).

significant proportion of co-incubated library reads originated from <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic>. A fused genome concatenating the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> and the <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> genomes was generated. About 90-98% of the reads mapped against the fused genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), which suggested a high quality of sequencing data. This assumption was confirmed by examining the quality of libraries using FastQC (data not shown). As indicated, the coverage was substantially higher on the <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> genome with only ~20 % mapping to the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> genome (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Expectedly, this ratio has shifted considerably towards the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> genome for histone targeting ChIP libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) going up from 20 % to around 90 % for all H3, H3K9 and H314 libraries validating correct antibody enrichment as <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> is devoid of histones. However around 10 % of reads were still mapping to the <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> genome which might be due to imperfect antibody specificity. Coverage depth deviations were accounted for by only considering reads originating from <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. This allowed for calculation of library size factors used for library normalization. To assess antibody specificity, we calculated the fraction of reads mapping to mitochondria, which do not contain histones. The control library amounted to about 0.25 % of reads as opposed to about 0.01– 0.03 % for H3, H3K9ac, H3K14ac libraries constituting a 10-fold enrichment. As a background control we used ChIP material obtained from anti-FLAG-tag antibody precipitates of a non-tagged fungal wild-type strain co-cultivated under the same conditions with <italic>S. rapamycinicus.</italic></p><p>We quantified the relative library proportions which amounted to 8–17 % of H3, H3K14ac and H3K9ac as well as up to ~65 % for background reads of co-incubated libraries mapped to <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). However, the background read proportions might not necessarily reflect actual gDNA ratios of both species in the co-cultivation due to various potential biases. To examine read distribution for each library, we counted mapped reads within equally spaced bins along the fused genome for different resolutions (see methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). As expected, background reads (upper panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) were evenly distributed across the genome reflecting nonspecific targeting of particular areas. The fused genome further enabled for controlling correct co-incubation conditions since no reads should be mapping to <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> in non-co-incubated samples as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> in the right panels (blue lines). The co-incubated samples exhibit an increased coverage in the middle of the <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> genome which might be due to sequence biases or enriched DNA caused by the replication origin (<italic>oriC</italic>) located in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jakimowicz et al., 1998</xref>). Further, there were coverage dips in the middle of the fungal chromosomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), which were most likely due to incomplete assembly around the centromeres. They are characterized by long ‘N’ stretches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ekblom and Wolf, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s7-2"><title>Changes of H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation profiles in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> in response to <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic></title><p>As reported in the manuscript, the genome-wide H3K9 and H3K14 chromatin landscape of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> were determined. There was also a drop-off in all libraries at the chromosome arms, which was most likely caused by the bordering bins being shorter and therefore they account for less reads. Since gene density also varies across the genome (lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), we addressed the question whether this correlates with the intensity of the investigated chromatin states. To this end, we calculated the spearman correlation to correlate read counts and gene counts among the 50k bins. As expected, there was almost no correlation between the background and the genes (r=0.09). However, for H3 we found it to be rather high (r=0.37) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>). Since the used bin size is large, this could point at global H3 occupancy to be higher for high gene density regions such as euchromatin and low H3 occupancy for heterochromatin. Noteworthy, the correlation between read and gene density was found to be lower for H3K14ac and H3K9ac (r=0.14 and 0.15 respectively), which might indicate a more subtle regulatory mechanism for those marks targeting individual genes as opposed to larger domains. Notably, the highest correlation was found between the two acetylation marks (r=0.53) hinting at some potential cross-talk or common regulation between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s7-3"><title>Chromatin profiles at translation start sites and translation termination sites</title><p>We assessed the location of H3K9ac, H3K14ac and histone H3 relative to promoters and gene bodies by plotting the average read count frequency for all genes to either the TSSs or TTSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Due to missing information about the 5’ and 3’ transcriptional start and stop sites, we used translational start and stop sites for transcription start and stop sites, respectively, as surrogates. The results obtained apply to both <italic>A. nidulans</italic> in mono- and co-culture with the bacterium. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan et al. (2010)</xref>, the peaks correspond to highly positioned nucleosomes relative to the TSSs with a nucleosome-free region (NFR) directly upstream of the TSS. H3K9ac and H3K14ac showed highest enrichment for the first and second nucleosomes up- and downstream of the TSS and drastic reduction downstream of the third nucleosome after the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). Reduced occupancy of unmodified histone H3 was observed at the TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan et al., 2010</xref>). Towards the 3’ end of genes, histone H3 occupancy gradually increased, which was accompanied by a decrease in acetylation. Plotting of differentially acetylated H3K9ac against H3K14ac showed a strong correlation between the localization of the two modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Acetylation is generally described as a transcription activating mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gacek and Strauss, 2012</xref>). To test for this general assumption we correlated our acetylation data to microarray data generated under the same condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nützmann et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). This allowed us to compare the log-fold changes (LFCs) of the differential chromatin states with the LFCs calculated from the RNA expression data. H3K9ac correlates with the differentially expressed genes with a coefficient of 0.5 in contrast to H3K14ac (-0.05) and histone H3 (-0.01) for which no detectable dependency was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref> shows the same trend, i.e., a correlation of 0.2 for gene expression changes <italic>versus</italic> H3K9ac changes. This finding was expected since the calculation included all genes most of which did not change. To determine the correlation of acetylation at the TSS and the TTS according to the grade of expression of the genes, we separated the differentially expressed genes into four quartiles (q1 lower 25 %, q2 the medium lower 25–50 %, q3 are the medium higher 50-75 %, q4 higher 25 %). The increase of acetylation at the TSS correlated with the expression level of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6a and c</xref>). Decreased expression coincided with an increase of histone H3 at the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s7-4"><title>Reduced intracellular amino acid concentration in response to the bacterium</title><p>The increased expression of <italic>cpcA</italic> and other genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis implied a reduced availability of amino acids in the cell upon bacterial-fungal co-cultivation. Therefore, we measured the internal amino acid pool in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> both grown in monoculture and with <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>). As an additional control and to further confirm the specificity of the interaction, the fungus was co-cultivated with <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic>, which does not induce the <italic>ors</italic> gene cluster. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>, significantly reduced levels of glutamine, histidine, phenylalanine, asparagine, threonine and reduced metabolism of arginine, which was supplemented to the medium, were observed.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work in its current form will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Nevertheless, we appreciate the topic and find the work in principle very interesting. Thus, if you choose not to send the work as is elsewhere, but rather revise the study, <italic>eLife</italic> would be prepared to review the work again. It would, however, be treated as a new submission, although we would try to retain the same reviewers.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents three connected &quot;stories&quot;. The first story is the generation of genome-wide H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation maps in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> in the absence and presence of the actinobacterium, <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic>. The second story is on the regulation of specific biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), where the authors focus again on the orsellinic BGC, which was the subject matter of three previous publications by the same group. The third story includes the truly novel part of the manuscript but unfortunately gets the least amount of space. This is the interesting finding that the (supposedly intimate) contact, shown in a previous paper, of the actinobacterium with <italic>Aspergillus hyphae</italic> somehow decrease the available nitrogen, causing an imbalance in amino acid uptake or utilization which triggers the &quot;General Control&quot; or &quot;Cross-Pathway Control&quot; system, regulated by Gcn4/CpcA- and Bas-type TFs. The authors argue that one of the putative Bas1-related TFs, now named BasR, is responsible for the bacterium-induced control.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In general, all reviewers were concerned about the novelty of this study as written and deliberated extensively on whether to &quot;reject&quot; or &quot;revise&quot;. In the first story, the novelty of the study lies in the genome-wide chromatin maps generated in the presence of the bacterium, whereas previously only small regions were studied. However, the general features of chromatin regulation by themselves (i.e., upregulation by increased H3K9ac and some increase in H3K14ac) are nothing new as similar studies have been done in other fungi (yeast, <italic>Fusarium</italic>), plants and animals, both in the presence or absence of stressors. In the second story, the connection between <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic>, acetylation, and orsellinic acid production has previously been reported, and the authors do not report incisive analyses on novel clusters. Instead they focus, quite unaccountably, on the one cluster that is down- instead of up-regulated (<italic>eas</italic>); so no new products are identified or characterized here. The third story, which has the potential to be the most novel, unfortunately gets the least amount of space and what the authors report is a phenomenological description of the pathway uncovered with no mechanistic studies other than genetic deletion analysis.</p><p>Thus, the reviewers' general recommendation is that the authors should focus their manuscript and substantially expand either the second story or the third story (in conjunction with the first). If the authors decide to expand the second story, they should describe the effects on novel BGCs and compounds. If the authors decide to expand on the third story, they should further describe the BasR pathway and how it may be activated.</p><p>1) The authors show that one of the putative Bas1-related TFs, now named BasR, is responsible for the bacterium-induced control but they completely disregard potential function of the second TF, <italic>AN8377</italic>, based on the apparently unchanged level of H3K9ac in the gene (which is not specifically shown). While <italic>AN7174</italic> (BasR) has very restricted distribution in fungi (although there seem to be homologs in <italic>Saprolegnia, Malassezia</italic> and <italic>Ustilago</italic>; also according to FungiDB), <italic>AN8377</italic> is the more wide-spread factor. The authors do not mention anything about this Myb/SANT domain protein and its function at all. What is shown is a phenomenological description of the pathway uncovered with no mechanistic studies other than genetic deletion analysis. For example, instead of using a rapamycin-deficient mutant of a <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species that presumably did not cause induction of Gcn5, why wasn't rapamycin simply added to the medium to test whether it was required to elicit the outcome (especially since yeast <italic>gcn5</italic> mutants are sensitive to rapamycin). Perhaps this had been done before but then the logic of the experiment with the mutant of an unrelated species is unclear. There is also not direct evidence for BasR regulating either the genes in amino acid metabolism affected by cross-pathway control or the final target genes in clusters, e.g. by binding to motifs in their promoters.</p><p>2) If the authors focus their manuscript on the identification of circuits that regulate amino acid availability in <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, they should give their manuscript a new title. &quot;Chromatin remodeling&quot; specifically refers to the movement of nucleosomes, either sliding, removal or replacement, by a group of large ATPases. The authors are discussing &quot;chromatin modifications&quot; by a lysine acetyltransferase. This is not the same thing as &quot;remodeling&quot;. These changes in modifications did not per se result in the identification of BasR, and that BasR directly &quot;regulates&quot; natural product biosynthesis also has not been shown, though it may very well affect this indirectly. Also, BasR is not novel, but distantly related to Bas1/2 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>3) The reviewers appreciate the authors wanting to get good ChIP data on this interaction which really is where the field needs to move. However, the pulldown with antibodies against histone should not pick up any bacterial DNA. Unfortunately, it brought down lots of bacterial DNA. One possibility is that their bacteria have something like Protein A, which would indiscriminately bind the IgG heavy chain. The &quot;fused genome&quot; designation is basically accounting for this contamination which has to have some impact on the results. The reviewers wonder if the authors could have mixed the fungus with cell fragments of the bacterium or some other method to reduce this contamination. The reviewers like the idea of DCA, but are not sure how one can use the data, because of the contamination from the bacterial DNA. We presume that the fungal information is still viable, but would worry that you're introducing biases in library prep, etc., especially when comparing to the fungal samples where 100% of the reads map to <italic>Aspergillus</italic>. More controls might help. Would this ChIP approach bring down bacterial contamination if other bacteria were used?

According to your general recommendation, we have expanded the story about the Myb-like transcription factor BasR (e.g. dependency on GcnE, regulation of other secondary metabolite gene cluster) and concurrently we condensed the part about the chromatin profiles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In general, all reviewers were concerned about the novelty of this study as written and deliberated extensively on whether to &quot;reject&quot; or &quot;revise&quot;. In the first story, the novelty of the study lies in the genome-wide chromatin maps generated in the presence of the bacterium, whereas previously only small regions were studied. However, the general features of chromatin regulation by themselves (i.e., upregulation by increased H3K9ac and some increase in H3K14ac) are nothing new as similar studies have been done in other fungi (yeast, Fusarium), plants and animals, both in the presence or absence of stressors. In the second story, the connection between S. rapamycinicus, acetylation, and orsellinic acid production has previously been reported, and the authors do not report incisive analyses on novel clusters. Instead they focus, quite unaccountably, on the one cluster that is down- instead of up-regulated (eas); so no new products are identified or characterized here. The third story, which has the potential to be the most novel, unfortunately gets the least amount of space and what the authors report is a phenomenological description of the pathway uncovered with no mechanistic studies other than genetic deletion analysis.</p><p>Thus, the reviewers' general recommendation is that the authors should focus their manuscript and substantially expand either the second story or the third story (in conjunction with the first). If the authors decide to expand the second story, they should describe the effects on novel BGCs and compounds. If the authors decide to expand on the third story, they should further describe the BasR pathway and how it may be activated.</p><p>1) The authors show that one of the putative Bas1-related TFs, now named BasR, is responsible for the bacterium-induced control but they completely disregard potential function of the second TF, AN8377, based on the apparently unchanged level of H3K9ac in the gene (which is not specifically shown). While AN7174 (BasR) has very restricted distribution in fungi (although there seem to be homologs in Saprolegnia, Malassezia and Ustilago; also according to FungiDB), AN8377 is the more wide-spread factor. The authors do not mention anything about this Myb/SANT domain protein and its function at all. What is shown is a phenomenological description of the pathway uncovered with no mechanistic studies other than genetic deletion analysis. For example, instead of using a rapamycin-deficient mutant of a Streptomyces species that presumably did not cause induction of Gcn5, why wasn't rapamycin simply added to the medium to test whether it was required to elicit the outcome (especially since yeast gcn5 mutants are sensitive to rapamycin). Perhaps this had been done before but then the logic of the experiment with the mutant of an unrelated species is unclear. There is also not direct evidence for BasR regulating either the genes in amino acid metabolism affected by cross-pathway control or the final target genes in clusters, e.g. by binding to motifs in their promoters.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer criticises two main aspects, to which we answer separately.</p><p>First – missing data regarding <italic>AN8377</italic>: Sequence analysis using Blast revealed two putative <italic>bas1</italic> orthologues in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> – <italic>AN8377</italic> and <italic>basR (AN7174</italic>). Based on our phylogenetic analysis (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) <italic>AN8377</italic> seems to be more similar to the yeast <italic>bas1</italic> than <italic>basR</italic>. Nevertheless, in contrast to <italic>basR, AN8377</italic> showed no changes in its acetylation pattern during fungal-bacterial co-cultivation (data were added to the subsection “The transcription factor BasR is the central regulatory node of bacteria-triggered SM gene cluster regulation”, first paragraph and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 legend). To further analyse a potential involvement, we generated an <italic>AN8377</italic> deletion strain. Cocultivation experiments with <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> revealed no impact of the presence of <italic>AN8377</italic> on the activation of the <italic>ors</italic> gene cluster (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Furthermore, we found <italic>basR</italic> to be involved in the activation of the cross-pathway control like the yeast <italic>bas1</italic> and that GcnE is probably needed for its expression. Therefore, we did not further investigate of <italic>AN8377</italic>.</p><p>Second – distribution of <italic>AN7174</italic> in fungi: Here, the reviewer is not entirely correct. The only fungal species containing a nearly complete <italic>AN7174</italic> homologue are <italic>Aspergillus versicolor</italic> (score 421/642 (69% )), <italic>Aspergillus sydowii</italic> (score 407/642 (66% )), <italic>Aspergillus calidoustus</italic> (score 355/642 (73% ))<italic>, Aspergillus ochraceoroseus</italic> (score 348/642 (71%))and <italic>Aspergillus rambellii</italic> (score 336/642 (66% )). In all other fungal species (<italic>e.g. Ustilago maydis, Malassezia globosa</italic>) the homologous region is restricted to the DNA-binding Myb domain, which is highly conserved in eukaryotes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) If the authors focus their manuscript on the identification of circuits that regulate amino acid availability in Aspergillus, they should give their manuscript a new title. &quot;Chromatin remodeling&quot; specifically refers to the movement of nucleosomes, either sliding, removal or replacement, by a group of large ATPases. The authors are discussing &quot;chromatin modifications&quot; by a lysine acetyltransferase. This is not the same thing as &quot;remodeling&quot;. These changes in modifications did not per se result in the identification of BasR, and that BasR directly &quot;regulates&quot; natural product biosynthesis also has not been shown, though it may very well affect this indirectly. Also, BasR is not novel, but distantly related to Bas1/2 in S. cerevisiae.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this hint. We changed the title accordingly to <bold>“</bold>Chromatin mapping identifies BasR as the regulatory node of bacteria-induced production of fungal secondary metabolites”. It is correct that, due to its relation to Bas1, BasR is not totally novel, as would not be any Myb-like transcription factor. However, to emphasise the relevance of BasR as a main regulator of natural product biosynthesis in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, we performed transcriptome analyses with a mutant strain overproducing BasR. Our data reveal that five of the eight secondary metabolite gene clusters differentially acetylated during fungal-bacterial cocultivation are also transcriptionally regulated by BasR. Based on our data the main differences between Bas1 of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and BasR of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> are the different structures of the proteins and the transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolite biosyntheses in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> and thus the regulatory outcome of their activities. Common to both is their involvement in the activation of the cross-pathway control system and the requirement of a functional Gcn5/GcnE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers appreciate the authors wanting to get good ChIP data on this interaction which really is where the field needs to move. However, the pulldown with antibodies against histone should not pick up any bacterial DNA. Unfortunately, it brought down lots of bacterial DNA. One possibility is that their bacteria have something like Protein A, which would indiscriminately bind the IgG heavy chain. The &quot;fused genome&quot; designation is basically accounting for this contamination which has to have some impact on the results. The reviewers wonder if the authors could have mixed the fungus with cell fragments of the bacterium or some other method to reduce this contamination. The reviewers like the idea of DCA, but are not sure how one can use the data, because of the contamination from the bacterial DNA. We presume that the fungal information is still viable, but would worry that you're introducing biases in library prep, etc., especially when comparing to the fungal samples where 100% of the reads map to Aspergillus. More controls might help. Would this ChIP approach bring down bacterial contamination if other bacteria were used? Maybe some focus on methods would be good to work out a cleaner result.</p></disp-quote><p>According to Supplementary file 3, the contamination only makes up to 8-16% of the reads. We are not sure if this qualifies as “lots of”. Anyway, this could be due to various reasons, most likely caused by antibody specificity. The chosen strategy to generate a fused genome accounts for a possible unspecificity by mapping possible contaminated reads to their corresponding genome. Such reads were then deliberately ignored for subsequent processing, most importantly for calculating the normalization factor, which ultimately only takes into account reads mapped to the fungal genome. In conclusion, this strategy reduces bias and enables the comparison of the fungal monoculture with the fungal-bacterial coculture in the best possible way. The success of the strategy becomes evident in Figure 1. The data of cultivations with presence of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> (green and blue lines) are perfectly superimposed to the <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sections but not the <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> section. The latter serves as a control. To underline this point further, we have generated MA plots (new Appendix 1—figure 2). They show that both conditions are very similar, with no obvious bias and the loess regressions align with the 0 line. For H3, almost no change is detectable; thus this this data serve as negative control.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Title: change &quot;the regulatory node&quot; to &quot;a key regulatory node&quot; since there are likely other regulatory nodes that contribute to S. rapaminicus-induced SM cluster activation (your data supports this hypothesis: 3/8 differentially acetylated SM gene clusters were not differentially transcribed in response to basR overexpression).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion, the title has been changed to “Chromatin mapping identifies BasR, a key regulator of bacteria-triggered production of fungal secondary metabolites”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The phylogenies of basR depicted on Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 look different.

Therefore, in Figure 6, we only showed proteins of the tree that are most similar to BasR, <italic>AN8377</italic> and Bas1. Now, in the caption of Figure 6 we also refer to the more extended tree shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) “The changes of H3K14ac in Figure 1 are therefore likely due to nucleosome rearrangements towards the translation start sites (TSS) rather than increased amounts of this modification”: Why does this hypothesis only apply to H3K14ac but not H3K9ac as well?</p></disp-quote><p>To explain this aspect, we added the following sentence to the Results: “Such nucleosome rearrangements might represent the prevailing driver of H3K14ac change because at the same time there is a lower overall acetylation level.

We could also show a positive correlation of higher gene expression with increased H3K9 acetylation. Analysis of the RNA-seq data of the <italic>basR</italic> overexpression strain revealed that BasR is not only involved in the transcriptional regulation of several secondary metabolite gene clusters, but also seems to be important for the observed downregulation of genes of the nitrogen metabolism. We have added the corresponding data to the manuscript (Supplementary file 4). The data emphasize the importance of BasR in transducing the bacterial signal(s) in the fungus. We found no influence of BasR on GcnE or other members of the Saga/Ada complex. This is not surprising since GcnE is not differentially expressed during the <italic>A. nidulans – S. rapamycinicus</italic> co-cultivation. We assume that the activity of GcnE is not transcriptionally regulated under the conditions applied in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 5: Here you illustrate the levels of expression of the ors cluster and basR, as well as the relative levels of the ors cluster products. You mention the &quot;leakiness&quot; of the tet<sup>On</sup> promoter, and we can see an increase in expression of basR grown without doxycycline. This level of expression looks similar to that in the co-culture, and yet do not see an increase above what is typically seen of the ors cluster. Do you have a hypothesis as to why this is?</p></disp-quote><p>It is true, that the difference of the <italic>basR</italic> gene expression between the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> – <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> co-cultivation and the non-induced <italic>basR</italic> overexpression is not high. However, in the latter we did not detect orsellinic acid or derivatives thereof (see Figure 5). This finding suggests that under low expression conditions we need an additional, yet unknown signal from the streptomycete. This appears not to be necessary anymore under artificial high BasR overexpression conditions when we see both high expression of <italic>ors</italic> genes and production of orsellinic acid and derivatives. The induction of the <italic>ors</italic> gene cluster in the induced <italic>tet</italic><sup>On</sup>-<italic>basR</italic> mutant is slower compared to that observed in the co-cultivation of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> with <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic>. In the wild type, the <italic>ors</italic> gene cluster is already highly expressed after 3 hours of co-cultivation, whereas the overexpression mutant needs six hours after induction by doxycycline to reach a comparable expression level. It is conceivable, that we missed the highest peak of <italic>basR</italic> expression at the analyzed time points. It is also likely that BasR is a member of a protein complex. Thus, overproduction of BasR can lead to a certain overproduction of orsellinic acid, but then other factors of the complex might become limiting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Subsection “The presence of BasR in fungal species allows forecasting the inducibility of ors-like gene clusters by S. rapamycinicus”: Earlier in the manuscript you mention the &quot;leakiness&quot; of the tet<sup>On</sup> promoter when overexpressing basR in A. nidulans. Is this the case in A. sydowii? If not, it would be really nice to see the loss of ors products in the co-culture of S. rapacycinicus and A. sydowii tet<sup>On</sup>-basR without doxycycline, demonstrating the conserved role of basR in the interaction of the two microbes.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, the used <italic>tet</italic><sup>On</sup>-system showed similar leakiness in <italic>A. sydowii</italic> and <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. Integrating gene constructs in <italic>A. sydowii</italic> by homologous recombination is very difficult. Therefore, the inducible <italic>tet</italic><sup>On</sup>construct was integrated ectopically into the genome (see Figure 6—figure supplement 3). Due to this ectopical integration cocultivated <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> and <italic>A. sydowii tet</italic><sup>On</sup>-<italic>basR</italic> would still lead to the production of orsellinic acid and derivatives even in the absence of doxycycline, since expression of the native <italic>basR</italic> in <italic>A. sydowii</italic> remains unaffected. However, we expect that this cultivation condition would bring the same outcome as in the <italic>A. nidulans tet</italic><sup>On</sup>-<italic>basR</italic> strain that has, of course, the <italic>tet</italic><sup>On</sup>-<italic>basR</italic> cassette integrated at the <italic>basR</italic> locus and thus replaced the endogenous <italic>basR</italic> gene. This is easily achievable in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>. As expected, cocultivation of the <italic>A. nidulans tet</italic><sup>On</sup>-<italic>basR</italic> strain with <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> in the absence of doxycycline did not lead to the production of any orsellinic acid (see Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) How was the anti-H3 antibody validated?

In our hands this H3 antibody does not work for ChIP. The same concern applies to the anti-H3K9ac and anti-H3K914ac antibodies; Active Motif 39161 does not show up as a validated ChIP antibody in either database, and no catalog number is given for the second antibody.</p></disp-quote><p>We have validated the anti-H3 antibody (ab1791) by comparing H3 ChIP efficiency for nucleosomes that were simultaneously mapped for nucleosome positioning.

Furthermore, the anti-histone H3 antibody was already used for chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> by the Strauss group in 2008 (Reyes-Dominguez et al., 2008), where it was used to calculate the ratio between acetylated H3 and total H3 of the bidirectional promoter of the <italic>prnD-prnB</italic> genes in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>.

Previously, this antibody was successfully used for ChIP analysis by our group (Nützmann et al., 2011). The anti-acetyl-histone H3 (Lys14) is a rabbit polyclonal antibody from Merck (07-353).

The intention of our model figure is to show all known factors involved in the <italic>S. rapamycinicus</italic> – <italic>A. nidulans</italic> interaction, with special emphasis on the BasR-regulated transcription of several secondary metabolite gene clusters, which is clearly supported by our data. We fully agree with the reviewer. At this stage, we cannot exclude that differential expression of the biosynthetic gene clusters is not directly controlled by binding of BasR to the promoters or by another transcription factor that is activated by BasR.

Based on these data, we found that the fungal chromatin landscape is drastically altered as a result of a functional interaction between the two organisms. We identified a fungal transcriptional regulator required for transducing the bacterial signal(s) which led to the activation of secondary metabolite gene clusters. We found that manipulation of the identified regulator is sufficient to phenocopy the effect of the bacterium on the fungus: overexpressing the corresponding <italic>basR</italic> gene activates orsellinic acid production in absence of the bacterium, while its deletion renders the fungus unable to receive the bacterial instructions and activate the silent SM cluster.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that the regulator is functionally conserved in other <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp., e.g. in <italic>Aspergillus sydowii</italic>, where we also observe the intimate bacterial-fungal interaction.
