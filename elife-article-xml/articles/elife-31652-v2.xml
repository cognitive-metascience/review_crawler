pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31652.001</object-id><p>The ESCRT machinery mediates reverse membrane scission. By quantitative fluorescence lattice light-sheet microscopy, we have shown that ESCRT-III subunits polymerize rapidly on yeast endosomes, together with the recruitment of at least two Vps4 hexamers. During their 3–45 s lifetimes, the ESCRT-III assemblies accumulated 75–200 Snf7 and 15–50 Vps24 molecules. Productive budding events required at least two additional Vps4 hexamers. Membrane budding was associated with continuous, stochastic exchange of Vps4 and ESCRT-III components, rather than steady growth of fixed assemblies, and depended on Vps4 ATPase activity. An all-or-none step led to final release of ESCRT-III and Vps4. Tomographic electron microscopy demonstrated that acute disruption of Vps4 recruitment stalled membrane budding. We propose a model in which multiple Vps4 hexamers (four or more) draw together several ESCRT-III filaments. This process induces cargo crowding and inward membrane buckling, followed by constriction of the nascent bud neck and ultimately ILV generation by vesicle fission.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) machinery mediates ‘reverse’ membrane budding in distinct but topologically related processes, including formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) in multivesicular bodies (MVBs), plasma-membrane repair and microvesicle formation, abscission in cytokinesis, budding of certain viruses, and nuclear membrane resealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Christ et al., 2017</xref>) as well as membrane deformation towards the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCullough et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>MVB formation depends on the hetero-multimers ESCRT-0, ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II, which capture ubiquitinated cargo on the endosomal limiting membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bilodeau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katzmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alam et al., 2004</xref>). Budding then requires recruitment of ESCRT-III heteropolymers and the type I AAA+ (<underline>A</underline>TPase <underline>a</underline>ssociated with a variety of cellular <underline>a</underline>ctivities) ATPase, Vps4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babst et al., 2002</xref>). In yeast cells, ESCRT-III includes a major structural component, Snf7, core subunits Vps2, Vps20, and Vps24, and accessory proteins Did2, Vps60 and Ist1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCullough et al., 2013</xref>). Interaction of Vps20 with ESCRT-II triggers membrane recruitment of Snf7, which in turn recruits Vps24 and Vps2. Vps2 recruits Vps4 to these filaments and together with Vps24 may also restrict Snf7 polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babst et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saksena et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Teis et al., 2010</xref>). In vitro, Snf7 alone or together with Vps2 and Vps24, forms curved filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Henne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mierzwa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schöneberg et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In cells, Vps4 forms a hexameric ring when recruited to ESCRT-III filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caillat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monroe et al., 2014</xref>). A Vps4 hexamer can unfold individual ESCRT-III subunits by ATP-dependent translocation through its central pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monroe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Su et al., 2017</xref>); in vitro, this process promotes disassembly of ESCRT-III polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). The N-terminus of Vps4 contains a ‘Microtubule Interacting and Trafficking’ (MIT) domain, which interacts with C-terminal ‘<underline>M</underline>IT <underline>i</underline>nteraction <underline>m</underline>otifs’ (MIM) on ESCRT-III subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Obita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007</xref>). Binding of MIT domains to these motifs, exposed in the assembled polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Obita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007</xref>), releases Vps4 auto-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Merrill and Hanson, 2010</xref>). Formation of ILVs requires coordinated interaction of Vps4 with MIMs of Vps2 and Snf7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adell et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Current understanding of how the ESCRT machinery promotes reverse membrane budding comes primarily from ensemble biochemical assays with purified components and from live-cell imaging experiments on HIV budding and on plasma-membrane and nuclear-envelop repair and abscission at the midbody using ectopic protein expression. Since ESCRT-III filaments can deform membranes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wollert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wollert and Hurley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schöneberg et al., 2017</xref>), it has been suggested that their assembly and/or disassembly provides the driving force for budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fabrikant et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiaruttini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wollert and Hurley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wemmer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mageswaran et al., 2015</xref>). Live cell imaging of mammalian cells overexpressing fluorescently tagged ESCRT-III and Vps4 showed that ESCRT-III arrived before Vps4 at the sites of HIV budding, during plasma membrane repair and at the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bleck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baumgärtel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prescher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jouvenet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guizetti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vietri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olmos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jimenez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raab et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Denais et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mierzwa et al., 2017</xref>). ESCRT-III and Vps4 are recruited to the midbody prior to abscission, but whether the recruitment is correlated remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mierzwa et al., 2017</xref>). These experiments did not achieve the required levels of sensitivity, or spatial and temporal resolution to trace the inherently rapid dynamics.</p><p>We have now capitalized on the resolution, speed, and noninvasive illumination of lattice light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LLSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref>) to study recruitment dynamics of Snf7, Vps24 and Vps4 at individual endosomal carriers imaged over the entire yeast cell volume. During their 3–45 s lifetimes, recruitment of these proteins appeared to be stochastic, but mutually correlated; a large fraction (60%) of the traces did not exceed 62, 33 and 48 molecules (8 hexamers) of Snf7-eGFP, Vps24-eGFP and Vps4-eGFP, respectively. Although non-productive events displayed similar recruitment dynamics, on average they only recruited 12 Vps4 molecules (2 hexamers). Vps4 was not needed to sustain ESCRT-III dynamics, but electron tomography showed that it was essential for ILV budding and scission. To explain how the coordinated activity of ESCRT-III and Vps4 can drive ILV formation, we propose that relatively short ESCRT-III filaments continuously assemble and disassemble. Rapid Vps4 hexamer formation, nucleated by ESCRT-III components, then bridges subunits from two or more ESCRT-III filaments, so that its ATP-dependent unfolding activity can pull (and potentially unfold) an ESCRT-III subunit threaded into its pore while remaining docked on another filament through its MIT domain. At early stages of vesicle formation, uncoordinated ATP-dependent activity of this kind promotes membrane bulging (ILV budding); at later stages, it facilitates membrane fission, release of ILVs and creation of MVBs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fluorophore tagged Vps4 and ESCRT-III subunits as probes of ESCRT activity on endosomes</title><p>We generated fluorophore tagged Snf7 and Vps24 subunits of ESCRT-III and Vps4, to track the dynamics of ILV biogenesis and MVB formation. Direct fusion of eGFP to the C-terminus of ESCRT-III subunits interferes with function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teis et al., 2008</xref>), probably because of incompatibility with the periodicity of ESCRT-III polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tang et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shen et al., 2014</xref>).

The expression levels of the fusion proteins were comparable to the untagged proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Direct fusion of eGFP to the C-terminus of Vps4 likewise affects function, because of the positions of the C-terminal helix in higher-order Vps4 assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scott et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Landsberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caillat et al., 2015</xref>). We added a 3xHA linker and integrated 3xHA-eGFP or 3xHA-mCherry at the C-terminus of endogenous Vps4 by homologous recombination. Subcellular fractionation showed that Vps4-3xHA-eGFP (Vps4-eGFP) was expressed as a full-length fusion protein at endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>).</p><p>Live-cell, wide-field fluorescence microscopy showed that expression of Snf7-eGFP alone blocked MVB sorting to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>), but not when it was co-expressed with endogenous Snf7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Inspection of the structure of Snf7-polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) suggests that Snf7-eGFP protomers need to be interspaced with at least 2 untagged Snf7 molecules to avoid steric clashes within the polymer. Vps24-eGFP, Vps4-eGFP and Vps4-mCherry could, however, fully replace the corresponding untagged proteins without compromising trafficking of mCherry-Cps1 or Mup1-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Moreover, wild-type cells expressing Snf7-eGFP along with untagged Snf7 could grow on canavanine, as could cells expressing Vps24-eGFP, Vps4-eGFP as expected for a fully functional MVB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2008</xref>), while the deletion mutants of any of these three proteins could not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Thus, we have shown that cells tolerate full replacement of Vps4 and Vps24 by their fluorescently tagged equivalents as well as expression of Snf7-eGFP co-expressed with its endogenous, untagged counterpart. Previous work has shown a ratio of Snf7 to Vps24 of about 3–6 in the membrane-bound fraction of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teis et al., 2008</xref>). The mean ratio of Snf7-eGFP to Vps24-eGFP measured by calibrated fluorescence intensity in the events studied here is about 1.4:1.

Formation of puncta required the ‘early ESCRTs’. Deletion of ESCRT-0 (Vps27), -I (Vps23), or -II (Vps36 or Vps22) left only a diffuse, cytosolic signal for ESCRT-III (Snf7-eGFP or Vps24-eGFP) or Vps4-eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Recruitment of Vps24-eGFP depended on Snf7, which in turn required Vps20, and deletion of any ESCRT-III core subunit (Vps20, Snf7, Vps24, Vps2) prevented accumulation of Vps4-eGFP in puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>).

Electron tomography showed directly the consequences of acute Vps4 depletion on ILVs and on the morphology of perivacuolar structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>). We subjected cells to high-pressure freezing 2, 10 and 120 min after adding rapamycin. Although ESCRT-III was still recruited, the number of ILVs per MVB decreased, while the number of MVBs with ILV buds did not increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). In contrast, after 10 min the number of endosomes lacking ILV buds increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). These observations suggest that ILV budding (e.g. membrane buckling) and scission stall when the cytosolic pool of Vps4 is reduced and that fusion of ‘older’ MVBs with the vacuole then leaves only empty, ‘younger’ MVBs, with incomplete buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). The timing for this sequence of events is consistent with our observation that Mup1-eGFP can reach the vacuole from the plasma membrane less than 15 min after methionine addition (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>), and with earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arlt et al., 2015</xref>) showing that alpha-factor also trafficked within 15 min from the plasma membrane to the vacuole. At the 120 min point, we found few endosomes with large budding structures and with very few ILVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>) or flat cisternal membrane stacks, reminiscent of class E compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Thus, abrupt loss of free Vps4 stalled ILV budding and scission even though the dynamic recruitment of ESCRT-III persisted. Similar results to the 120 min time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>) were observed under long-term conditions in cells expressing mutants of Snf7 and Vps2 unable to interact with Vps4 including the appearance of a small number of endosomes with large budding structures mostly devoid of ILVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adell et al., 2014</xref>). The outcome of these long-term steady-state perturbations could not, however, define the critical step(s) for which Vps4 was required. The most straightforward molecular interpretation of our new results is that several active Vps4 hexamers participate in a single budding and fission event and that an incomplete bud will stall if no more Vps4 can add.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Current models for ILV formation assume gradual accumulation of ESCRT-III proteins, followed by a burst of Vps4 at the end of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schöneberg et al., 2017</xref>). The models invoke the properties of ESCRT-III polymerization linked to a membrane surface as the driving force for membrane deformation; free energy input from ATP hydrolysis by Vps4 then re-sets the system by recycling the ESCRT-III components. Our live-cell imaging data are not consistent with this proposed sequence of events, nor are they easily reconciled with the assumption that ATP hydrolysis is needed only to complete the assembly-disassembly cycle. We summarize first our principal findings and then offer a possible alternative model.</p><p>First, appearance and disappearance of Snf7 and Vps4 at peripheral endosomes correlate, as do appearance and disappearance of Vps24 and Vps4. Therefore Snf7 and Vps24 must also correlate. Moreover, if Vps24 and Vps2 are recruited jointly, as earlier evidence suggests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babst et al., 2002</xref>), then all these three ESCRT-III components will co-assemble, presumably into filamentous structures related to the diverse forms seen in vitro. Although Vps24 and Vps2 are sometimes called ‘capping proteins’, because they are required for the recruitment of Vps4 and thus restrict the growth of Snf7 filaments in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babst et al., 2002</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mierzwa et al., 2017</xref>) our data from LLSM show coordinated, rather than sequential recruitment.</p><p>Second, during the lifetime of ESCRT-III assemblies on a peripheral endosome, which ranges from 3 s to a substantial fraction of a minute, the average numbers of Snf7 and Vps24 subunits present during the event, subject to uncertainties about the incorporation ratio of tagged and untagged Snf7, are about 60 to 150 Snf7 and 14 to 30 Vps24, respectively (representing 20th to 80th percent of the distributions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Initial recruitment is abrupt, rather than gradually cumulative. Termination is likewise abrupt. Both components fluctuate substantially, with no evident pattern, during the lifetime of the presumptive nascent bud. The fluctuations, like the initial accumulation, are abrupt; the magnitudes of these fluctuations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) can be nearly as great as the overall averages.</p><p>Third, in the perivacuolar endosomes, spatially unresolved in the optical microscope, large fluctuations in Snf7, Vps24 and Vps4 are of the same magnitude as a complete peripheral event (i.e. about 100–150 Snf7, 30–70 Vps24 and 20–50 Vps4 (representing 20th to 80th percent of the distributions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>), suggesting that the mechanism of ILV formation in the perivacuolar region is the same as in the periphery.</p><p>Fourth, Vps4, although it appears together with the other components, is not required for recruitment of Snf7 and Vps24. ESCRT-III recruitment did not cease under conditions of acute Vps4 depletion, and ESCRT-III recruitment kinetics were essentially the same in cells expressing ATPase impaired Vps4 as in cells expressing wild-type Vps4.</p><p>Fifth, Vps4 is required not only for scission of nascent ILVs but probably also for invagination. Following acute depletion of Vps4, the perivacuolar endosomes that accumulate contain no ILVs and at most have only one or two invaginating buds. Were Vps4 not required for invagination, we would expect those endosomes to have many such buds. The E-compartment stacks seen in cells expressing ATPase impaired Vps4 likewise appear to be devoid of buds, suggesting that for invaginations to form, Vps4 must not only be present, but its ATPase activity must also be intact. This conclusion also follows from our observation, that accumulation of more than 2–3 hexamers requires an ATPase competent Vps4. That is, an active ATPase (and, by inference, ATP hydrolysis) is necessary for a nascent ILV to proceed from an early to a later stage. (See also item (7), below).</p><p>Sixth, Vps4 is largely monomeric in the cytosol, but rapidly forms hexamers when recruited along with Snf7 and Vps24 to endosomes. Fluctuations in Vps4 content during the lifetime of a recruitment event were generally in multiples of six.</p><p>Seventh, approximately 20% of the Vps4 and ESCRT-III recruitment events are probably ‘non-productive’ -- that is, do not result in a completed ILV. Our evidence for this conclusion is as follows. Addition of cargo led to immediate uptake by the cells mediated by their ubiquitinated receptors, presumably into small early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kukulski et al., 2012a</xref>), which recruited Vps4 and Snf7. Previous work has shown, however, that only when cargo reaches larger compartments, probably generated by fusion of the smaller vesicles, do ILVs appear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prescianotto-Baschong and Riezman, 1998</xref>). Indeed, early endosomes are too small to host production of ILVs, and only when they reach some critical size is it likely that ILVs can invaginate and pinch. We suggest that most of the peripheral events that accumulate three or more Vps4 hexamers represent formation of complete ILVs, as such events are absent in cells expressing the ATPase-impaired mutant and in the <italic>pep12</italic>Δ cells that cannot form endocytic carriers large enough to accommodate an ILV.</p><p>As this summary illustrates, we have shown that Vps4 is present throughout the process of ILV formation and that its ATPase activity is required to proceed from an early stage to a later one, as well as for vesicle scission. These findings are not compatible with current models. What sort of molecular mechanism might they suggest instead? Snf7, Vps24 and other, related ESCRT-III components all form filamentous or helical polymers in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schöneberg et al., 2017</xref>), but because a variety of polymorphic assemblies of these molecules have been characterized, we cannot from available data specify what structure(s) correspond to the in vivo events recorded here. The apparent co-assembly of Snf7 with Vps24 (and probably Vps2) and the estimated amounts of these ESCRT-III subunits in a typical recruitment are not, however, consistent with formation of very long, coiled structures on membranes. Moreover, rapid fluctuations in the numbers of Snf7 and Vps24 during the lifetime of an ESCRT-III mediated event suggest that two or more shorter filamentous structures may be forming, each a co-polymer of the ESCRT-III components, rather than a single continuously growing filament. Bro1, the ESCRT-0 component can nucleate ESCRT-III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, Vps25, the ESCRT-II component thought to nucleate ESCRT-III through Vps20, is present in two copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hierro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Teo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Teis et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, multiple nucleations are therefore in principle possible. If the observed ESCRT-III dynamics indeed reflect growth and shrinkage (or appearance and disappearance) of more than one filament, then invagination and pinching may require some correlation of the otherwise stochastic behavior of multiple filaments, presumably brought about by the ATPase activity of several Vps4 hexamers. One picture consistent with these notions is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31652.029</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposal of a model for the mechanism of ESCRT-mediated intraluminal vesicle formation.</title><p>The figure shows a schematic representation for possible stages during the budding and scission of ILVs in MVBs. ESCRT-0-II (not shown) bind cargo proteins and nucleate rapid assembly of several ESCRT-III filaments. These ESCRT-III assemblies grow and shrink stochastically and recruit Vps4. ESCRT-III dynamics occur continuously throughout the formation of ILVs and do not require Vps4. When recruited, Vps4 hexamers, docked by MIT-MIM association on one filament, exerts ATP-dependent force on another filament by pulling the C-terminus of an ESCRT-III subunit into the hexamer pore; as the cycling process ensues, the filament movement drives crowding of the membrane-anchored cargo. The crowding forces membrane invagination, to create the surface area needed to accommodate the cargo molecules. The forces exerted by the interactions between ESCRT-III and Vps4 hexamers also generate the neck of the nascent bud, lead to membrane constriction and ultimately to vesicle fission and final release of the ESCRT machinery.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-31652-fig6-v2"/></fig><p>The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> has the following features. First, it postulates two or more ESCRT-III filaments, wrapped around the ubiquitinated cargo - ESCRT-0, I, II complexes that recruit them. Second, it postulates that the ATPase activity of Vps4 hexamers drives invagination and ultimately scission of nascent buds, through mechanochemical coupling to the ESCRT-III polymers. Vps4 hexamers interact with ESCRT-III polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghazi-Tabatabai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>) through their MIT domains with the MIM elements near the C-termini of ESCRT-III subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Obita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007</xref>); the interaction with Vps2 MIM elements is particularly strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Obita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007</xref>). When assembled as a hexamer, Vps4 can also unfold an ESCRT-III subunit by passing the ESCRT-III polypeptide chain through its central pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Su et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monroe et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, there are a variety of ways in which a Vps4 hexamer, anchored on one filament, can pull on components of another. In the particular version, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, cargo-associated ESCRT-0-I-II complexes (not displayed) nucleate rapid assembly of several ESCRT-III filaments, which grow and shrink stochastically. A Vps4 hexamer (several are generally present), docked by MIT-MIM association on one filament, exerts ATP-dependent force on another by pulling the C-terminus of an ESCRT-III subunit into the hexamer pore, crowding the membrane-anchored cargo together as the cycling process ensues during the duration of the event (cargo crowding). The crowding forces membrane invagination (membrane buckling) to create the surface area needed to accommodate the cargo molecules, which generally have larger luminal domains than cytosolic projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Derganc et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Derganc and Čopič, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stachowiak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mageswaran et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in this model, Vps4 drives invagination primarily by concentrating cargo, rather than by favoring transformation of an ESCRT-III filament from a planar coil to dome-like one, as in several other proposed models. The capacity to adopt a dome-like curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lata et al., 2008</xref>) will, however, allow ESCRT-III filaments to accommodate to an invaginating bud, probably increasing the capacity for Vps4 hexamers, as observed for productive events. The forces exerted by the interactions between ESCRT-III and Vps4 also generate the neck of the nascent bud (ILV budding), leading to neck tightening, membrane constriction and ultimately to vesicle fission and final release of the ESCRT machinery. Many variations of this picture are consistent with our current data.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>The following antibodies were used for western blot analysis with the stated dilutions: rabbit polyclonal antiserum (1:200) specific for Vps2 (SAT 455 alpha) purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adell et al., 2014</xref>); polyclonal rabbit antisera (1:5000) specific for Vps4, Snf7 and Vps24 were a gift from the Emr Lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teis et al., 2008</xref>); mouse monoclonal antibody (1:10000) specific for PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase 1, (Invitrogen, Rockford, Illinois, USA, 459250); mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000) specific for GFP (IgG1K, Roche Diagnostics, Germany, 11814460001, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_390913">AB_390913</ext-link>); goat anti-mouse IgG–Peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, USA, A4416, 1:5000, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_258167">AB_258167</ext-link>); goat anti-Rabbit IgG–Peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, USA, A0545, 1:5000).

Moreover Pma1 is a stable cell surface protein with a half-life of ∼11 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benito et al., 1991</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shih et al., 2000</xref>). Heterodimerization of FKBP12 with FRB fused to Vps4 was achieved in yeast cells grown to mid-log phase and then treated with 1 µg/ml rapamycin (rapamycin stock = 50 mg/ml in 100% EtOH) . Vps4-(eGFP)-FRB was efficiently anchored way in less than one minute and remained inactivated for the duration of the experiments (ranging from 30 s to 2 hr). When Vps4-GFP-FRB was co-expressed with Vps4-mCherry in the same cell, Vps4-mCherry remained in the cytoplasm and on endosomes. It was not co-recruited by Vps4-eGFP-FRB to Pma1-FKBP1 at the plasma membrane. This result suggested that once Vps4-eGFP-FRB was anchored to Pma1-FKB12 it could no longer form functional complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Under these conditions Vps4-eGFP-FRB was only visible at the PM, did not accumulate on endosomes and was not transported into the vacuole via the MVB. When Vps4-eGFP-FRB was co-expressed with untagged Vps4, MVB sorting remained active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) after anchoring away Vps4-eGFP-FRB. Vps4-GFP-FRB remained anchored to Pma1-FKBP12, it remained at the PM and was not detected on endosomes and it was not transported to the vacuole for the duration of the experiment – unlike Mup1-mCherry that was efficiently delivered to the vacuole in the same cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Epifluorescence microscopy</title><p>Live cell epifluorescence microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 equipped with a SPOT Xplorer CCD camera, standard fluorescent filters and AxioVision software. Exposure time was 500 msec for all fluorescent channels (eGFP, mCherry, mRuby2, FM4-64) and 50 msec for phase contrast images. Membrane labeling by FM4-64 dye (Invitrogen) was done in midlog (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vida and Emr, 1995</xref>).

Cells were mounted on concavalin A coated cover slides. FRAP was carried in perivacuolar regions of interest containing Vps4-eGFP and FM4-64; bleaching was achieved by 10 ms exposure of an Argon laser beam (digital power 40%, intensity 40%) emitting at 488 nm (point-bleaching setting, Leica-FRAP Wizard). Vps4-eGFP was imaged with 488 nm (10% intensity, HyD 100% gain), FM4-64 was imaged with 561 nm (3% intensity, HyD detector 100% gain). The time-series were acquired with an imaging speed of 1400 Hz. For analysis, fluorescence intensity was corrected for background and bleaching, and normalized to the fluorescence intensity from the first frame. The rate of recovery after photobleaching and the fitted time constants were determined using a single-exponential fitting custom-made MATLAB script.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Correlated light and electron microscopy</title><p>Correlative light and electron microscopy was performed as described with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kukulski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suresh et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, Vps4-eGFP expressing cells were grown in SD-Met media and Vps4-mNeonGreen expressing cells in SC-Trp at 30°C. Yeast cells were harvested by filtration and then subjected to high-pressure rapid freezing. Samples were freeze-substituted and then embedded in Lowicryl HM20. 200–300 nm thick sections were collected on copper grids with a continuous carbon film. TetraSpeck beads of 50 nm diameter used as markers for the correlation procedure were deposited on the sample surface. The grids were imaged on an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope equipped with 100×, N/A 1.45 objective and an Orca-ER camera (Hamamatsu). Three channels were acquired for each field of view (blue with excitation filter 377/50 nm and emission filter 473/30 nm; green with excitation filter 470/22 nm and emission filter 520/35 nm; red with excitation filter 556/20 nm and emission filter 624/40 nm). Before electron tomography 15 nm fiducial gold conjugates were applied to the section surface as fiducial markers for tomogram alignment, and samples were contrasted with Reynolds lead citrate. Electron tomography was performed using Tecnai F30 (FEI) transmission electron microscope at the EMBL Electron Microscopy Core Facility, operated at 300 KV, equipped with a FEI Eagle 4K CCD camera and dual tilt holder. Data were collected using the SerialEM software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>). Two tomograms were recorded for each area of interest: a dual-axis high-magnification tomogram with pixel size 1.202 nm, tilt range −60° to +60°, and 1° tilt angle increment and a low magnification tomogram with a pixel size of 2.59 nm, tilt range −60° to +60°, and a 2° tilt angle increment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Sample preparation for tomography and immuno-gold labeling</title><p>High-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmiedinger et al., 2013</xref>).

Electron tomography from 300 nm sections (coated with 10 nm fiducial gold conjugates) was performed on a Tecnai T20-G2 (FEI) operated at 200kV using dual-tilt series. Images were recorded at binning 2 with a 4 × 4 k Eagle digital camera (FEI) from 55° to −55° with 1° increments using Inspect3D automated tomography software (FEI).

Cells were concentrated by centrifugation and 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells re-suspended in 10 μl selective SC media and spotted on top of concanavalin A-coated 5 mm round glass coverslips. After 5 min, coverslips were placed in the sample bath of our LLSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguet et al., 2016</xref>) containing selective SC media. The samples were imaged as a time series in 3D using a dithered multi-Bessel lattice light-sheet by stepping the sample stage at 500 nm intervals in the s-axis equivalent to ~261 nm translation in the z-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>); thus, each 3D image took 850 ms to acquire (including a 100 ms pause between imaging volumes) for a total of 60 time points. Each 3D stack corresponded to a pre-deskewed volume of ~50 µm x 50 µm x 15 µm (512 × 512×30 pixels). The inner and outer NAs of excitation were 0.505 and 0.6, respectively. Yeast cells only expressing Vps4-eGFP, Vps4<sup>E233Q</sup>-eGFP, or Vps4-eGFP in the <italic>pep12∆</italic> background, were excited with a 488 nm laser (~120 mW operating power with an illumination of ~300 µW at the back aperture) to acquire 28–56 imaging planes, each exposed for ~14.8–21 ms and recorded using an Andor iXon 897 EMCCD camera. Same conditions were used to image cells expressing Snf7-eGFP in the <italic>pep12∆</italic> background. Cells expressing combinations of Snf7-eGFP and Vps24-eGFP with either Vps4-mCherry or Vps4<sup>E233Q</sup>-mCherry were sequentially excited with a 488 nm laser (~240 mW power and ~600 µW at back aperture) and a 561 nm laser (~500 mW power and ~400 µW at back aperture) for each optical plane. Images for each channel were recorded with two Andor iXon 897 EMCCD cameras using exposures of ~11.8 ms per channel. These imaging conditions provided with the sensitivity sufficient to detect the fluorescence signal with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3–5 from 3 eGFP molecules located within a diffraction-limited spot. Under these imaging conditions used for cells expressing the Vps4<sup>E233Q</sup> mutants, the dynamic range of the EMCCD became saturated for the fluorescence signal elicited by ESCRT-III subunits or Vps4 associated with the E compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Analysis of ESCRT-III and Vps4 recruitment dynamics</title><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>3D image preprocessing</title><p>Approximately 300–1000 yeast cells were analyzed per experimental condition.

Valid tracks used for further analysis encompassed those that did not merge or split during the duration of the object, whose lifetimes were fully included in the time series, whose fluorescence intensity where above the local background and sensitivity threshold and whose positions were farther than 1.5 µm from any edge of the imaged volume. Persistent tracks also used for analysis corresponded to those with lifetimes longer than the time series.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-2"><title>Single molecule eGFP fluorescence calibration</title><p>The LLSM was calibrated for three-molecule eGFP detection using bacterially produced eGFP adsorbed to a glass coverslip and imaged with the LLSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10e</xref>). The microscope was adjusted to detect the fluorescence of single eGFP molecules, thus allowing us to generate a calibration curve obtained with different exposures and with the same laser power conditions used to image the cells. A custom-made MATLAB (MathWorks) script automatically detected the 3D-fitted asymmetric Gaussian fluorescence intensity associated with a diffraction-limited spot; a T-test was used to identify valid spots whose 3D-fitted fluorescence signal was statistically higher than their local background before bleaching. The fluorescence intensity distribution was then fitted to a mixture-model Gaussian function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguet et al., 2013</xref>), where the first Gaussian population corresponded to signal elicited by a single-eGFP molecule. The eGFP fluorescence signals detected in the yeast cells were then converted to number of eGFP molecules and the traces include the propagated error (square root of the squared sums of uncertainties from the 3D fitted fluorescence signal and from the single-eGFP calibration curve). The spinning disc confocal microscope was calibrated for single-molecule eGFP as described above but using a 2D Gaussian fluorescence intensity-fitting algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguet et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-3"><title>Fluctuation dynamics, lifetimes, number of molecule and visualization</title><p>Imaging of diffraction limited fluorescent beads illuminated so as to generate the signal equivalent to ~50 eGFPs showed constant fluorescence signal with a standard deviation of ~3; this indicates that the large signal fluctuations determined in the yeast cells were not due to the instrument but instead were biological fluctuations due to change in the number of fluorescence molecules recruited to a single spot. The same conclusion was reached by demonstrating absence of fluorescence intensity fluctuations in time series of Mup1-eGFP cargo internalized into the diffraction-limited peripheral endosomes in yeast cells imaged with the same conditions of illumination and acquisition used to trace ESCRT-III and Vps4 dynamics. Correlation dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), lifetimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) and maximum number of molecules accumulated within a trace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>) were obtained using custom-made MATLAB routines.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Congratulations, we are pleased to inform you that your article, &quot;Recruitment dynamics of ESCRT-III and Vps4 to endosomes and implications for reverse membrane budding&quot;, has been accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Maholtra as the Senior Editor.</p><p>This work is the first rigorous examination of ESCRT-III and Vps4 dynamics in cells as these molecules generate endosome intralumenal vesicles. Contrary to prevailing models, which propose a sequence of ESCRT-III filament polymerization that drives ILV budding and concludes with Vps4 recruitment and ILV fission elicited by Vps4 ATPase activity, this manuscript shows that Vps4 and ESCRT-III associate with the endosome continuously, that Vps4 ATPase activity correlates with ESCRT-III dynamics, and that Vps4 is required for ILV formation, not just fission. The authors propose a new model that accounts for the observed dynamics that will be of great interest to the field.</p><p>The reviews have been included at the end of this letter. As you will see, the reviewers made a few suggestions for experiments that might strengthen and/or extend your findings, however, addressing these points is optional. Please let us know if you wish to consider any of these new experiments as it would then be necessary to consult the reviewing editor for approval of new additions.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>A study of ESCRT protein dynamics on endosomes of live cells is presented. Studies of purified and in vivo overexpressed ESCRT III proteins show that Snf7 and other ESCRT-III subunits are capable of forming spiral filaments that deform membrane; these filaments are proposed to entrap integral membrane proteins and to possess intrinsic membrane bending activity. Prevailing models of ILV biogenesis also propose that the ATPase cycle of Vps4 elicits ESCRT-III filament disassembly and release of ESCRT-III proteins from the membrane, concomitant with vesicle fission. In this study, cutting edge optical and electron microcopy tools were implemented to test several assumptions of the prevailing models by monitoring the association of fluorescently tagged ESCRT-III and Vps4 molecules with yeast endosomes, over time, in live cells. The authors report that ESCRT-III and Vps4 dynamics are inconsistent with current models that posit sequential accumulation of ESCRT-III molecules (i.e., filament growth) that drives ILV membrane budding, concluding with the action of Vps4 to drive ILV fission. Based on their results, a conceptually new mechanistic model is proposed in which continuous association/dissociation of ESCRT-III and Vps4 molecules with the maturing endosome membrane elicits the formation of a dynamic filamentous network that concentrates integral membrane proteins to drive membrane bending via molecular crowding, culminating in vesicle fission. Overall, this is a nicely executed, interesting study that, despite a few technical caveats, is certain to stimulate an important debate within the field.</p><p>1) Ambiguity regarding the presumed mixed tagged-untagged Snf7 filaments on the endosome is concerning because the degree to which the tag changes Snf7 behavior (i.e., kinetics of filament assembly) is not established. Affected protein functions, if any, might significantly skew the interpretation of the data by restricting analyses to events that do not reflect the physiological situation. In addition, if the assumption that tagged and untagged Snf7 are incorporated with equal probability into an ESCRT-III filament is not correct, then the estimate of Snf7 abundance on the endosome is compromised. I wonder if simple Snf7 fractionation experiments to determine the proportion of tagged Snf7 in membrane-associated cell membrane fraction might lend some clarity to this question and confidence to the authors' assumption.</p><p>2) The small proportion of endosomes for which Vps4-mCherry could be detected and analyzed (~30%) begs the question, are the analyzed events representative? Similar to the issue raised in point 1, if the assumption that tagged Vps4 function equivalently to untagged Vps4 (the included tests of tagged Vps4 function are not sufficiently quantitative to determine this), then it is difficult to gauge the significance of restricting the analysis to the subset of endosomes that contain enough Vps4-mCherry to analyze.

This is the reason why in the time series ~ 60% of the Snf7-eGFP spots colocalize with Vps4-mCherry. Importantly (an internal control), the remaining non-detected fraction is similar to the fraction of traces with up to 18-20 Vps4-eGFP molecules detected using the live cell imaging LLSM adjusted to detect at least 3 eGFP molecules per spot. These results suggest that Snf7-eGFP always co-localized with Vps4-mCherry.</p><p>The full analysis was restricted, however, to 32% of the Snf7-eGFP / Vps4-mCherry traces (still more than 3300) since in these the Vps4-mCherry signal was sufficiently high for reliable tracking during the whole life of the tracing; the relatively fast rate of mCherry bleaching in the remaining traces precluded us from carrying a complete analysis.</p><p>We believe that Vps4-eGFP and Vps4-mCherry are fully functional fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). When expressed alone, the lifetimes of Snf7-eGFP, Vps24-eGFP and Vps4-eGFP traces were indistinguishable from each other, consistent with similar recruitment to the endosomes, regardless of being tagged or not.</p><p>We have tested Vps4-mScarlet, Vps4-mRuby2, Vps4-turboRFP but Vps4-mCherry still gave the best results.
