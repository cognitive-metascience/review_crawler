To maintain these complex functions the composition of the plasma membrane is highly regulated and needs constant remodeling. Plasma membrane proteins and lipids are taken up by endocytosis and are delivered to early endosomes. Endosomes are the main sorting station in the endosomal pathway. These compartments are necessary for sorting, recycling and degradation of cargo molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maxfield and McGraw, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Proteins destined for degradation are sorted by the ESCRT complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henne et al., 2011</xref>) into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) which are finally fused with the vacuole. The process of endosomal maturation requires switching from the Rab5 to the Rab7 GTPase as well as a change in the phosphoinositide composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cabrera and Ungermann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>). For the final fusion of endosomes with the lysosome/vacuole the so called HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting) tethering complex and the RAB family GTPase Ypt7 are required.</p><p>An alternative pathway for endosomal cargo is the recycling pathway to the plasma membrane. In mammalian cells, specialized recycling endosomes recycle cargo back to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maxfield and McGraw, 2004</xref>). In yeast cells, recycling of endocytic cargo to the plasma membrane requires the Golgi apparatus. Depending on different sorting complexes such as the retromer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seaman et al., 1998</xref>) or the Snx4/41/42 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2017</xref>) proteins can be targeted to the Golgi. Recent discoveries suggest that the trans-Golgi network in yeast also serves as the early/recycling endosome. Additionally, yeast harbors a separate late/prevacuolar endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 2018</xref>). In this model, endocytic cargo is delivered directly to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is further sorted for recycling or transport to the prevacuolar compartment.</p><p>For the tethering of retrograde endosomal transport carriers at the Golgi the GARP (Golgi associated retrograde protein trafficking) complex is required. GARP is a hetero-tetrameric complex consisting of the four subunits Vps51, Vps52, Vps53 and Vps54 and belongs to the family of CATCHR (complexes associated with tethering containing helical rods) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conibear and Stevens, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Siniossoglou and Pelham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vasan et al., 2010</xref>). Deletion of the GARP complex has been linked to multiple cellular dysfunctions. The first discovered and canonical pathway is the sorting of the carboxy peptidase Y (CPY) receptor Vps10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conibear and Stevens, 2000</xref>), hence the name Vps of all subunits. However, deletion of the GARP complex has also been linked to defects in autophagy and mitochondrial tubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reggiori and Klionsky, 2006</xref>), defects in the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fiedler et al., 2002</xref>), cell wall integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conde et al., 2003</xref>), vacuole integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conibear and Stevens, 2000</xref>) and several more (for a complete overview see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonifacino and Hierro, 2011</xref>).</p><p>We have previously identified an important role for the GARP complex in lipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fröhlich et al., 2015</xref>). Deletion of either subunit of the GARP complex results in the massive accumulation of sphingolipid intermediates, the long chain bases (LCBs) in cells. Interestingly all observed defects in GARP knockout mutants, including vacuolar fragmentation can be rescued by chemical depletion of sphingolipids. This suggests that sphingolipid accumulation is the causing problem in cells but the molecular mechanism for this remains largely elusive.</p><p>Here, we have developed a system that combines auxin induced degradation of the GARP complex with mass spectrometry based vacuolar proteomics and lipidomics to systematically identify cargo of the GARP dependent endosomal sorting pathway. We show that plasma membrane proteins of two different functional groups, amino-phospholipid flippases and cell wall biosynthesis proteins, are the first to be mis-sorted after chemical depletion of the GARP complex. We also analyze the cellular and vacuolar lipid composition to shed some light on the important functions of the GARP complex in cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Acute GARP inactivation by auxin-mediated degradation</title><p>Deletion of any subunit of the hetero-tetrameric GARP complex results in a plethora of cellular phenotypes ranging from endosomal sorting defects, to mitochondrial dysfunction, to problems with the CVT pathway and cellular sphingolipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonifacino and Hierro, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fröhlich et al., 2015</xref>). However, with its canonical role in retrograde endosome to Golgi trafficking, the first occurring changes causing the aforementioned defects remain unknown. To study the causing defects occurring in cells after deletion of the GARP complex we made use of the auxin induced degron (AID) system. We therefore tagged the Vps53 subunit of the GARP complex C-terminally with an AID tag followed by a 6 HA tag. To enable auxin‐dependent recognition of Vps53‐AID-6HA by an ubiquitin ligase, we expressed the Oryza sativa F‐box transport inhibitor response‐one auxin receptor protein (OsTir1) in these cells. In immunoblot experiments we could detect similar protein levels for Vps53-AID-6HA compared to Vps53 only carrying a C-terminal 6 HA tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Addition of the auxin analogue 3-idoleacetic acid (IAA) resulted in the rapid degradation of the AID tagged Vps53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Quantification of several replicates revealed that 90% of the protein as degraded after 10 min. After 60 min 99% of the protein are degraded which we consider complete degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42837.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Vps53 can be depleted using the auxin induced degron system.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) AID tagged Vps53 is rapidly degraded after addition of IAA.

To test if auxin induced degradation of the GARP subunit Vps53 resembled the phenotype of the knockout we spotted cells on plates containing myriocin, IAA or a combination of both.

GARP knockouts cells show very strong vacuolar fragmentation phenotypes. One hypothesis is that loss of GARP function results in a decrease in recycling from endosomes via the Golgi to the plasma membrane and therefore accumulation of cargo at the vacuole. One potential cargo are LCBs resulting from the breakdown of complex sphingolipids which are speculated to cause the vacuolar defects. To test the effect of acute GARP inactivation on the vacuole we tagged the vacuolar membrane protein Vph1 with a GFP tag in cells expressing Vps53-AID-HA and OsTir. In a control strain harbouring Vps53-AID-6HA without OsTir we labelled Vph1 with a mCherry tag. To determine the effect of Vps53 degradation on the vacuole we mixed the two strains of the same mating type, added IAA to the cells and monitored the vacuolar morphology over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Yeast cells usually carry one to three round vacuoles, as we observed for more than 70% of the cells in both strains under conditions without IAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Over time, the addition of IAA caused an increase of cells harbouring more than three vacuoles as early as 30 mins after addition of IAA only in the strain carrying Vps53-AID-6HA and OsTir. After 90 mins of treatment this number increased to more than 65%. In contrast, control cells showed no change in the vacuolar morphology over time showing that the inactivation of GARP function rapidly results in changed vacuolar morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). However, this phenotype is not as strong as a <italic>VPS53</italic> deletion suggesting that the accumulation of cargo enhances the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fröhlich et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42837.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Acute depletion of Vps53 leads to vacuolar fragmentation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Yeast cells expressing Vps53-AID-6HA together with the OsTir ligase and Vph1-GFP (green vacuoles) and cells expressing only Vps53-AID-6HA and Vph1-mCherry were mixed and treated with 500 µM IAA for 0, 30, 60 and 90 mins.

To test if we can purify vacuoles from yeast cells with chemically depleted Vps53 we tagged Vph1 with either a GFP tag or a mCherry tag in the Vps53-AID strain. We induced Vps53 depletion in the strain harbouring Vph1-GFP with IAA for 90 min. We next mixed both strains and purified vacuoles according to established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabrera and Ungermann, 2008</xref>). Purified vacuoles were analyzed by live cell imaging to determine the number of purified vacuoles as well as their average diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). We observed a mild increase in the number of purified vacuoles from IAA treated cells together with a concomitant decrease in the average vacuolar diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), suggesting that vacuoles can still be purified from GARP depleted cells. It is possible that vacuoles that are further fragmented are lost during purification. Together, our data show that vacuoles from yeast cells with a chemically depleted GARP complex can be purified in similar numbers as to untreated control cells. This suggests that early changes in the vacuolar proteome and lipidome in GARP depleted cells can be determined systematically.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Enriched vacuoles can be characterized by MS based proteomics</title><p>To study the cargo that is transported to the vacuole in GARP depleted strains we first established the methods for purification of the vacuoles and their analysis using SILAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ong and Mann, 2007</xref>) labeling followed by MS based proteomics. Yeast vacuoles have been characterized by mass spectrometry based proteomics before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wiederhold et al., 2009</xref>). In this study 77 proteins were identified that were annotated as vacuolar proteins, equalling 42% of all annotated vacuolar proteins. In total 13% of all identified proteins belonged to the vacuolar fraction. To determine the purity of vacuoles in our hands, we purified vacuoles from lysine 0 labelled cells and mixed them with total cell lysates from lysine 8, ‘heavy’ labelled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Our analysis resulted in a total of 1599 proteins yielding a SILAC ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Of these proteins 135 were identified that are annotated as vacuolar proteins. To carefully analyze our data and identify contaminants we plotted the SILAC ratios of all identified proteins against their total intensities. As expected we observed a strong bias towards proteins with low SILAC ratios reflecting proteins that are enriched in the vacuole preparations. We next binned the proteins according to their logarithmic SILAC ratios and analyzed the GO (gene ontology) terms of the different ratio bins. This analysis revealed that proteins in the two bins with the lowest SILAC ratios (<italic>log<sub>2</sub></italic> ratio −5 to −6 and −4 to −5) were significantly enriched in proteins with the GO term ‘vacuole’ (p&lt;4.86<sup>−28</sup> and p&lt;4.26<sup>−14</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>). The next two higher ratio bins (<italic>log<sub>2</sub></italic> ratio −4 to −5 and −2 to −4) also yielded proteins annotated as vacuolar but with lower significance values. Instead these bins were highly enriched for ER and lipid droplet localized proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Together, these data show that we can enrich vacuolar proteins in our preparations. However, together with vacuoles we also enriched proteins from the ER and lipid droplets. This supports the idea that yeast vacuoles form extensive membrane contact sites with both organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouchez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Zutphen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42837.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Proteomic analysis of enriched yeast vacuoles.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Experimental setup to determine vacuolar enrichment.

Recent discoveries suggest that the TGN can act as the early/recycling endosome in yeast, thus GARP can potentially tether endocytic vesicles originating from the plasma membrane. Independent of the pathway, we hypothesized that transport carriers that are not tethered at the Golgi in a GARP deficient strain will eventually arrive at the yeast vacuole. We should thus be able to identify the cargo by purifying vacuoles from a GARP depleted strain and compare their protein content to a control strain. Since vacuoles are completely fragmented in a GARP knockout strain we purified vacuoles from an OsTir Vps53-AID-6HA strain labelled with heavy lysine and treated with IAA and compared them to vacuoles isolated from a mock treated, light lysine labelled OsTir Vps53-AID-6HA strain. To also control the overall protein levels in the cells we quantified the entire proteome of the cell prior to vacuole purification (for the experimental setup see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). To ensure that we identify mis-targeted proteins as early as possible we analyzed the vacuolar and cellular proteome after 0, 30, 60 and 90 min of IAA treatment. The most pronounced phenotypes were observed after 90 min of IAA treatment. In the purified vacuole sample we identified a total of 1515 proteins with yielding a SILAC ratio (t = 90 min; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

In line with our hypothesis that plasma membrane proteins, following a GARP dependent transport route cannot be recycled, the most enriched group of proteins are annotated as plasma membrane proteins (GO:0005886; p-value&lt;4.74<sup>−6</sup>, 2.53 fold enrichment). Amongst these proteins are especially the plasma membrane localized amino-phospholipid flippases Dnf1 and Dnf2 as well as their adaptor protein Lem3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hachiro et al., 2013</xref>).

Therefore, we analyzed the proteomes of cell lysates and isolated vacuoles from yeast cells harboring the OsTir ubiquitin ligase treated with IAA or mock treated. We did not observe changes in any of the proteins significantly enriched in the cells were we degraded the GARP complex, except for Pdr12 which was enriched in the cell lysate of IAA treated cells compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). We also did not observe changes in the previously identified target proteins when we compared IAA treated cells with or without the expression of the OsTir ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). Together these control experiments suggest that the proteins we find enriched at vacuoles are depending on transport by the GARP tethering complex.</p><p>To further validate our results, we compared OsTir Vps53-AID-6HA cells treated with IAA for 90 mins with mock treated OsTir Vps53-AID-6HA cells again. This time we switched SILAC labeling to exclude any effects on protein trafficking from heavy or light labelled lysine. This also allows us to plot the heavy to light SILAC ratios of the two experiments against each other. The two experiments are strongly anti correlated, as expected by switching SILAC labels. Importantly, many of the previously detected proteins mis-targeted to the vacuole still remain strong outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested if the deletion of the vacuolar proteinase A gene, <italic>PEP4</italic>, had an impact on the observed proteins. If proteins reach the vacuole and are internalized, they are broken down by vacuolar proteases. Thus, it is difficult to pick up peptides of the proteins by MS based proteomics, since only peptides resulting from LysC digestion are searched for in the experiments. A deletion of the major vacuolar protease could therefore improve the identification rate of proteins that are enriched in vacuoles. Overall, results from this experiment improved the identification rate of proteins in the vacuolar samples. We again saw differences in the amino phospholipid-flippase proteins Dnf1, Dnf2 and Lem3 and in cell wall proteins. In comparison to the previous results, in these experiments we observed a vacuolar enrichment of the SNARE Tlg2 and the protein Vps45 which are known interactors of the GARP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dulubova et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). However, the number of peptides of the two mentioned proteins compared to for example the flippases are relatively low (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>).</p><p>Together our data show that the amino-phospholipid flippase proteins of the plasma membrane are specifically re-routed to the vacuole in cells were we induce the depletion of the GARP complex. For a protein that is shifted from a recycling pathway to a degradation pathway, we expected that the overall protein levels in the cell are decreased, while the amount on or in the vacuolar fraction increased. We only observed a small decrease in total cell lysates for Dnf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). The protein levels for Lem3 were below the detection limit in the cell lysate. In contrast, we saw the overall protein levels of Pdr12 increasing in both, the vacuolar and the cell lysate sample. This suggests that the expression of the multi-drug transporter Pdr12 is increased by the addition of IAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). This also leads to the conclusion that Pdr12 is probably transporting IAA out of the cell and a <italic>pdr12Δ</italic> strain could be more sensitive to lower levels of IAA. This has to be evaluated in the future. Interestingly, we did not observe any changes in the best described GARP dependent protein, the CPY receptor Vps10. In both the vacuolar fraction and the cell lysate the levels of Vps10 remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). One explanation for this observation is that the levels of Vps10 at the vacuole are already high in mock treated cells. This is exactly what we observe while we did not detect any Dnf2 signal at the vacuole under these conditions.</p><p>We also hypothesized that the method we have developed to map endocytic recycling cargo could be used to identify the endocytic adaptors for the proteins that are recycled. Flippases have previously been linked to the Sla1 dependent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). However, we were not able to purify sufficient amounts of vacuoles from <italic>sla1Δ</italic> cells to analyse their proteomic composition. To test our hypothesis alternatively, we deleted the AP-2 adaptor complex subunit <italic>APL1</italic> in our functional Vps53-AID strain. Proteomic analysis of enriched vacuoles from ‘<italic>light</italic>’ labelled OsTir Vps53-AID-6HA cells compared to ‘<italic>heavy</italic>’ labelled OsTir Vps53-AID-6HA <italic>apl1Δ</italic> cells, both treated with IAA for 90 min revealed that the amino-phospholipid flippases Dnf1, Dnf2 and Lem3 were identified at the vacuole in both strains, yielding a SILAC ratio of approximately 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>). We confirmed or results by live cell imaging of mNeon tagged Lem3 where we could still detect Lem3 at vacuoles in IAA treated Vps53-AID-6HA cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). To exclude that the protein is targeted to the vacuole from an intracellular pool we analyzed the cellular distribution of Lem3-mNeon in OsTir Vps53-AID-6HA and OsTir Vps53-AID-6HA <italic>apl1Δ</italic> cells using the radial profile plot imageJ plugin. This analysis shows that the plasma membrane signal of Lem3 is depleted in cells with vacuolar Lem3 accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Only three proteins involved in cell wall maintenance that we have identified as enriched in vacuoles in GARP depleted cells (Chs1, Cwp1 and Flc2) are lower abundant at vacuoles from AP-2 deleted OsTir Vps53-AID-6HA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). This suggests that proteins involved in cell wall maintenance are constantly shuttled between the plasma membrane and the Golgi using AP-2 as the endocytic adaptor complex. The endocytic adaptor for the amino-phospholipid flippases remains unknown. However, this observation confirms that our method is useful to detect adaptor complexes for endocytic proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Dnf1, Dnf2 and Lem3 are targets of GARP dependent recycling</title><p>The amino phospholipid flippases Dnf1 and Dnf2 as well as the adaptor protein Lem3 are integral parts of the plasma membrane and responsible for generating phospholipid asymmetry across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hachiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakano et al., 2008</xref>).

Our MS results suggested that both, Dnf1 and Dnf2 as well as Lem3 are not recycled in GARP depleted cells and instead are re-routed to the vacuole. To confirm our MS data we tagged each of the proteins with the mNeon green fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shaner et al., 2013</xref>) in cells also harboring the vacuole localized Vph1-mCherry as well as OsTir and the AID-tagged Vps53. While we were unable to detect any signal for Dnf1-mNeon, Dnf2 and Lem3 both localized to the plasma membrane with an enrichment at either the bud or the bud neck and also some puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,c</xref>). Importantly, we did not observe any co-localization of the dots with Vph1-mCherry labelled vacuoles. When we compared IAA treated to mock treated cells after 30, 60 and 90 min of treatment we observed an increasing number of cells that showed Dnf1 or Lem3 signal co-localizing with the vacuole which we also quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b,c,d</xref>). This phenotype was always observed in cells that had fragmented vacuoles. In comparison, mock treated cells showed no increase in vacuolar Lem3 or Dnf2 signal as well as no increase in vacuolar fragmentation. To control that IAA treatment itself did not affect our results we analyzed Dnf2 and Lem3 localization in IAA treated cells that were either harboring only OsTir or OsTir and an AID tagged version of Vps53. Here, we also observed Dnf2 and Lem3 localization to the vacuole only in Vps53-AID tagged cells treated with IAA, thus ruling out any side effects from the IAA treatment <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42837.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Plasma membrane localized flippases re-localize to vacuoles in GARP complex depleted cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Co-localization of mNeon-tagged Lem3 (second row from top) with mCherry-tagged Vph1 (third row from top) are shown in mock treated and IAA treated cells.

The Vps53-AID strain overexpressing Lem3 from the TEF promotor also grew in the presence of IAA and miltefosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).

To test this hypothesis we isolated lipids from IAA treated OsTir Vps53-AID-6HA and OsTir Vps53-6HA cells without an AID tag and analyzed the levels of the most abundant phospho-glycerolipids phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidyl-serine (PS), phosphatidyl-inositol (PI), phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphpatidyl-glycerol (PG) as well as the sphingolipid intermediates long chain bases (LCB) and ceramides (CER) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).

These are the two lipid classes that are flipped across the bilayer by Dnf1 and Dnf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stevens et al., 2008</xref>).

We also detected a significant 1.5 fold increase in LCBs in GARP depleted cells (p=0.01525).

Especially the mis-localization of the several flippases, usually localized to the plasma membrane results in changes in lipid homeostasis.</p><p>Mutations in the GARP complex result in a large variety of phenotypes in the yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> ranging from protein sorting defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conibear and Stevens, 2000</xref>), to defects in autophagy and mitochondrial tubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conibear and Stevens, 2000</xref>) to sphingolipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fröhlich et al., 2015</xref>). The canonical pathway for the GARP complex is the retrograde transport of the CPY receptor Vps10. While it is clear that GARP mutations cause a CPY transport defect it seems unlikely that all the other observed phenotypes are a consequence of this. To understand the complexity of the phenotypes of GARP mutations it is necessary to identify the first defects occurring in the cell after GARP depletion.</p><p>The assay we developed allows us to observe the changes appearing in the cell as early as 30 min after depletion of the GARP complex. We observe rapidly occurring re-localization of the amino-phospholipid flippases Dnf1 and Dnf2 as well as their adaptor protein Lem3 from the plasma membrane to the yeast vacuole. Interestingly, these proteins do not seem to reach the vacuolar lumen, suggesting that the transport carriers do not fuse with the vacuole and are not destined to arrive at the vacuole in WT cells.</p><p>Flippases are crucial to maintain phospholipid asymmetry across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hachiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakano et al., 2008</xref>). The loss of these proteins in the plasma membrane most likely results in changes of the plasma membrane lipid composition. This note is supported by the changes in the PE to PC ratio we observe in cells. This could also explain why subunits of the GARP complex have been identified in screens using plasma membrane organization as a readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fröhlich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grossmann et al., 2008</xref>). It is also possible that changes in the plasma membrane composition affect the lipid composition of endocytic vesicles derived from the plasma membrane and thus endocytic sorting. Such defects have previously been shown in yeast strains harbouring mutations of flippase proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hachiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hua et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>We have previously suggested that the accumulation of sphingolipids causes the vacuolar fragmentation in <italic>vps53Δ</italic> cells. This theory is supported by the fact that depletion of sphingolipids reverses the vacuolar fragmentation defect observed in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fröhlich et al., 2015</xref>). A recent report also suggests that changes in phospholipids that are transported to the vacuole could result in vacuolar fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2018</xref>). However, we could not detect changes in the vacuolar lipid composition in GARP depleted cells but still observe vacuolar fragmentation as early as 60 mins after depletion of Vps53. It remains possible that our vacuole purification protocol systematically excludes highly fragmented vacuoles where certain lipids are enriched. Our microscopic analysis of purified vacuoles from GARP depleted cells allows this conclusion. It remains also possible that the fragmentation of vacuoles is not the consequence of the accumulation of LCBs but rather depends on different factors. A possible explanation can be a change in ion homeostasis due to changes in plasma membrane composition and thus permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mioka et al., 2018</xref>). Changes in vacuolar morphology could lead to changes in lipid export, especially LCBs, leading to the massive accumulation we observed previously in GARP knockout cells.</p><p>Depleting cellular sphingolipid levels by addition of myriocin results in a block of the re-localization of Lem3 from the plasma membrane to vacuoles. Depletion of sphingolipids after myriocin addition can be detected as early as 10–30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berchtold et al., 2012</xref>) and is known to block endocytosis in both yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pepperl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rispal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zanolari et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, sphingolipid depletion can have two beneficial effects in GARP depleted cells, the inhibition of endocytosis and therefore preventing mis-localization of amino phospholipid flippases. And second, a reduced flux of sphingolipids that reach the vacuole. However, these effects are difficult to dissect biochemically and the method presented here can only detect short term effects. Better protocols for the purification and lipidomic analysis of vacuoles will be crucial to answer these questions in the future. Understanding the lipid related phenotypes will be important to understand the effects of mutations in GARP subunits in human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feinstein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gershlick et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our study also gives new insights in the general organization of the endosomal pathway in yeast. A recent report suggests that yeast has a minimal endosomal system where the trans Golgi network can function as an early/sorting endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 2018</xref>). Our data suggest that two classes of proteins, the amino phospholipid flippases and cell wall proteins such as Chs1 are constantly shuttling between the plasma membrane and the Golgi complex. The GARP complex, in this scenario can also be a tether for vesicles directly arriving from the plasma membrane and not only for retrograde endosomal transport carriers. Similar results and GARP dependency have previously been observed for the yeast monocarboxylate transporter Jen1 depending on carbon source availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Becuwe and Léon, 2014</xref>). For cell wall maintenance proteins we have evidence that the yeast AP-2 complex is the endocytic adaptor. So far, the function of AP-2 in yeast remains enigmatic. One report suggests the cell wall integrity sensor Mid2 is a cargo of the AP-2 complex and that cell wall maintenance in general is depending on AP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapa-y-Lazo et al., 2014</xref>). While we do not find Mid2 at the vacuole in GARP depleted cells we observe several other cell wall related proteins including Chs1, Cwp1 and Flc2. All these proteins are not accumulating at the vacuole of GARP depleted cells when the AP-2 adaptor complex is knocked out. In contrast, flippase recycling is reported to be dependent on the endocytic adaptor Sla1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). While we were unable to purify vacuoles from <italic>sla1Δ</italic> cells, this suggests that several endocytic pathways are dependent on tethering by the GARP complex. In mammalian cells transport of the lysosomal Niemann Pick Type C protein 2 (NPC2) depends on a functional GARP complex and mannose-6-phosphate receptor recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wei et al., 2017</xref>). We have not observed any trafficking defects for yeast Npc2 in our experiments. It was previously shown that the localization of yeast Npc2 depends on a functional AP-3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2007</xref>) and thus it remains possible that we cannot observe defects depending on a functional GARP recycling pathway. Another explanation is the long half-life of 7.1 hr measured experimentally for Npc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christiano et al., 2014</xref>). Changes in the abundance of a vacuole resident protein with a slow turnover rate will probably not be detected in a time course of GARP depletion over 90 min. However, it remains possible that the GARP complex also plays a role in Npc2 transport to the yeast vacuole but in this study we focus on the events occurring early after GARP depletion.</p><p>Finally, we anticipate our assay to be a very useful tool to systematically study the endosomal sorting pathway. The combination of vacuole purification and mass spectrometry proteomics can be used to determine cargo of several sorting complex. For example, acute depletion of the AP3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Llinares et al., 2015</xref>) should result in the lack of proteins delivered to the vacuole via this pathway. Alternatively, the assay could be adapted to identify cargo of the AP-2 complex that is localized to the yeast plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rad et al., 1995</xref>). But in contrast to its mammalian counterpart its function and cargo remain largely elusive.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

We agree that our mass spectrometric data do not rule out this possibility. We have now confirmed our results by live cell imaging and added an analysis of the intracellular distribution of the Lem3 signal. While this still does not rule out divertion from an intracellular pool, it suggests that the plasma membrane pool of Lem3 gets also depleted. We have added these data as Figure 4—figure supplement 5 and have modified the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding cause/effect of lipid alterations: are the observed trafficking defects of Dnf1/Dnf2/Lem3 causative of sphingolipid effects in GARP KO cells, or are they effects?

We have carried out the suggested experiments to test Lem3 localization upon GARP depletion with and without sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibition. Interestingly, Lem3 remains plasma membrane localized in GARP depleted cells upon myriocin treatment. However, in our view, this does not rule out that flippases/Lem3 as direct targets of the GARP complex. Chemical sphingolipid depletion is known to lead to actin deploimerization and inhibition of endocytosis. Therefore, the plasma membrane localized proteins remain in the plasma membrane even when the GARP complex is depleted. We have previously shown that deletion of <italic>VPS53</italic> results in an accumulation of long chain bases and chemical sphingolipid biosynthesis is beneficial for the cells. In the auxin induced degron system that we use here, we can only detect small changes in sphingolipid levels. However, the beneficial effects of myriocin treatment in VPS53 knockout/depleted cells could be both(i) suppression of endocytosis and thus flippase activity in the plasma membrane (ii) lower levels of sphingolipids reaching the yeast vacuole. We have added the new data to Figure 6 and modified the Results section and Discussion section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The results here seem to differ from findings in mammals (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28658628).

We therefore expressed V5 tagged CDC50A and CDC50B as well as HARFP tagged ATP8B1 in HeLa cells from plasmids and depleted VPS53 by siRNA. We could only detect CDC50A and CDC50B as well as ATP8B1 signal in the ER which is probably an artifact of the massive overexpression (Figure for the referees). However, NPC2 is described to be transported to the yeast vacuole in an AP3 dependent pathway. Additionally, the long half-life (7.1 hours) of Npc2 makes it difficult to detect changes in protein abundance after 90 minutes of GARP depletion. We have edited our Discussion section to include these very important points.</p></body></sub-article></article>
