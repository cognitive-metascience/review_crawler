coordination of the proliferation and the migration of endothelial cells. Here, we investigated the regulatory role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in harmonizing angiogenesis processes in a three-dimensional in vitro model. We described a microRNA network which contributes to the observed down- and upregulation of proliferative and migratory genes, respectively. Global analysis of miRNA–target gene interactions identified two sub-network modules, the first organized in upregulated miRNAs connected with downregulated target genes and the second with opposite features. miR-424–5p and miR-29a-3p were selected for the network validation. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches targeting these microRNAs impaired angiogenesis, suggesting that these modules are instrumental to the temporal coordination of endothelial migration and proliferation. Interestingly, miR-29a-3p and its targets belong to a selective biomarker that is able to identify colorectal cancer patients who are responding to anti-angiogenic treatments. Our results provide a view of higher-order interactions in angiogenesis that has potential to provide diagnostic and therapeutic insights.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>network</kwd><kwd>VEGF</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12182</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bussolino</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18652</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bussolino</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009885</institution-id><institution>Regione Piemonte</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A1907A Deflect</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bussolino</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003407</institution-id><institution>Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRIN 2017, 2017237P5X</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bussolino</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003196</institution-id><institution>Ministero della Salute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Era-net TRS-2018-00000689</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bussolino</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007364</institution-id><institution>Fondazione CRT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bussolino</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22910</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bussolino</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003407</institution-id><institution>Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FPRC 5xmille 2016 Biofilm</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bussolino</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Coordinated microRNAs activity induced by VEGF represses cell proliferation and favors cell migration at the onset of sprouting angiogenesis in endothelial cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The expansion of a vascular network through the sprouting angiogenesis (SA) process requires a coordinated control of many cellular functions, including the activation of quiescent endothelial cells (ECs), cell protrusion, basal lamina and extracellular matrix degradation, cell migration and proliferation, deposition of new basement membrane, cell junctions and cell polarity alteration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011</xref>). In response to an angiogenic stimulus, activated ECs acquire distinct specialized phenotypes to accomplish these different tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>), ultimately leading to the formation of a new functional vascular network. In particular, during SA, ECs dynamically switch from a tip phenotype, which guides the network expansion, to a stalk cell state that is characterized by active proliferation.</p><p>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A) is the most prominent cytokine that activates a genetic program that sustains this morphogenetic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simons et al., 2016</xref>). Transcriptomic analysis of tip and stalk cells isolated from the retinal vascular plexus showed differential expression of molecular determinants, represented by genes that are involved in extracellular matrix remodeling for tip cells and that encode components of the Notch signaling pathway for stalk cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">del Toro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strasser et al., 2010</xref>). It also has been proposed that the EC fate decision towards the tip or stalk cell phenotype is affected by VEGF-A gradient concentration in the surrounding extracellular matrix and by VEGF receptors expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, the gene expression regulatory events that sustain the initial transition from quiescent to activated ECs in response to an angiogenic stimulus have not yet been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that such phenotypic transition would require profound transcriptomic alterations that are brought about through the coordination of multiple regulation layers, including microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that extensively modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by targeting the mRNAs of protein-coding genes, directing their repression through mRNA degradation or (to a lesser extent) inhibition of protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, one of the first functions attributed to miRNAs was the control of developmental processes in which a morphogen gradient directs cell fate by activating specific genetic programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Inui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ivey and Srivastava, 2015</xref>). In this scenario, miRNAs are an integral part of the regulatory network that allows transitions between different cell states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hornstein and Shomron, 2006</xref>). A role for miRNAs in ECs biology and vascular development has been established in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of two endonucleases that are required for mature miRNAs generation, namely Dicer and Drosha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ha and Kim, 2014</xref>). The consequent reduction in the level of miRNAs resulted in alteration of several key properties of ECs, including their sprouting ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuehbacher et al., 2007</xref>), and impaired postnatal angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suárez et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The activity of specific miRNAs in connection with the VEGF signaling pathway components has been studied more extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dang et al., 2013</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that miR-15a and miR-16, among other miRNAs, repress VEGF expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chamorro-Jorganes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yin et al., 2012</xref>), whereas miR-126 promotes VEGF signaling by targeting the downstream effector <italic>PIK3R2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fish et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, miR-27b and miR-221 are required for tip cell specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biyashev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nicoli et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) technology allowed the generation of a complete annotation of the miRNAs that are expressed by two-dimensional cultured human ECs in normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuosmanen et al., 2017</xref>) or hypoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Voellenkle et al., 2012</xref>) conditions. Yet, the extent to which miRNAs could affect ECs phenotypic specification during SA has not been fully captured to date. Using RNAseq technology and network analysis, we exploited a three-dimensional model of SA that specifically describes the lateral inhibition-driven tip cell selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heiss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nowak-Sliwinska et al., 2018</xref>), which is considered to be the first step in capillary nascence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eilken and Adams, 2010</xref>). The information obtained was used to generate a co-expression network encompassing the post-transcriptionally regulated interactions between modulated miRNAs and their predicted protein-coding gene targets. Here, we show that in the initial step of SA, miRNAs act cooperatively to give robustness to the specification of the tip cell phenotype by reducing the expression of genes that are associated with cell-cycle progression and of members of the mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that sustains VEGF-A-mediated cell proliferation, while de-repressing genes that are involved in cell migration and extracellular matrix remodeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>VEGF-A induces the tip phenotype of endothelial cells in a 3D model of sprouting angiogenesis</title><p>To study the activation of quiescent endothelial cells induced by an angiogenic stimulus, and the impact that miRNAs may exert on this process, we exploited a three-dimensional (3D) model that mimics the initial phase of SA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heiss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nowak-Sliwinska et al., 2018</xref>). ECs were induced to form 3D spheroids that are characterized by mature EC–EC junctions that are responsible for quiescent proliferation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weidemann et al., 2013</xref>). Spheroids were then embedded in a 3D collagen matrix and exposed to VEGF-A to trigger SA and to stimulate the formation of capillary-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Spheroids that had been exposed to VEGF-A for 18 hr (SPHV) and control spheroids (SPHC) were then processed for long- and small-RNAseq. Expression analysis of protein-coding genes identified 3071 differentially expressed (DE) genes in SPHV compared to SPHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), revealing dramatic changes in the global transcriptomic profile during the early phase of sprouting. Upregulation of VEGFR2, the major VEGF signal transducer, was validated by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). By looking at the expression of known tip and stalk cell markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Bock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">del Toro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strasser et al., 2010</xref>), we observed a general upregulation of tip marker genes and a downregulation of stalk marker genes in the comparison between SPHV and SPHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To visualize the organization of tip and stalk cells in this model, we analyzed the tip cell markers DLL4 and CXCR4 by immunofluorescence, or we transduced ECs with a fluorescent reporter of Notch activity to visualize stalk cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Although the EC sprouts strongly expressed DLL4 and CXCR4, cells in which the Notch reporter was activated were present only occasionally, so ECs largely acquired a tip-cell phenotype. Furthermore, manipulation of the Notch pathway by the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT or by exogenous DLL4 resulted in increased or reduced sprouting, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Altogether, these observations indicate that this sprouting model can be used, at this specific developmental time point, to represent the early phase of VEGF-A response that involves activation of quiescent ECs and differentiation to tip cells.</p><p>To identify key biological pathways or that set of genes that is relevant to the sprouting process, the gene expression dataset was interrogated by taking advantage of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). When comparing SPHV with SPHC, this analysis confirmed the upregulation of known VEGF-A responder genes (‘VEGF-A UP’), and revealed a positive enrichment of gene sets that are representative of several biological pathways and classes of molecules, including ‘Translation’, ‘Cell adhesion molecules’, ‘Integrin pathway’, ‘Extracellular matrix organization’, and ‘Collagen formation’. Altogether, these alterations in gene expression mirror the transcriptional landscape that allows the migratory process. Other representative enriched pathways included ‘Oxidative phosphorylation’ and ‘Lysosome’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>VEGF-A induces the tip phenotype of endothelial cells in a 3D model of sprouting angiogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EC spheroids were embedded in a collagen matrix and stimulated with VEGF-A to induce endothelial cell sprouting.

Nonetheless, and in agreement with the non-proliferating tip cell phenotype, GSEA showed a strongly negative enrichment score (ES) for cell-cycle-controlling genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Indeed, when looking at the expression levels of genes belonging to the ‘cell cycle’ KEGG pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kanehisa et al., 2016</xref>), expression analysis showed that 52 genes out of 113 were DE in SPHV compared to SPHC, of which 50 were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Hypergeometric test confirmed a statistically significant over-representation of this subset of genes among all the DE genes (<italic>P </italic>= 7.40x10<sup>-5</sup>). Only cyclin D2 (CCND2) and cyclin E1 (CCNE1), two genes belonging to the cyclin family and participating in the G<sub>1</sub>phase of the cell cycle, were upregulated. The finding that VEGF-A did not activate the proliferation of ECs and the accompanying DNA synthesis was also confirmed by the negative ES of gene sets that are representative of pyrimidine metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and, to a lesser extent, purine metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Indeed, we observed a general downregulation of genes involved in de novo synthesis of nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Downregulations of the cyclin B1 gene and of IMPDH2, the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, were validated by a real-time PCR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). We then measured the activities of the enzymes PPAT and CAD, which are considered to be indices of de novo synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and of ATIC, which catalyzes the last step of purine synthesis, respectively. VEGF-A stimulation decreased the activity of these three enzymes in the 3D model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) indicating that, in this condition, de novo nucleotide synthesis is not required. On the contrary, their activity significantly increased in a control experiment performed with ECs cultured in 2D conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Measurement of the percentage of cells that entered the S phase of the cell cycle confirmed that SPHC displayed a quiescent, non-proliferative status, and that VEGF-A was not able to trigger cell proliferation in spheroids significantly within an 18-hr time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). By contrast, VEGF-A activity on cell proliferation was well evident in cells cultured in standard 2D conditions, both in a proliferation assay and in a GSEA of the corresponding microarray data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). Furthermore, ECs that were mitotically inactivated by mitomycin C treatment maintained the ability to migrate and to form endothelial sprouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Taken together, these observations indicate that, in 3D conditions, early VEGF-A activity is primarily directed towards cell migration rather than towards cell proliferation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Early VEGF-A response does not involve cell proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GSEA plot showing negative association with the ‘cell cycle’ gene set in SPHV compared to SPHC.

To assess the impact of endogenous miRNAs on the phenotypic differentiation that occurs during SA, we applied a bioinformatics pipeline based on the co-expression analysis of miRNAs and protein-coding genes, the prediction of miRNA target genes, and the association of miRNAs with biological pathways, followed by network analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We first performed pair-wise correlation analysis between miRNAs and the expression of protein-coding expression, and plotted the distribution of the correlator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We then isolated the subset of pairs that contained evolutionarily conserved or non-conserved miRNA–target gene interactions, based on TargetScan predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2015</xref>). The frequency distribution of the correlator for the conserved interactions subset showed a significant enrichment in negative correlations compared to that for the entire dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, blue line). This is indicative of the repressive activity exerted by miRNAs on their targets; that is, when a miRNA is upregulated, its protein-coding gene target is downregulated and vice-versa. By contrast, the non-conserved interactions subset did not show any significant alteration in the correlator frequency distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Considering that target-site conservation is believed to be an indication of functional repression for mammalian miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>), the integration of the SA gene expression dataset with information about evolutionarily conserved miRNA–target gene interactions provides information on the global activity of miRNAs taking place during the early sprouting phase. Therefore, this strategy permits the identification of target genes and biological processes that are more likely to be affected by miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation.</p><p>GSEA-based analysis of correlation between miRNA expression and groups of genes participating in the regulation of specific biological pathways, represented as gene sets, was also used to support our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This analysis identified five clusters of genesets representing distinct biological functions that are modulated during SA, together with their associated miRNAs. Gene ontology-based enrichment analysis performed on the genes contained in each cluster showed the following classes: 1) extracellular matrix remodeling and cell migration, 2) protein translation and metabolic processes, 3) intracellular signaling pathways, 4) RNA and protein processing, and, 5) cell cycle, DNA repair and MAPK cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Clusters 1 and 2 contained genes that are mostly upregulated in SPHV compared to SPHC, whereas clusters 3, 4 and 5 contained genes that are mostly downregulated. To generate the global post-transcriptional regulatory network that sustains SA, the results from the above analyses were integrated. The resulting miRNA-centered co-expression network is composed of 149 miRNAs and 717 protein-coding genes connected by 1713 edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). This network is essentially characterized by two individual components: one representing upregulated miRNAs connected with downregulated target genes, and one representing downregulated miRNAs connected with upregulated target genes.

The data shown so far demonstrate that genes controlling cell proliferation were strongly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), as were the expression levels of miRNAs correlated with genes associated with cell division and the MAPK cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). On these bases, we asked whether miRNAs have a role in suppressing the proliferative signal downstream VEGF-A through ERK pathway inhibition, while supporting cell migration in a 3D context. To this purpose, we interrogated the previously defined global post-transcriptional network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), and extracted the nodes corresponding to genes that encode known MAP kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Craig et al., 2008</xref>) together with their targeting miRNAs. Mapping of these interactions generated a network composed of one major component, which represents the inhibitory activity of miRNAs over several MAP kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These MAP kinases showed reduced expression in SPHV compared to SPHC. The <italic>TAOK1</italic> gene, whose protein product is a kinase that activates stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raman et al., 2007</xref>), and <italic>MAPK1</italic>, whose protein product is ERK2, were the most targeted genes in this sub-network, being targeted by 11 and 7 different miRNAs, respectively. Notably, all components constituting the ERK module, namely C-Raf (<italic>RAF1</italic>), MEK (<italic>MAP2K1</italic>) and ERK2 (<italic>MAPK1</italic>), were represented. Among the four members composing the p38MAPK family (p38α, -β, -γ and -δ), only p38α (<italic>MAPK14</italic>) was present, but this gene was not connected with the major component of the network because its expression is increased in SPHV compared to SPHC. Downregulation of <italic>RAF1</italic>, <italic>MAP2K1</italic>, <italic>MAPK1</italic> and <italic>TAOK1</italic>, and upregulation of <italic>MAPK14</italic> in SPHV compared to SPHC, was validated by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

These hub miRNAs therefore should be pivotal to the network architecture and to the post-transcriptional regulatory activity that sustains the sprouting process. To validate the accuracy of the network analysis, and the relevance of the predicted miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional control of the genetic program sustaining SA, we subjected two miRNAs to further investigations. To validate the network, we selected miR-424–5p and miR-29a-3p, which are well-known miRNAs involved in angiogenesis regulation, and showed a high number of interactions with coding genes. miR-424–5 p was upregulated and targeted 98 genes, which were mainly related to intracellular signaling, including the MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). miR-29a-3p was downregulated and controlled the post-transcriptional regulation of 25 genes, mostly related to extracellular matrix remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). These miRNA–target interactions are also reported in the publicly available databases miRTarBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chou et al., 2018</xref>), TarBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karagkouni et al., 2018</xref>) and starBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2014</xref>), which store miRNA–mRNA interactions supported by experimental evidence. In particular, for miR-424–5 p, 97 out of 98 interactions were present in these databases (24 of them in all three databases, and 73 in one or two); for miR-29a-3p, 23 out of 25 interactions were present in the databases (7 of them in all three databases, 16 in one or two) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). RNAseq expression data for miR-424–5p and miR-29a-3p in SPHC and SPHV were confirmed by real-time PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The expression of these two miRNAs can also be altered when the Notch pathway is manipulated. In fact, inhibition of the Notch pathway with DAPT, which increases sprouting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), increased the expression of miR-424–5p and reduced the expression of miR-29a-3p; the opposite effect was obtained when spheroids were treated with exogenous DLL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>).</p><p>To assess the role of miR-424–5p and miR-29a-3p in the sprouting process, we altered their expression in ECs by using miRNA mimics or inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), and performed the sprouting assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Quantification of sprout areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) indicated that both upregulation by miRNA mimics and downregulation by miRNA inhibitors of miR-424–5p and miR-29a-3p impaired the ability of ECs to sprout, suggesting that the equilibrium of the network architecture requires that the expression of these two hub miRNAs is maintained at controlled levels. In a tip competition assay, spheroids were generated by mixing an equal number of ECs expressing the fluorescent protein DsRed with ECs transfected with miR-424–5p or miR-29a-3p mimics or inhibitors. Fluorescent or non-fluorescent cells occupying the tip position of the sprouts were counted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> shows that cells with altered expression of miR-424–5p or miR-29a-3p were impaired in reaching the tip cell position. To ascertain the robustness of the gain-of-function/loss-of-function approach, we also altered the expression of miR-16–5 p, which belongs to the same family as miRNA-424–5p, with which it putatively shares the same subset of target genes. However, our network analysis, which integrates target predictions with expression data, predicted a different subset of target genes for miR-424–5p and miR-16–5 p in the spheroid model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), and miR-16–5 p appeared to be a more peripheral miRNA that had only 16 predicted target genes. Indeed, miR-16–5 p modulation did not affect sprouting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). miR-424–5p and miR-29a-3p expression was significantly reduced in <italic>DICER</italic><sup>KD</sup> spheroids compared to <italic>DICER</italic><sup>WT</sup> spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>), suggesting that impaired expression of these two miRNAs could account, at least in part, for the sprouting defects observed in spheroids after <italic>DICER</italic> knock-down and in agreement with their role in network hierarchy. Furthermore, modulation of miR-424–5p, which is involved in the MAPK sub-network shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, resulted in the alteration of P-ERK activity according to the bioinformatics prediction, whereas modulation of miR-29a-3p, which is not involved in this network, was not effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>The effect of modulation of miR-424–5p and miR-29a-3p on cell proliferation was also tested in the spheroid model, the limitation of this assay being that the inhibition of cell proliferation cannot be evaluated as it is already close to zero. Indeed, none of the treatments could significantly increase cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In a 2D VEGF-dependent cell proliferation assay, however, treatment with the miR-424–5p mimic was able to reduce cell proliferation by 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). When tested in a 2D VEGF-dependent cell migration experiment, the miR-424–5p mimic had a positive effect on cell migration, whereas the miR-29a-3p mimic had a negative effect, the latter in agreement with its predicted role as a negative regulator of cell migration. miRNA inhibitors, however, did not show any significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>To further validate miR-424–5p and miR-29a-3p activity in the different biological pathways identified by the network analysis, we used real-time PCR to analyze the expression of 10 predicted target genes for miR-424–5p and 10 for miR-29a-3p. The targets investigated included genes involved in cell proliferation control (<italic>MAP2K1</italic>, <italic>CCND2</italic>), as well as genes involved in cell migration and extracellular remodeling (<italic>ITGA2</italic>, <italic>NID1</italic>), whose alteration could account for the phenotype observed. Indeed, we were able to verify a reduction in the expression of target genes when the corresponding miRNA mimic was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H,I</xref>). The effect of the miRNA inhibitors on the selected targets was, however, less pronounced, and we were able to observe upregulation for only three target genes for each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed the expression of other miR-424–5p and miR-29a-3p targets that are present in their respective miRNA subnetworks and that were not previously analyzed.

This might be explained by the existence of a broader effect on the network architecture that would involve indirect miRNA–miRNA interactions. To gain more insights into the impact that modulation of a hub miRNA can have on the global network architecture, we analyzed the expression of a large panel of miRNAs (of which 127 are represented in the SA network) by TaqMan array microRNA cards when miR-424–5p or miR-29a-3p were either upregulated or downregulated. The results indicate that 76 miRNAs showed altered expression (|∆∆Ct| &gt; 2) upon up- or downmodulation of miR-424–5p or miR-29a-3p in at least two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

This type of tumor was chosen because angiogenesis plays an important role in its progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battaglin et al., 2018</xref>), and some of the patients benefit from anti-angiogenic therapy with the VEGF blocker bevacizumab. 450 CRC samples were first ranked by their endothelial gene signature or endothelial score, a parameter that takes into account the expression of 35 EC-specific genes, not expressed by CRC or other stromal components, and that correlates with ongoing angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Isella et al., 2015</xref>). When GSEA was used to correlate the different miRNA-target gene subsets obtained from the network analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>) with CRC samples, we observed a significant positive enrichment for the miR-29a-3p-targets subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), meaning that expression of miR-29a-3p targets is higher in CRCs that have a high endothelial score. Furthermore, average expression in CRC samples of the genes that were present in the network analysis and that are upregulated in SPHV (upregulated module, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>) also showed a significant positive correlation with endothelial score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Likewise, GSEA analysis in which the endothelial score was used as phenotype classifier revealed a significant enrichment of the upregulated module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) and allowed the identification of a core gene set of 58 genes that are coherently regulated in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>).

We showed that initial response to VEGF-A in ECs consists of a profound remodeling of the transcriptome, which allows differentiation toward the tip phenotype. This includes the activation of genes that regulate extracellular matrix remodeling, which is essential to the migratory process, and the repression of genes that promote cell proliferation and nucleotide de novo synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The observation that these two fundamental VEGF-A downstream pathways might not be synchronous in tip cells is in agreement with earlier studies on pathophysiological angiogenesis, in which it was demonstrated that the onset of vascular sprouting depends on the migration of existing ECs and does not require EC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ausprunk and Folkman, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sholley et al., 1984</xref>). The spheroid model described here cannot, however, recapitulate all of the molecular events that lead to the formation of a more complex vascular bed. Furthermore, it cannot allow the analysis of tip-stalk cell dynamics because of the inability to differentiate stalk cells properly. This can be attributed to the intrinsic short life of the model compared to the mouse retina model and to the absence of other co-regulatory events, such as the generation of a VEGF gradient by neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okabe et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, the specificity of this model in the generation of tip cells allowed the analysis, at a molecular level, of the post-transcriptional regulation that sustains tip cells selection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functions of miRNA in the context of regulatory networks</title><p>Here, information about the expression of miRNAs was used to generate a global post-transcriptional regulatory network based on co-expression between miRNAs and their predicted protein-coding target genes. Using this unbiased approach, we were able to emphasize a role of miRNAs in repressing genes that regulate cell proliferation and other signaling pathways downstream of VEGF. Such pathways include the MAPKs signaling cascade, which is mainly involved in transducing the VEGF-A mitogenic signal. Meanwhile, miRNAs also promoted the expression of genes that are involved in extracellular matrix remodeling.</p><p>Several studies have highlighted the importance of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional interactions in the shaping of global regulatory networks. The connections involving both transcription factors and miRNAs can be described in terms of small regulatory patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hornstein and Shomron, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsang et al., 2007</xref>). Some circuits topologies, in their incoherent form, can be associated with positive correlation patterns between the expression of miRNAs and their predicted target genes, and are generally thought to have a buffering function on transcriptional noise. On the other hand, the coherent form of miRNA-target circuits is thought to mediate a post-transcriptional reinforcement of transcriptional regulation and is associated with negative correlation schemes of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cora' et al., 2017</xref>). Our experimental setup intrinsically highlights and selects such negative correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In this context, miRNA activity is meant to reinforce the transcriptional program and to facilitate phenotypic transitions by precisely shaping a genetic program that is triggered by external cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ebert and Sharp, 2012</xref>). In principle, however, we cannot preclude the presence, among the miRNA–gene network presented, of a later layer of indirect interactions between miRNAs and their targets or between the miRNAs themselves that is able to fine-tune the behavior of the network elements.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Regulation of MAP kinase activity by miRNAs</title><p>To demonstrate carefully the robustness of the post-transcriptional regulatory network described here at a system level, we performed a series of experimental validation by envisaging two different approaches: 1) removal of mature miRNAs by <italic>DICER</italic> knock-down to evaluate the global effects of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional activity on SA, and 2) validation of predicted targets for two miRNAs identified as hubs from the network analysis. For the first validation approach, we focused on a MAPK-specific subnetwork, due to its role in cell proliferation control, that pinpointed a coordinated miRNA inhibitory activity on the ERK module, represented by the <italic>RAF1</italic>, <italic>MAP2K1</italic> and <italic>MAPK1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Although the process that is triggered by a mitogenic stimulus depends on subsequent substrate phosphorylation throughout the MAPK cascade, it has been shown that the final outcome can also be influenced by miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of MAPK genes themselves.

In fact, previous studies attributed the angiogenesis defects induced by <italic>DICER</italic> inhibition to a reduction of VEGF-induced proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suárez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suárez et al., 2008</xref>). However, the mechanistic demonstration of this hypothesis was limited to in vitro experiments that used 2D-cultured ECs only. Although we confirmed the reported effects of <italic>DICER</italic> inhibition in 2D cultures, we also demonstrated that the activation of ECs that enables tip cell selection and migration (the first step in SA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011</xref>]) benefits from a miRNA-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation. Therefore, in the more complex in vivo scenario, in which different ratios of migratory (tip) and proliferating (stalk) ECs exist simultaneously, miRNAs could have different effects depending on the EC phenotype considered. Nevertheless, owing to its broad effect on the expression of miRNAs, <italic>DICER</italic> inhibition could also have affected regulatory pathways other than ERK, and thus could have contributed to the observed phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Role of two hub miRNAs in the post-transcriptional regulatory network</title><p>For the second validation approach, we focused on two hub miRNAs: miR-424–5p and miR-29a-3p, which belong to the network component containing up- and downregulated miRNAs, respectively. Their expression could be further modulated when the Notch pathway is either repressed or activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>), supporting the concept that their regulation promotes tip cell specification. Earlier studies in two-dimensional EC cultures reported that miR-424–5p upregulation reduced VEGF-induced proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chamorro-Jorganes et al., 2011</xref>), or indirectly modulated HIF-α expression thus promoting angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghosh et al., 2010</xref>), whereas miR-29a inhibition impaired cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is also known that a widespread feature of miRNA activity toward a specific target is context-dependency, which also highlights the importance of target validation under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erhard et al., 2014</xref>). In our three-dimensional model, integration of expression data with target prediction allowed the identification of context-specific targets. In fact, miR-424–5p showed preferential targeting activity towards genes that are associated with cell-cycle progression and intercellular signaling, whereas miR-29a-3p activity was more specific to genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). A similar targeting pattern, for both miRNAs, has been described in previous evidence-based computational studies in different cellular models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsang et al., 2010</xref>). Our independent analyses in ECs support the concept that a single miRNA can act on different targets belonging to the same pathway to reinforce its biological effect.</p><p>Finally, our unbiased approach disclosed an unpredicted hierarchical role of miR-424–5p and miR-29a-3p in a complex process such as SA. In fact, perturbation of miR-424–5p and miR-29a-3p expression levels propagated throughout the network, causing alterations in the expression levels of a large number of other miRNAs, including miRNAs that share coding targets with miR-424–5p or mir-29a-3p. Considering that each gene in the network is targeted by several different miRNAs, such broad network rearrangement could explain why inhibition of a single miRNA did not result in a significant increase in the expression of all its targets in a predictable way, and why inhibition of miR-424–5p alone was not as effective as removal of miRNAs by DICER knock-down in rescuing cell proliferation upon VEGF-A stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Signature of the activity of miRNAs in tumor angiogenesis</title><p>To prove the strength of our experimental design and extend our findings to clinical data, we investigated the angiogenic post-transcriptional activity in human tumors. Indeed, in a collection of 450 CRC, we successfully challenged the correlation between gene modules that constitute a signature of the activity of miRNAs and ongoing angiogenesis in the stromal compartment. A significant correlation was, however, not detected for the downregulated gene modules, which mostly included cell-proliferation-associated genes. This can be explained by the fact that, in whole tumor transcriptomic data, the signal from the highly proliferating epithelial cancer cells overcome the signal coming from the less represented ECs. In addition, a signature composed of 58 sprouting-associated genes, which also included miR-29a-3p targets, was able to identify patients who benefitted from anti-angiogenic treatment with the VEGF-A blocking agent bevacizumab. On one side, this strengthens the evidence of the involvement of post-transcriptional regulation in tumor angiogenesis, and on the other side, it paves the way for future development of predictive markers for VEGF-A blocking agents. This analysis could also be extended to other cancer types, such as ovarian, cervical, non-small cell lung cancer or glioblastoma, in which angiogenesis is recognized to support tumor growth and in which bevacizumab is an approved therapeutic option. In summary, network analysis of whole transcriptomic data obtained from an in vitro SA model identified miRNA-mediated regulatory modules that fine-tune the response of ECs to VEGF-A and that could be exploited to identify new druggable biomarkers in angiogenesis-related diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary cell cultures</title><p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from the cords of newborns by collagenase digestion of the interior of the umbilical vein, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nowak-Sliwinska et al., 2018</xref>).

(miRNAs) are pivotal regulator of gene expression during cell behaviors. Yet, the network of target-gene regulation that enables their mode of function is often difficult to decipher in biological systems due to the high complexity of their predicted mRNA matches. Sprouting angiogenesis is mediated by the activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) signaling cascade that coordinate proliferation, migration and survival of endothelial cells. Using a combination of computational and genomics analysis of VEGF-signaling responses in 3D spheroid and 2 D endothelial cell-based assays, the authors show that VEGF-A activated a complex miRNA-centered co-expression network characterized by the repression of cell cycle genes and de-repression of extracellular matrix remodeling and cell migration genes. The consequences of loss of miRNA processing, via Dicer silencing, support that VEGF-A activates such network changes to enable migration instead of a proliferation phenotype during tip-cell formation in the sprouting angiogenesis of the 3D-spheroid model. In addition, miRNAs were found dispensable for VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis in the 2D endothelia cell model. This work illuminates the high degree of post-transcriptional regulation that controls endothelial cells responses to VEGF-A and will improve our understanding of different modes of VEGF-A function during the genesis of blood vessels in diverse tissues.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A regulatory microRNA network controls endothelial cell phenotypic switch during sprouting angiogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Minna U Kaikkonen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Rosano et al. investigates the role of miRNAs in the regulation of angiogenesis in 3D in vitro model. They compare the 3D angiogenesis model to 2D angiogenesis and demonstrate that the 3D conditions directs cell migration over cell proliferation. In the second part of the manuscript, they identify post-transcriptional regulatory networks by performing pair-wise correlation of mRNA and miRNA expression. They provide evidence that MAPKs play an important role in sprouting angiogenesis through regulation of RAF1, MAP2K1, MAPK1 and TAOK1 expression. Finally, they provide characterization of the effect of miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p in angiogenesis and regulation of genes implicated in cell proliferation and migration.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>The reviewers find that the paper describes a very interesting study of the mechanism by which VEGF-A-signaling coordinate tip cells behaviors during sprouting angiogenesis via controlling post-transcriptional regulation.</p><p>Central conclusions:</p><p>1) Trascriptome analysis indicates that a proliferation-to-migration switch occurs during VEGF-A induction of sprouting angiogenesis in 3D spheroids vs. 2D cell culture assay.</p><p>2) Post-transcriptional regulatory networks driven by the miRNA machinery protein, Dicer, are essential to suppress proliferative tip cells behavior in 3D and promote motile behavior.</p><p>3) miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p regulation of genes hub is implicated in buffering cell proliferation and migration during sprouting angiogenesis.</p><p>The reviewers raise a number of concerns that must be addressed before the paper can be accepted. There is some skepticism on how the data discovered with the spheroids 3D vs. 2D models can be relevant for the scientific community that study sprouting angiogenesis in vivo. This point could be substantially improved by providing a deeper phenotypic characterization of spheroids model (with or without miRs) as suggested by reviewers. Further experimentation is also required to better characterize and validate the conclusions draw by the manipulation of miR-424 and 29 -signaling pathways in spheroids.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is unclear if the 3D spheroid assay is a suitable model for probing coordination of tip cell proliferation and migration in angiogenesis. The switch from quiescent to activated angiogenic endothelial cell phenotype is classically associated with (and dependent on) a global increase in proliferation and high levels of P-ERK in tip cells – both of which are not observed in the spheroid assay. Indeed, recent work elegantly demonstrates that mid to low levels of P-ERK drive proliferation in the mouse retinal vessels, whereas high levels reduce tip cell proliferation via induction of p21 (Pontes-Quero, Nat. Comm. 2019). However, Rosano et al. indicate that P-ERK is repressed and dispensable in spheroid angiogenesis. Although the authors point out key differences between their 2D and 3D assays, such discrepancies between the spheroid assay and in vivo observations are overlooked. In particular:</p><p>- Why is ERK dispensable in this system but indispensable in vivo?</p><p>- Why are such low levels of proliferation (&lt;4% of cells versus &gt;90% in vivo) observed and why so variable between experiments (4% in Figure 2F versus 0.42% in Figure 6E – rising to only 2% upon DICER KD – i.e. below control levels of Figure 2F)? Do both tip and stalk cells not proliferate in this system? Considering spheroids are treated with VEGF for 18 hours, could the short 2 hour EdU pulse simply miss an earlier synchronized burst of VEGF-induced mitotic events?</p><p>- What is the organization of tip and stalk cells and localization of tip markers in this assay? Would a lack of stalk signatures upon VEGF stimulation suggest a disorganized structure? Does manipulation of Notch-mediated tip versus stalk identity generate predictable shifts in proliferation, P-ERK and miRNA expression? This information is key to confirming that VEGF-regulated miRNAs drive a tip (not stalk) phenotype, as proposed.</p><p>- Are phenotypes observed in the spheroid assay dependent or independent of p21?</p><p>2) How were the p38 and ERK selected? Evidently, the logical thing would have been to select those based on targets of those pathways being enriched in the Figure 3D but this is unclear from the manuscript.</p><p>3) Knockdown of DICER evidently has dramatic genome-wide effects through various pathways so it is impossible to rule out effects that act through other pathways than ERK. This should be clarified.</p><p>4) Can the authors prove that proliferation is promoted in the Dicer KO 3D cells using PCNA or cell cycle analysis via flow cytometer? It would be helpful to have some experiments that analyze the phenotype of the spheroid rather than the gene expression only.</p><p>5) Loss of Dicer promote the level of proliferative genes and inhibit SA, suggesting that the activation of proliferation inhibits SA – that is why it needs to be actively inhibited. However, I don't understand why inhibiting proliferation (with ERK inhibitor) in Dicer KO spheroid further reduces SA. The prediction is that SA in Dicer Ko should be rescued by the inhibition of proliferation, right? Why do they see a further decrease in absence of miRNAs?</p><p>6) I found the differences between Dicer/VEGF interaction in 3D vs. 2D model very interesting. Can the authors test if components of the miRNA machinery are differentially regulated by VEGF-A treatment in 3D vs. 2D? This should be easily extrapolated by their RNA seq data, or it could be easily done by qPCR with a time course of treatment with VEGF-A. I think that it would be interesting to know if vega regulates miRNAs biogenesis to mediate such a switch, or it is an innate response from the 3D vs. 2D cell behaviors? Perhaps some comments on this in the Discussion would be useful.</p><p>7) In general, the interpretation of proliferation vs. migration signaling in SA and why these should be regulated in 3D vs. 2D it is not clear. Do the authors believe that proliferation and migration need to be buffered to promote SA? Do they think that they need to be differentially regulated in time? For example, do they think that miRNA first stop proliferation then miRNA release migration? A clearer model that supports their main conclusion would be critical to follow the interpretation of these results.</p><p>8) The role of miR-424 and miR-29a have already been established in angiogenesis so the real novelty lies in identifying the target gene networks through which the miRNAs act. However, the validations are incomplete as only experimental evidence of miRNA mimics affecting gene expression (Figure 7D, E) is shown and the inhibitor data is missing. This missing experimental evidence should be provided.</p><p>9) Currently the experimental evidence provided under section &quot;Biological validation of the miRNA Hub network in regulating Sprouting Angiogenesis&quot; is insufficient to support the claim. To be able to present in an unbiased way that the miRNAs are regulating the computationally predicted networks, the authors need to perform RNA-seq analysis of mRNAs upon miRNA perturbation. This would significantly strengthen the manuscript that currently lies on predictions for miRNA effects and insufficient validation of few selected candidates.</p><p>10) miRNA-mRNA pairwise correlation demonstrated that miR-424-5p expression is induced and the targets (MAPK and cell cycle related) are repressed whereas the miR-29a-3p was downregulated and target mRNAs (ECM-related) upregulated. The angiogenesis assay (Figure 7D), however, does not support this. This puts in question the 3D model and whether it is more prone to any perturbation. Would you see an opposite effect in proliferation assay or in 2D angiogenesis model?</p><p>11) The functions of identified miRNA networks in angiogenesis are mostly implied rather than directly tested. As such, additional experimentation providing mechanistic insight would greatly improve the manuscript. For example:</p><p>- What is the function of modulating MAPK genes identified in Figure 5? Are P-ERK levels perturbed in VEGF-treated spheroids, as predicted?</p><p>- Which miRNAs are responsible for regulation of ERK pathway genes in Figure 5 and can modulation of these miRNAs predicable impact sprouting, P-ERK levels and proliferation?</p><p>- Likewise, does DICER impact P-ERK levels, as predicted in Figure 6?</p><p>- In Figure 7, does miR-inhibition increase target expression?</p><p>- Does miR mimic/inhibitor expression predictably increase/decrease proliferation and P-ERK?</p><p>- If so, can ERK inhibition further modulate effects of miR 424-5p? But not 29a-3p?</p><p>- It is stated that these miRNAs allow proliferation and migration to be &quot;spatially segregated in different EC populations&quot; but how would this be achieved? Are they expressed in distinct tip or stalk domains?</p><p>- If cells expressing miR 424-5p/29a-3p mimic/inhibitor are mixed with WT cells, how well do they compete for the tip position?</p><p>12) The relevance of last Results paragraph? I'd suggest the authors revise the text to better convey the main message. For example, &quot;Furthermore, average expression of genes belonging to the up-regulated module identified in the network analysis showed a significant positive correlation with endothelial score.&quot; What does this mean? Please explain the endothelial score in the text. What is the relevance of findings i.e. is the effect specific to CRC or would some cancers not show enrichment for angiogenesis related gene modules?</p><p>13) The Discussion is confusing and would profit from more structure (separate paragraphs etc).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A regulatory microRNA network controls endothelial cell phenotypic switch during sprouting angiogenesis&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor and two reviewers.</p><p>The authors have improved the manuscript by clarifying many questions from the reviewers' comments and providing extensive further experimental evidence to support the conclusions. There are some points, however, that still need to be addressed.</p><p>1) To provide further validation of the miRNA-regulated networks (reply to reviewer comments 8-9), the authors demonstrated that up- or down-modulation of miR-424 and miR-29a significantly regulated several other miRNAs. The data, however, is not incorporated in the manuscript. Please include the data in the manuscript, to strengthen the conclusion of these two miRNAs representing central players of the transcriptional response.</p><p>2) Similarly, please provide the results evaluating the miR-424-5p and MiR-29-3p target expression upon inhibitor treatment (reply to reviewer comment 11).</p><p>3) The proliferation levels of &lt; 0.5% makes it impossible to evaluate if there are any differences in SPHC and SPHV or to demonstrate any effect of the manipulation of miR-424-5p and MiR-29-3p levels. Therefore, the authors should avoid to overly interpret the data and discuss the limitations. The authors should also provide the information about the miR-424-5p and MiR-29-3p mimics/inhibitors not affecting proliferation in the 3D model to complement the results shown for the 2D model (Figure 7—figure supplement 3) that currently was only mentioned in the response letter.</p><p>4) Figure 4. Please explain which is the upregulated and downregulated hub in the figure legend.</p><p>5) VEGF does further repress pro-proliferative genes, but this is not a phenotypic switch as there is no change in proliferative phenotype. Also, the function of this repression of pro-proliferative genes is unknown, as 424-5p miR inhibitor fails to increase proliferation. The subtle increase in EC proliferation (and pro-proliferative genes) seen upon DICER KD is not evidence that miRs block proliferation upon VEGF treatment, as only VEGF-treated cells are shown. Are these also elevated in non-VEGF-treated cells? The authors should show the cytofluorimetric analysis of EdU incorporation into the DNA in DICER-WT and DICER-KD spheroids without VEGF-A (Figure 6E) to support that the effects of Dicer are VEGF-A depended.</p><p>6) In addition, the dispensability of proliferation and ERK in spheroid SA does not demonstrate that they essentially have to be repressed to enable SA in WT cells. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to support profound statements such as &quot;the first SA step requires a miRNA-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation&quot;, or that migration and proliferation pathways &quot;cannot be activated at the same time&quot;. Please revise the statement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48095.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers raise a number of concerns that must be addressed before the paper can be accepted.

In particular:</p><p>- Why is ERK dispensable in this system but indispensable in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>Spheroid assay exploited in this manuscript is based on the capability of endothelial cells to sense an angiogenic stimulus in a 3D gel of collagen I. According to several published observations, this assay supports the formation of tip cells that precedes the elongation of individual capillary-like sprouts originating from single spheroids (Heiss et al., 2015). Indeed, this assay has been used to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of molecules on tip cell formation (Adam et al., 2013). The gene expression heatmap presented in Figure 1B confirms at molecular level these observations, showing that VEGF-stimulated spheroids are enriched in tip marker genes. Therefore, we are aware that this assay does not recapitulate the complexity of the tip-stalk dynamics occurring in in vivo sprouting angiogenesis; nonetheless, it is a powerful tool to understand the effect of angiogenic inducers in the first events of capillary nascence, which are characterized by the lateral inhibition-driven tip cell selection (Eilken et al., 2010). The limit of our assay is now specified in the last paragraph of the Introduction.</p><p>Regarding the role of ERK in VEGF signaling, the first version of the manuscript reported that treatment with the ERK inhibitor SCH 772984 did not alter sprout activity, suggesting a negligible involvement of ERK in sprouting. We also reported that spheroid stimulation by VEGF resulted in reduced expression of some members of MAPK family, but we did not evaluate the level of P-ERK. Following the reviewer’s request, the current version of the manuscript now reports the P-ERK amount in control spheroids and in VEGF-stimulated spheroids, evaluated by Mesoscale technology (see Materials and methods section). We demonstrated that VEGF stimulation decreases the basal level of P-ERK (Figure 5C). To better elucidate the correlation between ERK function and the predicted role of miR-mediated post-transcriptional control of SA, in the first version of the manuscript we analyzed MAPK1 expression in DICER-silenced endothelial cells and showed that its expression increased (Figure 6A). In the present version of the manuscript, we also analyzed P-ERK levels in DICER-silenced endothelial cells and showed that DICER silencing resulted in an increased amount of P-ERK (Figure 6B), thus supporting the observed sensitivity of the assay to ERK inhibitor as reported in the first version of the manuscript (first version Figure 6B, C, now Figure 6C, D). Furthermore, differential expression analysis performed with DESeq2 showed that CDKN1A (p21) mRNA is not differentially expressed (log<sub>2</sub>(Fold Change) = -0.17, P value adjusted = 0.68), and p21 inhibition by the selective drug UC2288 did not have any effect on sprouting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This indicates that sprouting, in this model and at the stage considered, does not depend on p21 activity.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48095-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We agree that our data do not support the recent observations published in Nature Communications by Benedicto’s group, which performed in vivo retina studies in mice. This discrepancy is now discussed in the Discussion section according to these points: (i) the different time scale characterizing the two models (hours versus days); (ii) the feature of our in vitro model, which precisely describes the early tip selection from a cell monolayer and its motion and cannot take into account other co-regulatory events characterizing SA, in comparison to the retina model where neurons play a relevant role in establishing available amount of VEGF (Okabe et al., 2014); (iii) the inability of the spheroid model to analyze tip-stalk dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Why are such low levels of proliferation (&lt;4% of cells versus &gt;90% in vivo) observed and why so variable between experiments (4% in Figure 2F versus 0.42% in Figure 6E – rising to only 2% upon DICER KD – i.e. below control levels of Figure 2F)?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for a mistake that happened during the uploading of the figures. The current manuscript contains the correct figure that shows a 0.04% of proliferating cells in SPHC and a 0.12% of proliferating cells in SPHV. (The correct figure was indeed already included in the initial submission version of the manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do both tip and stalk cells not proliferate in this system?</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, the SA model utilized here is not suitable to analyze stalk cell behavior, nor to study the interplay between tip and stalk cells. This limit is most probably due to the short life time of endothelial cells in these experimental conditions. This assumption is supported by the following observations:</p><p>i) RNAseq analysis clearly demonstrates that stalk specific genes are down-modulated in our experimental conditions (Figure 1B);</p><p>ii) DLL4 (tip cell marker) immunofluorescence shows a strong labeling of all endothelial cell sprouts (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A);</p><p>iii) Spheroids generated with endothelial cells transduced with a fluorescent reporter of Notch activity showed that very few cells activated the Notch pathway.

VEGF stimulated spheroids were fixed, permeabilized and stained with Ab anti-DLL4, or the DsRed fluorescent protein, indicative of Notch activity, was visualized. Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, which is representative of 16 different spheroids from two independent experiments, clearly shows that DLL4 and CXCR4 staining are predominant, while very few cells with active Notch signaling pathway (white arrow) contributed to the formation of endothelial sprouts, indicating that the model is markedly oriented toward the tip phenotype.

Notch pathway inhibition by DAPT, which favors the tip phenotype (Jakobsson et al., 2010), increased sprouting, while the opposite was obtained by treatment with exogenous DLL4.</p><p>ii) DAPT treatment resulted in increased expression of miR-424-5p and decreased expression of miR-29a-3p. The opposite effect was obtained with DLL4 treatment. This further supports the concept that miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p expression is regulated during tip cells specification. In fact, in our model miR-424-5p expression increases while miR-29a-3p expression decreases. Data about miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p expression after Notch pathway manipulation are now reported in Figure 7C, D.</p><p>iii) We analyzed the effect of Notch pathway manipulation on of P-ERK levels in SPHV, measured by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) technology and expressed as ratio of P-ERK/total ERK. The data obtained are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>. According with our envisaged scenario where inhibition of ERK pathway by miRNAs occurs during tip cells selection, Notch pathway inhibition by DAPT, which increases tip cells, further decreases P-ERK in SPHV. However, DLL4 stimulation does not result in a mirrored effect as reported for tip selection and miRNAs modulation.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48095-resp-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We underline that the complexity of signaling pathways, their reciprocal interferences, and the methods here used to modulate Notch pathway (a ligand versus a chemical inhibitor) can explain the incoherence between these results. Furthermore, the analysis of single signaling event (i.e. P-ERK) does not necessarily match an observed biological function (i.e. sprouting) because of the well-established occurrence of crosstalks, referring to the case where two inputs work through distinct signaling pathways but cooperate to regulate the cellular work. Therefore, we decided to not show some of these results because, in our opinion, they do not modify the general meaning of the other data obtained by Notch modulation, which confirm that VEGF triggers a tip phenotype in the early phase of SA by a miR-dependent mechanism. To explain the observed discrepancy between DDL4 and DAPT effect on VEGF mediated P-ERK level in tip cells, more experiments would be required, which are out of the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>iv) We analyzed cell proliferation levels by flow cytometry in SPHV treated with DAPT or DLL4. Cell proliferation was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). Considering the data shown in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2, we can explain these results as follows:</p><p>i) Stalk cells population, which should represent the proliferating component, in this model is negligible. Therefore, treatment with DAPT favors tip cell selection more than could actually decrease stalk cells number. In this situation, it is not possible to expect a reduction in cell proliferation rate which is already close to zero.</p><p>ii) DLL4 treatment reduced sprouting, meaning a reduction in tip cells rather than an increase in stalk cells number, which can explain the lack of a proliferative response.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48095-resp-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Are phenotypes observed in the spheroid assay dependent or independent of p21?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the sprouting assay in the presence of increasing concentrations of the p21-specific chemical inhibitor UC2288.

Evidently, the logical thing would have been to select those based on targets of those pathways being enriched in the Figure 3D but this is unclear from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The main observations taken into account were the strong down-regulation of genes controlling cell proliferation and the fact that MAPK1 (an upstream regulator of cell proliferation genes) is one of the genes most targeted by miRNAs in the whole network. The GO analysis presented in Figure 3D showed a selection of few (of many) GO terms with the lowest P-values. Indeed, the “MAPK cascade” term was present in the output of this analysis, and associated with the “blue” cluster. This information has been added to Figure 3D. MAPK1 and other MAP kinases constitute the “MAPK cascade” GO term, while p38 upstream activators are shared with the “<italic>JNK</italic> cascade”, which is associated with the “green” cluster in Figure 3D. Furthermore, p38 and ERK were selected on the basis of a huge number of papers that demonstrate that p38 and ERK represent two intermediate nodes of VEGF receptor signaling pathway able to switch the input respectively towards a motogenic or mitogenic activity. Excellent reviews overview this concept (Koch et al., 2011; Simons et al., 2016). The whole paragraph and Figure 3 have been reshaped for improved clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Knockdown of DICER evidently has dramatic genome-wide effects through various pathways so it is impossible to rule out effects that act through other pathways than ERK. This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments based on DICER silencing were planned to support the concept that miR-mediated post-transcriptional control is instrumental to SA and they have to be considered as complementary to the GOF and LOF experiments specifically targeting miR-29a-3p and miR-424-5p. The concept that DICER inhibition can affect multiple pathways is now clarified in the Discussion section at the end of the paragraph ‘Regulation of MAP Kinase activity by miRNAs’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Can the authors prove that proliferation is promoted in the Dicer KO 3D cells using PCNA or cell cycle analysis via flow cytometer? It would be helpful to have some experiments that analyze the phenotype of the spheroid rather than the gene expression only.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully underline that in the first version of the manuscript we measured the percentage of proliferating cells by EdU detection and flow cytometry (Figure 6E of the first version, now Figure 6F). In this experiment, as well as in all other experiments where we measured cell proliferation, the BrdU analog EdU is added to the cell culture where it is incorporated into the newly synthetized DNA in cells that are actively proliferating. The percentage of EdU positive cells therefore corresponds to the percentage of cells being in the S phase of the cell cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Loss of Dicer promote the level of proliferative genes and inhibit SA, suggesting that the activation of proliferation inhibits SA – that is why it needs to be actively inhibited. However, I don't understand why inhibiting proliferation (with ERK inhibitor) in Dicer KO spheroid further reduces SA. The prediction is that SA in Dicer KO should be rescued by the inhibition of proliferation, right? Why do they see a further decrease in absence of miRNAs?</p></disp-quote><p>We showed that loss of DICER increased cells proliferation. However, the lack of miRNA had an extensive effect on the transcriptome, due to their broad activity. For instance, DICER silencing caused a general downregulation of cell adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>, from the GSEA analysis of SPHV_DICER<sup>KD</sup> versus SPHV_DICER<sup>WT</sup>), which can account for reduced cell motility. We currently cannot rule out that the extensive rewiring of the network that sustains sprouting caused by the lack of miRNAs could benefit, to a certain extent, from increased ERK activation, and therefore making the system sensitive to ERK inhibition, i.e. presence of proliferating cells in the sprouts.</p><p>A second point to be considered is related to methodological aspects of our assay characterized by the presence of homotypic cellular junctions, which mediate a contact inhibition of cell proliferation. The stimulation of spheroids with VEGF triggers cell motility, loss of endothelial-endothelial junctions and in principle it should allow cell proliferation. The findings of this paper (e.g. miR-mediated arrest of cell-cycle) predict that the sequence migration/proliferation in sprouting angiogenesis is temporally regulated and reflects the tip/stalk dynamics occurring in vivo.</p><p>However, in this in vitro assay, the block of miRNA machinery by DICER silencing inhibits the motility phase of sprouting angiogenesis and subsequently impairs the cell-cell junction dismantling. This condition may mask the theoretical expected result of ERK inhibition in DICER-silenced cells.</p><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48095-resp-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I found the differences between Dicer/VEGF interaction in 3D vs. 2D model very interesting. Can the authors test if components of the miRNA machinery are differentially regulated by VEGF-A treatment in 3D vs. 2D? This should be easily extrapolated by their RNA seq data, or it could be easily done by qPCR with a time course of treatment with VEGF-A. I think that it would be interesting to know if vega regulates miRNAs biogenesis to mediate such a switch, or it is an innate response from the 3D vs. 2D cell behaviors? Perhaps some comments on this in the Discussion would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>From the expression datasets from 2D or 3D cells stimulated with VEGF we extracted information about genes involved in miRNA biogenesis (DGCR8, DICER1, DROSHA, TARBP2, XPO5) or in miRNA-target recognition (AGO1-4). The results of the differential expression (DE) analysis performed with LIMMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6</xref>) do not indicate any statistically significant change in these gene’s expression, either in 2D or 3D condition (fold change &gt;0.5 and adjusted P value &lt;0.05 for a gene to be considered differentially expressed).</p><fig id="respfig6"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48095-resp-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>This would suggest that VEGF regulates miRNAs expression at the transcriptional level, although we cannot rule out the existence of post-transcriptional modifications (i.e. phosphorylations) occurring to the proteins that constitute the miRNA machinery (Treiber et al., 2019), which could alter the catalytic activity of some of its components. It would be very interesting, therefore, to compare alterations of global miRNAs expression upon VEGF stimulation in 3D vs. 2D condition but we believe it is beyond the main scope of this paper. We did, nonetheless, measure the expression of miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p by real-time PCR in HUVECs cultured in 2D (H2D) and stimulated with VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref>, average of n=3 experiments ± SEM). In this condition, where VEGF triggers cell proliferation, miR-424-5p expression decreased after VEGF stimulation, as opposite to the spheroid model. miR-29a-3p expression was downregulated as in spheroids, in agreement with the fact that VEGF stimulation in 2D culture also activates cell scatter migration.</p><fig id="respfig7"><label>Author response image 7.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48095-resp-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In general, the interpretation of proliferation vs. migration signaling in SA and why these should be regulated in 3D vs. 2D it is not clear. Do the authors believe that proliferation and migration need to be buffered to promote SA? Do they think that they need to be differentially regulated in time? For example, do they think that miRNA first stop proliferation then miRNA release migration? A clearer model that supports their main conclusion would be critical to follow the interpretation of these results.</p></disp-quote><p>2D culture models cannot recapitulate the complexity of the in vivo environment. In a 2D culture of ECs stimulated with VEGF, proliferating cells coexist with cells with increased motility, due to dual role of VEGF on ECs as activator of both cell proliferation and cell migration. In the 3D spheroid model, however, being closer to an in vivo condition, it was possible to observe that cells that are initially contact-inhibited are induced to migrate by VEGF, while not entering in a proliferative state. We believe that miRNAs, by repressing proliferation genes, act in this phase as a switch that allows endothelial cells to enter the tip phenotype. A different (stalk) phenotype characterized by cell proliferation would emerge at a later point. It would be very interesting, therefore, to analyze miRNAs activity in stalk cells, but unfortunately in this model they are not enough represented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The role of miR-424 and miR-29a have already been established in angiogenesis so the real novelty lies in identifying the target gene networks through which the miRNAs act. However, the validations are incomplete as only experimental evidence of miRNA mimics affecting gene expression (Figure 7D, E) is shown and the inhibitor data is missing. This missing experimental evidence should be provided.</p><p>9) Currently the experimental evidence provided under section &quot;Biological validation of the miRNA Hub network in regulating Sprouting Angiogenesis&quot; is insufficient to support the claim. To be able to present in an unbiased way that the miRNAs are regulating the computationally predicted networks, the authors need to perform RNA-seq analysis of mRNAs upon miRNA perturbation. This would significantly strengthen the manuscript that currently lies on predictions for miRNA effects and insufficient validation of few selected candidates.</p></disp-quote><p>Points 8 and 9 raised by the reviewers concern very important aspects of the biology and functioning of miRNA-mediated regulatory networks. We decided to address point 8 and 9 together because, in our opinion, the requested experiments need to be discussed taking into account the general rules by which miRNA-mediated mechanisms occur in living cells and are common to the two points. Actually, it is well demonstrated that the principles of degeneracy and pluripotentiality of miRNA function imply that individual protein coding genes can be targeted by several miRNAs whereas a single miRNA may concomitantly regulate a subset of several different protein coding genes. We believe that the results presented in our work have to be interpreted in agreement to this principle. Before analyzing by mRNA-seq the SA gene network in endothelial cells in which miR-424 and 29a would be perturbed, to answer to point 9 issue we decided preliminarily to investigate the impact of GOF and LOF approaches targeting miR-424 and 29a on miRNA expression. To this purpose, by means of miRNA-PCR cards we studied the global effect of miRNA perturbation on the expression levels of a large panel of miRNAs, selected among those that are endogenously expressed in our model. The entire procedure was performed for the GOF of miR-424 and miR-29a, as well as for the LOF of the same two miRNAs. Strikingly, results point out a vast reshaping of endogenous miRNA levels upon the modulation of the two “hub” miRNAs, miR-424 and 29a, thus indicating that miR-424 and miR-29a modulation induces a deep re-wiring of the global miRNA network in addition to a modulation of their target coding genes. These miRNA-miRNA modulations are probably due to indirect interactions, e.g. TF-mediated. As example of the results, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig8">Author response image 8, a</xref> heatmap reporting the top-differentially expressed miRNAs (| logFC | &gt; 2.0) upon up- or down-modulation of miR-424 and miR-29a, having restricted the list to the miRNAs present in the two “hub” modules – in other words, modulated miRNAs that share the same targets with miR-424-5p or miR-29a-3p.</p><fig id="respfig8"><label>Author response image 8.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48095-resp-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The above experiments also highlighted the opposite effect on the modulated miRNAs between the GOF or LOF experiments, thus indicating a non-specular trend following the up-modulation or down-modulation procedure. The global reshaping of the miRNAs observed is likely to propagate to the downstream regulated target coding genes.</p><p>Overall, the interpretation of these results prompted us to stress a high interconnection among miRNA themselves and thus the miRNA-gene network, making it arduous to isolate the effect of a single miRNA from the global behavior of the whole miRNA network by means of a high-throughput mRNA-seq, at least in our system. On the basis of these results the mRNA-seq experiment suggested at point 9 seems not so robust to validate the predicted network, since our miRNA-card experiments demonstrate that the perturbation of one miRNA can reset the whole miRNA network and indeed change in unpredictable ways the network of differential expressed coding genes. In other words, the expected results of a mRNA-seq experiment upon GOF or LOF of miR-424 and miR-29a would probably require fully recapitulating the behavior of their target genes, and the discussion of such indirect interactions. We believe this is a very interesting observation that will need specific effort to be explored but it concerns the biology of miRNA rather than the control of SA and we plan to address this issue in future studies. Inside this scenario, we consider a major point in our work the results reported in the section “DICER Knock-Down Rescues VEGF-A Proliferative Effect”, where we used a DICER Knock-Down strategy to illustrate the rescue of the sprouting phenotype rather than the effect of a single miRNA. At the same time, the biological validations reported in the section “Biological validation of the miRNA Hub network regulating Sprouting Angiogenesis” illustrate the role of miR-424 and miR-29a as overall capable of sustain the observed phenotype upon up- or down-modulation. Of note, by real-time PCR, expression of 10 predicted target genes for miR-424-5p and 10 for miR-29a-3p were already validated in the current version of our manuscript. To partially overcome this issue, thinking also to reviewer’s point 8, we investigated publicly available databases (namely MirTarbase, DIANA Tarbase and StarBase) of experimentally validated miRNA-gene interactions for the presence of miR-424 and miR-29a target genes among the ones present in our two hubs. The results are the following:</p><p>For miR-424:</p><p>97 out of 98 of the miR-424 hub target genes are validated in the above databases (24 of them validated by all the three databases, whilst 73 of them are validated by at least one).</p><p>For miR-29a:</p><p>23 out of 25 of the miR-29a target genes are validated in the above databases (7 of them validated by all the three databases, whilst 16 of them are validated by at least one).</p><p>This information has been added in the Results section ‘Biological validation of the miRNA Hub Network Regulating Sprouting Angiogenesis’ and as Table 1—source data 1.</p><p>Summing up the above analysis, we can say that &gt; 90% of the miR-424 and miR-29a target genes present in our two hubs are already experimentally validated in some model systems, hence supporting our answer to the reviewer’s question regarding insufficient validation of selected targets. We believe that the lack of reciprocity between miRNA inhibitors and mimics in regulating coding genes depends on the miRNA features above summarized. Therefore, we propose not to show these data in the main text, planning to discuss these issued in a separate paper. We are thankful again for the reviewer’s comments. To address these concerns, the main text was updated in the in the Results section and in the Discussion section basically avoiding the usage of terms indicating the uniqueness of direct interactions among the miRNA-network we presented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) miRNA-mRNA pairwise correlation demonstrated that miR-424-5p expression is induced and the targets (MAPK and cell cycle related) are repressed whereas the miR-29a-3p was downregulated and target mRNAs (ECM-related) upregulated. The angiogenesis assay (Figure 7D), however, does not support this. This puts in question the 3D model and whether it is more prone to any perturbation.</p></disp-quote><p>To exclude unspecific effects induced by the GOF/LOF strategy targeting miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p, which could be accountable for a general sensitivity of the system to any perturbation, we used the same strategy to modulate miR-16-5p expression. The results are shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1F, G, and indicate that miR-16-5p GOF/LOF did not have any relevant effect on spheroids sprouting. We chose specifically miR-16-5p because, other than having a recognized role in angiogenesis, belongs to the same family miR-424-5p belongs, having in common the same seed region. This implies that miR-424-5p and miR-16-5p can, in principle, target the same set of genes, according to TargetScan predictions. However, our bioinformatics analysis, which integrates TargetScan predictions with expression data, predicted a different subset of target genes for miR-424-5p and miR-16-5p in our 3D model (Figure 4—source data 1). We believe that this result is consistent with the idea that miRNA activity on their predicted targets depends also on the global cellular context, i.e. expression levels of miRNAs and targets availability. Furthermore, miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p, having a high number of connections in our network, can be considered “hub” miRNAs, while miR-16-5p is a more peripheral miRNA. According to the network theory, disturbance of a hub, not of a peripheral node, is expected to cause a dramatic effect on the whole system, and that is actually what we observed. This experiment therefore demonstrates that the effects of miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p GOF/LOF are specific, and reinforces the effectiveness of our bioinformatics analyses. This information has now been clarified in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would you see an opposite effect in proliferation assay or in 2D angiogenesis model?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a proliferation assay using HUVECs treated with miRNA mimics or inhibitors, cultured in 2D and stimulated with VEGF for the same time as spheroids (18h).

Some of the interaction showed here have been, however, already demonstrated, as mentioned in the Discussion section, such as miR-494/RAF1 or miR-424/MAP2K1. We did, however, show that expression of several MAPK target genes increases when miRNAs expression is reduced by DICER knock down, and we investigated more in detail the role of miR-424-5p, which is the miRNA with the highest number of connections (5) in the MAPK sub-network. Figure 7E shows the impact of miR-424-5p modulation on sprouting, Figure 7G shows the effect of miR-424-5p mimic on the MAPK target genes MAP2K1 and MAP3K3, and Figure 7—figure supplement 3 shows the effect of miR-424-5p mimic and inhibitor on P-ERK levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Likewise, does DICER impact P-ERK levels, as predicted in Figure 6?</p></disp-quote><p>A new experiment is shown in Figure 6B demonstrating that DICER silencing increases P-ERK levels in VEGF-treated spheroids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 7, does miR-inhibition increase target expression?</p></disp-quote><p>We evaluated the expression of miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p targets that were previously analyzed in the mimic experiments in spheroids transfected with the miRNA inhibitors.

Another consideration is that transfection of miRNA inhibitors, although successful, do not completely abrogate miRNAs expression, as shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Does miR mimic/inhibitor expression predictably increase/decrease proliferation and P-ERK?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the sprouting assay with cells transfected with miR-424-5p and mir-29a-3p mimics or inhibitors, and analyzed P-ERK levels by MSD technology. Figure 7—figure supplement 1I shows that only miR-424-5p manipulation could perturb the system, resulting in reduced P-ERK activity with miR-424-5p mimic and increased P-ERK activity with miR-424-5p inhibitor. This is in agreement with the predictions showed in the MAPK network (Figure 5A), where miR-424-5p interacts with, and should down-regulate, several MAPK upstream of ERK, while miR-29a-3p is not part of the MAPK network.</p><p>We did not, however, observe any effect on cell proliferation when miR-424-5p or miR-29a-3p expression was manipulated in spheroids by miRNA mimics or inhibitors. This can be explained by the fact that changes in P-ERK activity were modest, and by the fact that many different miRNAs are involved in the MAPK network (Figure 5A). Actually, only miR-424-5p inhibitor would predictably increase cell proliferation, which cannot be lowered further by miR-424-5p mimic. We did, however observe increased proliferation in spheroids DICER KD (Figure 6) and reduced proliferation in 2D cells treated with the miR-424-5p mimic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- If so, can ERK inhibition further modulate effects of miR 424-5p? But not 29a-3p?</p></disp-quote><p>In the sprouting assay, treatment with ERK inhibitor did not further modulate effects of miRNA mimics or inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig12">Author response image 12</xref>, average of n=2 experiments ± SEM).</p><fig id="respfig12"><label>Author response image 12.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48095-resp-fig12-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is stated that these miRNAs allow proliferation and migration to be &quot;spatially segregated in different EC populations&quot; but how would this be achieved? Are they expressed in distinct tip or stalk domains?</p></disp-quote><p>Our experiments indicate that in the initial phase of SA miRNAs have an inhibitory effect on proliferative signals and contribute to the differentiation of non-proliferating tip cells. The phrase has been modified to “these two fundamental VEGF-A downstream pathways cannot be activated at the same time in tip cells” in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- If cells expressing miR 424-5p/29a-3p mimic/inhibitor are mixed with WT cells, how well do they compete for the tip position?</p></disp-quote><p>Spheroid assay was performed by mixing in equal parts HUVECs transfected with miRNA mimics or inhibitors, or relative controls, and HUVECs transduced with a lentiviral vector for the stable expression of the fluorescent protein DsRed. Fluorescent cells at the very tip of the sprouts were counted. Figure 7—figure supplement 2 shows that cells transfected with either miR-424-5p or miR-29a-3p mimics or inhibitor were impaired in reaching the tip position. This observation is consistent with the data showed in Figure 7E, F, where alteration of miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p expression impairs sprouting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The relevance of last Results paragraph? I'd suggest the authors revise the text to better convey the main message. For example, &quot;Furthermore, average expression of genes belonging to the up-regulated module identified in the network analysis showed a significant positive correlation with endothelial score.&quot; what does this mean? Please explain the endothelial score in the text. What is the relevance of findings i.e. is the effect specific to CRC or would some cancers not show enrichment for angiogenesis related gene modules?</p></disp-quote><p>The last paragraph has been extensively revised and the endothelial score explained. These findings could be extended to any other cancer whose growth depends on angiogenesis, or any cancer type for which anti-angiogenic therapy has been proven beneficial. This information has been added to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The Discussion is confusing and would profit from more structure (separate paragraphs etc).</p></disp-quote><p>The Discussion has been divided into paragraphs, each with a title.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have improved the manuscript by clarifying many questions from the reviewers' comments and providing extensive further experimental evidence to support the conclusions. There are some points, however, that still need to be addressed.</p><p>1) To provide further validation of the miRNA-regulated networks (Reply to reviewer comments 8-9), the authors demonstrated that up- or down-modulation of miR-424 and miR-29a significantly regulated several other miRNAs. The data, however, is not incorporated in the manuscript. Please include the data in the manuscript, to strengthen the conclusion of these two miRNAs representing central players of the transcriptional response.</p></disp-quote><p>A new paragraph entitled “Modulation of miRNA hubs alters network architecture” and a figure (Figure 8) describing the effect of miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p modulation on other miRNAs have been added to the Results section. To reinforce the concept that miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p modulation has a widespread effect on other miRNAs’ expression, we included a heatmap (Figure 8A) that was not initially included in the previous reply to reviewers. This heatmap shows the effect of miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p modulation on all the miRNAs expressed in our model. The second heatmap (Figure 8B) focuses only on the miRNAs comprised in the SA network. The results have also been discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, please provide the results evaluating the miR-424-5p and MiR-29-3p target expression upon inhibitor treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>Expression of miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p targets upon inhibitor treatment have been added in Figure 7—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The proliferation levels of &lt; 0.5% makes it impossible to evaluate if there are any differences in SPHC and SPHV or to demonstrate any effect of the manipulation of miR-424-5p and MiR-29-3p levels. Therefore, the authors should avoid to overly interpret the data and discuss the limitations. The authors should also provide the information about the miR-424-5p and MiR-29-3p mimics/inhibitors not affecting proliferation in the 3D model to complement the results shown for the 2D model (Figure 7—figure supplement 3) that currently was only mentioned in the response letter.</p></disp-quote><p>The information about the proliferation assay in the 3D model has been added as Figure 7—figure supplement 3A, and the limitations of the assay have been discussed. In the Discussion section, the phrases “Furthermore, miR-424-5p and miR-29a-3p target prediction can be an example of how the activity of a miRNA can be directed to a specific cellular function” and “extended the existing information about cell-autonomous function of these miRNAs thus identifying new molecular targets related to the endothelial role in cancer SA” have been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4. Please explain which is the upregulated and downregulated hub in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>The description of the two network components has been added to the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) VEGF does further repress pro-proliferative genes, but this is not a phenotypic switch as there is no change in proliferative phenotype. Also, the function of this repression of pro-proliferative genes is unknown, as 424-5p miR inhibitor fails to increase proliferation. The subtle increase in EC proliferation (and pro-proliferative genes) seen upon DICER KD is not evidence that miRs block proliferation upon VEGF treatment, as only VEGF-treated cells are shown. Are these also elevated in non-VEGF-treated cells? The authors should show the cytofluorimetric analysis of EdU incorporation into the DNA in DICER-WT and DICER-KD spheroids without VEGF-A (Figure 6E) to support that the effects of Dicer are VEGF-A depended.</p></disp-quote><p>GSEA data for the comparison of <italic>DICER<sup>KD</sup></italic> versus <italic>DICER<sup>WT</sup></italic> in non-stimulated spheroids has been added as Figure 6—figure supplement 1C (not significant). The cytofluorimetric analysis of spheroids not stimulated with VEGF-A (SPHC) has been added in Figure 6F, showing that <italic>DICER<sup>KD</sup></italic> per se does not affect cell proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In addition, the dispensability of proliferation and ERK in spheroid SA does not demonstrate that they essentially have to be repressed to enable SA in WT cells. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to support profound statements such as &quot;the first SA step requires a miRNA-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation&quot;, or that migration and proliferation pathways &quot;cannot be activated at the same time&quot;. Please revise the statement.</p></disp-quote><p>The indicated statements have been revised.</p></body></sub-article></article>
