cave animals posits colonization by surface ancestors followed by the acquisition of adaptations over many generations. However, the speed of cave adaptation in some species suggests mechanisms operating over shorter timescales. To address these mechanisms, we used <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic>, a teleost with ancestral surface morphs (surface fish, SF) and derived cave morphs (cavefish, CF). We exposed SF to completely dark conditions and identified numerous altered traits at both the gene expression and phenotypic levels. Remarkably, most of these alterations mimicked CF phenotypes. Our results indicate that many cave-related traits can appear within a single generation by phenotypic plasticity. In the next generation, plasticity can be further refined. The initial plastic responses are random in adaptive outcome but may determine the subsequent course of evolution. Our study suggests that phenotypic plasticity contributes to the rapid evolution of cave-related traits in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The Mexican tetra is a fish that has two forms: a surface-dwelling form, which has eyes and silvery grey appearance, and a cave-dwelling form, which is blind and has lost its pigmentation. Recent studies have shown that the cave-dwelling form evolved rapidly within the last 200,000 years from an ancestor that lived at the surface. The recent evolution of the cave-dwelling form of the tetra poses an interesting evolutionary question: how did the surface-dwelling ancestor of the tetra quickly adapt to the new and challenging environment found in the caves?</p><p>‘Phenotypic plasticity’ is a phenomenon through which a single set of genes can produce different observable traits depending on the environment. An example of phenotypic plasticity occurs in response to diet: in animals, poor diets can lead to an increase in the size of the digestive organs and to the animals eating more. To see if surface-dwelling tetras can quickly adapt to cave environments through phenotypic plasticity, Bilandžija et al. have exposed these fish to complete darkness (the major feature of the cave environment) for two years. After spending up to two years in the dark, these fish were compared to normal surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling tetras.</p><p>Results revealed that surface-dwelling tetras raised in the dark exhibited traits associated with cave-dwelling tetras. These traits included changes in the activity of many genes involved in diverse processes, resistance to starvation, metabolism, and levels of hormones and molecules involved in neural signaling, which could lead to changes in behavior. However, the fish also exhibited traits, including an increase in the cells responsible for pigmentation, that would have no obvious benefit in the darkness. Even though the changes observed require no genetic mutations, they can help or hinder the fish’s survival once they occur, possibly determining subsequent evolution. Thus, a trait beneficial for surviving in the dark that appears simply through phenotypic plasticity may eventually be selected for and genetic mutations that encode it more reliably may appear too.</p><p>These results shed light on how species may quickly adapt to new environments without accumulating genetic mutations, which can take hundreds of thousands of years. They also may help to explain how colonizer species succeed in challenging environments. The principles described by Bilandžija et al. can be applied to different organisms adapting to new environments, and may help understand the role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic></kwd><kwd>cavefish</kwd><kwd>colonization</kwd><kwd>rapid evolution</kwd><kwd>cave adaptation</kwd><kwd>total darkness</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY024941</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeffery</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004488</institution-id><institution>Croatian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tenure Track Pilot Programme TTP-2018-07-9675</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bilandžija</surname><given-names>Helena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011264</institution-id><institution>FP7 People: Marie-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-PEOPLE-2011-COFUND – NEWFELPRO FP7 2007-2013, grant agreement no. 291823, project EACAA, agreement No. 50</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bilandžija</surname><given-names>Helena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1556819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Porter</surname><given-names>Megan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1256898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Renner</surname><given-names>Kenneth J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>New International Fellowship Mobility Programme for Experienced Researchers</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-PEOPLE-2011-COFUND – NEWFELPRO FP7 2007-2013, grant agreement no. 291823, project EACAA, agreement No. 50</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bilandžija</surname><given-names>Helena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001703</institution-id><institution>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tenure Track Pilot Programme TTP-2018-07-9675</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bilandžija</surname><given-names>Helena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic> surface-dwelling fish exposed to complete darkness develop many traits resembling cavefish adaptations by phenotypic plasticity in a single generation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major problem in modern biology is understanding how organisms adapt to an environmental change and how complex, adaptive phenotypes originate. Phenotypic evolution can result from standing genetic variation, new mutations, or phenotypic plasticity followed by genetic assimilation, but these processes are often difficult to distinguish in slowly changing environments. This difficulty can be overcome by studying adaptation to more abrupt environmental changes, such as the dramatic transition from life on the Earth’s surface to subterranean voids and caves.</p><p>A unifying feature of subterranean environments is complete darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Culver and Pipan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pipan and Culver, 2012</xref>). Cave-adapted animals have evolved a range of unusual and specialized traits, often called troglomorphic traits, which enable survival in challenging conditions of the subsurface. In cave dwelling animals, visual senses and protection from the effects of sunlight are unnecessary, and consequently eyes and pigmentation are usually reduced or absent. To compensate for lack of vision, other traits, especially those related to chemo- and mechano-receptor sensations, are enhanced. Circadian rhythms that fine-tune organismal physiology with day-night cycles are also distorted, and light dependent behaviors, as well as the neural and endocrine circuits controlling these behaviors, are modified. Because photosynthetic organisms are not present in caves, primary productivity is absent and nutrient availability is usually limited. Survival under conditions of reduced and/or sporadic food resources is possible due to the evolution of modified feeding behaviors and adaptive changes in metabolism, such as lower metabolic rate, increased starvation resistance, and changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Culver and Pipan, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The ancestors of cave dwelling animals originally lived on the surface. Regardless of whether the pioneering animals entered the subsurface accidently (by capture of surface waters or by falling into a pit) or purposely (to take refuge from harsh competition or changing climate conditions), they were suddenly exposed to darkness and subterranean living conditions. How did they overcome the challenges of life in darkness, such as orientation in the absence of light, survival during long periods without food, and detection of mates, in order to successfully establish underground lineages? The preadaptation hypothesis suggests that the ancestors of cave adapted animals were pre-adapted to darkness by already leading semi-nocturnal lifestyles in environments with low-light penetration, such as rotting logs, leaf litter, or in the soil, simplifying their transition to life in caves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vandel, 1965</xref>). However, many cave dwelling animals, such as the cavefish <italic>Astyanax mexicanus,</italic> are descended from diurnal surface-dwelling animals; and the cavefish <italic>Poecillia mexicana</italic>, is derived from photophilic surface ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parzefall et al., 2007</xref>) with no obvious pre-adaptations to low light. For these animals, the transition to dark subterranean habitats could have posed significant challenges.</p><p>In the present investigation, we used the teleost <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic> as a model system to understand the molecular, physiological and morphological basis of cave colonization. <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> is an excellent system for studying adaptation to cave life because it consists of both the ancestral-proxy form and multiple derived forms: surface dwelling (surface fish, SF) and cave-dwelling conspecifics (cavefish, CF) respectively. Surface fish live in rivers exposed to day-night cycles with abundant food availability. In the karstic Sierra Madre Oriental del Norte mountain range in Mexico, SF have colonized about 30 caves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gross, 2012</xref>), and their cave dwelling descendants have adapted to permanently dark, mostly food restricted subterranean waters.</p><p>Recent studies revealed that cavefish lineages are much younger than previously thought, from less than 20,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fumey et al., 2018</xref>) to about 200,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herman et al., 2018</xref>) years old, implying that the evolution of numerous cave-related phenotypes may have occurred over relatively short time periods. Furthermore, troglomorphic phenotypes are maintained in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> cavefish despite the lack of complete isolation between surface fish and cavefish populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bradic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chakraborty and Nei, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wilkens and Hüppop, 1986</xref>). A remarkably recent origin of troglomorphic traits, also involving likely immigration from surface populations, has also been proposed for the evolution of cave-related traits in other cave dwelling animals, including invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrmann-Godel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klaus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Niemiller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schilthuizen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Villacorta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Li, 2013</xref>). What are the mechanisms that enable the rapid evolution of various distinct cave-related phenotypes, and how are they preserved despite the homogenizing process of gene flow from surface populations? Clearly, strong selection must be involved in these cases, but in order for selection to act, it is essential to have phenotypic variants with differences in fitness in the cave environment.</p><p>The conspecific surface and cave morphs of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> are capable of hybridization in the laboratory and thus have been the subjects of extensive genetic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Quin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Protas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yoshizawa et al., 2012</xref>). However, not many mutations have been uncovered in CF, even in the presumably dispensable genes associated with eye degeneration, such as crystallin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hinaux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). A more immediate mechanism for survival is likely necessary when new colonizers first enter caves. This suggests the presence of standing genetic variation and/or phenotypic plasticity followed by genetic assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Waddington, 1953</xref>), rather than the complete reliance on the accumulation of new mutations to produce the necessary variability. An instance of standing genetic variation has been reported in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> CF with respect to the evolution of eye reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rohner et al., 2013</xref>), but phenotypic plasticity has not been studied extensively in this system (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reyes, 2015</xref>). This is surprising since phenotypic plasticity plays an important role in the adaptation of many different organisms to changing environments and the colonization of new habitats reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox et al. (2019)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morris (2014)</xref>.</p><p>To replicate the colonization of the subterranean environment, we placed <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> SF in completely dark conditions for up to two years. By assaying different traits, we discovered that dark-raised SF show numerous phenotypes that are normally associated with CF adaptations to dark environments. The results imply that some cave-adapted traits may have appeared rapidly by phenotypic plasticity in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>. Our results provide a basis for the evolution of adaptations in the cavefish lineage by genetic assimilation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Morphological changes in dark-raised surface fish</title><p>In this study, we exposed SF to D/D from early developmental stages until up to 2 years after spawning, and compared them to L/D controls.

Genes involved in circadian regulation, locomotor rhythm and visual perception were down-regulated in D/D fish, whereas lipid metabolism was the main functional category enriched in the up-regulated gene set. Two genes involved in pigmentation were also changed but their expression was higher in D/D, consistent with the increase in pigment cells described above.

D/D and L/D controls were fed daily portions of brine shrimp from seven dpf, when larvae normally lose their reliance on yolk and begin feeding.

Furthermore, experiments on <italic>Poecillia mexicana</italic>, another teleost with cave adapted lineages, showed that darkness caused degenerate changes in the spine and promoted sexual isolation between adjacent surface and cave lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Riesch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Riesch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Torres-Dowdall et al., 2018</xref>). Although our study was unable to replicate the changes in body shape seen by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rasquin (1949)</xref>, we confirmed her observation of increased body fat. We also confirmed changes in pituitary and thyroid hormone metabolism, both in gene expression and hormone levels. Down-regulation of <italic>sst1.2</italic>, a homolog of somatostatin - growth hormone-inhibiting hormone, is consistent with increased growth hormone in D/D SF. In addition, the changes in thyroid stimulating hormone and growth hormone levels we observed in dark raised SF are consistent with the reduction of basophils and the predominance of acidophils in the pituitary gland of D/D SF reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rasquin, 1949</xref>). These results suggest that one of the immediate responses to cave colonization and darkness may be changes in the endocrine system. In fact, endocrine signaling, along with epigenetic changes, activation of heat shock proteins, and transcriptional regulation, are the major molecular mechanisms involved in regulating plastic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aubin-Horth and Renn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beldade et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>). Our transcriptome analyses revealed that genes and GO terms involved in all of the above processes showed significant changes in response to darkness. In addition to hormonal signaling, there are changes in genes involved in the stress response, several different signal transduction pathways, protein metabolism, including protein folding and posttranslational modifications, and genes showing transcription factor or epigenetic regulator activities. Furthermore, using RT-PCR we found that the expression of <italic>hsp90aa1.2</italic>, <italic>dnmt1</italic> and <italic>dnmt3bb</italic>, genes related to stress or epigenetic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gore et al., 2018</xref>), were changed in D/D SF. These results suggest that multiple molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity may be mobilized by exposure of SF to darkness.</p><p>Our RNAseq results contained functional categories enriched in both the up- and the down-regulated dataset: hormone activity (as mentioned above) and oxidation-reduction processes. Changes in oxidation-reduction processes may be related to increased stress following the exposure to a changed environment. Alternatively, these changes may be light-dependent since light activates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which, in turn, act as messengers between photoreception and the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hirayama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pagano et al., 2018</xref>). Pathways involved in the response to oxidative stress, photoreception, and circadian regulation were down-regulated. Thus, the absence of light may directly reduce ROS production, photoreception, and circadian control.</p><p>Our study revealed many traits that change in SF upon exposure to darkness. Strikingly, all these traits are associated with the cave lifestyle, and almost all of them change to resemble CF adaptive phenotypes. For example, compared to SF, CF have higher starvation resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aspiras et al., 2015</xref>), a lower metabolic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hüppop, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moran et al., 2014</xref>), higher basal cortisol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallo and Jeffery, 2012</xref>), and lower serotonin levels (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elipot et al., 2014</xref>). When exposed to darkness, in addition to mimicking higher growth hormone and triglyceride levels in CF (see above), we found that SF show higher starvation resistance, lower metabolic rates, higher cortisol levels, and lower serotonin levels. The results demonstrate that for these traits SF begin to resemble CF in the same generation following exposure to complete darkness. Because the plastic phenotypes are under genetic control in multiple independently evolved CF populations and irreversible when CF are transferred to light in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gross, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jeffery, 2001</xref>), the results are consistent with the possibility that the initial dark-induced plastic responses in SF became fixed in CF-like descendants via genetic assimilation. However, not all CF traits could be replicated by exposing SF to darkness. Therefore, although important, plasticity caused by constant darkness is not the only path for the appearance of cavefish traits. Other mechanisms, including plasticity caused by environmental factors other than darkness (e.g. changes in nutrient availability), selection on the standing genetic variation, new mutations, or any combination of these processes, might also be involved. In addition, standing genetic variation for differences in plasticity in an ancestral population could result in the evolution of these traits.</p><p>Although darkness is an ecologically relevant cue, the induction of changes in SF by the absence of light does not necessarily imply that they are adaptive for cave life. Plasticity can result in adaptive, non-adaptive as well as maladaptive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghalambor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Langerhans and DeWitt, 2002</xref>). It is self-explanatory how increased triglyceride content, starvation resistance or decreased metabolic rate can increase fitness in the (food-limited) cave environment, but the effects of neurotransmitter or hormone changes are less intuitive. Therefore, we hypothesized that, if a trait is adaptive, it would be present in multiple independently evolved cavefish populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prevorcnik et al., 2004</xref>). As a proof of principle, higher starvation resistance and triglyceride content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aspiras et al., 2015</xref>) conform to this criterion. We tested neurotransmitter and hormone levels and showed that growth hormone and serotonin change in multiple CF concordantly to the initial SF plastic response. Conversely, thyroid stimulating hormone showed the opposite direction of change, suggesting that the initial SF plastic response was not adaptive.</p><p>Also opposite to the expected direction of change, melanophore numbers increase in D/D SF. The increase of melanophores in dark-raised SF was modest and confined to specific regions of the body, but consistent with up-regulation of some melanosome-related genes in the transcriptome. This result was unexpected but considered reliable, since SF x CF hybrids can also show hyper-melanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gross et al., 2016</xref>), and neutral mutations are a likely cause of melanophore reduction in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> CF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Protas et al., 2007</xref>). We found a surprising result in another classic troglomorphic trait, eye degeneration: although visual perception was a GO term associated with down-regulated genes in D/D SF transcriptome, we were unable to detect changes in eye size. However, D/D SF exhibited well-developed retinal layers, and we even recorded thickening of the inner and outer nuclear layer, and the photoreceptor layer. These regions are cell proliferation and intercalation centers so it is possible that darkness activates mitotic activity in these retinal layers as a compensation for defective transmission of light from the lens and induced retinal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alunni et al., 2007</xref>). The finding of increased eye size under our experimental conditions of complete darkness is puzzling, but has also been observed in a natural <italic>Astyanax</italic> population that has recently colonized a cave in Texas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McGaugh et al., 2019</xref>). Our results are consistent with studies showing that teleosts change body pigmentation and retinal phenotypes in response to light levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Epp, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kay et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tarboush et al., 2016</xref>). For example, <italic>Astyanax</italic> F2 hybrids with small or absent eyes also show hyperpigmentation, which has been explained as background adaptation due to the lack of visual input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gross et al., 2016</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that plasticity lacks the propensity to produce adaptive variants, and non-adaptive, even maladaptive, effects seem to be as likely as adaptive outcomes.</p><p>Importantly, pigmentation and eyes are absent in PA and other fully troglomorphic CF. The fact that they showed non- or mal-adaptive plastic response in SF exposed to darkness, suggests that natural selection acting against plasticity may be involved in the evolution of these traits in CF. A novel aspect of the evolution of classical troglomorphic traits, the reduction of eyes and pigmentation, may be that they are a consequence of strong selection against non- or mal-adaptive plastic responses during colonization of caves by surface ancestors.</p><p>To test if the inheritance of some of the plastic phenotypic changes described here occur during the next generation, we induced spawning in D/D SF and investigated starvation resistance and metabolic rate in the offspring (dSF), traits shown to exhibit plasticity in the parental D/D generation. Neither of these traits showed differences between offspring spawned in the light or dark when maintained in L/D. However, when maintained in D/D, dSF showed continued plasticity of both traits, as well as potential adaptive-tuning of the character states, suggesting that plasticity is evolvable and can itself be an evolutionary adaptation. Increased plasticity was previously suggested to be an important stepping stone in the process of adaptations to extreme environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lande, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lande, 2009</xref>). Therefore, consistent with the Baldwin effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crispo, 2007</xref>), the evolution of cave related traits may have proceeded through initial selection for continued plasticity and refinement of the characters, followed by selection of individuals carrying the most improved variants of the phenotype. Higher growth hormone and triglyceride levels, as well as lower body serotonin levels in PA than D/D SF, also imply refinement of the initial SF plastic response in CF. In nature SF are periodically swept into caves and plasticity in many traits that enable survival may be critical to extend their lifespan long enough to leave offspring. According to our results, the next generation may be slightly better equipped for coping with the cave environment by increased plasticity and small adaptive switches in traits.</p><p>One of the reasons the role of plasticity in adaptive evolution has been contested is its randomness in the production of outcomes where non-adaptive and mal-adaptive responses are as likely as adaptive responses. However, our study suggests that even the initial non-adaptive plastic responses may eventually produce an adaptive outcome. Some traits, including the hallmarks of troglomorphic adaptations (the loss of eyes and pigmentation) initially show non-adaptive plastic responses but the complete loss of these traits in CF indicates strong selection against plasticity in SF colonizers. Non-adaptive plasticity may have a greater role in evolution than previously appreciated because it may increase the strength of selection against plasticity, and perhaps, in some cases, may affect the whole trait itself. Conversely, in cases where plasticity produces adaptive outcomes, initial selection will act to enhance plasticity, and plasticity will be maintained in the derived lineage for many generations. Overall, plasticity has a critical role in producing variability (adaptive or not) on which selection can act (for or against) to produce individuals with optimal fitness in the new environment.</p><p>We also uncovered two cases in which the plasticity of a single trait changes within an individual over the course of development. Both metabolic rate and serotonin showed shifts in plasticity depending on developmental stage. Metabolic rate initially (at 2.5 dpf) changes in response to the light regime but later (by 7.5 dpf) this response is lost in PA. In contrast, serotonin levels are plastic in adults but not in 7 dpf larvae. Interestingly, switches in plasticity occur at the same time as switches in character state. At 2.5 dpf there is no difference in metabolic rate between SF and PA, but by 7.5 dpf, the metabolic rate in PA is lower than in SF, agreeing with previous studies done on adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hüppop, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moran et al., 2014</xref>). In the case of serotonin, character states show opposite relationships at different stages: they are lower in larvae but higher in adult SF compared to PA. Therefore, for metabolic rate and serotonin levels, both the trait and its plasticity change concordantly, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms of character development may also influence the ability to respond to environmental stimuli. These two examples show that plasticity is not an intrinsically fixed property of a trait but can develop by itself. In our examples, plasticity develops concordantly with the traits it affects, and it can develop in a direction of expansion or reduction. The development of metabolic rate in PA is accompanied by canalization of the same trait. In the case of serotonin, development of the 5-HT system is accompanied by an increase in its plasticity.</p><p>Phenotypic plasticity can fill several gaps in the current model of cave colonization and the evolution of cave dwelling organisms. Our study shows how a colonizing surface ancestor, having no adaptations to caves and presented with the challenges of low food availability, orientation, and reproduction in complete darkness, could have overcome a transition to the extreme subterranean environment and establish a cave-adapted lineage. Further, due to plasticity, numerous adaptive traits arise within a single generation in response to only one, albeit the most relevant, environmental cue: darkness. Finally, plasticity may enable the maintenance of distinct phenotypes in the face of gene flow from ancestral surface-dwelling populations. The incorporation of phenotypic plasticity as one of the mechanisms underlying cave colonization and adaptive evolution provides a solution to dilemmas associated with drift or selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cartwright et al., 2017</xref>) acting alone to induce cave-related phenotypes in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>. Because multiple successful transitions by the same surface ancestors are not unique to <italic>Astyanax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Verovnik et al., 2004</xref>), some animal groups have colonized caves repeatedly in different times and geographical regions, and several unique cave dwellers are closely related to highly invasive (and plastic) surface dwelling species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bilandžija et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kupriyanova et al., 2009</xref>), it is possible that plasticity may be a general phenomenon in the colonization and adaptation to cave environments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

groups included <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic> SF and CF primarily from Pachón Cave (PA). In some experiments, CF from Tinaja (TI) and Molino (MO) caves were also used. Animals were obtained from the Jeffery Laboratory colony at the University of Maryland, and had undergone 3–5 generations in captivity since their original collection from the caves in 2002 (PA, TI) or 2006 (MO). Fish in the main colony were kept in 40 L tanks in cohorts of 8–15 animals and exposed to a 14 hr light/10 hr dark photoperiod. Spawning was induced every two weeks by extra feeding a few days prior to increasing the water temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jeffery et al., 2000</xref>). Temperature regime changes were as follows: fish were normally kept in 22 °C, on the first day of spawning temperature was raised to 24 °C, on the second day raised to 26 °C, on the third day returned to 24 °C, and on the fourth day returned to 22 °C. Embryos were spawned in the night and collected in the morning by washing them from the breeding nets. Dead embryos were removed and the remainder transferred to clean fish system water containing methylene blue. The fish were raised and handled according to established University of Maryland and NIH guidelines and all experiments conform to the regulatory standards.</p><p>Fish embryos spawned at the same time from different parent tanks were mixed in order to minimize the effects of specific genetic backgrounds and mimic the situation in nature where fish are randomly swept into caves. Mixed embryo clutches were divided in half and randomly assigned to different experimental conditions. One group was initially exposed to darkness either as embryos or young fry (from 1 to 2 hr to 3 days after spawning) and then raised in complete darkness (D/D) for up to two years. The other group, originating from the same brood, was reared in a normal 14 hr light/10 hr dark photoperiod (L/D). All other conditions were identical between the D/D and L/D study groups. Fish were reared in plastic tanks with no filtration or running water. Depending on their size and age, fish were reared in 1, 3 or seven liter tanks and then transferred to larger tanks as they increased in size. Once the fish reached approximately 1 cm in length they were transferred to 3L tanks, and once they grew to over 2 cm they were transferred to 7L tanks. Densities of fish among different groups depended on survival but were approximately similar and ranged between 5 to 10 fish per tank. Water was changed approximately once a month at the same time for every tank in the experiment. Fish in each tank were fed the same volume of brine shrimp once per day, approximately 0.5 mL of concentrated brine shrimp was added to smaller fish in 1L tanks, 1 mL in larger 3L tanks, and 2 mL in the largest 7L tanks. All procedures followed standard procedures for <italic>Astyanax</italic> fish husbandry in the Jeffery Laboratory. Dim red light (25 watts) was used when it was necessary to feed or handle the fish in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Romero, 1985</xref>). Dead fish were removed when they were observed. Fish of different ages were used throughout the experiments and were all adults (unless otherwise noted). Within every experiment fish groups of comparable ages were used for comparisons. Fish from both sexes were included in each experiment, and fish used in each experiment were collected at the same time of the same day.</p><p>For the G1 generation experiments, SF placed in D/D as embryos and raised for 2 years were spawned using standard procedures as explained above. The spawned embryos (dSF) were divided in two groups within the first 24 hr post-fertilization (hpf), and one group was left in D/D conditions and the other group was placed in L/D photoperiod within first 24 hpf. A control group of SF spawned from L/D raised parents was also divided into two groups and raised in L/D or D/D during the period of experimentation.</p><p>Information on sample sizes, time lapsed in experimental conditions, and the ages of fish used in specific experiments is provided in the sections corresponding to the description of specific experimental methods.</p><p>The following procedure was used for collecting, and when necessary pulverizing, adult fish for the respective experiments: fish were sacrificed with 0.4 or 0.5 mg/L MS222, tricaine methanesulfonate (Western Chemical Inc, Ferndale, WA, USA). Fish were maintained in the dark until they expired and then photographed, weighed, and pulverized in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. The pulverized material was divided into several Eppendorf tubes and stored at −80 °C until further processing.

Prior to RNA extraction, the stomach and liver were removed from the fish because they compromised RNA quality. Total RNA was isolated from samples stored in TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The fragment size, concentration, RNA integrity number (RIN) and 28S/18S ratio of RNA extracts were determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The cDNA libraries were constructed using TruSeq mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Fragment sizes and concentrations of libraries were verified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR machine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The samples were sequenced in a single Hiseq X-ten lane with a strategy of 150 bp paired-ends (PE), resulting in about 8 Gb raw data for each sample. To avoid potential adapter contamination, the last 60 bp of all reads were trimmed. Subsequently, the reads were removed if they contained: 1) more than 50% low quality (Q &lt; 35) bases; 2) more than 10 Ns, and 3) were PCR duplications. Cleaned read quality was confirmed in FASTQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews, 2010</xref>), and a total of 230,437,086 cleaned reads were retained for transcriptomic analysis.

The cortisol was reconstituted in PBS overnight at 4 °C and quantified using the Cortisol ELISA Kit (Item № 500360, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor MI, USA) following the kit protocol. Cortisol samples from fish within each group were pooled and assayed in triplicate.

Serotonin and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were analyzed using HPLC with electrochemical detection as described previously with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Renner and Luine, 1986</xref>). Brains were placed into 100 µL of sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing the internal standard alpha-methyl dopamine (αMDA; Merck and Co., Inc, Kenilworth, NJ). Fish bodies were placed in either 200 to 400 µL of acetate buffer containing αMDA based on the amount of tissue present. Both tissue types were disrupted by sonication using a 4710 Ultrasonic Homogenizer (Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., Chicago IL) and stored at −80°C. Prior to analysis, the sonicated brain samples were thawed, 4 μL of 1 mg/mL ascorbate oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to each sample and the samples were centrifuged at 17,000 g for 15 min. Fish body samples were treated the same way except that the supernatant was centrifuged a second time through a 0.2 µm filter. The filtered supernatant was removed and a Waters Alliance e2695 separation module was used to inject 50 µL of the supernatant onto a C<sub>18</sub>4 µm NOVA-PAK radial compression column (Waters Associates, Inc Milford, MA) held at 30°C.

The pellet was solubilized in 400 µL of 0.4 N NaOH and protein content was analyzed using the Bradford method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradford, 1976</xref>). A CSW32 data program (DataApex Ltd., Czech Republic) was used to determine 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations in the internal standard mode using peak heights calculated from standards. Injection versus preparation volumes were corrected and amine concentrations were normalized by dividing pg amine by µg protein. Data were tested for differences using a Three Way Analysis of Variance (SigmaStat version 3.5, Systat Software Inc, San Jose, CA).

interest to the broader scientific research communities. The manuscript provides key insights into the role of plasticity in evolution, and should have a broad, general impact on the fields of evolutionary biology, developmental biology, and evo-devo.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Phenotypic plasticity as a mechanism of cave colonization and adaptation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper &quot;Phenotypic plasticity as a mechanism of cave colonization and adaptation&quot; describes the results of raising surface fish in the dark to address the role of phenotypic plasticity in the evolution of cave animals. This work addresses a long-standing question: What happens upon initial colonization of a novel environment? Towards this end, the authors present a large amount of data, including RNA-sequencing and phenotypic data for multiple traits, which together suggest that phenotypic plasticity could play a large role in colonization in a novel, extreme environment, the cave. This work is an important first step in addressing the role of phenotypic plasticity in colonization of and evolution to a novel environment and is broadly applicable, as the principles discussed here have the potential to apply to many organisms colonizing new environments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For a few traits, it appears that only one biological replicate was performed. These include cortisol levels, triglyceride levels, TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels and GH (growth hormone) levels. It may be that I am misunderstanding the data. However, if this is the case, I recommend running more biological replicates. In line with this, the second generation survival results are rather mild. Can the authors provide information around the number of times this assay was performed, n values, etc.?</p><p>2) The reviewers are concerned that some of the conclusions are overstated in the Discussion. While the authors make a strong argument that many cave phenotypes can be phenocopied by phenotypic plasticity, they do not think from this study that claims can be made about natural selection acting to enhance or reduce plasticity. Specifically</p><p>A) The initial sentence of the Discussion suggests that the plastic responses observed here contradict the idea that cave-adaptations arise due to selection on genetic changes that occurs over longer periods. However, plasticity initially does not necessarily mean that these longer term processes are not at play, either on natural variation directly affecting the trait or genetic variation affecting plasticity.</p><p>B) The argument regarding canalization of pigmentation and melanophore number due to selection against plasticity seems flawed. I am not sure you can conclude anything about loss of plasticity regarding these traits, as they are not present to assess in the cavefish population in a way that was assessed in this study. If the authors would like to argue less plasticity in these traits, I would suggest using an alternative method to assess them (i.e. visualizing pigment cell numbers by L-DOPA or assessing eye size earlier in development when cavefish eyes are present).</p><p>C) The authors claim that due to plasticity it is possible to evolve adaptations in a short timeframe (Discussion, last paragraph). However, they looked in one generation at only 2 traits, and show modest effects on only one of these two. Thus, I would suggest that this is an overstatement.</p><p>3) Improved survival in darkness could be mediated by a number of factors, not just metabolic improvements. Are these survival effects stemming from one, or a complex cluster, of plastic phenotypes? Please address.</p><p>4) The authors claimed that surface morphs have &quot;no obvious pre-adaptations to low light&quot;, but the reviewers are not sure they agree. Surface fish have been described in the literature as 'scotophilic', and many researchers have noted the propensity for surface fish, even in captivity, remaining in the darkest part of their tanks. The reviewers would further note that this information appears to be relevant to the interpretation of Figure 4 (elevated cortisol in constant darkness for SF). Please address.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51830.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For a few traits, it appears that only one biological replicate was performed.

We originally had 2 biological replicates for the TSH and GH experiments. As a response to the reviewer’s critique we have made another biological replication of both determinations, and now have a total of 3 biological replicates. The new experiments replicated previous results that GH and TSH changed in SF under the influence of darkness and that levels of these hormones were different in CF and SF. The only difference in this experiment was that lower levels of TSH in D/D compared to L/D SF did not reach statistical significance (although they did show the same direction of change). For this reason we rewrote part of the Results.</p><p>The second generation survival experiment could only be performed once as it was very difficult to obtain embryos from fish raised to sexual maturity in the darkness, and the end result of the experiment is the death of larvae, so we could not repeat the experiment. Concerning the question about numbers, there were 24 larvae in each fish and treatment type at the beginning of the experiment. In total we used 96 larvae spawned in the darkness and the same number of fish spawned in L/D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers are concerned that some of the conclusions are overstated in the Discussion. While the authors make a strong argument that many cave phenotypes can be phenocopied by phenotypic plasticity, they do not think from this study that claims can be made about natural selection acting to enhance or reduce plasticity. Specifically</p><p>A) The initial sentence of the Discussion suggests that the plastic responses observed here contradict the idea that cave-adaptations arise due to selection on genetic changes that occurs over longer periods. However, plasticity initially does not necessarily mean that these longer term processes are not at play, either on natural variation directly affecting the trait or genetic variation affecting plasticity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and have changed the sentence in the Discussion as follows: “In addition to the widely accepted view that cave-adaptations result from long-term genetic processes (Barr, 1968; Culver, 1982; Juan et al., 2010), our results indicate that some cave-related traits can appear within a single generation by phenotypic plasticity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) The argument regarding canalization of pigmentation and melanophore number due to selection against plasticity seems flawed. I am not sure you can conclude anything about loss of plasticity regarding these traits, as they are not present to assess in the cavefish population in a way that was assessed in this study. If the authors would like to argue less plasticity in these traits, I would suggest using an alternative method to assess them (i.e. visualizing pigment cell numbers by L-DOPA or assessing eye size earlier in development when cavefish eyes are present).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and have removed all notions about canalization from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) The authors claim that due to plasticity it is possible to evolve adaptations in a short timeframe (Discussion, last paragraph). However, they looked in one generation at only 2 traits, and show modest effects on only one of these two. Thus, I would suggest that this is an overstatement.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have removed that part of the sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Improved survival in darkness could be mediated by a number of factors, not just metabolic improvements. Are these survival effects stemming from one, or a complex cluster, of plastic phenotypes? Please address.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this issue and rewrote sentences accordingly in the Figure 3 legend and in the subsection “Starvation Resistance in Dark-raised Surface Fish”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claimed that surface morphs have &quot;no obvious pre-adaptations to low light&quot;, but the reviewers are not sure they agree. Surface fish have been described in the literature as 'scotophilic', and many researchers have noted the propensity for surface fish, even in captivity, remaining in the darkest part of their tanks. The reviewers would further note that this information appears to be relevant to the interpretation of Figure 4 (elevated cortisol in constant darkness for SF). Please address.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the issue of scotophila in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> surface fish and have rewritten the sentence(s) claiming that <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> surface forms have no pre-adaptations to low light (Introduction). However, we intended to be more general in this introduction; and in the spirit of including other cave animals as examples have also pointed out that one cave dweller is known to be derived from a photophilic surface ancestor.</p><p>We agree that elevated cortisol in D/D SF suggests that the transition to a dark environment by surface ancestors of CF was a significant challenge with or without preadaptations, and this issue is addressed in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
