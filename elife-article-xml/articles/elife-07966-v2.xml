sulfur-oxidizing (SOX) bacteria that provide them with nutrition. We sequenced the SOX symbiont genomes from two <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> species. Comparison of these symbiont genomes with those of their closest relatives revealed that the symbionts have undergone genome rearrangements, and up to 35% of their genes may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Many of the genes specific to the symbionts were homologs of virulence genes. We discovered an abundant and diverse array of genes similar to insecticidal toxins of nematode and aphid symbionts, and toxins of pathogens such as <italic>Yersinia</italic> and <italic>Vibrio</italic>. Transcriptomics and proteomics revealed that the SOX symbionts express the toxin-related genes (TRGs) in their hosts. We hypothesize that the symbionts use these TRGs in beneficial interactions with their host, including protection against parasites. This would explain why a mutualistic symbiont would contain such a remarkable ‘arsenal’ of TRGs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07966.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07966.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07966.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Although bacteria are commonly associated with causing illness, many are actually beneficial to the organism they live in or on. The phenomenon of one species helping another to survive is known as symbiosis.</p><p>Animals thrive at hydrothermal vents in the deep sea because of their partnerships with symbiotic bacteria. The bacteria use the geochemical energy found at hydrothermal vents to convert carbon into sugars, thus providing their animal hosts with essential nutrients. Unlike the symbiotic communities that associate with humans and other mammals, in which thousands of bacterial species co-exist, deep-sea mussels associate with just one or two species of symbiotic bacteria. This relative simplicity is ideal for investigating how the intimate associations between animals and bacteria work.</p><p>Genes contain the instructions cells and organisms need to survive, and so one way that researchers investigate symbiosis is by studying the genes of the organisms involved. Such studies of beneficial bacteria are beginning to reveal that the molecular mechanisms involved in symbiosis are remarkably similar to those responsible for the harmful effects produced by some bacteria.</p><p>By performing genetic sequencing on the symbiotic bacteria from deep-sea mussels, Sayavedra et al. have discovered that the bacteria have an unusually large number of toxin-like genes, and that all of these genes are active in the bacteria when they are inside host mussels. This was unexpected, as the bacteria are known to benefit their mussel hosts. The toxin-like genes from the symbiotic bacteria are similar to toxins found in the bacteria that cause diseases such as cholera and the plague in humans and other animals.</p><p>Sayavedra et al. suggest that the symbiotic bacteria have ‘tamed’ these toxins to use them in beneficial interactions with their host. For example, some of the toxins could help the bacteria and mussels to recognize and interact with each other, and others could help to protect the mussel host from its natural enemies. The next step will be to test these ideas, which will be challenging as the mussels cannot be bred in the laboratory.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mussels of the genus <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> dominate deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps worldwide. The key to their ecological and evolutionary success is their symbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria that provide them with nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">von Cosel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Van Dover et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussels host their symbionts inside specialized gill epithelial cells called bacteriocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cavanaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Petersen and Dubilier, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Their filtering activity exposes <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussels to a plethora of diverse microbes in their environment. Despite this, they are colonized by only one or a few specific types of chemosynthetic symbionts. Some mussel species associate exclusively with sulfur-oxidizing (SOX) symbionts that use reduced sulfur compounds and sometimes hydrogen as an energy source, and carbon dioxide as a carbon source. Some have only methane-oxidizing (MOX) symbionts that use methane as an energy source and carbon source. Some mussel species host both types in a dual symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fisher et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Distel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Duperron et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dubilier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>). In all species except one, a single 16S rRNA phylotype for each type of symbiont (SOX or MOX) is found in the gills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dubilier et al., 2008</xref>). There are more than 30 described <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> species, and most associate with a characteristic symbiont phylotype, which is not found in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Duperron et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although these associations are clearly very specific, the molecular mechanisms that underpin this specificity are still unknown. No chemosynthetic symbiont has ever been obtained in pure culture. Therefore, molecular methods for investigating uncultured microbes have been essential for understanding their biodiversity, function, and evolution (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dubilier et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts are assumed to be horizontally transmitted, which means that each new host generation must take up their symbionts from the surrounding environment or co-occurring adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">Won et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kadar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">DeChaine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fontanez and Cavanaugh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Wentrup et al., 2014</xref>). To initiate the symbiosis, hosts and symbionts must have evolved highly specific recognition and attachment mechanisms. Once they have been recognized, the symbionts need to enter host cells and avoid immediate digestion, just like other intracellular symbionts such as <italic>Burkholderia rhizoxinica</italic> and <italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum,</italic> or pathogens such as <italic>Legionella, Listeria</italic>, or <italic>Yersinia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hentschel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Moebius et al., 2014</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Indeed, like many intracellular pathogens, the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts seem to induce a loss of microvilli on the cells they colonize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cossart and Sansonetti, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhavsar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Haglund and Welch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Wentrup et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the symbionts achieve dense populations inside the host cells (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Duperron et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Halary et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, they must be able to avoid immediate digestion by their hosts. Although the mechanisms of host cell entry and immune evasion have been extensively studied in pathogens and plant–microbe associations such as the rhizobia-legume symbiosis, far less is known about the mechanisms beneficial symbionts use to enter and survive within animal host cells.</p><p>The symbiosis between <italic>Vibrio fisheri</italic> bacteria and <italic>Euprymna scolopes</italic> squid is one of the few beneficial host-microbe associations where the molecular mechanisms of host-symbiont interaction have been investigated. A number of factors are involved in initiating this symbiosis such as the symbiont-encoded ‘TCT toxin’, which is related to the tracheal cytotoxin of <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">McFall-Ngai et al., 2013</xref>). A few studies of intracellular insect symbionts have shown that they use type III and type IV secretion systems to establish and maintain their association with their host (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23a">Dale and Moran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151a">Snyder and Rio, 2013</xref>). These secretion systems are commonly used by intracellular pathogens to hijack host cell processes, allowing their entry and survival within host cells (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hueck, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Steele-Mortimer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Backert and Meyer, 2006</xref>). An example is the <italic>Sodalis</italic> symbionts of aphids and weevils, which use a type III secretion system for entry to the host cell and are thought to have evolved from pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dale et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clayton et al., 2012</xref>). The virulence determinants of their pathogenic ancestors might therefore have been co-opted for use in beneficial interactions with their insect hosts.</p><p>In contrast to the <italic>Sodalis</italic> symbionts of insects and the <italic>Vibrio</italic> symbionts of squid, the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbionts are not closely related to any known pathogens. Moreover, because they fall interspersed between free-living SOX bacteria in 16S rRNA phylogenies, they are hypothesized to have evolved multiple times from free-living ancestors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Petersen et al., 2012</xref>). Comparative genomics is a powerful tool for identifying the genomic basis of beneficial and pathogenic interactions, particularly if the symbionts or pathogens have close free-living relatives that do not associate with a host (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Galagan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Ogier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib179">Zuleta et al., 2014</xref>). Genomes of closely related free-living and symbiotic relatives of <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbionts were recently published. Their closest free-living relatives are marine SOX bacteria called SUP05, which are abundant in the world's oceans, particularly in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) and hydrothermal plumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Sunamura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lavik et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Walsh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anantharaman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Wright et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Petersen and Dubilier, 2014</xref>). The <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbionts and SUP05 bacteria form a monophyletic clade together with the SOX symbionts of vesicomyid clams based on 16S rRNA gene phylogenies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Distel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Petersen et al., 2012</xref>). Closed genomes are available for the symbionts of two clam species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kuwahara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Newton et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>All members of this monophyletic group (the mussel and clam symbionts, and SUP05) share similar core metabolic features. They are all capable of autotrophic growth, and all use reduced sulfur compounds as an energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Newton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Walsh et al., 2009</xref>). They can differ in auxiliary metabolic capabilities such as hydrogen oxidation, nitrate reduction, or mixotrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Newton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anantharaman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Murillo et al., 2014</xref>). However, the major difference between these organisms is their lifestyle: SUP05 bacteria are exclusively free-living. The clam symbionts are exclusively host-associated, are vertically transmitted, and have reduced genomes. The <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts appear to have adapted to both niches, as they have a host-associated stage and are assumed to also have a free-living stage.</p><p>The goal of this study was to identify the genomic basis of host-symbiont interactions in <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbioses. We used high-throughput sequencing and binning techniques to assemble the first essentially complete draft genomes of the SOX symbionts from <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussels. We used comparative genomics of the symbionts' genomes to those of their close free-living and obligate symbiotic relatives to reveal genes potentially involved in <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> host-symbiont interactions. We used phylogenetics and bioinformatic prediction of horizontally acquired genes to investigate the origins of these genes. Finally, we used transcriptomics and proteomics to determine whether potential host-symbiont interaction genes are being expressed by the symbionts in their host.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Draft genome sequences of <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts</title><p>We sequenced the genomes of the SOX symbionts from three <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> individuals: two were <italic>Bathymodiolus azoricus</italic> from the Menez Gwen vent field on the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Symbiont draft genomes from each individual were almost complete (see ‘Materials and methods’). Despite different sequencing and assembly strategies, the draft genomes were 90.7–97.7% complete (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The total assembly sizes were between 1.7 and 2.3 Mbp, on 52 to 506 contigs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Each draft genome contained one copy of the 16S rRNA gene.

To further investigate the functional role of the TRGs encoded by the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts, we tested whether similar genes are more likely to be found in bacteria that live in a particular niche (extracellular host-associated, intracellular host-associated, or free-living), or that express a particular phenotype (pathogenesis or biofilm formation).</p><p>First, we used the Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance to determine whether the distribution of the three TRGs classes differed significantly (I) between biofilm-forming vs non-biofilm-forming bacteria, (II) between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, and (III) between free-living bacteria, host-associated intracellular bacteria, and host-associated extracellular bacteria, without considering whether the bacteria were pathogenic.

Some of the characterized toxin proteins are associated with membranes. We therefore also analyzed a fraction enriched in membrane proteins. In these proteomes, we found 12 YD repeat proteins and one RTX. We also found a number of toxin-associated proteins such as one RTX activator and two RTX toxin transporters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). Nine of the 12 identified YD repeat proteins were present in the membrane proteome. Our method allowed us to identify symbiont-encoded proteins that were found in higher relative abundance in the whole gill fraction compared to the symbiont-enriched fraction (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Appendix 4</xref>). These proteins are potentially exported to the host tissue, indicating that they play a role in direct host-symbiont interactions.

Alternatively, the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts could have acquired these genes via HGT after their divergence from the clam symbionts and SUP05. Toxins are often found in ‘genomic islands’ that have been acquired through HGT (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Lindsay et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Ochman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dobrindt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Soucy et al., 2015</xref>). Several observations point towards HGT of the TRGs into the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts rather than their loss by the clam symbionts and SUP05. Firstly, 63–68% of the TRGs could be identified as potentially horizontally acquired based on codon usage analysis, in contrast to 30–35% predicted for all coding sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). This means that their transfer was relatively recent, as the codon usage of these genes has not yet adapted to one typical of the symbiont genomes. Secondly, the content of the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiont genomes attest to the major role that HGT has played in their evolution. They are enriched in mobile elements such as transposases and restriction-modification systems compared to their closest relatives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). The lack of synteny we observed in the symbiont genomes is consistent with the presence of mobile elements and major HGT events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kobayashi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Rocha and Danchin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achaz et al., 2003</xref>). Thirdly, the TRGs from the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts are similar to genes from distantly related bacteria. Finally, mobile elements were regularly found directly upstream or downstream of the TRGs in the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiont genomes. The linkage of mobile elements with some of these genes could explain the mechanism of their transfer into the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiont genomes. This could also explain why each genome contained multiple copies of TRGs, as mobile elements are also prone to duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Reams and Neidle, 2004</xref>). Considering these observations, and the absence of these TRGs in their close relatives, we consider it most likely that they were acquired through HGT.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Are some of the TRGs used for direct beneficial interactions between hosts and symbionts?</title><p>Genes from the second major class of TRGs, MARTX, that were similar to those from <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiont, were significantly enriched in beneficial and pathogenic host-associated bacteria. One of the regions encoding MARTX genes from the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbiont has a domain structure similar to the filamentous hemagglutinin FhaB from <italic>B. pertussis</italic> and <italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica</italic> (MARTX1, see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3">Appendix 3</xref>). FhaB is involved in attachment of <italic>Bordetella</italic> to their human host and suppression of the immune response (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Melvin et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> has two distinct phenotypic stages: an infective stage, where <italic>fhaB</italic> is upregulated, and a non-infective stage, where <italic>fhaB</italic> is downregulated. The non-infective stage is necessary for its survival in the environment outside of the host. The lifestyle of the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiont has striking similarities to <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic>. The symbionts must also survive in the environment to be transmitted from one host generation to the next. Our transcriptomes showed that these MARTX genes are expressed by <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts within the host tissue. Unfortunately, we do not have samples to test whether they are downregulated in environmental symbiont stages. If so, it may have a similar function to its homologs in pathogenic <italic>Bordetella</italic>. MARTX-like genes also mediate cell–cell attachment in the symbiotic bacterial consortium ‘<italic>Chlorochromatium aggregatum</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Vogl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Liu et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Are some of the YD repeat proteins used for antagonistic bacteria–bacteria interactions?</title><p>Like the MARTX, YD repeat proteins were also significantly more enriched in host-associated compared to free-living bacteria.

These may compete with each other for nutrients and energy, or for space within host cells. Bacteria that express toxins to inhibit their close relatives need an immunity protein to protect them from each toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benz and Meinhart, 2014</xref>). These immunity proteins are encoded immediately downstream or upstream of the toxin protein. The toxin-immunity pair is usually linked to genes encoding a type VI secretion system, which is the mechanism of toxin delivery for all so far described YD proteins involved in bacteria–bacteria competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benz and Meinhart, 2014</xref>). None of the YD repeat proteins in the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbiont genome was found in an operon with an identifiable immunity protein, and no type VI secretion system gene was found in any of our draft genomes. The arrangement of YD repeat genes in the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiont genomes and the lack of genes encoding type VI secretion systems are therefore inconsistent with a role in competition between closely related symbiont strains.</p><p><italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussels are also infected by bacterial intranuclear pathogens called <italic>Candidatus</italic> Endonucleobacter bathymodioli, which are related to the genus <italic>Endozoicomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Zielinski et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Ca</italic>. E. bathymodioli invades the mussel cell nuclei where it multiplies, eventually bursting the infected cell. Intranuclear bacteria are never found in the nuclei of symbiont-containing cells, which led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Zielinski et al. (2009)</xref> to hypothesize that the symbionts can protect their host cells against infection. Consistent with this hypothesis, growth inhibition assays showed that <italic>B. azoricus</italic> gill tissue homogenates inhibit the growth of a broader spectrum of pathogens compared to the symbiont-free foot tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bettencourt et al., 2007</xref>).

For example, the genomes of the SOX symbionts of hydrothermal vent <italic>Riftia</italic> tubeworms and the heterotrophic symbionts of whale-fall <italic>Osedax</italic> worms are virtually complete, but they only contain one or a few RTX genes, and no YD repeat genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Robidart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gardebrecht et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Goffredi et al., 2014</xref>).

It is therefore highly unlikely that the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbionts are pathogens that have been mistaken for beneficial symbionts. The remarkably large number of TRGs in the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbionts bears striking similarity to the arsenal of toxins encoded by <italic>Candidatus</italic> Hamiltonella defensa, which is a facultative symbiont of aphids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Oliver et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">2005</xref>).

Hamiltonella defensa is a defensive symbiont that protects its host from attack by parasitic wasps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Oliver et al., 2003</xref>).

This raises the intriguing possibility that some of the TRGs in the SOX symbiont genomes might function in protecting the mussel hosts against eukaryotic parasites.</p><p>Compared to our knowledge of parasitism in shallow-water bivalves, little is known about parasitism in deep-sea <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussels. This is surprising considering that these incredibly dense communities would be ideal habitats for parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Moreira and López-García, 2003</xref>). Two studies have investigated parasitism in <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussels based on the microscopic identification of unusual ‘inclusions’ in mussel tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Powell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Ward et al., 2004</xref>). The most abundant parasites resembled <italic>Bucephalus</italic>-like trematodes of the phylum Platyhelminthes, which are common in shallow-water mussels (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Wardle, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Lauenstein et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">da Silva et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Minguez et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Bucephalus</italic> trematodes infect the gonads of their mussel hosts, which often results in sterilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Hopkins, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coustau et al., 1991</xref>).

If many of the TRGs encoded by the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbiont are being used to defend its host against parasites, as is hypothesized for <italic>Ca</italic>. H. defensa, then this could help to explain why <italic>B. childressi</italic> is so heavily infected by trematodes. The MOX symbionts of <italic>B. azoricus</italic> and <italic>B. childressi</italic> do not encode the abundant TRGs of the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbiont (Antony CP, personal communication, May 2015).</p><p>Our SNP analysis provides further support for the hypothesis that some TRGs may be used for direct beneficial interactions, and some may be used for indirect interactions such as protection against parasites. Genes involved in direct host-symbiont interactions such as recognition and communication are expected to be conserved within the symbiont population of one host species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Jiggins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailly et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this, eight out of nine genes in the MARTX1 region, which we hypothesize may be involved in attachment to the host, do not have a significantly larger number of SNPs per kb compared to the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). In the ninth gene, annotated as a hypothetical protein, SNPs per kb were slightly above average. In contrast to genes involved in direct host-symbiont interactions, those involved in indirect interactions such as defense against parasites are expected to be highly diverse (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Appendix 2</xref>). The large sequence variability in 22 of the TRGs is therefore consistent with a role for these genes in protecting the host against parasites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The genomes of the uncultured <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbionts encode a unique arsenal of TRGs, unexpected for a beneficial, nutritional symbiont. We hypothesize that the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbiont has ‘tamed’ these genes for use in beneficial interactions with their host. Some of the TRGs may benefit the symbiosis by protecting the symbionts and their hosts from their natural enemies. In most cases, symbionts are either nutritional, that is, their primary role is to provide their host with most or all of its nutrition, or they are defensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Douglas, 2014</xref>). The <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiont is therefore unusual, as it may play an essential role in both nutrition and defense.

An alternative to the hypothesis that toxins may be tamed for use in beneficial interactions would be that ‘symbiosis factors’ may be commandeered for use in harmful interactions. Given our recent recognition of the ubiquity and vast natural diversity of mutualistic interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">McFall-Ngai et al., 2013</xref>), it is possible that many of the genes that are currently annotated as toxins may have first evolved through beneficial host-microbe associations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sampling and processing of <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussels</title><p>We collected <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussels in Lilliput, Menez Gwen, and Lucky Strike vent sites on the MAR. <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> sp. from Lilliput on the SMAR were sampled and processed for genome sequencing as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Petersen et al.

Most were related to toxins from three broad previously defined classes, the YD repeats, RTX, and MARTX toxins. Most of the YD repeat and RTX genes could be identified accurately by automatic annotation due to the presence of signature repeat regions. Some of the predicted YD genes appeared to be truncated. Alignment with the closest hits was used to extend the partial ORFs that were not correctly predicted. To curate the annotation of MARTX genes, we built Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles for the characterized MARTX domains in <italic>Vibrio cholerae:</italic> actin cross-linking domain, Rho GTPase inactivation, and cysteine protease domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Satchell, 2011</xref>). The profiles were used to scan the SOX symbiont genomes with HMMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Finn et al., 2011</xref>). We searched for functional domains in the proteins identified as TRGs with SMART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Ponting et al., 1999</xref>). To analyze the diversity and redundancy of the TRGs in the SOX genomes, we constructed a protein similarity network. All protein sequences of the SOX symbionts were searched against Uniprot with BLAST (coverage &gt;50%, similarity &gt;25%, e-value &lt; e−5). We also used BLAST of all against all sequences of the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbiont to recover partial TRGs that could not be identified by automatic annotation. The two searches were combined to produce a sequence similarity network based on transitivity clustering using the plugin Blast2SimilarityGraph in Cytoscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Srinivasan and Moon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">Wittkop et al., 2010</xref>). Only the sub-networks that were connected in a maximum of two steps to the TRGs were considered. All TRGs of the SOX symbionts were submitted to Phyre2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kelley and Sternberg, 2009</xref>) to predict the secondary structure of the protein. We looked for clusters in the protein similarity network that could be associated with a subunit of a toxin complex or an active domain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Search for TRGs in SUP05</title><p>None of the three toxin-related classes has characteristic patterns, profiles, or domains that can be searched with standard tools. Often, their only shared feature is a repeat region, such as the RTX repeat in RTX and MARTX, which is a calcium-binding site containing G and N residues. However, the number of G and N residues and the length of the repeat is highly variable, which makes profile searches impossible. Moreover, these repeat regions can be shared by other calcium-binding proteins such as integrins and fibronectin, which do not act as toxins. The sequence and length of the YD repeat is similarly variable. To identify homologs of the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiont TRGs in published metagenomes and metatranscriptomes, we therefore used BLASTp (coverage &gt;50%, similarity &gt;25%, e-value &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref>).</p><p>Best hits were blasted against the SOX symbiont proteins to search for signatures of the TRGs.

Kruskall–Wallis and Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon tests were used to estimate if the increased number of a class of TR is biased in a certain lifestyle.

IMG was used as starting point to search for curated genomes that had genes with similarity to the TRGs of the mussel symbionts (&gt;10% similarity, e-value &lt; e<sup>−5</sup>). The protein sequences of these genomes were retrieved from NCBI based on the genome name (modified Python script from Sixing Huang, Max Planck Institute Bremen). BLASTp was used to retrieve protein sequences related to the SOX TRGs (&gt;50% coverage, &gt; 25% similarity, e-value of 0.001). 122 genomes had at least one gene that was similar to at least one TRG. We considered the genomes of different strains as independent events for statistical analysis, as even closely related strains can have different lifestyles. These genomes were manually curated based on a literature search and classified according to the following categories: (1) lifestyle: divided into three sub-categories (a) associated: if the organism is at any stage host-associated (based on IMG metadata), (b) intracellular: includes obligate and facultative symbionts (searched in Google scholar with the keywords ‘intracellular bacteria’ and references read for more details when the abstract was not sufficient), (c) free-living: bacteria that are not host-associated and not intracellular; (2) pathogen: bacteria that can produce disease (information obtained from IMG); (3) biofilm: bacteria found in biofilms (Google scholar keywords ‘biofilm’ and ‘microbial mat’ with literature analyses when not clear).</p><p>The data were formatted and merged with self-written Perl scripts and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">R Development Core Team (2011)</xref>.

To compare the number of TRGs against the lifestyle categories, we used Kruskall–Wallis test. A post hoc analysis was carried out on significant p-values for the associated category with the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test. Statistical analyses were done in R.

role of the symbionts in the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> association</title><p>In their complement of toxin-related genes (TRGs), the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiont genomes closely resemble those of pathogenic bacteria. In fact, it has a larger arsenal of these particular types of TRGs than any so far sequenced pathogen. Considering this, is it possible that their role in the association with their mussel hosts has been misunderstood? Could they in fact be pathogens of <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> rather than beneficial symbionts? Chemosynthetic symbionts are widely assumed to benefit their hosts by contributing a source of organic matter for their nutrition and so far this was also thought to be true for the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbioses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Van Dover, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cavanaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dubilier et al., 2008</xref>). There is a variety of evidence supporting that the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts are in fact an effective source of nutrition, including: (1) <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussels can grow to densities two to five times higher than their shallow-water relatives that rely exclusively on filter-feeding for their nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gebruk et al., 2000</xref>), (2) <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussels have a reduced feeding groove and digestive system compared to their filter-feeding relatives (Gustafson et al., 1998), (3) carbon transfer from sulfur-oxidizing (SOX) symbionts to <italic>B. azoricus</italic> has been demonstrated experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Riou et al., 2010</xref>), and (4) based on their genomes, the symbionts are autotrophs (see below). These observations are all consistent with the hypothesis that the SOX symbionts benefit their <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> hosts by providing them with a source of nutrition.</p></sec><sec id="s7-2"><title>Symbiont metabolism</title><p>The symbionts encode a modified version of the Calvin cycle that lacks the enzyme sedoheptulose-1,7-biphosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Instead, the symbionts have a pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) as described in other chemosynthetic symbioses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Markert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Kleiner et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dmytrenko et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to the clam symbionts and SUP05 that possess ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxidase (RubisCO) form II, <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts have RubisCO form I. RubiscCO form I is better adapted to higher O<sub>2</sub> concentrations and has a medium to low affinity to CO<sub>2</sub>, indicating an adaptation to environments with O<sub>2</sub> present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cavanaugh and Robinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badger and Bek, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The genome did not provide sufficient evidence to determine whether the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts are obligate autotrophs or mixotrophs. None of the three essentially complete symbiont genomes encode the enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which is often absent in the genomes of obligate autotrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Wood et al., 2004</xref>). Some other genes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were also missing, but this may be because the genomes are not yet closed. A few tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters were present, and these could be involved in uptake of organic compounds.</p><p>To acquire the necessary energy to fuel carbon fixation, the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts can utilize reduced sulfur compounds and hydrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kleiner et al., 2012a</xref>). The pathways for sulfur oxidation present in the genomes are similar to those of other SOX symbionts of <italic>R. pachyptila</italic> tubeworms, or vesicomyid and solemyid clam symbionts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Robidart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Harada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kleiner et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dmytrenko et al., 2014</xref>). We found the genes that encode SoxABXYZ and sulfide-quinone reductases (Sqr), which reduce cytochrome c and quinones using sulfide and/or thiosulfate as electron donor. The <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbionts might store elemental sulfur based on the absence of SoxCD sulfur dehydrogenase, although the symbionts lack the large intracellular inclusions typical of sulfur storage, and elemental sulfur has not yet been detected in mussel gills. Sulfide can be oxidized to sulfite with the reverse dissimilatory sulfite reduction pathway (rDsr), and sulfite can be further oxidized to sulfate with APS reductase and an ATP-generating ATP sulfurylase (Sat) (Dahl et al., 2008).</p><p>Besides the use of oxygen as electron acceptor, we found in the most complete genome of the symbiont from <italic>B. azoricus</italic> the genes for the use of nitrate as electron acceptor (nitrate reductase—<italic>narGHIJ</italic>); however, we did not find these genes in the other two symbiont genomes. The genes required to convert nitrite to nitrous oxide were found in all three-draft genomes (nitrite reductase—<italic>nirK</italic> and nitrite oxidoreductase—<italic>norCB</italic>). We might have not found the nitrate reductase in the draft genomes of BspSym and BazSymB due to the incompleteness (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The use of an alternative electron acceptor could reduce the competition for oxygen with their host.</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="app2"><title>Appendix 2</title><boxed-text><sec id="s8" sec-type="appendix"><title>Other potential roles of the TRGs</title><sec id="s8-1"><title>RTX toxins as nutrient-scavenging proteins</title><p>RTX genes were not preferentially found in host-associated bacteria but were also regularly found in free-living bacteria. Bloom-forming aquatic cyanobacteria had some of the highest numbers of RTX genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Cyanobacteria are well-known producers of secondary metabolite toxins called cyanotoxins, but protein toxins of cyanobacteria have received far less attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kaebernick et al., 2000</xref>). A hemolysin-like protein from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 was shown to be located in the S-layer of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> cells, and its deletion causes cells to be more permeable and more sensitive to environmental toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Sakiyama et al., 2011</xref>). This hemolysin-like protein therefore seems to have a protective rather than a toxic function, although it did have slight hemolytic activity when tested against sheep erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Sakiyama et al., 2006</xref>). However, the function of most cyanobacterial RTX toxins has not yet been investigated. Intriguingly, cyanobacterial blooms are tightly coupled to nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Paerl, 2008</xref>). If free-living cyanobacteria can use RTX proteins as toxins to obtain nutrients by lysing other organisms, analogous to pathogens lysing host cells, they could gain access to additional sources of nutrients.</p><p>Members of the marine <italic>Roseobacter</italic> clade also had an unusually large number of RTX genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). <italic>Roseobacter</italic> are some of the most abundant bacteria in marine habitats. They commonly associate with a range of eukaryotic organisms from single-celled phytoplankton to vertebrate and invertebrate animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buchan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Wagner-Döbler and Biebl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brinkhoff et al., 2008</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the RTX genes of <italic>Roseobacter</italic> are expressed, and that they can make up to 90% of the excreted proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christie-Oleza et al., 2012</xref>). However, their function in <italic>Roseobacter</italic> is still unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s8-2"><title>Could strain variation of <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts be promoted by a defensive role of TRGs?</title><p>A role for the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbiont in host defense against pathogens could help to explain why the mussels seem to associate with multiple closely related SOX strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Duperron et al., 2006</xref>). Associations with multiple very similar symbiont strains are considered evolutionarily unstable because they promote the emergence of ‘cheaters’, symbionts that benefit from the association but do not contribute to the cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib170">West et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hart et al., 2013</xref>). For example, a ‘cheater’ could be a SOX symbiont that occupies space within the host, thus gaining access to the electron donors and acceptors it needs for its growth, but passes on less organic matter to the host than neighboring ‘cooperators’. Cheaters have a distinct growth advantage, and could easily outcompete cooperators, ultimately leading to the breakdown of the association. Despite this, multiple strains of SOX bacteria can occur in individual <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Won et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">DeChaine et al., 2006</xref>). Intriguingly, the SOX symbiont strain variation identified in genetic markers such as the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA gene operon is similar to the strain variation seen in natural populations of defensive <italic>Ca</italic>. H. defensa symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Russell et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, we have shown that closely related SOX symbionts show extensive sequence variation in most TRGs, which is also the case for <italic>Ca</italic>. H. defensa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Russell et al., 2013</xref>). This large natural diversity is inconsistent with a role for the TRGs in host-symbiont recognition and communication, as genes mediating these processes should be conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Jiggins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailly et al., 2006</xref>). However, this diversity could be explained by antagonistic co-evolution between protective symbionts and their host's parasites. Indeed, experimental evolution shows that natural enemies quickly acquire resistance to <italic>Ca</italic>. H. defensa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Rouchet and Vorburger, 2014</xref>). However, this resistance is highly specific to the strain of <italic>Ca</italic>. H. defensa, the parasite is experimentally challenged with and is useless against other closely related strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Schmid et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Rouchet and Vorburger, 2014</xref>). Associating with diverse symbiont strains, each with its own unique arsenal of TRGs, could therefore protect the host in the face of rapidly evolving parasite resistance.</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="app3"><title>Appendix 3</title><boxed-text><sec id="s9"><title/><sec id="s9-1"><title>Structure of <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiont TRGs and genomic regions</title><p>In BspSym, the 19 multifunctional autoprocessing RTX (MARTX)-like genes were clustered in two genomic regions that spanned 58.5 kb (MARTX1) and 46.3 kb (MARTX2). Genes predicted in these regions encoded many of the unique features of MARTX genes and other large repetitive RTX proteins including RTX repeats, cysteine protease domains (CPDs), hemagglutinin, and adhesion domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, some of these genes were very large, which is typical of MARTX and MARTX-like genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Satchell, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">2011</xref>). BazSymA and BazSymB also encoded genes with characteristic signatures of MARTX genes, but these two draft genomes were highly fragmented, and the MARTX genes were found on very small genome fragments.</p><p>Both of the BspSym MARTX regions contained genes encoding RTX repeats and RTX CPDs. The RTX CPD has so far only been found in MARTX genes. Its function is to cleave off effector domains, whose sequence and effects on eukaryotic hosts can vary substantially even in MARTX genes from different strains of the same bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Roig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Kwak et al., 2011</xref>). Beyond these shared features, MARTX1 and MARTX2 of the BspSym had distinct differences. Genes in MARTX1 encoded six hemagglutinin domains, two adhesion domains, and a pectin lyase domain. Similar features are found in large repetitive RTX adhesins, except that the CPD domain is not usually found in this protein subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Satchell, 2011</xref>). In fact, the combination of hemagglutinin, pectin lyase, and CPD domains has so far only been found in the filamentous hemagglutinin protein of the betaproteobacterial pathogens <italic>B. pertussis</italic> and <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic>, which is a key determinant of epithelial cell attachment and immune response modulation in <italic>Bordetella</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Melvin et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Bordetella</italic>, where these domains are all encoded in one very large ORF, these domains were encoded in neighboring ORFs in the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiont. However, MARTX-encoding genes are notoriously difficult to predict due to their repetitive structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Satchell, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">2011</xref>). We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that these may in fact encode one large protein in the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiont.</p><p>The second MARTX-like gene cluster in the BspSym genome, MARTX2, resembles a ‘typical’ hemolysin operon. It contains all the necessary genes for type I secretion, and a gene annotated as <italic>rtxA</italic>, which encodes a hemolysin toxin. However, in contrast to typical hemolysin operons, it is missing the hemolysin activator gene. Interestingly, MARTX1, but not MARTX2, contains a gene annotated as a hemolysin activator. Moreover, the MARTX2 region contains four genes that each has up to five CPD domains. The CPD domain is typical for MARTX genes but not for known hemolysins. This region therefore has features characteristic of both RTX and MARTX genes.</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="app4"><title>Appendix 4</title><boxed-text><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>Supplementary materials and methods</title><sec id="s10-1"><title>Symbiont and host separation via density gradient centrifugation for genomics and proteomics from gill tissue</title><p>To separate the SOX symbionts from gill tissues and to obtain a fraction enriched in host cytosolic proteins from the gill, a combination of differential and rate-zonal centrifugation was applied.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Sayavedra et al. reports three draft genomes (of which one was published in 2011 by Petersen et al.) from chemosynthetic symbionts of three deep-sea hydrothermal vent mussels. The symbiontic bacteria were found to have an unusually high number of potentially virulence-associated genes. In particular genes coding for toxins of the types YD and RTX/MARTX were identified. Proteome data provide support for this finding. The findings have interesting and potentially far-reaching implications for the evolution of symbioses, as well as it gives insights into possible mechanisms of host-microbe interactions.</p><p>The reviewers found that this is a generally well-executed paper on a little known symbiont group, the results from which will be of general interest to the symbiosis and bacterial genomics fields, and that a number of improvements and corrections should be made before acceptance of the manuscript. The issues identified by the reviewers will require a rather extensive revision. Please find the following synthesis that combines the issues identified from the three reviewers into a single review:</p><p>1) The interesting statement that “33% of their genes may have been acquired by HGT” (in the Abstract) is not sufficiently supported by data and discussion in the manuscript. According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, this number was only found in 1 of 3 draft genomes. How representative is this value?</p><p>2) In the third paragraph of the Introduction, the prominent role of the <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic> symbiont toxin (TCT) and its role in initiating squid symbioses should be cited in this context.</p><p>3) In the subsection “Draft genome sequences of <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts” and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> were the 33% of foreign genes only found in BspSym? Does the symbol “-” mean that these were not tested or not found in BazSymB and BazSymA? If they were not found, one would then have to question the relevance of HGT for these systems. If they were not tested, one would need to ask why this seemingly important analysis was omitted. As a minor point, completeness estimates that are currently stated in the text should be included in this table.</p><p>4) In the subsection “Relationships to other toxins,” you state: “This cluster also contained a number of beneficial symbionts such as <italic>Burkholderia rhizoxinica</italic>, which is an intracellular symbiont of the fungus <italic>Rhizopus</italic>, and the <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> and <italic>Xenorhabdus</italic> symbionts of soil nematodes.” The examples should be correctly referenced. The <italic>B. rhizoxinica</italic> example is particularly interesting in this context (and very recently published in <italic>eLife</italic>, doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/I.03007">10.7554/I.03007</ext-link>) as this bacterial symbiont of a fungus known to cause rice blight could potentially share a similar strategy in symbiosis establishment.</p><p>5) In the subsection “Expression of toxin-related genes,” the section on transcriptome sequencing, as promised in the Abstract, is presented in the manuscript only with the first two sentences. There appears to be no visuals (figures, tables neither in main body nor supplement) and no methods description. The RNASeq approach should be removed.</p><p>6) In the subsection “Are some of the toxins used for direct beneficial interactions between hosts and symbionts?”, other examples from the symbiotic world should also be mentioned.</p><p>7) In the Conclusions (and also the Abstract), the interpretation of a tamed toxin, although a catchy phrase, appears overstated as long as the function of the toxins is not known. Is it not also conceivable that the symbionts are not as “beneficial” as previously thought? Provocatively stated, must the paradigm of <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbioses be rewritten? The early window of host-symbiont contact or a system like the present one, where a symbiont must always be acquired horizontally anew with each new generation may need a specific/aggressive line of defense. Alternatively, and in analogy to the <italic>Xenorhabdus</italic> system, could the host be using the toxins for defense against bigger predators or could chemical defense play a role? Several scenarios are conceivable, which attribute to the relevance of the presented findings.</p><p>8) The Conclusions paragraph provides an elegant and thought-provoking perspective and a testimony why the findings are relevant. The results could indeed be paradigm-shifting in chemoautotrophic symbioses and other, related symbiosis-systems in general.</p><p>9) With regards the subsection “Sampling and processing of <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussels”, where are the transcriptome data and why were they not included?</p><p>10) This is the first report of the genome sequence(s) of mussel chemosynthetic symbionts: “[…] to assemble the first essentially complete draft genomes of the SOX symbionts from <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussels” (last paragraph of the Introduction). However, this paper “leaps” over characterization of the genomes to focus on a particular subset of genes with hardly any description of the genomes themselves. The only information included in addition to the “toxin” genes is the size, 16S identity, GC content, shared numbers of genes, and mobile elements. No details or discussion on the coverage (total bp vary widely for the 3 genomes, as only part of the 16S was recovered for one host symbiont, suggests not very good), binning (<italic>B. azoricus</italic> has two different symbionts – SOX, MOX), assembly (or lack thereof), sequence heterogeneity, meta genomes (if environmental – different strains?), and genome size (very small for a free-living symbiont if estimate is correct from contigs). Functional genes/metabolic capabilities are not described. Further, the reported aspects of the mussel genomes are only compared to the vesicomyids and SUP05. What about the other symbionts?</p><p>In the absence of a general description of the mussel symbiont genomes, it is hard to put the importance of “toxin” genes in context. If this was just another strain of a bacterial species, then perhaps it is okay to skip any real description of the genome. However, there are very few chemosynthetic symbiont genomes sequenced to date, only 7 in total: 2 tubeworms, 1 oligochaetes, and 4 molluscs: 2 vesicomyids, 1 solemyid, and 1 snail. For these mussel symbionts, is there any genomic evidence for free-living? Mobile elements? Heterotrophs? Actually, I was most surprised to find in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Appendix 2</xref> that “the symbionts appear to be obligate autotrophs […]” as all 3 genomes lack alpha-ketoglutarate DH, and have few transporters for organic C uptake.</p><p>Please provide the primary description of the genomes in the supplement including a cursory description of major metabolic pathways.</p><p>11) “Toxin” genes is the main focus of this paper, but the function of these genes is not known, and the genes were identified based only on their sequence annotation as “toxin” or “virulence” genes, falling into three classes based in part on shared motifs. The sequences are so divergent they cannot be confidently aligned except for a few of the YD class (in the subsection “Relationships to other toxins”). The authors go to great lengths and sophisticated analyses to ID them as “toxin” genes including constructing gene similarity networks with clusters containing genes with &gt;25% similarity over at least half of the gene length. They compare the mussel symbiont toxin genes with those of other bacteria, examining “host-associated”, free-living”, etc. relationships with interesting correlations. Transcriptome analyses show they are all expressed, with some also via proteomics.</p><p>These analyses are quite interesting, and certainly challenge common thinking about mutualistic vs. parasitic associations and the roles of bacterial proteins and their role in disease. However, the functions of these “toxin” genes are not known, and the slant of the paper, including the title “toxin” and “arsenal” is almost entirely regarding the gene products as toxins.</p><p>“Toxin” genes are also detected in bacteria other than pathogens, also with unknown functions for the most part. The extensive discussion on the possible roles of these genes, necessitated given the lack of known function, is totally speculative and would benefit from a shorter and more focused treatment. For example, the authors speculate both that the bacteria have “tamed” the toxin genes to use in a mutualistic symbiosis and later that they may have been ancestral and their original function was mutualistic. Or that the toxin genes may function to protect the host against eukaryotic parasites.</p><p>On a semantic note, in efforts to promote studies of beneficial microbe/animal associations as informing parasitic or pathogenic associations, Margaret McFall-Ngai has suggested that terms like “virulence” and other disease related terminology be changed to more neutral terms, which I heartily endorse. The use of “toxin” or “pathogen” is disease-centric (and therefore mostly human-centric). To a bacterium, they have evolved mechanisms to obtain food (e.g., toxins to break open cells). If possible, use of a “symbiosis” term will be very helpful for presenting a balanced view of the possible functions of the “toxin” genes. Further, though “toxin-related” is used in the title, the paper quickly refers to these genes and their putative products as “toxins,” which, in the absence of function, is not correct.</p><p>12) Some larger patterns are suggested, e.g. that these genes are generally enriched in genomes of host associated bacteria. However, in the subsection “Are some of the toxins used for protection against eukaryotic parasites” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the analysis is not very meaningful because there is a phylogenetic component that is not taken into account. In other words, the clustering may reflect similarities of related species more than a repeated evolutionary pattern. This issue should be considered – can you show that there is a pattern independent of phylogeny?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Abundant toxin-related genes in the genomes of beneficial symbionts from deep-sea hydrothermal vent mussels” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Virtually all of my earlier concerns have been addressed, but those which I feel still require attention are as follows:</p><p>1) I still find the term “toxin-related” to carry too heavy a connotation of the former. And as noted, we are trying to get “pathogen neutral” language used for host-microbe associations. What about using “toxin-related” but then abbreviate “T-R” and use that throughout. That way you have defined it, but the letters don't impress as negative.</p><p>Other toxins to fix:</p><p>a) “Array of toxins,” “these toxins” (Abstract).</p><p>b) “RTX toxins” (in the subsection “Gene-based comparison reveals toxin-related genes specific to <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts”).</p><p>c) “[…] of toxin gene” (in the subsection heading “Statistical analyses of toxin gene content in microbial genomes”) – if it is shown in each case that it is a toxin, then the term is okay to use, otherwise, use “toxin and T-R genes[…]”.</p><p>d) “Toxin genes of the mussel” (in the subsection “Statistical analyses of toxin gene content in microbial genomes”).</p><p>2) Have the “toxin genes” been characterized as real toxins for organisms named? Including action, cyano, and firmicute? Clarify for any uncharacterized as “toxin-related.”</p><p>3) You refer to “massive genome rearrangements” (Abstract and text), but this is only relative to the related symbionts and SUP05.

The issues identified by the reviewers will require a rather extensive revision. Please find the following synthesis that combines the issues identified from the three reviewers into a single review.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The interesting statement that “33% of their genes may have been acquired by HGT” (in the Abstract) is not sufficiently supported by data and discussion in the manuscript. According to</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>, this number was only found in 1 of 3 draft genomes. How representative is this value?</italic></p><p>Originally we only did this analysis for the genome that has the longest scaffolds, but you are correct, there is no reason why we shouldn’t do this analysis for all SOX symbiont draft genomes. We now added data from the missing two draft genomes of the SOX symbionts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The proportion of genes potentially acquired through HGT is very similar in all three, (30-35%).</p><p><italic>2) In the third paragraph of the Introduction, the prominent role of the</italic> Vibrio fischeri <italic>symbiont toxin (TCT) and its role in initiating squid symbioses should be cited in this context.</italic></p><p>Thank you for pointing out this example! We have now added the following paragraph to the Introduction:</p><p>“The symbiosis between <italic>Vibrio fisheri</italic> bacteria and <italic>Euprymna scolopes</italic> squid is one of the few beneficial host-microbe associations where the molecular mechanisms of host-symbiont interaction have been investigated. A number of factors are involved in initiating this symbiosis such as the symbiont-encoded ‘TCT toxin’, which is related to the tracheal cytotoxin of <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">McFall-Ngai et al., 2013</xref>).”</p><p>We also discovered another important example of toxin-like genes mediating symbiosis, and have added this information to the Discussion:</p><p>“MARTX-like genes also mediate cell-cell attachment in the symbiotic bacterial consortium ‘<italic>Chlorochromatium aggregatum’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Vogl et al., 2008</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) In the subsection “Draft genome sequences of Bathymodiolus symbionts” and</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref> <italic>were the 33% of foreign genes only found in BspSym? Does the symbol “-” mean that these were not tested or not found in BazSymB and BazSymA?</italic></p><p>As above (response to point 1), we have now done this analysis for BazSymB and BazSymA and updated <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> accordingly.</p><p><italic>If they were not found, one would then have to question the relevance of HGT for these systems. If they were not tested, one would need to ask why this seemingly important analysis was omitted. As a minor point, completeness estimates that are currently stated in the text should be included in this table.</italic></p><p>We have now added new completeness estimates in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. We used a new analysis tool, CheckM (Parks et al., PeerJ, 2015) to estimate the completeness of our draft genomes, which is between 90.7 to 97.7%.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection “Relationships to other toxins,” you state: “This cluster also contained a number of beneficial symbionts such as</italic> Burkholderia rhizoxinica<italic>, which is an intracellular symbiont of the fungus</italic> Rhizopus<italic>, and the</italic> Photorhabdus <italic>and</italic> Xenorhabdus <italic>symbionts of soil nematodes.” The examples should be correctly referenced. The</italic> B. rhizoxinica <italic>example is particularly interesting in this context (and very recently published in eLife,</italic> doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/I.03007">10.7554/I.03007</ext-link><italic>) as this bacterial symbiont of a fungus known to cause rice blight could potentially share a similar strategy in symbiosis establishment.</italic></p><p>Thank you for pointing out this excellent study. This section was shortened to remove redundancy in the manuscript. However, we kept a similar paragraph in the Introduction, which is now properly referenced as follows:</p><p>“Once they have been recognized, the symbionts need to enter host cells and avoid immediate digestion, just like other intracellular symbionts such as <italic>Burkholderia rhizoxinica and Rhizobium leguminosarum,</italic> or pathogens such as <italic>Legionella, Listeria</italic> or <italic>Yersinia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hentschel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Moebius et al., 2014</xref>).”</p><p><italic>5) In the subsection “Expression of toxin-related genes,” the section on transcriptome sequencing, as promised in the Abstract, is presented in the manuscript only with the first two sentences. There appears to be no visuals (figures, tables neither in main body nor supplement) and no methods description. The RNASeq approach should be removed.</italic></p><p>We created a new table with the expression values of the toxins found in six metatranscriptomes (three animals each from the two different species) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). We have included a more detailed description of the transcriptomes in the Results section:</p><p>“Transcriptome sequencing revealed that all predicted toxin-related genes of the SOX symbionts in <italic>B. azoricus</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. sp gills were expressed. […] The expression levels of some genes from the RTX, MARTX and YD repeats classes were in some cases higher than the expression of the essential Calvin cycle gene ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxidase (RuBisCO)<italic>,</italic> which accounted for 0.03 to 0.5% of mRNA in <italic>B. azoricus</italic> symbionts and 0.11 to 1.04% in <italic>B</italic>. sp. Symbionts.”</p><p>The transcriptomics methods are described in the subsection “Transcriptomics” of the Materials and methods section.</p><p>The RNAseq data is important not only for showing that the toxin-like genes are actually expressed by the symbionts in the host, but also for our analysis of the toxin gene variability within SOX symbiont populations. We would therefore prefer to keep this analysis in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) In the subsection “Are some of the toxins used for direct beneficial interactions between hosts and symbionts?”, other examples from the symbiotic world should also be mentioned.</italic></p><p>As written above in our response to point 4, this section has been shortened and removed from the Discussion, but we have now included some examples of beneficial symbioses to the similar paragraph in the Introduction.</p><p><italic>7) In the Conclusions (and also the Abstract), the interpretation of a tamed toxin, although a catchy phrase, appears overstated as long as the function of the toxins is not known.</italic></p><p>We have toned down the wording in the Abstract to simply say: “[…] we hypothesize that these toxin-related genes are used by the symbionts in beneficial interactions with their host.”</p><p>We have kept this wording in the Conclusions, as it leads into a discussion of the possibility that toxins were not ‘tamed’, but symbiosis factors evolved first and were subsequently ‘commandeered’ for use in pathogenesis. This paragraph was well regarded by the reviewers (see point 8).</p><p><italic>Is it not also conceivable that the symbionts are not as “beneficial” as previously thought? Provocatively stated, must the paradigm of</italic> Bathymodiolus <italic>symbioses be rewritten? The early window of host-symbiont contact or a system like the present one, where a symbiont must always be acquired horizontally anew with each new generation may need a specific/aggressive line of defense. Alternatively, and in analogy to the</italic> Xenorhabdus <italic>system, could the host be using the toxins for defense against bigger predators or could chemical defense play a role? Several scenarios are conceivable, which attribute to the relevance of the presented findings.</italic></p><p>We also considered the possibility that the symbionts are not as “beneficial” as previously thought, and had a short paragraph on this topic in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Appendix 2</xref> in the original submission. Considering the reviewers’ request to shorten the Discussion, we decided to keep this section in the Appendix. We have now improved the visibility of this Appendix section by beginning the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“There is overwhelming evidence that sulfur-oxidizing symbionts are beneficial for their <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussel hosts (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Appendix 2</xref>). It is therefore highly unlikely that the SOX symbionts are pathogens that have been mistaken for beneficial symbionts.”</p><p>As you correctly state, it is true that the symbiont could be defending the host against parasites (we hypothesize this role for some of the toxin-related proteins beginning in the Discussion section under the title “Are some of the toxins used for protection against eukaryotic parasites?”).</p><p><italic>8) The Conclusions paragraph provides an elegant and thought-provoking perspective and a testimony why the findings are relevant. The results could indeed be paradigm-shifting in chemoautotrophic symbioses and other, related symbiosis-systems in general.</italic></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><italic>9) With regards the subsection “Sampling and processing of</italic> Bathymodiolus <italic>mussels”, where are the transcriptome data and why were they not included?</italic></p><p>As mentioned above in our response to point 6, we now included a <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref> that includes the expression values. We have included more detail on the transcriptomics in the Results section (also see above in response to point 6).</p><p><italic>10) This is the first report of the genome sequence(s) of mussel chemosynthetic symbionts: “[…] to assemble the first essentially complete draft genomes of the SOX symbionts from</italic> Bathymodiolus <italic>mussels” (last paragraph of the introduction). However, this paper “leaps” over characterization of the genomes to focus on a particular subset of genes with hardly any description of the genomes themselves. The only info included in addition to the “toxin” genes is the size, 16S identity, GC content, shared numbers of genes, and mobile elements. No details or discussion on the coverage (total bp vary widely for the 3 genomes, as only part of the 16S was recovered for one host symbiont, suggests not very good), binning (</italic>B. azoricus <italic>has two different symbionts – SOX, MOX), assembly (or lack thereof), sequence heterogeneity, meta genomes (if environmental – different strains?), and genome size (very small for a free-living symbiont if estimate is correct from contigs). Functional genes/metabolic capabilities are not described. Further, the reported aspects of the mussel genomes are only compared to the vesicomyids and SUP05. What about the other symbionts?</italic></p><p>We added more information the genome coverage in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. The details of the assembly and binning are described in the Materials and methods section under the heading “DNA extraction, sequencing, genome assembly and binning”. We included a sentence of what features Metawatt considers for the binning to make it clearer:</p><p>“454 sequencing was done by Genoscope to sequence the gradient pellet from gill tissue, and by OIST to sequence the adductor muscle of <italic>B. azoricus</italic>. […] The adductor muscle and gradient pellet metagenomes of <italic>B. azoricus</italic> were binned to separate the SOX symbiont from the MOX symbiont and host genomes with Metawatt V. 1.7, which uses tetranucleotide frequencies, coverage, GC content and taxonomic information for binning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Strous et al., 2012</xref>). Only sequences longer than 800 bp were considered for further analyses.”</p><p><italic>Further, the reported aspects of the mussel genomes are only compared to the vesicomyids and SUP05. What about the other symbionts?</italic></p><p>As above, our focus was on genome mining for genes that mediate host-microbe interactions in the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiosis. We did this by comparing the genomes of the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbionts with their closest free-living and symbiotic relatives that have a similar metabolism (autotrophic sulfur oxidizers), to identify genes specific to the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbionts. A comparison of the genomic and metabolic features of all sulfur-oxidizing symbionts would be a fascinating project, but is beyond the scope of our study. To make this clearer, we added the following sentence to the final paragraph of our Introduction:</p><p>“The goal of this study was to identify the genomic basis of host-symbiont interactions in <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbioses”.</p><p><italic>In the absence of a general description of the mussel symbiont genomes, it is hard to put the importance of “toxin” genes in context. If this was just another strain of a bacterial species, then perhaps it is okay to skip any real description of the genome. However, there are very few chemosynthetic symbiont genomes sequenced to date, only 7 in total: 2 tubeworms, 1 oligochaetes, and 4 molluscs: 2 vesicomyids, 1 solemyid, and 1 snail. For these mussel symbionts, is there any genomic evidence for free-living? Mobile elements? Heterotrophs? Actually, I was most surprised to find in</italic> <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2"><italic>Appendix 2</italic></xref> <italic>that “the symbionts appear to be obligate autotrophs […]” as all 3 genomes lack alpha-ketoglutarate DH, and have few transporters for organic C uptake.</italic></p><p><italic>Please provide the primary description of the genomes in the supplement including a cursory description of major metabolic pathways.</italic></p><p>As you also correctly stated, our study focuses on one aspect of the symbiont genomes. Our collaborators from the University of Greifswald (Ruby Ponnudurai, Stephanie Markert, Thomas Schweder) are currently finishing a manuscript which will provide a much more detailed overview of the symbiont metabolism based on proteogenomic analyses. To provide more genomic context for the toxin-related genes in our manuscript, we included a new description of the key metabolic pathways encoded by the SOX symbiont genomes in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Appendix 2</xref>. This also includes a new figure, which shows a metabolic reconstruction of the major pathways.</p><p><italic>11) “Toxin” genes is the main focus of this paper, but the function of these genes is not known, and the genes were identified based only on their sequence annotation as “toxin” or “virulence” genes, falling into three classes based in part on shared motifs. The sequences are so divergent they cannot be confidently aligned except for a few of the YD class (in the subsection “Relationships to other toxins”). The authors go to great lengths and sophisticated analyses to ID them as “toxin” genes including constructing gene similarity networks with clusters containing genes with &gt;25% similarity over at least half of the gene length. They compare the mussel symbiont toxin genes with those of other bacteria, examining “host-associated”, free-living”, etc. relationships with interesting correlations. Transcriptome analyses show they are all expressed, with some also via proteomics.</italic></p><p><italic>These analyses are quite interesting, and certainly challenge common thinking about mutualistic vs. parasitic associations and the roles of bacterial proteins and their role in disease. However, the functions of these “toxin” genes are not known, and the slant of the paper, including the title “toxin” and “arsenal” is almost entirely regarding the gene products as toxins.</italic></p><p>Throughout the paper, we now use the correct and more conservative term ‘toxin-related’, which reflects their similarity to characterized toxins, but allows for the fact that their function in this symbiosis is so far unknown. We also made the title more neutral by changing it to “Abundant toxin-related genes in the genomes of beneficial symbionts from deep-sea hydrothermal vent mussels”.</p><p><italic>“Toxin” genes are also detected in bacteria other than pathogens, also with unknown functions for the most part. The extensive discussion on the possible roles of these genes, necessitated given the lack of known function, is totally speculative and would benefit from a shorter and more focused treatment.</italic></p><p>We have shortened the Discussion significantly. The revised version is more focused, and we have removed repetition and redundancy.</p><p><italic>For example, the authors speculate both that the bacteria have “tamed” the toxin genes to use in a mutualistic symbiosis and later that they may have been ancestral and their original function was mutualistic. Or that the toxin genes may function to protect the host against eukaryotic parasites.</italic></p><p><italic>On a semantic note, in efforts to promote studies of beneficial microbe/animal associations as informing parasitic or pathogenic associations, Margaret McFall-Ngai has suggested that terms like “virulence” and other disease related terminology be changed to more neutral terms, which I heartily endorse. The use of “toxin” or “pathogen” is disease-centric (and therefore mostly human-centric). To a bacterium, they have evolved mechanisms to obtain food (e.g., toxins to break open cells). If possible, use of a “symbiosis” term will be very helpful for presenting a balanced view of the possible functions of the “toxin” genes.</italic></p><p>We completely agree with the opinions of the reviewers and Margaret McFall-Ngai. In our manuscript, we chose to use the term ‘toxin-related’ to refer to these ‘symbiosis genes’. We think it is important that the term ‘toxin’ is used. Firstly, similar genes have proven functions as toxins. Secondly, the term ‘symbiosis genes’ may not yet be widely understood by researchers working on pathogenesis, and ideally we would like to get this message across to this field as well. The final paragraph of the Conclusions focuses on exactly this issue.</p><p><italic>Further, though “toxin-related” is used in the title, the paper quickly refers to these genes and their putative products as “toxins”, which, in the absence of function, is not correct.</italic></p><p>We agree and now call these genes “toxin-related” consistently throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>12) Some larger patterns are suggested, e.g. that these genes are generally enriched in genomes of host associated bacteria. However, in the subsection “Are some of the toxins used for protection against eukaryotic parasites” and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>, the analysis is not very meaningful because there is a phylogenetic component that is not taken into account. In other words, the clustering may reflect similarities of related species more than a repeated evolutionary pattern. This issue should be considered – can you show that there is a pattern independent of phylogeny?</italic></p><p>That is an excellent point. The first indication that phylogeny is not the main driver came from our observation that the toxins were distributed among very distantly related taxonomic groups. We have now done a more detailed analysis testing for enrichment of toxins depending on taxonomic classification at the order, class and family levels. YD repeats and MARTX were not enriched at any of these levels, but we did find that RTX genes were enriched at the order level.</p><p>Similar analyses showed a significant enrichment of YD genes in intracellular bacteria and MARTX in host-associated, but not of RTX. We therefore conclude that lifestyle rather than phylogeny is the main factor driving the distribution of these genes. We added the following text in the Results:</p><p>“Bacteria that are closely related often have similar genomic and physiological features. […] Therefore, phylogeny is not the main driver in the toxin distribution of YD repeats genes and MARTX.”</p><p>While doing this new analysis, we realized that there was some redundancy in the data used for our first Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests. We redid this analysis after removing some species that were represented twice in the dataset. This resulted in slightly different P values, however, the overall results stayed the same, and those categories that were significant in our first analysis are still significant.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>[…] Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>I am tremendously impressed with the authors' attention to the issues raised during review of the previously submitted manuscript, their changes to the manuscript, and their thoughtful responses. Virtually all of my earlier concerns have been addressed, but those which I feel still require attention are as follows:</italic></p><p><italic>1) I still find the term “toxin-related” to carry too heavy a connotation of the former. And as noted, we are trying to get “pathogen neutral” language used for host-microbe associations. What about using “toxin-related” but then abbreviate “T-R” and use that throughout. That way you have defined it, but the letters don't impress as negative.</italic></p><p><italic>Other toxins to fix:</italic></p><p><italic>a) “Array of toxins,” “these toxins” (Abstract).</italic></p><p><italic>b) “RTX toxins” (in the subsection “Gene-based comparison reveals toxin-related genes specific to</italic> Bathymodiolus <italic>symbionts”).</italic></p><p><italic>c) “[…] of toxin gene” (in the subsection heading “Statistical analyses of toxin gene content in microbial genomes”) – if it is shown in each case that it is a toxin, then the term is okay to use, otherwise, use “toxin and T-R genes[…]”.</italic></p><p><italic>d) “Toxin genes of the mussel” (in the subsection “Statistical analyses of toxin gene content in microbial genomes”).</italic></p><p>Thanks for your suggestions. We are on the same page about using neutral terms. The term ‘Symbiosis genes’ would be preferable, but without experimental evidence to support the role of these genes in the symbiosis, we prefer the more cautious term ‘toxin-related genes’. We now use the abbreviation TRG for toxin-related gene throughout the manuscript. We also changed all of the above listed to TRGs. Thank you for pointing out the few occasions where the term ‘toxin gene’ slipped through after our first round of revisions.</p><p><italic>2) Have the “toxin genes” been characterized as real toxins for organisms named? Including action, cyano, and firmicute? Clarify for any uncharacterized as “toxin-related.”</italic></p><p>We modified the text as follows:</p><p>“TRGs from the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts clustered together with toxins and TRGs from phylogenetically diverse organisms including characterized toxins of gammaproteobacterial <italic>Vibrio</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, and TRGs of the gammaproteobacteria <italic>Shewanella</italic>, the actinobacterial <italic>Rhodococcus,</italic> the cyanobacterium <italic>Trichodesmium</italic>, and the firmicute <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor.”</italic></p><p><italic>3) You refer to “massive genome rearrangements” (Abstract and text), but this is only relative to the related symbionts and SUP05. And in the subsection “General genome comparison,” couldn't these have been the ancestor and the others have undergone rearrangement? I suggest changing to more benign “extremely different” or “lack synteny” or other such descriptor.</italic></p><p>We think that the SOX symbiont genomes is under constant genome reshuffling based on the following evidence: 1) The SOX <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbiont has a higher abundance of mobile elements compared to their close relatives, 2) Mobile elements are among the top 50 most expressed genes 3) Comparison of the two SOX symbionts of <italic>B. azoricus</italic> show genome rearrangements even between these two closely-related symbionts. These observations suggest that genome reshuffling is a significant and undergoing process in the SOX symbiont genomes. Nevertheless, we toned down the terms in the text as follows:</p><p>“Comparison of these symbiont genomes with those of their closest relatives revealed that the symbionts have undergone genome rearrangements, and up to 35% of their genes may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer.” (Abstract)</p><p>“BspSym, the genome that assembled into the fewest contigs, lacked synteny compared to SUP05 and the clam symbionts, as shown by whole-genome alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–Figure supplement 2</xref>). […] These regions without genome synteny therefore most likely represent true genome reshuffling in <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> symbionts.” (Subsection “General genome comparison”)</p><p>“The lack of synteny we observed in the symbiont genomes is consistent with the presence of mobile elements and major HGT events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achaz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kobayashi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Rocha and Danchin, 2002</xref>).” (Subsection “Origin of TRGs in Bathymodiolus symbionts”)</p><p>Subsection heading: “PCR amplification of regions with lack of synteny”.</p><p>“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>. Whole genome alignment. Each colored block is a region of the genome that aligned to part of another genome because it is homologous and the genes are arranged in the same order.” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> legend)</p><p><italic>4) Molecular mechanisms are extremely well described for Rhizobia. Clarify in sentence “animalhost microbe” (Introduction) or add in Rhizobia/legumes.</italic></p><p>We modified the text according to your suggestion:</p><p>“Although the mechanisms of host cell entry and immune evasion have been extensively studied in pathogens and plant-microbe associations such as the Rhizobia-legume symbiosis, far less is known about the mechanisms beneficial symbionts use to enter and survive within animal host cells.”</p><p><italic>5) In the subsection “Are some of the toxin-related genes used for direct beneficial interactions between hosts and symbionts?” has it been shown that RTX proteins form pores in vacuolar members in any bacteria? Have any intracellular bacteria been shown to do such? If so, cite real examples. If not, this is a serious stretch and I favor removing. I searched the manuscript and there is very little on function of RTX.</italic></p><p>We removed this section.</p><p><italic>6) I found the second paragraph of the subsection “Are some of the toxin-related genes used for protection against eukaryotic parasites?” quite interesting. As you have the MOX sequence(s), do they have the T-R genes?</italic></p><p>This is indeed an interesting question. The MOX symbiont genomes do not have the toxin-related genes of the SOX symbiont. We added the following text:</p><p>“If many of the TRGs encoded by the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbiont are being used to defend its host against parasites, as is hypothesized for <italic>Ca</italic>. H. defensa, then this could help to explain why <italic>B. childressi</italic> is so heavily infected by trematodes. The methane-oxidizing symbionts of <italic>B. azoricus</italic> and <italic>B. childressi</italic> do not encode TRGs (Antony CP, personal communication, May 2015).”</p><p><italic>7) State in main text that the genomes are being described elsewhere. Otherwise I still have the same reaction – why write about just toxin genes??</italic></p><p>We added the following text in the Results section:</p><p>“The core metabolic potential of the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> SOX symbionts is described in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref> – Symbiont Metabolism. A detailed description of the genomes is beyond the scope of this paper and will be published elsewhere”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
