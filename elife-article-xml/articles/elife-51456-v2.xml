Here, we describe a morphogenetic movement in which the intertwined socket and shaft cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> anterior wing margin mechanosensory bristles undergo PCP-directed apical rotation, inducing twisting that results in a helical structure of defined chirality. We show that the Frizzled/Vang PCP signaling module coordinates polarity among and between bristles and surrounding cells to direct this rotation. Furthermore, we show that dynamic interplay between two isoforms of the Prickle protein determines right- or left-handed bristle morphogenesis. We provide evidence that, Frizzled/Vang signaling couples to the Fat/Dachsous PCP directional signal in opposite directions depending on whether Pk<sup>pk</sup> or Pk<sup>sple</sup> predominates. Dynamic interplay between Pk isoforms is likely to be an important determinant of PCP outcomes in diverse contexts. Similar mechanisms may orient other lateralizing morphogenetic processes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our right and left hands are mirror images of each other and cannot be precisely superimposed. This property, known as chirality, is vital for many tissues and organs to form correctly in humans and other animals.

In flies, PCP signaling controls the orientation of trichomes (hairs) on the adult cuticle, orientation of ommatidia in the eye, and orientation of cell divisions, though the full range of phenotypic outputs has not been explored. While much focus has been placed on mechanistic studies in flies, medically important developmental defects and physiological processes in vertebrates are also under control of PCP signaling, motivating mechanistic studies in flies that might inform similar studies in vertebrates. Defects in the core PCP mechanism result in open neural tube defects, conotruncal heart defects, deafness, situs inversus and heterotaxy (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henderson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum and Ott, 2018</xref>). PCP is also believed to participate in both early and late stages of cancer progression and in wound healing. PCP polarizes skin and hair, the ependyma and renal tubules. Paralogs of the PCP component Prickle are mutated in an epilepsy-ataxia syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassuk et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehaideb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paemka et al., 2015</xref>). Mutations in ‘global’ PCP components have been associated with a human disorder of neuronal migration and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zakaria et al., 2014</xref>) and in developmental renal disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indicates that at least two molecular modules contribute to PCP signaling. The core module acts both to amplify molecular asymmetry, and to coordinate polarization between neighboring cells, producing a local alignment of polarity. Proteins in the core module, including the serpentine protein Frizzled (Fz), the seven-pass atypical cadherin Flamingo (Fmi; a.k.a. Starry night), the 4-pass protein Van Gogh (Vang; a.k.a. Strabismus), and the cytosolic/peripheral membrane proteins Dishevelled (Dsh), Diego (Dgo), and the PET/Lim domain protein Prickle (Pk) adopt asymmetric subcellular localizations that predict the morphological polarity pattern such as hairs in the fly wing (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zallen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>). These proteins communicate at cell boundaries, recruiting one group to the distal side of cells, and the other to the proximal side, through the function of an incompletely understood feedback mechanism, thereby aligning the polarity of adjacent cells. A global module serves to provide directional information to the core module by converting tissue level expression gradients to asymmetric subcellular Fat (Ft) - Dachsous (Ds) heterodimer localization (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matis and Axelrod, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zallen, 2007</xref>). The atypical cadherins Ft and Ds form heterodimers which may orient in either of two directions at cell-cell junctions. The Golgi resident protein Four-jointed (Fj) acts on both Ft and Ds as an ectokinase to make Ft a stronger ligand, and Ds a weaker ligand, for the other. Graded Fj and Ds expression therefore result in the conversion of transcriptional gradients to subcellular gradients, producing a larger fraction of Ft-Ds heterodimers in one orientation relative to the other. Other less well defined sources of global directional information appear to act in partially overlapping, tissue dependent ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharp and Axelrod, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Various <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues depend primarily on either of two isoforms of Pk, Prickle<sup>prickle</sup> (Pk<sup>pk</sup>) and Prickle<sup>spiny-legs</sup> (Pk<sup>sple</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gubb et al., 1999</xref>). These isoforms have been proposed to determine the direction in which core PCP signaling responds to directional information provided by the Ft/Ds/Fj system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olofsson and Axelrod, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hogan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambegaonkar and Irvine, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayukawa et al., 2014</xref>). Pk<sup>sple</sup> binds directly to Ds, orienting Pk<sup>sple</sup>-dependent core signaling with respect to the Ds and Fj gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayukawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambegaonkar and Irvine, 2015</xref>), while Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent core signaling has been proposed to couple less directly through a mechanism in which the Ft/Ds/Fj module directs the polarity of an apical microtubule cytoskeleton on which vesicles containing core proteins Fz, Dsh and Fmi undergo directionally biased trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olofsson and Axelrod, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shimada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harumoto et al., 2010</xref>). Others, however, have argued that Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent core signaling is instead uncoupled from the Ft/Ds/Fj signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambegaonkar and Irvine, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawrence et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The most intensively studied morphogenetic responses to PCP signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> occur in epithelia such as wing and abdomen, in which cellular projections called trichomes (hairs) grow in a polarized fashion from the apical surface, and in ommatidia of the eye, in which photoreceptor clusters achieve chirality via directional cell fate signaling. Chaete (bristles), which serve as sensory organs, are also polarized by PCP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schweisguth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gubb and García-Bellido, 1982</xref>). Bristles comprise the 4–5 progeny of a sensory mother cell (SMC), one of which, the shaft, extends a process above the epithelium such that it tilts in a defined direction with respect to the tissue. In mechanosensory microchaete on the notum, one daughter of the SMC divides to produce the shaft and a socket cell that surrounds the shaft where it emerges from the epithelial surface; the other SOP daughter divides to produce a glial cell, a sheath cell and a neuron. Studies of microchaete polarity have shown that the initial division of the SMC is polarized by PCP in the epithelium from which it derives, such that the two daughters are born in defined positions with respect to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gho and Schweisguth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellaïche et al., 2001</xref>). However, subsequent events that ultimately determine the direction of shaft polarity have not been described.</p><p>We chose to study bristle polarity on the anterior margin of the wing (AWM). A row of stout mechanosensory bristles and a row of curved chemosensory bristles are on the dorsal surface, and a mixed row of mechano and chemosensory bristles is on the ventral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). All of these bristles tilt toward the distal end of the wing in wildtype. In <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutant wings, and in wings overexpressing Pk<sup>sple</sup>, a large fraction of the AWM bristles point proximally rather than distally; the <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> phenotype is suppressed by mutation of <italic>dsh</italic>, implicating the core PCP signaling mechanism in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gubb et al., 1999</xref>). However, the morphogenetic process resulting in polarity and the genetics of its apparent control by PCP signaling have not been explored. Here, focusing on the dorsal mechanosensory bristles, we report our analysis of the underlying morphogenesis leading to AWM bristle polarization, and show that polarization results from a corkscrew-like helical morphogenetic process involving the shaft and socket cells. Furthermore, our results reveal how interplay between Pk<sup>pk</sup> and Pk<sup>sple</sup> control the handedness of the helical growth, and how the Ft/Ds/Fj system directs it in opposite orientations depending on whether the core PCP mechanism operates in a Pk<sup>pk</sup>- or Pk<sup>sple</sup>-dependent mode.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Morphology of wildtype dorsal mechanosensory bristles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dorsal and ventral views showing adult dorsal mechanosensory bristles (red arrowheads), ventral chemo- and mechanosensory bristles (blue arrowhead) and dorsal chemosensory bristles (black arrowhead).

In wildtype control wings at 36 hr apf, the apical ends of socket cells are tilted toward the distal end of the wing and are interspersed with the actin bundles of the shafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,C’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–B’’</xref>).

Consistent with polarity patterns of adult bristles, actin bundles of <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutant shafts near the distal end of the wing show a reversed, proximal, tilt, whereas shafts in the proximal and the very most distal regions show the normal distal tilt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,A’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–C’’</xref>).

To better understand the structures of shaft-socket pairs, and to unambiguously determine the relationship between sibling shaft-socket cell pairs, random individual bristle lineages were labeled by clonal expression of RFP, filling the cell bodies of labeled shaft and socket cells. Simultaneous staining of the socket cells (identified by Su(H) expression) allows one to identify the sibling shaft-socket cell pairs. 3D confocal reconstructions facilitate examination from a variety of viewpoints and enable the positions and shapes of cell bodies, nuclei, shaft, and apical opening of the socket cells to be visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–B’’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). These views allow us to see that the wildtype nucleus and main portion of the shaft cell is dorsal and extends slightly posterior to that of the sibling socket cell. The base of the shaft rises from the cell body, wraps clockwise along its socket sibling (as viewed from the apical side in a right wing), and then rises through a groove in the socket that extends apically along the proximal side of the socket, finally emerging through the donut shaped apical surface of the socket cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–D’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). In contrast, in the distal bristles of <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutant wings where bristles are reversed, the shaft is positioned within an oppositely oriented groove on the distal side of the sibling socket cell. The shaft nucleus is dorsal and posterior to the socket nucleus, similar to their arrangement in wildtype, though their alignment is not as regular. Therefore, the structure of <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutant bristles is roughly a mirror image of that in wildtype, with nuclei in similar positions, but the shaft bending in a counterclockwise direction and rising through a groove on the opposite side of the socket cell compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–B’’</xref>). In the proximal region of the <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutant wing, the relationship of shaft-socket siblings resembles that in wildtype, reflecting the normal bristle polarity in that region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–C’’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, the P or D position of shaft relative to the sibling socket cell correlates to the normal or reversed bristle polarity in proximal and distal regions of <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutants, suggesting that the shaft position relative to the socket determines bristle polarity (tilt).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Helical growth of the shaft-socket pair positions the shaft relative to the socket</title><p>Since the relative position of the shaft to the socket appears to be important for bristle polarity, we wished to identify the developmental process by which this relationship is achieved. In microchaete of the notum, the orientation of the initial division of the sensory organ precursor cell is specified by PCP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schweisguth, 2015</xref>). Assuming the orientations of subsequent daughter cell divisions are similarly regulated, the shaft-socket relationship may be determined by their relative positions at their birth. A similar process might occur in AWM mechanosensory bristles. Alternatively, a post-division morphogenetic process may determine their final configurations.</p><p>To examine this process, we analyzed 3D structures of shaft-socket sibling pairs at earlier developmental stages. In wildtype bristles at 24 hr apf, the shaft cell nucleus is posterior and just slightly dorsal to the socket cell nucleus, similar to their positions at 36 hr apf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). The extending shaft is just reaching the apical surface, and is positioned in a groove on the dorsal side of the socket cell. At the apical surface, the shaft, sits in a shallow indentation in the apical surface of the socket cell, which adopts a crescent shape with the opening of the crescent pointing in the dorsal direction. Over time, from 28 to 32 to 36 hr apf, as the shaft continues to extend above the apical surface, the socket cell crescent rotates clockwise, and gradually closes to form a ring around the shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">3</xref>). Because the apical surface rotates while the nuclei remain relatively stationary, the shaft and socket twist to form a left-handed helical shape. As the shaft grows out above the socket cell, it points distally. The cell bodies, are initially relatively flat in the dorsal-ventral direction, but as they grow, extend dorsally, becoming flatter in the anterior-posterior direction. Quantification of rotation was performed by measuring rotation angles, as diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, from 3D images of socket cells captured at different time points (c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and data are displayed in rose plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

Early in wing development, Pk<sup>pk</sup> protein is strongly expressed and is present in most or all cells. In discs, Pk<sup>pk</sup> is relatively elevated in AWM proneural cells. Following a slight dip in levels around 8 hr apf, expression levels climb, peaking around 32 hr apf, when wing hairs emerge, and then decline with little detectable expression remaining by 40 hr apf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–A’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–H,K–K’’</xref>).

Beginning around 28 hr apf, Pk<sup>sple</sup> expression is specifically detected in dorsal AWM cells and in vein L3. This expression persists through 32 hr apf, when wing hairs emerge, and weaker expression in other veins becomes apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–B”</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,L,L’</xref>).

At 40 hr apf, when Pk<sup>sple</sup> is at peak expression in most of the wing blade, expression has disappeared from vein cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,L–L”</xref>).</p><p>Most pertinent to bristle development, at the 24 hr apf AWM, Pk<sup>pk</sup> is expressed at apical junctions at similar levels in anterior margin and socket cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,C’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

At the same time, Pk<sup>sple</sup> expression becomes evident and increases over time, first uniformly in cells near the margin, and gradually becoming strongest in the socket and shaft cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,D’,F–F’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>, compare with Pk<sup>pk</sup> (V5::Pk) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The timing of the shift from Pk<sup>pk</sup> to Pk<sup>sple</sup> expression is accelerated at the margin relative to the interior of the wing. Mosaic experiments demonstrate that Pk<sup>pk</sup> localizes proximally in socket and other margin cells, and that, importantly, Pk<sup>sple</sup> colocalizes with Pk<sup>pk</sup> to the proximal side of socket cells. Proximal Pk<sup>sple</sup> localization is an unexpected observation based on previous studies in which overexpressed Pk<sup>sple</sup> localized at the distal junctions of hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayukawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambegaonkar and Irvine, 2015</xref>).

Therefore, the reversed, Pk<sup>sple</sup>-dependent polarity in <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutants requires Ds, and we interpret this to indicate that the Ds global signal recruits Pk<sup>sple</sup> to sites of enriched Ds (distal) in the absence of Pk<sup>pk</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; compare with 7D), which drives reversal of shaft-socket orientation and therefore reversal of bristle polarity.</p><p>In <italic>ds</italic> knockdowns, we are unable to readily interpret the localization pattern of V5::Pk because levels are similar in socket and margin cells. Nonetheless, other results suggest that the local polarity correlation in the absence of Ds is mediated primarily by asymmetric localization of Pk<sup>pk</sup> rather than the asymmetric localization of Pk<sup>sple</sup> that we can observe. First, recall that in wildtype, Pk<sup>sple</sup> is recruited to colocalize with Pk<sup>pk</sup> at proximal sites, so Pk<sup>pk</sup> is likely to similarly recruit the colocalization of Pk<sup>sple</sup> in the absence of Ds. Consistent with this idea, when <italic>ds</italic> was knocked down in <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutants, neither proximal nor distal localization of Pk<sup>sple</sup> was observed in socket cells, and local correlation of bristle polarity was weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, the local domains of correlated asymmetric Pk<sup>sple</sup> localization in <italic>ds</italic> knock-down socket cells depend on the presence of Pk<sup>pk</sup>; Pk<sup>sple</sup> alone is insufficient to facilitate local signaling between neighbors. Finally, removing Pk<sup>sple</sup> in <italic>ds</italic> knock-down wings failed to significantly modify <italic>ds</italic> knock-down effects on the polarity of bristles (and also hairs) while removing both Pk<sup>pk</sup> and Pk<sup>sple</sup> does (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), confirming that <italic>ds</italic> knock-down affects the Pk<sup>pk</sup>-mediated, rather than the Pk<sup>sple</sup>-mediated, PCP signal for wing bristle (and hair) polarity. Taken together, these observations suggest that the locally correlated domains of polarity observed in <italic>ds</italic> knock-down wings depend on Pk<sup>pk</sup> activity.</p><p>These and previous results indicate that Pk<sup>pk</sup> is the principal isoform functioning in core PCP signaling during bristle polarization. They are most consistent with, though do not definitively show, that in wildtype, the Ds global signal directs orientation of core signaling such that Vang and Pk<sup>pk</sup> localize to the proximal side (and incidentally colocalizing Pk<sup>sple</sup> to the proximal side) to establish normal polarity. The alternative possibility is that Ds activity is permissive, and some other signal directs this orientation of Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent core polarization. The proposal that Ds is instructive for orienting Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent core signaling, while consistent with our prior interpretation of coupling between the Ft/Ds/Fj signal and Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent core PCP signaling in wing hair polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olofsson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharp and Axelrod, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2002</xref>), is at odds with other reports asserting that while under Pk<sup>pk</sup> control, core PCP directionality is uncoupled from the Ft/Ds/Fj signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambegaonkar and Irvine, 2015</xref>). Rigorous testing of this hypothesis requires reorienting the Ft/Ds/Fj signal and assessing the isoform dependence of the response.</p><p>It was previously shown that reversing the gradient of Ds expression near the distal part of the wing under control of <italic>distal-less-GAL4</italic> (<italic>dll &gt;2</italic> x-ds) reverses wing hair polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harumoto et al., 2010</xref>). Assuming that hair polarity is determined by Pk<sup>pk</sup>, for which ample evidence exists, and that it depends on core signaling, this result would demonstrate coupling of Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent core PCP signaling to the Ds signal. We rigorously tested this assumption by testing the core signaling and Pk isoform dependence of this response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–K</xref>). <italic>dll &gt;2</italic> x-ds reverses polarity of a substantial swath of wing hairs, precisely in the region where the Dll expression gradient is expected to be steepest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). <italic>dll &gt;2 x-ds,</italic> however does not reverse AWM bristle polarity, as it does not produce a proximal-to-distal expression gradient at the AWM. Because our results show that AWM bristle and wing hair polarization show indistinguishable responses to Ft/Ds and to core PCP manipulations, we propose that wing hairs are a suitable readout for this assay. We first asked whether <italic>dll &gt;2 x-d</italic>s-driven hair polarity reversal depends on core module activity by removing Fz, and found that ectopic Ds-dependent reversal is blocked in a <italic>fz</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>). Furthermore, ectopic Ds re-orients the core PCP protein orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>). These results rule out the possibility that ectopic Ds reverses polarity through a pathway that does not include the core PCP module. We then tested the Pk isoform dependence of reversal, and found that it is almost entirely abolished upon removal of Pk<sup>pk</sup> (<italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> or <italic>pk<sup>pk-sple</sup>)</italic>, but is largely unchanged upon removal of Pk<sup>sple</sup> (<italic>pk<sup>sple</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,I–K</xref>). This result decisively demonstrates that Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent core PCP signaling in wing hair polarization is oriented by the Ft/Ds/Fj signal, and strongly suggests that the same coupling occurs during Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent AWM bristle polarization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Direction of helical morphogenesis determines bristle polarity</title><p>Producing structures of defined chirality requires directional information on three Cartesian axes. Our results indicate that in determining bristle chirality, PCP provides directional information along the proximal-distal axis. The apical-basal axis is defined by the epithelium, while the dorsal-ventral axis is likely defined by the dorsal-ventral compartment boundary.</p><p>We have shown that the polarity of wing margin bristles (proximal or distal tilt) is determined by controlling the handedness of helical growth. The entwined shaft and socket cells undergo an apical clockwise or counterclockwise rotation that results in a left-handed or right-handed helical structure, placing the shaft to the proximal (wildtype) or distal (<italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutant) side of the socket cell. The direction of rotation depends on PCP signaling among and between margin and socket cells. Helical cellular structures of defined handedness, such as the bristles resulting from properly directed rotation, have been noted in bacterial and plant species, but few examples have been described in animals.</p><p>The entwined twisting of the shaft and socket is a coordinated morphogenetic event, and the apparent stereotyped junctional rearrangement of additional margin cells suggests that at least some other cells are involved as well. We do not know in which cell or cells mechanics are regulated to drive this morphogenesis. One possibility is that an internal cytoskeletal mechanism induces the helical growth of the socket and/or shaft cells. Another possibility is that the side of the socket cell crescent marked by Pk at 24 hr is anchored, while the other side grows to wrap around the shaft, inducing junctional rearrangements and propelling the rotation of the apical portion of the shaft relative to the socket cell. Apical rotation could then cause twisting of the more basal portions of the socket cell, and could in turn direct the shaft to the corresponding side of the socket cell.</p><p>The precise location at which the PCP signal is required to determine rotation direction is unclear. Because we observe asymmetric core complexes at margin-socket cell junctions, but very little at shaft-margin or shaft-socket junctions, we hypothesize that interaction between the socket and surrounding margin cells is the essential determinant of rotation. PCP proteins at these junctions could control junctional dynamics, as is known to occur in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huebner and Wallingford, 2018</xref>). This will require further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of core PCP signaling in socket-shaft rotation</title><p>Core PCP signaling participates in regulating rotation, as the magnitude of rotation is substantially impaired in the core mutants <italic>fz</italic>, <italic>dsh</italic>, <italic>vang</italic> and <italic>fmi</italic>. Nonetheless, we note that a small amount of clockwise rotation still occurs in these mutants. We hypothesize that tissue scale mechanical forces may drive this rotation, though we do not rule out the possibility that some other signaling activity may also be involved. Compared to other core proteins, the impact of removing Pk<sup>pk</sup> on the magnitude of rotation is subtle. The clockwise rotation in <italic>pk<sup>pk-sple</sup></italic> mutants is only slightly less than in wildtype. This result is reminiscent of Pk<sup>pk</sup> function in polarizing wing hairs: polarity in <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutants is strongly perturbed due to the presence of Pk<sup>sple</sup>, while hair polarity in <italic>pk<sup>pk-sple</sup></italic> mutants is only weakly perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gubb et al., 1999</xref>). These findings are consistent with previous proposals that the core PCP mechanism retains a residual capacity to propagate some asymmetry in the absence of Pk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Strutt and Strutt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lawrence et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The core PCP signal, in addition to executing directed rotation in response to Pk<sup>pk</sup> or Pk<sup>sple</sup>, coordinates polarity between neighboring bristles. Local correlation between rotation angles is strong when core signaling is intact, even in the absence of the Ft/Ds signal, but is weak when core signaling is disrupted. This is analogous to the proposed mechanism for locally coordinating polarity between adjacent wing hairs. It is important to note that the local polarity signal must pass through intervening margin cells to signal from bristle to bristle.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Spatiotemporal dynamics and selection of Pk<sup>pk</sup> versus Pk<sup>sple</sup> for polarity determination</title><p>Our data suggest that whether the Pk<sup>pk</sup> or Pk<sup>sple</sup> isoform dominates to control the direction of PCP signaling depends not only on the relative amounts of each isoform, but also on the dynamics of expression and its effect on competition for participation in the core complex. During rotation of AWM bristle shaft-socket pairs, both Pk<sup>pk</sup> and Pk<sup>sple</sup> isoforms are detected at the apical junction of the socket with an inverse temporal relationship; high expression of Pk<sup>pk</sup> decreases during rotation, while the initially undetectable level of Pk<sup>sple</sup> protein increases. In these conditions, the system is controlled by Pk<sup>pk</sup>, and both Pk<sup>pk</sup> and Pk<sup>sple</sup> localize proximally, thus orienting the core complex in its wildtype configuration. We hypothesize that Pk<sup>sple</sup> is recruited by Pk<sup>pk</sup> through their known ability to interact heterotypically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayukawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambegaonkar and Irvine, 2015</xref>). This ability of Pk<sup>pk</sup> and Pk<sup>sple</sup> to colocalize has not been previously observed in wildtype conditions. Notably, however, in the wing, ectopic Pk<sup>sple</sup> localization follows the expected position of Pk<sup>pk</sup> when Ds and Dachs cues are removed, though each were not independently visualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambegaonkar and Irvine, 2015</xref>). Conversely, Pk<sup>sple</sup> overexpression was seen to recruit Pk<sup>pk</sup> to the distal side of wing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayukawa et al., 2014</xref>), reversing hair polarity as it does bristle polarity. We suggest that the temporal expression pattern in the AWM allows the system to initiate polarization under Pk<sup>pk</sup> control, and that the gradually accumulating Pk<sup>sple</sup> colocalizes with Pk<sup>pk</sup> rather than outcompeting established proximal localization. Because bristles in <italic>pk<sup>sple</sup></italic> mutant wings fully polarize, the proximal Pk<sup>sple</sup> is inconsequential for normal bristle polarization.</p><p>In contrast, overexpression of Pk<sup>sple</sup>, producing early and sustained high level expression, enables it to outcompete endogenous Pk<sup>pk</sup> and reverse polarity by driving localization to the distal side through its interaction with Ds and Dachs, likely recruiting Pk<sup>pk</sup> along with it. Similarly, in <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutants, endogenous Pk<sup>sple</sup>, free from recruitment to the proximal side, localizes distally and reverses polarity. We infer that during the critical period for determining bristle rotation direction in wildtype, Pk<sup>sple</sup> does not reach a sufficient level to outcompete Pk<sup>pk</sup> and reverse the rotation.</p><p>That <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutation only reverses polarity of a region of distal bristles, whereas Pk<sup>sple</sup> overexpression can reverse polarity of most or all AWM bristles, indicates that endogenous Pk<sup>sple</sup> is only poised to act in a limited region of the margin. This may reflect subtle differences in the timing of its expression increase across the margin. Alternatively, it may reflect differences in the strength of the Ft/Ds/Fj signal across the margin. Our analyses do not have sufficient resolution to distinguish these possibilities.</p><p>Dynamic isoform expression appears to have important consequences for other aspects of wing development. Hair polarity is determined by Pk<sup>pk</sup> (at around 32 hr apf), but it can be inferred that some Pk<sup>sple</sup> is already present, as is evident from the difference between the hair polarity patterns of <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> and <italic>pk<sup>pk-sple</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gubb et al., 1999</xref>), and as confirmed by our expression analyses. We suggest that hair polarity does not fully reverse in <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutants either because levels of Pk<sup>sple</sup> are not yet high enough or because expression is primarily in veins and at the AWM at the time hair polarity is fixed. In contrast, the polarity of ridges, established later in wing development [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merkel et al., 2014</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>) notwithstanding], depends on Pk<sup>sple</sup>. We propose that by the time ridge polarity is determined, the amount of Pk<sup>sple</sup> has increased and the amount of Pk<sup>pk</sup> has decreased sufficiently to allow Pk<sup>sple</sup> to exert control of ridge polarization. Though likely unimportant for normal development, the somewhat earlier expression of Pk<sup>sple</sup> in veins relative to the intervein regions may contribute to polarity discontinuities observed in <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> mutant wings, especially around L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gubb and García-Bellido, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hogan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merkel et al., 2014</xref>). Ft-Ds polarity appears to also be distorted around veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merkel et al., 2014</xref>). Pk<sup>pk</sup> and Pk<sup>sple</sup> expression dynamics are likely at play in determining the PCP response in other tissues as well.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The ft/Ds/Fj global signal orients both Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent and Pk<sup>sple</sup>-dependent core PCP signaling in the wing</title><p>The idea that Ds controls the direction of core PCP signaling was first proposed by Adler based on wing hair polarity phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 1998</xref>). We subsequently studied the Ft/Ds/Fj system and similarly concluded that it directs core PCP protein localization in the wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2003</xref>), a Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent process, and polarization of ommatidia in the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2002</xref>), a Pk<sup>sple</sup>-dependent process. We proposed that coupling in wing hair polarization is necessarily weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2003</xref>), and the more recently proposed model in which Ft/Ds/Fj orient microtubules to orient directional trafficking of Fz, Dsh and Fmi-containing vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olofsson and Axelrod, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shimada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harumoto et al., 2010</xref>) is consistent with a weak coupling mechanism in Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent processes. The finding of direct binding of Pk<sup>sple</sup> to Ds and Dachs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayukawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambegaonkar and Irvine, 2015</xref>) suggests a model for more direct and potentially stronger coupling of Pk<sup>sple</sup>-dependent processes to the Ft/Ds/Fj system. The idea of coupling in Pk-dependent signaling has been controversial, and based largely on correlation, subsequent studies have led to the argument that Pk<sup>sple</sup>-dependent core signaling is coupled, but Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent signaling is uncoupled from the the Ft/Ds/Fj system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambegaonkar and Irvine, 2015</xref>). Yet others have suggested that the Ft/Ds/Fj and core PCP systems always function in parallel rather than being coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawrence et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casal et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we report strong evidence that Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent core PCP signaling is responsive to the Ds signal, at least in polarizing wing hairs. We propose that the same is the case in polarizing bristles that are controlled by essentially similar responses to Pk isoforms and to the Ft/Ds/Fj system.</p><p>In bristles, we directly observe the requirement for Ds to distally localize Pk<sup>sple</sup> when Pk<sup>pk</sup> is absent, confirming Pk<sup>sple</sup> coupling. The evidence that Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent core signaling is coupled to the upstream Ft/Ds/Fj signal is less apparent. In wildtype, correct bristle polarization requires Pk<sup>pk</sup> to prevent reversal by recruiting Pk<sup>sple</sup> to the proximal side, though as noted above, proximal Pk<sup>sple</sup> plays no essential role. But absent the need to antagonize Pk<sup>sple</sup> coupling, is there evidence that core signaling in the presence of just Pk<sup>pk</sup> (<italic>pk<sup>sple</sup></italic> mutant) is coupled to Ft/Ds/Fj? When the Ft/Ds/Fj system is intact, Pk<sup>pk</sup> localizes proximally, but without Ds or Ft, Pk<sup>pk</sup> localizes proximally and distally in random domains, driving domains of correct and reversed rotation analogous to the random but locally correlated domains of hair polarity in <italic>ft</italic> or <italic>ds</italic> mutant wing tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2003</xref>). The same random domains of bristle polarity are seen when only Pk<sup>pk</sup> is available (<italic>ds</italic> knockdown in a <italic>pk<sup>sple</sup></italic> mutant). This result demonstrates that the Ft/Ds/Fj system is required for correct polarization of the core PCP system while solely under Pk<sup>pk</sup> control, though it cannot distinguish a permissive from an instructive role. An instructive role is, however, concordant with its instructive role in directing Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent wing hair polarity.</p><p>The proposal that Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent core signaling is coupled to and responds to the Ft/Ds/Fj signal in bristle polarization might at first appear to conflict with the observation that properly oriented rotation proceeds to a significant extent in the absence of both Pk<sup>pk</sup> and Pk<sup>sple</sup>. This is explained by pointing out that our model for coupling invokes Ft/Ds/Fj directed microtubule-based transport of Fz and Dsh, but that the involvement of Pk<sup>pk</sup> is indirect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olofsson and Axelrod, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shimada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harumoto et al., 2010</xref>). As have others, we propose that Pk<sup>pk</sup> functions to amplify the asymmetry introduced by this transport, but that some asymmetry, and communication of polarity information between cells, can still occur in its absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Strutt and Strutt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lawrence et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2000</xref>). In other words, Ft/Ds/Fj coupling to Pk<sup>pk</sup>-dependent core PCP signaling is not directed by Pk<sup>pk</sup>, but rather, is permitted to occur because the Pk<sup>sple</sup>-dependent mechanism is not operating to override it. Because core module function is required, this activity does not result from Pk isoform action influencing Ft/Ds/Fj output independent of core signaling, as has been recently suggested in another context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casal et al., 2018</xref>). It is important to caution that the model for the relationship between Ft/Ds/Fj and core signaling presented here does not necessarily extend to their relationship in other tissues where their interactions may well be different, and that experiments done in other tissues may not be directly relevant to wing hair and AWM bristles.</p><p>The results presented here indicate that mapping the spatiotemporal dynamics of Pk isoform expression is essential to understanding how various developmental events can be differentially coupled to upstream global directional signals in a given tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>A hypothesis for translating PCP into organ rotation</title><p>Chirality, or left-right laterality, is a key feature of many organs in invertebrates and vertebrates. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, rotation of the gut and of the male genitalia occurs in a defined direction to produce such laterality. In vertebrates, rotation of the gut and heart tube also leads to left-right asymmetry in these organs.

Pupae were removed from their pupal cases and fixed for 60–90 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C. Wings were then dissected and extracted from the cuticle, and were washed two times in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100). After blocking for 1 hr in 5% Bovine serum Albumin in PBST at 4°C, wings were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in the blocking solution. Incubations with secondary antibodies were done for 90 min at room temperature in PBST. Washes in PBST were performed three times after primary and secondary antibody incubation, and incubations in phalloidin (1:200 dilution) in PBST were done for 15 min followed by wash at room temperature before mounting if required. Stained wings were mounted in 15 μl Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Primary antibodies were as follows: goat polyclonal anti-Su(H) (1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz, sc-15183), mouse monoclonal anti-V5 (1:200 dilution, Thermo-fisher, R960-25), guinea pig polyclonal anti-Pk[C] (1:800 dilution, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olofsson et al., 2014</xref>), rat monoclonal anti-dEcad (1:200 dilution, DSHB). Secondary antibodies from Thermo Fisher Scientific were as follows: 488-donkey anti-mouse, 488-goat anti-guinea pig, 546-donkey anti-goat, 633-goat anti-guinea pig, 633-goat anti-rat, 647-donkey anti-mouse. Alexa 635 and Alexa 350 conjugated phalloidin were from Thermo Fisher Scientific.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Imaging and quantification</title><p>Adult wings were dissected and washed with 70% EtOH and mounted in DPX (Sigma) solution. All adult wings were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse E1000M equipped with a Spot Flex camera (Model 15.2 64 MP). All immunofluorescence images were taken with a Leica TCS SP8 AOBS confocal microscope and processed with LAS X (Leica) and Adobe Photoshop. For three dimensional wing margin images, 50 to 100 z-stacks, each with 0.2 μm thickness, were collected and combined using 3D reconstitution software (Leica). Scale bars are not provided for three dimensional images due to errors introduced by perspective, but approximate scale can be inferred from related two- dimensional images. To measure the apical rotation angles of socket cells, a horizontal line linking centers of circles around apical surfaces of socket cells was drawn, and perpendicular lines intersecting the center of each socket cell apex were drawn (black lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Vectors from each socket cell center passing through the center of the apical opening of the socket circles (blue vectors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) were drawn and angles between the vertical lines and the vectors were measured with Image J software. Statistical analysis was performed and rose plots generated using Oriana four software. Comparisons were made using Student’s t-test and p values are reported. Summary statistics are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. For qualitative results such as expression patterns, a minimum of 20 biological replicates from at least two independent experiments were examined and representative images are shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>CRISPR/Cas9 homology directed recombination for tagging V5 sequence to <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> and <italic>pk<sup>sple</sup></italic> genomic locus</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Construction of gRNA containing plasmids</title><p><italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> gRNA1 (5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">ATGGCTCAGGCCCGATCTAG</named-content>-3’) and <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> gRNA2 (5’- <named-content content-type="sequence">GTGGATCAACCCCTGGAAAC</named-content>-3’) were assembled into <italic>pCFD4</italic> plasmid (Addgene, 49411) digested by the BbsI restriction enzyme using Gibson Assembly (NEB) to express two gRNAs under the U6 promoter.

of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing, Cho et al. describe a new mode of planar polarized morphogenesis. The authors show that bristle orientation arises when the two major cell types that comprise each bristle – the socket and shaft cell – rotate with a defined chirality like a corkscrew and become intertwined. Rotation is dependent on the core PCP pathway and, strikingly, the chirality of rotation depends on which of two Prickle isoforms (Pk or Sple) predominates. By investigating how endogenously-tagged Prickle isoforms respond to changes in the Fat/Dachsous PCP module, they suggest that the two Pk isoforms orient the core PCP module relative to the Fat/Dachsous directional input in opposite ways. Thus, this paper defines a new PCP-dependent morphogenetic process and provides further insights into the intriguing interplay between Prickle isoforms in PCP. Readers broadly interested in cell polarity and morphogenesis will benefit from reading these new contributions to the field.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Prickle isoforms determine handedness of helical morphogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Danelle Devenport as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Cho et al. investigate how mechanosensory bristles of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing margin are planar polarized, finding that PCP-dependent rotation of socket and shaft cells, rather than asymmetric positioning of daughter cells, determines bristle orientation. Prickle (Pk) isoform expression appears to determine the chirality of this rotation, and the authors argue that the two Pk isoforms orient the core PCP module relative to the Fat/Dachsous directional input in opposite ways. Overall, the reviewers felt that the documentation of PCP-mediated helical morphogenesis together with further insights into the intriguing interplay between Pk isoforms makes an important contribution to the field. They raised some issues about data presentation, quantification and statistical analysis that should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>The reviewers were also in agreement that the section on Pk<sup>pk</sup> coupling to the Fat/Ds system was weak and detracted from the rest of the manuscript. The simplest solution would be to remove this section from the revised manuscript so it can be elaborated in a separate study. However, in case the authors do want to address the issues with this section, those comments can be found at the end and separated from the rest of reviewer points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1) Figure 4H-I. Mosaic knockdown of pk by RNAi is used to distinguish which side of the cell junction Pk and Sple isoforms reside. The authors conclude that both isoforms are proximal. This is an important result as it is different from previously published studies overexpressing Sple and should be shown more clearly. It is very difficult to distinguish the boundaries between expressing and non-expressing cells, especially considering that margin cells may contribute to the signal.</p><p>2) Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B. The loading control levels are highly variable making it difficult to interpret how Pk and Sple isoform levels change over time. Perhaps tubulin is not an appropriate loading control if it levels too change over time. Can the authors plot Pk and Sple levels relative to Tub loading control? Or use V5 fluorescent intensities from confocal images to compare levels?</p><p>3) Figure 4. The authors conclude from the localization of Pk and Sple isoforms &quot;that distal localization of Pk<sup>sple</sup> in Pk<sup>pk</sup> mutants drives counter-clockwise rotation of shaft-socket pairs.&quot; In addition, the title of this section is &quot;Localization of Pk<sup>pk</sup> and/or Pk<sup>sple</sup> determines handedness of helical rotation&quot;. I think these are overstated conclusions. The localization certainly correlates with the direction of rotation, but this seems insufficient to conclude this drives rotation, especially since elimination of both isoforms has very little effect on rotation.</p><p>4) Figure 7D. This experiment shows that reversed Sple localization in Pk<sup>pk</sup> mutants depends on Ds, and &quot;we interpret this to indicate that the Ds global signal recruits Pk<sup>sple</sup> to sites of enriched Ds (distal) in the absence of Pk<sup>pk</sup>&quot;. What about in the proximal part of the wing where bristle polarity is normal? Is Sple localized proximally, and independent of Ds? How do the authors interpret the distally restricted phenotype of Pk<sup>pk</sup> mutants? Is the Ds signal stronger distally?</p><p>5) Coupling between the Fz-Vang and Ft-Ds pathways by Pk isoforms. &quot;we interpret this to indicate that the Ds global signal recruits Pk<sup>sple</sup> to sites of enriched Ds (distal) in the absence of Pk<sup>pk</sup> (Figure 7B; compare with 7D), which drives reversal of shaft-socket orientation and therefore reversal of bristle polarity.&quot; Are Fz and Vang localizations flipped in socket cells with reversed polarity in Pk<sup>pk</sup> mutants?

Hence, I presume PCP specifies clockwise or anticlockwise morphogenesis by specifying polarity in one axis of the plane, in concert with a second polarity cue in the orthogonal axis in the plane (which I take to be an AP oriented cue, ultimately set up by the Hedgehog pathway?). Without this second cue, the PCP cue alone wouldn't be sufficient to specify chirality?</p><p>2) Introduction paragraph three: I think consistent nomenclature for proteins in flies is capitalized Roman so should be &quot;Prickle&quot; and &quot;Spiny-legs&quot; (and probably &quot;Pk<sup>Pk</sup>&quot; and &quot;Pk<sup>Sple</sup>&quot;)?

This is a complex area, but I think it would be easier for readers if the authors stuck to one view. At least based on the data so far, we don't see any evidence that Pk<sup>Pk</sup> couples, only that it enhances core pathway activity?</p><p>6) Paragraph three of subsection “Pk<sup>pk</sup> and Pk<sup>sple</sup> differentially interpret directional signals from Ds”: the authors deduce that in the absence of Pk<sup>Pk</sup>, Pk<sup>Sple</sup> is recruited to distal cell edges by distally localised Ds, but I find this confusing (at least without further clarification) as Merkel et al. seemed to show pretty clearly that – at least in the wing blade – Ds is oriented primarily on the AP axis from 16h APF onwards, and trichomes orient primarily on the AP axis in <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> as well (e.g. Merkel et al. and Gubb et al.). So I would expect Sple to be recruited largely to AP cell edges (maybe with a slight distal bias?) not to distal cell edges. But maybe something happens on the edge of the wing blade to tilt the Ds polarity axis more PD? What do the authors think?</p><p>7) Paragraph four subsection “Pk<sup>pk</sup> and Pk<sup>sple</sup> differentially interpret directional signals from Ds”: this appears to be a key sentence, as here the authors appear to argue that ds knockdown affects a Pk<sup>Pk</sup>-mediated signal for bristle polarity, however I completely failed to follow the logic that indicates Pk<sup>Pk</sup> is providing a polarity cue rather than contributing to polarity magnitude (see paragraph two of subsection “Pk<sup>pk</sup> versus Pk<sup>sple</sup> isoform expression determines the direction of rotation” and Table 3) and suppressing effects of &quot;ectopic&quot; Sple.</p><p>– The key piece of data is (I think) that ds- gives reversals of bristle polarity, and (perhaps surprisingly) these are suppressed by loss of Pk and loss of Pk and Sple, but not by loss of Sple alone. I may be missing something important here, but these results seem to say that having Pk activity causes a disruption in polarity in the absence of Ds, but does nothing to support the view that Pk orients polarity?</p><p>– Having given it some thought, I think the key to understanding these bristle phenotypes is the original observation of Gubb and Garcia-Bellido, 1982 that &quot;Trichomes and chaetae express the same polarity&quot; i.e. the bristles do what the adjacent trichomes do. In ds we know trichomes reverse in the mid-anterior wing margin (Adler et al., 1998) and this seems to be due to altered core PCP in turn produced by disrupted cell flows, oriented cell divisions etc. (Aigouy et al., Merkel et al.) [other explanations for the swirling phenotype are possible but don't alter the argument I think]. In ds double mutants with the core pathway, trichomes show a <italic>fz/in</italic> pattern (Adler et al., 1998) and point broadly distal on the anterior wing margin, and we see bristles doing the same in <italic>ds pk-<sup>sple</sup></italic> i.e. the phenotype of core loss-of-function is epistatic to that of <italic>ft-ds</italic> for trichome polarity. In <italic>ds pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> we also see trichomes pointing distally as do the bristles (e.g. Hogan et al., 2011), presumably because Sple isn't being mislocalized by Ds (as also suggested in the text by the authors here) and we're seeing either a wild-type or <italic>fz/in</italic> loss-of-function polarity phenotype?</p><p>Comments related to trichome polarity:</p><p>1) The authors also revisit the issue of whether Ft-Ds instruct trichome polarity in Figure 7G-K. However, these results just seem to agree with the view that the core loss-of-function trichome polarity phenotypes are epistatic to loss- or gain-of-function <italic>ft-ds</italic> trichome polarity phenotypes. There is no dispute that <italic>dll&gt;2x-ds</italic> makes trichome polarity swirl (and as they normally point distally, any swirling can be interpreted as &quot;reversal&quot;), but I think it is hard to prove or disprove whether this is direct effect on the core pathway or an indirect effect on the complex process of wing morphogenesis (c.f. work from Eaton lab) that alters core polarity. I don't think it's a surprise that loss of <italic>fz</italic> or <italic>pk<sup>sple</sup></italic> suppresses this phenotype (epistasis noted by Adler et al., 1998) or that <italic>pk<sup>sple</sup></italic> does not (this leaves core pathway intact).</p><p>The interesting question is why the <italic>dll&gt;2x-ds; pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> phenotype looks like the <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> phenotype. The authors describe this as a &quot;suppression&quot;, and seem to conclude that this means Pk<sup>Pk</sup> couples to Ft-Ds, but I don't follow the leap of logic. I think the accepted view is that in <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> the residual population of Pk<sup>Sple</sup> is oriented by endogenous Ft-Ds generating the familiar <italic>pk<sup>pk</sup></italic> AP oriented trichome pattern, and it appears that this AP orientation persists in a <italic>dll&gt;2x-ds</italic> background. This persistence is interesting, but seems to be more about how and when Pk<sup>Sple</sup> couples to Ft-Ds, and doesn't seem to reveal anything about whether Pk<sup>Pk</sup> can couple to Ft-Ds. Have I missed something?</p><p>2) Overall I feel it's a pretty shaky case that Ft-Ds is directly orienting the core in these experiments or that Pk is acting to couple the core to Ft-Ds. Of course if you did want to argue that Ft-Ds orient the core in the relevant region of the wing blade to affect either distal trichome polarity or the triple row bristles, I think you would have to carefully reconcile the following published observations:</p><p>i) Ft-Ds polarity seems to be AP while core is PD, so they don't point the same way? (A timing issue maybe?)</p><p>ii) flattening Ds and Fj gradients seems to give normal polarity? (Also of bristles?)</p><p>iii) <italic>ft dachs</italic> and ft UAS-ft-intra and ft UAS-wts give normal trichome polarity? (Triple row bristles also point distally in these genotypes?)</p><p>However, this all seems like a different argument, not pertinent to helical morphogenesis.</p><p>3) Nevertheless, in light of the above, I worry about the statement in the Abstract &quot;Pk<sup>pk</sup> and Pk<sup>sple</sup>, determines right- or left-handed bristle morphogenesis, each by coupling Frizzled/Vang signaling to the Fat/Dachsous PCP directional signal in opposite directions&quot;. On one hand I don't follow the argument showing Pk<sup>Pk</sup> is coupling to Ft-Ds or that Ft-Ds is determining bristle polarity. The fact that bristle polarity is disrupted in ds mutants doesn't necessarily imply Ds is instructive. I agree that in the absence of Pk<sup>Pk</sup>, Pk<sup>Sple</sup> is probably reversing bristle polarity by coupling to Ds – but this doesn't happen in normal development.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51456.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>1) Figure 4H-I.

But just saying that bristles and hairs share the same polarity is hardly an explanation for the direction we see in various mutants, since it doesn’t explain why either the hairs or bristles behave as noted. As an aside, we’re unconvinced that cell flows are the answer, but that is another discussion. The essence of our finding is that in this region, Pk<sup>sple</sup> expression comes up earlier than the rest of the wing, accounting for the cleaner reversal when Pk<sup>pk</sup> is removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments related to trichome polarity:</p><p>1) The authors also revisit the issue of whether Ft-Ds instruct trichome polarity in Figure 7G-K. However, these results just seem to agree with the view that the core loss-of-function trichome polarity phenotypes are epistatic to loss- or gain-of-function ft-ds trichome polarity phenotypes. There is no dispute that dll&gt;2x-ds makes trichome polarity swirl (and as they normally point distally, any swirling can be interpreted as &quot;reversal&quot;), but I think it is hard to prove or disprove whether this is direct effect on the core pathway or an indirect effect on the complex process of wing morphogenesis (c.f. work from Eaton lab) that alters core polarity.

Epistasis, done properly, implies an upstream-downstream relationship which we indeed believe to be the case between these two systems when pk<sup>pk</sup> is participating in core function.</p><p>However, we wish to go one step further, and address whether Ft-Ds is <italic>instructive</italic> during Pk<sup>pk</sup> function, and loss-of-function epistasis is not sufficient to make this assessment. Demonstrating an instructive role requires reorganizing the Ft-Ds signal in a defined way and asking if the core response follows the predicted input. We therefore identified a condition, <italic>dll&gt;2x-ds</italic>, in which a reorganized Ds gradient redirects polarity. The reviewer correctly notes that there are some swirls in this pattern, and that by definition if there are some swirls there must be areas if reversed polarity. But one way to create swirls is to induce areas of reversed polarity, and we argue that <italic>dll&gt;2x-ds</italic> does exactly that. To try to make the point more convincingly, we now provide an image showing a much larger portion of such a wing, and highlight the region where the reversed gradient is most pronounced (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1E). Note that in the majority of this region, hairs are reoriented to point away from the margin, as expected based on the shape of the <italic>dll</italic> expression domain, whereas swirls appear primarily at the borders of this domain where the reversed polarity confronts regions that are not reversed because ds is either expressed at too low a level or too high a level to produce a meaningful gradient. In addition, we’ve moved the location of the close-up images in Figure 7G-K away from the L3-L4 intervein space where we sometimes saw distortions of the reversal, as in this example, perhaps due to the veins, or possibly due to the geometry of the <italic>dll</italic> gradient, to the L4-L5 intervein space where the effect is more cleanly seen.</p><p>The reviewer also focuses on “whether this is direct effect… or an indirect effect…” We hope the reviewer will agree that the questions of epistasis and of instructive function imply nothing at all about how direct or indirect the signal is between the two systems; how direct or indirect is instead a quite distinct question. If, as the reviewer suggests, Ft-Ds acts on core PCP by modulating wing morphogenesis (c.f. work from Eaton lab), this would simply provide an explanation for the epistasis and instructive function. In this manuscript, we make no specific argument about the mechanism – we simply argue that the Ft-Ds system instructs directionality of the core system when Pk<sup>pk</sup> is participating. However, for this reviewer, we note that we do not favor an Eaton mechanism, such as perturbation of cell flow and shear, because these physical processes would be expected to alter the mutant polarity patterns as well as the wildtype pattern, yet this is not observed.

Nor do we argue that “Pk is acting to couple the core to Ft-Ds.” Indeed, we have previously proposed a rather indirect model in which Ft-Ds orient polarized microtubules on which vesicles containing core proteins traffic. In this model, coupling is indirect and is not mediated by Pk<sup>pk</sup>.</p><p>Nonetheless, we will address the points raised by the reviewer.</p><p>(i) Orientation of the Ft-Ds system has not been examined at the anterior wing margin. Published data only measure to a distance of several cells away from the margin. Still, looking at the Eaton data (Merkel et al.), both the Ft-Ds and core systems evolve from a radial pattern, but the core system becomes parallel while the Ft-Ds system does not. As we suggested originally in Ma et al., 2003, the tendency of the core system toward local alignment is stronger than the coupling to the Ft-Ds system. Thus, the early Ft-Ds orientation and perhaps a subtle remaining P-D orientation at later times could be sufficient to produce the effects we see.</p><p>(ii-iii) While these genotype-phenotype relationships are interesting, we believe they address a different question, specifically, whether there is some other information that is revealed when Ft-Ds is partially or wholly disabled. There is little doubt that perturbing the Ft-Ds signal in a variety of ways and in several tissues impinges on core PCP directionality. The listed genotypes attempt to completely remove this information. If that is successful (we’d argue that’s not entirely clear), what remains is indicative of what other information might orient core PCP, but does not bear on how Ft-Ds, when active, interacts with the core PCP system. Yes, we’d like to better understand these observations, but that is not necessary to interpret the experiments in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Nevertheless, in light of the above, I worry about the statement in the Abstract &quot;Pk<sup>pk</sup> and Pk<sup>sple</sup>, determines right- or left-handed bristle morphogenesis, each by coupling Frizzled/Vang signaling to the Fat/Dachsous PCP directional signal in opposite directions&quot;. On one hand I don't follow the argument showing Pk<sup>Pk</sup> is coupling to Ft-Ds or that Ft-Ds is determining bristle polarity. The fact that bristle polarity is disrupted in ds mutants doesn't necessarily imply Ds is instructive. I agree that in the absence of Pk<sup>Pk</sup>, Pk<sup>Sple</sup> is probably reversing bristle polarity by coupling to Ds – but this doesn't happen in normal development.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the wording in the Abstract was problematic, although for a somewhat different reason, and it has been changed. We do not aim to imply an active role for Pk<sup>pk</sup> in coupling, but rather that Ft-Ds couples to the core PCP system when the core system utilizes Pk<sup>pk</sup>. It is also correct that “The fact that bristle polarity is disrupted in ds mutants doesn't necessarily imply Ds is instructive.” As discussed above, the reorienting response of the core PCP system, and of cellular polarity, upon introduction of an alternately produced Ds gradient is the basis for claiming Ft-Ds is instructive. We hope that this discussion, and the improved language in the revised manuscript, is persuasive.</p></body></sub-article></article>
