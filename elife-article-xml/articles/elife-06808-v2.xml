Mechanistic understanding of branching is largely limited to flowering plants such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which have a recent evolutionary origin. We show that in gametophytic shoots of <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>, lateral branches arise by re-specification of epidermal cells into branch initials. A simple model co-ordinating the activity of leafy shoot tips can account for branching patterns, and three known and ancient hormonal regulators of sporophytic branching interact to generate the branching pattern- auxin, cytokinin and strigolactone. The mode of auxin transport required in branch patterning is a key divergence point from known sporophytic pathways. Although PIN-mediated basipetal auxin transport regulates branching patterns in flowering plants, this is not so in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>, where bi-directional transport is required to generate realistic branching patterns. Experiments with callose synthesis inhibitors suggest plasmodesmal connectivity as a potential mechanism for transport.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06808.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06808.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06808.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most land plants have shoots that form branches and plants can regulate when and where they grow these branches to best exploit their environment. Plants with flowers and the more ancient mosses both have branching shoots, but these two groups of plants evolved to grow in this way independently of each other. Most studies on shoot branching have focused on flowering plants and so it is less clear how branching works in mosses.</p><p>Three plant hormones—called auxin, cytokinin and strigolactone—control shoot branching in flowering plants. Auxin moves down the main shoot of the plant to prevent new branches from forming. This movement is controlled by the PIN proteins and several other families of proteins. On the other hand, cytokinin promotes the growth of new branches; and strigolactone can either promote or inhibit shoot branching depending on how the auxin is travelling around the plant.</p><p>Coudert, Palubicki et al. studied shoot branching in a species of moss called <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>. The experiments show that cells on the outer surface of the main shoot are essentially reprogrammed to become so-called ‘branch initials’, which will then develop into new branches. Next, Coudert, Palubicki et al. made a computational model that was able to simulate the pattern of shoot branching in the moss.</p><p>Further experiments supported the predictions made by the model. Coudert, Palubicki et al. found that, as in flowering plants, auxin from the tip of the main shoot suppresses branching in the moss, and cytokinin promotes branching. The experiments also showed that strigolactone inhibits shoot branching, but its role is restricted to the base of the shoots. The model predicts that, unlike in flowering plants, auxin must flow in both directions in moss shoots to produce the observed patterns of shoot branching. Also, the experiments suggest that the PIN proteins and another group of proteins that control the movement of auxin do not regulate shoot branching in moss. Instead, it appears that auxin may move through microscopic channels that link one moss cell to the next.</p><p>Coudert, Palubicki et al.'s findings suggest that both flowering plants and mosses have evolved to use the same three hormones to control shoot branching, but that these hormones interact in different ways. One key next step will be to find out how auxin is transported during shoot branching in moss by manipulating the opening of the channels between the cells. A further challenge will be to find out the precise details of how the hormones control the activity of the branch initial cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

of the vascular plants was underpinned by the innovation of a branching growth habit in the shoots of their last shared common ancestor around 430 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langdale and Harrison, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>). The earliest vascular plants branched by bifurcation, involving the even partitioning of the growing tip into two new shoot tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sussex and Kerk, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harrison et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langdale and Harrison, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harrison and Langdale, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ligrone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tomescu et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequent diversification within the seed plants was underpinned by the evolution of lateral (axillary) branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sussex and Kerk, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langdale and Harrison, 2008</xref>), in which buds initiate in leaf axils but may then become dormant until receiving environmental or internal cues to promote their activation and growth. Lateral branching thus permits finely tuned regulation of plant architecture and space filling in response to the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergamini and Peintinger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Domagalska and Leyser, 2011</xref>). Whilst branching by bifurcation is prevalent in non-seed vascular plant sporophytes and many bryophyte gametophytes, a capacity for lateral branching evolved by convergence in mosses and primed their diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Farge-England, 1996</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms regulating lateral branching are well studied in flowering plant sporophytes, in which the initiation of axillary meristems is regulated by a drop in auxin levels and a rise in cytokinin levels as leaves initiate from the apical meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2014b</xref>). Classical decapitation experiments showed that the main shoot apex exerts an inhibitory effect over subsequent branch outgrowth, a phenomenon known as apical dominance. Replacing decapitated apices with lanolin impregnated with phytohormones showed that auxin can mediate this inhibition, and that its action can be antagonized by cytokinin application to buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thimann and Skoog, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wickson and Thimann, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cline, 1991</xref>). Strigolactone has recently been identified as a third hormonal regulator of branching, exerting an inhibitory or stimulatory effect on branch outgrowth depending on the auxin transport status of the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomez-Roldan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Umehara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shinohara et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which the co-ordinated action of auxin, cytokinin and strigolactone regulates branching is not yet fully clear, but regulated auxin transport plays a key role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crawford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Domagalska and Leyser, 2011</xref>). Auxin is synthesized in young expanding leaves and is transported basipetally by several transporters including PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) polar auxin efflux carriers to generate the polar auxin transport stream in the stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gälweiler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ljung et al., 2001</xref>). The suppressive action of auxin on lateral branch outgrowth is mediated indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morris, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Booker et al., 2003</xref>), leading to the hypothesis that a second messenger (for example cytokinin) could act as an intermediary between auxin and bud activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morris, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Booker et al., 2003</xref>). However, a dominant bud need not be apical, and more recent work suggests that buds compete to export auxin into the main auxin transport stream and that such competition is enhanced by a suppressive action of strigolactones on PIN1-mediated auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crawford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Prusinkiewicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shinohara et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, PIN-mediated auxin transport is a key integration point in the regulation of branching patterns.</p><p>Despite the pivotal contribution of branching pattern innovations to the evolution of plant architecture, the mechanisms underlying the evolution of branching are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sussex and Kerk, 2001</xref>). Auxin transport assays and decapitation experiments used in conjunction with pharmacological treatments in the lycophyte, <italic>Selaginella</italic>, suggest that auxin (acting via polar transport) and cytokinin are conserved regulators of branching in vascular plant sporophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wochok and Sussex, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanders and Langdale, 2013</xref>). Although bryophyte sporophytes do not normally branch, there is a detectable basipetal auxin transport stream in mosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>, disruption of auxin transport by application of polar transport inhibitors or perturbations in PIN function can induce a branching form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2014b</xref>) that closely resembles branching forms in the early fossil record, and such branching forms have also been reported as rare natural liverwort variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bower, 1935</xref>). These data suggest that bulk basipetal polar auxin transport is a conserved regulator of land plant sporophyte development, and point to a potential contribution of PIN-mediated polar auxin transport to the evolution of sporophytic branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>The extent of conservation between sporophytic and gametophytic branching mechanisms is unknown. Classical decapitation experiments revealed apical dominance in mosses and showed that as in flowering plants, a suppressive role of the apex on lateral branching acts via auxin and can be antagonized by cytokinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Maltzahn, 1959</xref>). Whilst <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> PIN proteins are plasma-membrane targeted polar auxin transporters with many roles in gametophore development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Viaene et al., 2014</xref>), bulk basipetal auxin transport is not detected with radiolabelled auxin transport assays in moss gametophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fujita and Hasebe, 2009</xref>), suggesting that auxin transport patterns are not shared between sporophytes and gametophytes. The contribution of cytokinins to gametophore branching has not been extended beyond the pharmacological approaches mentioned above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Maltzahn, 1959</xref>), and strigolactone biosynthesis <italic>ppccd8</italic> mutants have increased branching in protonemal tissues but no reported gametophore defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Proust et al., 2011</xref>). These data have led to the hypothesis that distinct developmental mechanisms have been recruited to regulate gametophyte and sporophyte shoot architecture in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fujita and Hasebe, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the hormonal regulation of lateral gametophore branching in the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>. We present a simple model in which apical auxin sources interact via non-polar auxin transport with hormonally regulated global and local sensitivities to auxin elsewhere in the moss gametophore, accurately reproducing observed branching patterns. Our work suggests that three conserved hormonal cues have been recruited independently in evolution to produce a convergent branching morphology, but that their co-ordinated action is integrated by different mechanisms to those in flowering plants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Branch initials are specified de novo on the gametophore epidermis</title><p>To determine the manner of branch initiation in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>, we first undertook a morphological and histological analysis. We found rhizoids initiating in all leaf axils beyond a certain distance from the main gametophore apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>) but branches were present in only a subset of axils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–P</xref>). In contrast to reports from other species that have identified stereotypical and taxon-specific branch initiation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berthier et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthier, 1970</xref>), we found no regular spacing in the pattern of initiation of <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> branches. We were unable to detect any evidence of dormancy, suggesting that branch initiation and outgrowth are not distinct developmental processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). At the earliest stage of branch initiation that we were able to detect, branches were manifest as a single apical cell surrounded by leaf initials and adjacent to rhizoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>), appearing to differentiate from the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>). At later stages of development, more rhizoids developed at the base of each branch and newly formed leaves were distinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–L</xref>). Well developed lateral branches were morphologically similar to the main gametophore axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>), and transverse sections cut at the base of lateral branches showed that each branch persisted as a superficial projection; there was no continuity between the conducting tissue of the lateral branches and the conducting tissue of the main stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N–P</xref>). We reasoned that the largest branches would have initiated first and evaluated the sequence of branch initiation by dissecting branches from 6 week old gametophores, and ranking their size relative to their position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>).

The position of lateral branches was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), showing an uneven distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The formation of a minimum of 18 leaves was required prior to branch initiation, and an apical portion devoid of branches was maintained at a similar length throughout development. We termed the barren apical portion of the gametophore the apical inhibition zone (AIZ), and the portion of the gametophore in which branches initiated was termed the branching zone (BZ). Reasoning that each of these aspects of the branch distribution might be under regulatory control, we sought to determine how the branch initiation pattern deviated from a random distribution. We simulated a dataset of 60 gametophores in which branching occurs stochastically with a probability of 5% to obtain a similar number of branches to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). We defined a gametophore as a 1D series of metamers where each metamer consists of a section of the main gametophore axis and a leaf, and growth proceeds at a fixed rate adding new metamers as the simulation progresses. Although it was immediately apparent that the simulated dataset lacked apical inhibition, potential differences in branch spacing in the branching zone between WT and simulated datasets were not obvious. We therefore calculated and compared the mean minimum distance between branches in the branching zone of WT (4.48 ± 1.48) and simulated stochastically branching shoots (3.62 ± 0.41). In the WT dataset, branches were more evenly dispersed than expected at random (p-value &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), supporting the notion that the distribution of branches within the BZ is regulated. Even if an apical inhibition zone is introduced into a random model of branching, for example by assuming a branching competency that requires a minimum metamer age, it cannot produce a realistic branching pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06808.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Branching patterns are non-random.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A wild-type gametophore before (left) and after (right) removing the leaves.

The bottom metamer is always defined as the first of the 1D metamer file representing the gametophore in the model.

A phenomenon that was not observed in real plants (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

We first sought to identify potential contributions of the main gametophore apex and auxin to the branching pattern by performing surgical experiments in which thirty gametophores were teased out of several colonies and decapitated by removal of the top six metamers (the top third of the apical inhibition zone). The excised apices were replaced with lanolin or lanolin impregnated with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thirty further gametophores were isolated and left intact as a control, and all sets were left to grow for a week. Whilst control gametophores continued to grow as normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), the gametophores which had their apices replaced by lanolin discontinued growth of the main axis and initiated branches in the portion of the stem originally comprising the apical inhibition zone beneath the cut site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E</xref>). In contrast, the gametophores that had their apices replaced by IAA impregnated lanolin had impaired branch initiation and development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Whilst a total of around 70 branches initiated from lanolin treated control gametophores, around 50 branches initiated from IAA treated gametophores, and of these less than 10 showed normal development. The remainder were shorter than normal and were unable to initiate leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), a defect that we have previously observed in the main apex in gametophores treated with high concentrations of auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2014b</xref>). No difference in the spacing of branches in control or experimental treatments was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest the hypothesis that the shoot apex suppresses branch initiation by acting as an auxin source, which contradicts the low auxin activity levels in gametophore tips reported by <italic>GH3::GUS</italic> signal accumulation. However, the <italic>GH3::GUS</italic> reporter reflects downstream transcriptional outputs of auxin signalling, and may not accurately reflect the auxin distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunoud et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore quantified IAA levels along the gametophore axis by sampling the top six metamers, the apical inhibition zone minus the tip and the branching zone with the branches removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Despite some variability between replicates, we found that mean IAA levels were highest in the tip. We also undertook decapitation experiments in the <italic>GH3::GUS</italic> reporter line and found that the signal intensity dropped substantially in decapitated plants, consistent with the notion that the apex can affect auxin levels elsewhere in the gametophore. In combination, data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> support assumption one of our model by (i) showing that the main apex can regulate the branching pattern, (ii) providing evidence that the main apex is an auxin source, and (iii) showing that apically applied auxin can suppress branching.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Auxin suppresses branching</title><p>To determine whether the suppression of branching by auxin is position dependent or whether auxin can act as a global suppressor of branching, 5 week old gametophores were immersed in an auxin solution for 24 hr and grown for a further 2 weeks prior to analysis of branching patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

We found that branching was very strongly suppressed in this transgenic line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). We used gametophores with fewer than 20 leaves for this experiment because comparison of model predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>) to WT data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) showed that we should most clearly detect a difference at this stage of development, and <italic>ppccd8</italic> mutants make few gametophores. Our inferences were supported in a similar but scaled down experiment using fully grown gametophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus basal expression of a strigolactone biosynthetic gene can account for the predicted requirement of our model for a local basal inhibitor of branching.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06808.032</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Expression levels of a strigolactone biosynthesis gene modulates branching.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) Branching patterns of 60 gametophores with fewer than 20 leaves in (<bold>A</bold>) WT, (<bold>B</bold>) strigolactone-deficient <italic>ppccd8</italic> mutants, (<bold>C</bold>) <italic>ppccd8</italic> mutants treated with 1 μM GR24 and (<bold>D</bold>) <italic>RMS1oe</italic> transgenics with increased strigolactone levels.

We have shown that these three ancient hormonal cues were recruited independently to regulate lateral branching in gametophores of the moss <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>. In combination our model and experimental data lead us to a notion of branching whereby the ratio <italic>c</italic>/<italic>T</italic> determines the fate of epidermal cells in the gametophore axis. If the ratio drops below a threshold level, an epidermal cell can be respecified as a lateral apical cell thereby triggering branch initiation. Such a drop usually occurs in leaf axils independently of the leaf initiation process at the meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>) as a result of competing hormonal cues dispersed across the gametophore. However, cells elsewhere in the metamer are also competent to form branch initials, and do so if the <italic>c</italic>/<italic>T</italic> ratio is perturbed, for instance by changing auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5, 6</xref>), strigolactone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) or cytokinin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Although this process has some similarities to the branch initiation process in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in which a drop in auxin levels in the axils of initiating leaves coupled with a rise in cytokinin levels primes the initiation of the axillary meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2014b</xref>), there are many differences in the regulation of lateral branching between flowering plant sporophytes and <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> gametophytes.</p><p>A first key difference is the mechanism underlying apical dominance, which requires PIN-mediated bulk basipetal polar auxin transport in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gälweiler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ljung et al., 2001</xref>). Our model for branching in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> assumes that the main gametophore apex acts as the source of a cue that can move into the gametophore axis to suppress branching. Decapitation experiments show that the main gametophore apex inhibits branching and that this inhibitory effect can be maintained if the apex is substituted by a source of auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We detect higher levels of auxin in the apex than elsewhere in the gametophore, and removal of the apex diminishes levels of expression of an auxin responsive reporter in the gametophore axis, thereby implicating auxin as an apical cue and indicating a requirement for auxin transport away from the apex in the regulation of branching patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although these results are qualitatively similar to the outcome of such experiments in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thimann and Skoog, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wickson and Thimann, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cline, 1991</xref>), no bulk basipetal auxin transport has been detected in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>). Our model predicts a requirement for bi-directional, or diffusion-like transport to generate realistic patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and suggests that not only the direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but also the rate of transport has a significant impact on branch patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Our experiments with <italic>pin</italic> mutants and pharmacological inhibitors show that membrane-targeted auxin transporters belonging to PIN and ABCB/PGP families are not significant contributors to branch patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Patterning is sensitive to the application of the callose synthesis inhibitor DDG, and incremental increases in the concentration of applied DDG have similar effects on branch patterning as incremental increases in the rates of transport implemented in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These data suggest that auxin may move with diffusive properties via callose-gated plasmodesmatal connections between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Further distinctions relate to variation in conceptualized notions of global and local sensitivities to auxin that can be produced in moss by varying the activity of cytokinin biosynthesis and degradation, and strigolactone biosynthesis pathways respectively. Although the role of cytokinin in gametophore induction is well characterized in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashton et al., 1979</xref>), and cytokinin has previously been shown to antagonize auxin in branch formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Maltzahn, 1959</xref>), little is known about where and how cytokinin acts later in gametophore development. Our results are consistent with a homogenous effect of cytokinin within the gametophore axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and further analysis of cytokinin distributions, for instance with a modified TCS reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller and Sheen, 2008</xref>), may be informative. Upregulation of cytokinin levels by overexpressing <italic>IPT1</italic>, and exogenous cytokinin applications show that cytokinin is sufficient to promote lateral meristem formation and therefore indicate that cytokinin directly promotes branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which strigolactone acts with auxin in the regulation of branching is likely to differ between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>. Whereas strigolactone is thought to suppress branch outgrowth in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by dampening PIN mediated polar auxin transport, the mode of action of strigolactone in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> is unclear. Notably, key strigolactone signalling components required for the inhibition of sporophyte branching in higher plants are not present in mosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delaux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Saint Germain et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, components such as D14 (involved in strigolactone perception) and D53 are absent in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delaux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly the <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> homologue of the F-Box protein MAX2 may not be involved in strigolactone signalling, despite its central role in many strigolactone responses in flowering plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Saint Germain et al., 2013</xref>). The modulation of branching by <italic>PpCCD8</italic> and <italic>RMS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>) was unexpected as previously published work identified roles for <italic>PpCCD8</italic> in protonemal but not gametophore branching patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Proust et al., 2011</xref>). The basal expression domain of <italic>PpCCD8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Proust et al., 2011</xref>) is consistent with a local site of hormone action, but the mechanism underlying the <italic>ppccd8</italic> and <italic>RMS1oe</italic> mutant phenotypes remains to be seen. Although there is a substantial body of evidence that strigolactone-like signals are active across the plant kingdom, the ancestral function of strigolactone and/or these strigolactone-like signals is thought to be in rhizoid elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delaux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Saint Germain et al., 2013</xref>). The absence of distinct branch initiation and outgrowth processes in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> implicates strigolactone in branch initiation, and the relative unimportance of PIN-mediated auxin transport in the regulation of <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> branching patterns suggests that strigolactone is unlikely to act via PIN-mediated auxin transport.</p><p>Diverse branching forms are evident in both the gametophytic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>) and sporophytic plant fossil record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerrienne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>). Although plant phylogenies show that gametophytic branching forms have several independent evolutionary origins, the innovation of sporophytic branching maps once onto the plant tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langdale and Harrison, 2008</xref>) and occurred in pre-vascular plants such as <italic>Partitatheca</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>). Exogenous hormone treatments in <italic>Selaginella</italic> have shown that the antagonistic relationship between auxin and cytokinin in the regulation of branching is conserved within the vascular plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanders and Langdale, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, auxin transport assays and pharmacological treatments used in combination with decapitation in <italic>Selaginella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wochok and Sussex, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">1975</xref>) have shown that auxin transport-mediated apical dominance is a homology of vascular plant sporophytes. Disruption of PIN-mediated polar auxin transport in moss sporophytes can induce a branching form that is intermediate between living bryophytes and vascular plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2014b</xref>), and resembles the earliest branching forms in the sporophytic fossil record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that auxin transport-regulated branching may be a homology of the sporophyte generation. Although the regulation of lateral branching by three key regulatory hormone pathways in moss gametophytes indicates deep homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scotland, 2010</xref>), the mode and basis of auxin transport are a key divergence point in branch patterning mechanisms between land plant sporophytes and gametophytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Sterile spot cultures were grown on BCD + AT medium as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>) and gametophores were sampled after 5 and 7 weeks for branching pattern analysis. For histological analyses, gametophores from 6-week-old colonies were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, 3% glutaradehyde, 0.5% tannic acid in phosphate buffered saline overnight at 4°C. Fixed tissue was dehydrated and embedded in Technovit 7100 resin as described by the manufacturer (Kulzer, Germany). Five micrometer sections were cut and stained with 0.1% Toluidine Blue for 30 s, rinsed in water, and dried for storage or further examination. For SEM, samples were frozen from fresh on a Pelletier cooling stage set to −25°C and imaged using a Zeiss EVO HD (Zeiss, Germany) environmental scanning electron microscope with variable pressure mode and 30 Pa nitrogen gas. Models were implemented as in the SI methods. For analysis of endogenous IAA and CK content, gametophores were isolated from 6-week old colonies, dissected to collect 10–20 mg (for IAA) and 50 mg (for CK) of tissue and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were extracted, purified and analyzed using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as previously described, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edlund et al.

The moss gametophore is represented in the model as a graph of vertices and connecting edges. Each vertex represents either a metamer or an apex. The graph representing the moss is dynamic. Periodically, new vertices are added to the graph representing growth of the gametophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The number of simulation steps between the addition of new vertices in the model constitutes 1 plastochron, which we assume to be approximately 1 day for wild-type <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> grown on agar medium. The differential equations calculating the rate of change of auxin concentration per vertex (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) of the graph are solved numerically using the forward Euler integration scheme. The time step Δt is set to 0.005, there are thus 200 simulation steps per plastochron. For all simulation results presented, a number of gametophores have been simulated where growth is delayed by a random amount of simulation steps between two neighboring axes, and the simulation stops after a set number of total simulation steps has been reached. All simulated gametophores initiate as one apical vertex visualized in red, and a vertex representing the first metamer, visualized in grey. Separate lateral axes are simulated, and their initiation point is represented as a red cell. Higher order branching is not represented and was rarely observed in experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Model parameter values</title><p>For the most important parameters such as auxin concentrations, auxin movement or auxin decay rates there were no direct estimates available to this project.

Our parameter value settings, given that we have 200 simulation steps per plastochron, correspond to an auxin movement rate of approximately 1 mm/hr in the gametophore. However, we found for several auxin movement rate values inside these bounds for which simulation results could be reproduced by readjusting other parameter values.

Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this time.</p><p>As you can see from their attached reviews, the reviewers acknowledge your interesting comparative study of branching in seedless and seed plants, but they also feel that the story is not yet developed far enough. You will note that the reviewers raise some important criticism of the modelling part of your paper. Specifically, they point out discrepancies that apparently go against your statement that the model “accurately reproduces observed branching patterns”. Should you be able to come up with a substantially improved and further developed manuscript in the future, we would be happy to consider it, but please be aware that this would be handled as a new submission.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a new submission was re-reviewed and accepted without further revisions.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>The authors study branching in <italic>P. Patens</italic> using a combination of morphological characterization, genetics, pharmacology and computational modeling. The subject area is interesting and a comparative understanding of branching in seedless and seed plants of value to the field. As such the study provides some potentially interesting hints on this front. However clear cut findings do not yet emerge so the case for publication in a general interest journal is not yet very strong. There are also technical issues that need resolution.</p><p>1) The initial simulations showed a branch formed always in the most basal metamer. Is there biological basis for this or is it a computational artefact relating to boundary conditions used? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> shows a lot of simulations that there is a gradient in auxin emanating from the base. Where does this auxin come from? This seems problematic. These issues need a very clear explanation.</p><p>2) The proposed mechanism does not seem very robust. What stops branches from emerging next to each other? Neighboring sites could be (randomly) assigned a very close T which would result in branches in neighboring metamers. This does seem to be the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> where there are 7 side-by-side initiations. If you compare with the branching pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> you will there are none of these cases in the WT data. The long-range inhibition that is currently there (auxin diffuses from sources and branches are only made under a target concentration) is very unlikely be enough to account for this. What do the authors suggest? Is there a biological entry point into modeling these key aspects?</p><p>3) The treatment of lateral branches is not explained very clearly in the text. In the supplement the authors state they do grow out, so I assume their distance from the main axis would indeed affect their inhibitory effect. A cartoon or a model visualization of a typical run of the model including the branches would be helpful to understand this point. It is also not clear whether the distance to the lateral tips is taken into account when calculating distances between branches. If not, shouldn't it be? In general the relationship between the length of lateral branches and their inhibiting effect needs consideration.</p><p>4) On the same front: Why is it not possible to decapitate/ablate lateral branches? That experiment would really help modeling efforts.</p><p>5) While the overexpression of <italic>RMS1</italic> does appear to have a strong phenotype the role of strigolactone in the model is less clear. It seems the phenotype of <italic>ppccd8</italic> is very subtle and only detectable in plants with fewer than 20 leaves. If the basal suppression is strigolactone related, then why don't we see it in older plants? In the model, a strigolactone induced reduction of the threshold is required in the basal “5 or so” cells, yet there are often branches formed in these regions in real plants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig5">Figures 2C and 5A</xref>).</p><p>6) The question of how auxin is transported seems very pertinent to the model and as far as I understand we do not yet have a clear picture on the biology here. Data on the <italic>pin</italic> mutants seems not fully conclusive but consistent with the PINs being apolar transporters, however the authors claim transporters play a minor role. If neither PINs nor the ABCBs are responsible for this transport, how does the auxin get from cell to cell? It cannot really diffuse across the membrane, yet the model suggests a diffusive mechanism, such as apolar transport. This makes the whole argument a bit confusing and weak. The reader is left feeling there are too many uncertainties piling up here to allow the model to provide substantial novel insight into the process.</p><p>7) The <italic>GH3:GUS</italic> expression in relation to auxin quantification is not clearly explained. How reliable an auxin reporter is it?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>The authors look at shoot branching in moss. They look at branch spacing and show that it appears not to be entirely random, and that there is some sort of spacing mechanism involved. They propose a model based on the interaction of auxin, cytokinin and strigolactone. The model consists of a growing apex that is a source of auxin, with the lateral branches also acting as auxin sources. Auxin diffuses away from the sources, and is degraded creating gradients. Cells that are below a threshold of auxin concentration initiate lateral branches. The concentration at sources is assigned with some random variation, as is the threshold for initiation in each cell. Cytokinin is added to the basic model by changing the threshold concentration of auxin below which outgrowth will occur, and strigolcatone is added by having an inhibitory effect at the base.</p><p>It is a very simple threshold model, which is also one of its major weaknesses. For example, in the model we see lateral initials in adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) which does not seem to occur in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Does this not suggest a process more active than a simple diffusion/threshold model, which is known not to be robust? The model needs some sort of local activation and long range inhibition, like a reaction-diffusion diffusion system, or like the model in Prusinkiewicz 2009, PNAS. It seems a bit difficult to compare distances in such a model with WT, when simple features of the distribution are different.</p><p>On the upside, the experimental work is nice as the authors have tested a variety of scenarios to see if the same players in branching in angiosperms are also used in moss. However the experiments leave us somewhat disappointed, as PINs and ABCBs appear not to be so important, but yet auxin still is. This begs the question as to how, exactly, cytokinin and strigolactone are thought to interact with auxin.</p><p>It would be nice to have more comparison throughout the text and results sections with the classic decapitation experiments in angiosperms, what outcomes are the same? What is different? Likewise for the auxin/cytokinin/strigolactone up/down manipulations.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>In the subsection headed “Strigolactone fulfils a predicted requirement for basal suppression of branching”: If the basal inhibitor in the model is indeed strigolactone, then why doesn't a branch always occur in the basal most metamer in the <italic>ppccd8</italic> mutant as in the model (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>)? The phenotype looks pretty weak compared to model predictions, suggesting that strigolactone must not be the main player for the basal repression.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>: Why does the cell on the bottom, 9th from the right, look to have a gradient of auxin coming from it, as though it was an auxin source?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>This paper demonstrates that auxin, cytokinin and strigolactones together coordinate branching in the gametophyte of <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>. This is important because it demonstrates that a similar mechanism has evolved to control the branching of bryophyte gametophytes and flowering plant sporophytes. However the authors identify some subtle differences.</p><p>The authors start with a model that indicates that a bidirectional transport is required to generate a pattern that reflects the pattern of branching along the moss gametophyte. They suggest that there are repressors and promoters of branching and then go onto identify regulatory molecules that fulfil the criteria predicted in the model.</p><p>Having constructed a model the authors then go on to test the biological significance of these parameters by experiment.</p><p>The first key experiment reports the finding that like sporophyte shoots, auxin produced at the apex represses branching. This was supported by the observation that auxin levels were higher at the apices suggesting that the apex is a source of auxin.</p><p>The authors then modulate endogenous levels of auxin using plants with decreased or increased levels of SHI2 activity. The authors state that branching pattern agrees with the predictions of the model. However they do not state the result and the reader is left to interpret the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (see “suggestions” below). The figure indicates that loss of <italic>shi2</italic> function results in increased branching and over expression decreases branch number, which is consistent with their model. PIN mediated auxin transport is involved in branching development but is not the major component. This is an important result and explains published observations regarding auxin transport in gametophytes from the Hasebe group.</p><p>Cytokinin promotes branch formation and decreased endogenous levels of cytokinin results in a reduction in branching number.</p><p>Genetic evidence is presented that indicates that strigolactones repress branching.</p><p>Taken together the data support the model for branching. For the first time a coherent model that explains moss gametophore branching is presented.</p><p>Suggestions:</p><p>1) In the subsection headed “Auxin biosynthesis mutants capture predicted effects of changing model values H<sub>apex</sub> and H”: This section is written cryptically. I don't have a problem with the data but the cryptic way in which the data are referred to. The authors should report the phenotype of <italic>shi</italic> mutants in the text. They only refer to H values, which is vague in the context of an experiment and experimental data. The final sentence of this section is unclear and vague—what is the biological result? The concluding sentence is no help to the reader (see helpful concluding sentence of the following paragraph). Even the title of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is unhelpful and gnomic.</p><p>2) In the subsection headed “Up-regulating cytokinin degradation captures predicted effects of decreasing model values of <italic>T</italic>”, the expression “similar to the model output”. It would help a struggling reader if the authors stated the result and then concluded that his was similar to the model output.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06808.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We have explored changes in the rate of auxin transport via callose-gated plasmodesmatal connectvity as a plausible alternative mechanism in the regulation of branching patterns.
