neuromuscular system provides an ideal context in which to study synaptic partner choice, because it contains a small number of pre- and postsynaptic cells connected in an invariant pattern. The discovery of interactions between two subfamilies of IgSF cell surface proteins, the Dprs and the DIPs, provided new candidates for cellular labels controlling synaptic specificity. Here we show that DIP-α is expressed by two identified motor neurons, while its binding partner Dpr10 is expressed by postsynaptic muscle targets. Removal of either DIP-α or Dpr10 results in loss of specific axonal branches and NMJs formed by one motor neuron, MNISN-1s, while other branches of the MNISN-1s axon develop normally. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of <italic>dpr10</italic> correlates with muscle innervation by MNISN-1s during embryonic development. We propose a model whereby DIP-α and Dpr10 on opposing synaptic partners interact with each other to generate proper motor neuron connectivity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cell-surface proteins</kwd><kwd>synaptic connectivity</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular circuit</kwd><kwd>IgSF</kwd><kwd>muscle innervation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lobb-Rabe</surname><given-names>Meike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 096509</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zinn</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01 NS102342</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carrillo</surname><given-names>Robert A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Chicago Grossman Institute for Neuroscience, Quantitative Biology and Human Behavior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carrillo</surname><given-names>Robert A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Chicago BSD Faculty Diversity Career Advancement Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carrillo</surname><given-names>Robert A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Synaptic partner recognition in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular circuit requires interactions between the Dpr and DIP subfamilies of immunoglobulin cell-surface proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The proper wiring of neural circuits is essential for animal behavior, and alterations in connectivity are linked to neurological disease phenotypes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rowe, 2010</xref>). Thus, identifying cell-surface molecules involved in neural wiring is critical for understanding biological mechanisms in normal development and in diseased states. Using genetics to uncover these mechanisms has been difficult, partially due to the fact that achieving the necessary precision appears to require partially redundant biochemical interactions.</p><p>One of the simplest and most accessible systems in which to study the genetic determination of synaptic connectivity patterns is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular system. In each larval abdominal hemisegment, 35 identified motor neurons innervate a set of 30 muscle fibers. Each motor neuron chooses one or more specific muscle fibers as synaptic targets, and the map of connections is almost invariant. <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses are glutamatergic and use orthologs of mammalian AMPA receptors for synaptic transmission. Many scaffolding and regulatory proteins that modulate these receptors are conserved between insects and vertebrates. The sizes and strengths of <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs are regulated by retrograde signaling from their postsynaptic muscle targets. In addition to this developmental plasticity, NMJ synapses also exhibit short-term and homeostatic plasticity. These features make the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ a useful genetic model system for excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broadie and Bate, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keshishian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Menon et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although many molecules involved in axon guidance, NMJ morphology, and synaptic activity have been identified through forward and reverse genetic experiments, we still lack an understanding of the mechanisms by which individual larval muscle fibers are recognized as synaptic targets by <italic>Drosophila</italic> motor axons. Gain-of-function (GOF) experiments suggest that individual muscles are labeled by cell-surface proteins (CSPs) that can define them as targets for motor axons. 30 CSPs have been identified that cause motor axons to mistarget when they are ubiquitously expressed in muscles. These proteins contain a variety of extracellular domain (XCD) types, including immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domains and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) sequences. Some of these proteins are normally expressed on subsets of muscles in embryos, suggesting that they could act as molecular signatures during motor axon targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kurusu et al., 2008</xref>). However, none of the CSPs identified thus far are required for innervation of the muscles that express them, suggesting that they have partially redundant functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiba et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kurusu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taniguchi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Winberg et al., 1998</xref>). In loss-of-function (LOF) mutants lacking CSPs expressed on muscle fibers or the receptors for these proteins on motor axons, innervation occurs normally in most cases. To our knowledge, there are no published LOF mutations in CSP genes that cause high-penetrance failures of innervation of specific muscle fibers.</p><p>A network of new candidates for synaptic targeting molecules was recently identified through a global in vitro ‘interactome’ screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Özkan et al., 2013</xref>). In this network, the ‘Dpr-ome’, a set of 21 proteins with two IgSF domains, the Dprs, interact in a complex pattern with a set of 11 proteins with three IgSF domains, called DIPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cosmanescu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Özkan et al., 2013</xref>). We and others have examined the expression patterns of many Dprs and DIPs, and found that each is expressed in a small and unique subset of neurons in the larval ventral nerve cord and pupal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cosmanescu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We studied the functions of one Dpr–DIP binding pair, Dpr11–DIP-γ, in both the larval neuromuscular system and the pupal optic lobe. Loss of either <italic>dpr11</italic> or <italic>DIP-γ</italic> produced phenotypes affecting NMJ morphology and retrograde bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, but did not alter NMJ connectivity patterns. DIP-γ is expressed in most motor neurons, so it is unlikely to be involved in recognition of targets by specific motor neurons. In the optic lobe, however, DIP-γ is selectively expressed in amacrine neurons that are postsynaptic to photoreceptor neurons that express Dpr11, suggesting that Dpr11–DIP-γ interactions may be important in determining synaptic connectivity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>). For several other Dpr–DIP in vitro binding pairs, optic lobe neurons expressing a Dpr are also synaptically connected to neurons expressing the cognate DIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tan et al., 2015</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). In the antennal lobe, Dprs and DIPs regulate adhesion and sorting of axons of olfactory receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barish et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Based on these findings, we surveyed DIP expression in the larval neuromuscular system, in order to identify DIPs whose expression is restricted to subsets of motor neurons. Remarkably, DIP-α is expressed by only two motor neurons in each hemisegment. There are two types of glutamatergic motor neurons in the larval neuromuscular system: 1b (big boutons) and 1s (small boutons). Larval muscle fibers are divided into four fields: the ventral, ventrolateral, lateral, and dorsal fields. Each 1b motor neuron innervates one or two muscle fibers. The three 1s motor neurons have multiple branches, and each 1s neuron forms branches on most or all of the fibers within a specific muscle field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoang and Chiba, 2001</xref>). DIP-α is expressed in MNISN-1s, which synapses on dorsal muscles, and in MNISNb/d-1s (also referred to as MNSNb/d-1s), which synapses on ventral and ventrolateral muscles. Fate determination and axon guidance of MNISN-1s have been extensively studied in embryos, where it is known as RP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frasch et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landgraf et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Patel et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sink and Whitington, 1991</xref>).</p><p>A subset of muscles innervated by MNISN-1s axon branches are muscles 4, 3, and 2, which are arranged in a ventral→dorsal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In <italic>DIP-α</italic> mutant larvae, the interstitial axon branch onto muscle 4 (m4) is always missing, and the branch onto m3 is usually absent. The branch onto m2, however, is always present. MNISN-1s filopodia are observed in the m4 target area in both wild-type and <italic>DIP-α</italic> mutant embryos, but 1s boutons never form on m4 in mutants. This suggests that nascent axonal projections onto m4 fail to stabilize and convert into NMJs in the absence of DIP-α.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42690.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DIP-α is expressed in a subset of neurons that includes MNISN-1s/RP2.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) <italic>DIP-α-T2A-GAL4</italic> driving EGFP expression in (<bold>A</bold>) embryonic and (<bold>B</bold>) third instar larval ventral nerve cords labeled with anti-GFP (green) and anti-Eve (red).

Thus, in both of these neuromuscular systems, interactions between DIP-α and Dpr10 control formation of synapses on specific muscle targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>DIP-α</italic> is selectively expressed by two identified motor neurons</title><p>In a previous study, we showed that several Dprs and DIPs, including <italic>DIP-α,</italic> are expressed in subsets of neurons in the larval ventral nerve cord (VNC). <italic>DIP-α</italic> reporter expression was observed in a subset of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), including a segmentally repeated pair of motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>). Here we sought to investigate the identity of these DIP-α-expressing neurons and to determine if <italic>DIP-α</italic> is required for their targeting to specific muscles. We monitored <italic>DIP-α</italic> expression with reporters driven by a gene trap GAL4 in embryos and third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, respectively). The GAL4 line was generated by replacing a splice-trap MiMIC transposable element, MI02031 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Venken et al., 2011</xref>), in the first <italic>DIP-α</italic> coding intron with a T2A-<italic>GAL4</italic> cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diao and White, 2012</xref>), using recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). It has been demonstrated that most MiMIC-derived <italic>GAL4</italic> cassettes faithfully reproduce the expression patterns of the genes into which they are inserted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015b</xref>). T2A-<italic>GAL4</italic> cassettes in coding introns have the additional feature that GAL4 expression is from a transcript whose translation initiates at the normal ATG of the gene. This means that the expression pattern of GAL4 should correspond to that of the nascent endogenous protein. However, proteins are also subject to post-translational control, so GAL4-driven reporter expression may not necessarily mimic the expression pattern of an accumulated protein as observed by antibody staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Venken et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The first cells to express the <italic>DIP-α-T2A-GAL4&gt;UAS-</italic>EGFP reporter (<italic>DIP-α-GAL4&gt;EGFP</italic>) include a pair of segmentally repeated neurons in the stage 14 (st14) embryonic VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). <italic>DIP-α</italic> expression persists into late embryonic development, and the segmentally repeated pair of dorsal <italic>DIP-α</italic>+ cells also express the transcription factor Even-skipped (Eve) by st16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The three prominent medially located pairs of Eve+ neurons correspond to the well-characterized aCC, pCC, and RP2 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landgraf et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Patel et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>). pCC is an interneuron, and aCC is the Ib-type motor neuron that innervates m1.

Motor neurons make stereotyped connections with their muscle targets, allowing us to utilize the innervation pattern of the <italic>DIP-α</italic>+ Eve+ neuron to identify it. Using the same <italic>DIP-α-GAL4&gt;EGFP</italic> reporter, we observe two axons that exit the VNC in each hemisegment; thus, <italic>DIP-α</italic> expression persists through embryonic and larval development. One of these axons innervates the dorsal muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), corresponding to the known connectivity map of MNISN-1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoang and Chiba, 2001</xref>). The other axon innervates ventral and ventrolateral muscles, corresponding to the connectivity map of MNISNb/d-1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The MNISNb/d-1s cell body is located ventrally within the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and is not Eve+. When NMJs on all muscles are visualized with anti-HRP, it is observed that only 1s boutons express the <italic>DIP-α-GAL4&gt;EGFP</italic> reporter. Not all 1s boutons are labeled with the reporter, however. There is a third 1s motor neuron that innervates lateral muscles, and this does not express <italic>DIP-α.</italic> In summary, <italic>DIP-α</italic> is expressed by two of the three 1s motor neurons in each abdominal hemisegment, and not by any 1b motor neurons.</p><p>DIP-α is a cell surface protein, and analysis of its subcellular localization might provide insights into its function. To address where DIP-α localizes within MNISN-1s, we used a ‘protein trap’, <italic>DIP-α-EGFP-DIP-α</italic>, constructed by using RMCE to insert GFP into the reading frame of DIP-α, using the same MiMIC as for the T2A-<italic>GAL4</italic> replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015a</xref>). If such protein traps are expressed well, they usually are transported to the subcellular compartments where the endogenous protein is located. During late embryonic development, DIP-α-EGFP-DIP-α localized to growth cones prior to muscle innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and remained distributed to all larval MNISN-1s NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), including m4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We were unable to determine if DIP-α-EGFP-DIP-α also localizes to MNISN-1s dendrites due to the abundant signal in the VNC neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DIP-α is required for MNISN-1s targeting specificity</title><p>Previously, we and others reported expression patterns that support a role for Dpr-DIP interactions in synaptic partner choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Given the selective expression of <italic>DIP-α</italic> in two 1s motor neurons within the neuromuscular system and the localization of DIP-α to presynaptic terminals, we speculated that <italic>DIP-α</italic> may be involved in targeting of motor axons to muscle fibers. The innervation pattern of the larval musculature is almost invariant, so we can readily evaluate changes in connectivity due to alterations in gene function.

Remarkably, loss of <italic>DIP-α</italic> produces a unique phenotype in which the MNISN-1s branch on m4 is always missing (the m4-1s phenotype; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

During the larval instars, NMJs formed during embryogenesis expand in order to keep pace with the growth of the muscle fibers.

MNISN-1s begins to express <italic>DIP-α-GAL4&gt;EGFP</italic> at st13/14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and this expression continues through embryonic st17 and then persists during larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The proper wiring of MNISN-1s requires the coordination of axon guidance, fasciculation, defasciculation, and synaptic partner choice. Thus, the striking loss of m4-1s observed upon removal of DIP-α could result from defects in various developmental processes.</p><p>Axon guidance requires the integration of attractive and repulsive external cues through cell surface proteins. MNISN-1s innervates the dorsal muscles, the most distal of which is m1. To determine the gross progression of MNISN-1s muscle innervation, we quantified terminal ‘swellings’ which precede varicosity formation in st15-16 embryos in distal (m1, 2, 9, and 10) and proximal (m3, 4, 19, and 20) muscle fields. MNISN-1s rarely formed terminal swellings in the proximal muscle field at this stage, unlike distal muscles, suggesting that MNISN-1s innervates muscles distal to proximal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, if DIP-α is required for axon guidance we would expect to observe defects in MNISN-1s axons in the vicinity of m1 and m2 in mutants.

This process requires the appropriate balance of adhesion between axons and repulsive signals that facilitate separation of axons from the nerve bundle.

We investigated whether <italic>DIP-α</italic> was required for MNISN-1s filopodia to leave the nerve bundle.

The developmental time course for MNISN-1s innervation of m4 is not known, so we examined MNISN-1s axons at various embryonic stages and in first instar larvae. In control embryos, we observe MNISN-1s axon defasciculation and filopodia at m4 beginning in st17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). MNISN-1s filopodia at more dorsal muscles are evident at earlier stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

MNISN-1s innervates most of the muscles in the dorsal muscle field, but only the proximal (most ventral) branches of its axon are affected in <italic>DIP-α</italic> mutants. The branch innervating m4, m4-1s, is absent in 100% of hemisegments in mutants. DIP-α is required in the MNISN-1s neuron to direct innervation of m4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Examination of the MNISN-1s axon during embryonic development shows that its filopodia explore the surface of m4 and surrounding muscles in a normal manner in <italic>DIP-α</italic> mutants, but a stable m4 NMJ never forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Innervation of muscles near m4 is also reduced in <italic>DIP-α</italic> mutants, while innervation of more dorsal muscles is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). One of DIP-α’s two binding partners, Dpr10, is expressed at high levels in muscles and can localize to the postsynaptic side of NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and the m4-1s branch is also absent in <italic>dpr10</italic> mutants. RNAi knockdown experiments show that Dpr10 is required in muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). By examination of the temporal and spatial expression patterns of <italic>dpr10</italic> in embryos, we found that its earliest expression is on muscles flanking m4, some of which also lack 1s NMJs in <italic>DIP-α</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This suggests that recognition of Dpr10 on these muscles by DIP-α on the MNISN-1s growth cone is a cue for branch formation or stabilization.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A model for control of muscle innervation by interactions between DIP-α and Dpr10</title><p>A number of mutant screens for alterations in the morphologies and patterning of NMJs in the larval neuromuscular system have been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kraut et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Valakh et al., 2012</xref>). LOF mutations in a few genes, including those encoding the cell-surface IgSF domain protein Sidestep and its binding partner, Beaten Path, cause motor axons to fail to arborize normally onto any muscle fibers, resulting in large-scale alterations in innervation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kinold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pipes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Siebert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sink et al., 2001</xref>). However, there are no prior reports (to our knowledge) of LOF mutations in single genes that cause high-penetrance changes in targeting of single larval motor axons to individual, or groups of, muscle fibers.</p><p>The failure to find genes required for innervation of specific muscles in LOF screens has suggested that individual muscles may be labeled by multiple targeting cues, and that neurons express receptors for more than one of these cues. Loss of any one neuronal receptor or muscle targeting cue does not cause strong phenotypes because they have partially redundant functions. The remaining receptors and cues may substitute for the missing proteins in mutants and allow normal muscle targeting to occur.</p><p>It has been difficult to identify neuronal receptors whose expression is specific to particular subsets of motor axons. Neuronal CSPs that have been previously studied in the context of motor axon guidance and arborization onto muscles (<italic>e.g.,</italic> Receptor Tyrosine Phosphatases (RPTPs), Beaten Paths, Fasciclin II, Netrin receptors, Semaphorin receptors) are usually expressed by most or all motor neurons. Not surprisingly, then, mutations in genes encoding these proteins usually produce guidance or arborization phenotypes that affect many motor axons and muscles. By contrast, DIP-α is expressed in only two of the 35 motor neurons that innervate muscles in each larval abdominal hemisegment. These are the 1s motor neurons MNISN-1s (RP2) and MNISNb/d-1s. This finding suggested that any phenotypes caused by loss of DIP-α might be specific to the axons of these two motor neurons.</p><p>Like other motor axons, the two DIP-α-expressing axons probably express binding partners for many muscle cell-surface proteins. Neuronal and muscle binding partners could act as signaling receptors, ligands for receptors, or adhesion molecules. The 1s motor axons that express DIP-α have multiple branches, and each axon innervates most of the muscles within a muscle field. MNISN-1s innervates muscles in the dorsal field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoang and Chiba, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landgraf et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nose, 2012</xref>). One might expect that targeting phenotypes would be observed in <italic>DIP-α</italic> LOF mutants only if binding of DIP-α to one of its Dpr binding partners was essential for recognition of specific muscle fibers by individual branches of a 1s motor axon. In fact, we observed that the loss of DIP-α causes a high-penetrance loss of branches onto a particular group of dorsal muscle fibers innervated by MNISN-1s. These are internal m4 and m3, and external m19 and m20, which are underneath m4 and m3 in embryonic and larval fillet preparations. However, the branches of the MNISN-1s axon onto internal dorsal m2 and external m9 and m10, which lie underneath m2, are still present in <italic>DIP-α</italic> mutants.</p><p>MNISN-1s branches are also lost with high penetrance in <italic>dpr10</italic> null mutants, indicating that Dpr10 is the DIP-α binding partner relevant to innervation of these muscles. In larvae, <italic>dpr10</italic> is expressed at high levels in most muscle fibers. Knockdown of <italic>dpr10</italic> by RNAi in all muscles affects formation of the same MNISN-1s branches that are eliminated in <italic>dpr10</italic> mutants. Therefore, binding of neuronal DIP-α to muscle Dpr10 is likely to underlie recognition of specific muscles as targets for proximal MNISN-1s axon branches. In embryos, <italic>dpr10</italic> expression is initiated in m20 and m5, which flank m4. NMJs on m20 are also absent in <italic>DIP-α</italic> mutants; m5 does not receive 1s innervation. <italic>dpr10</italic> expression begins in m4 around the time at which we observe exploration of this muscle by filopodia emerging from the MNISN-1s axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The gene encoding DIP-α’s other binding partner, Dpr6, is expressed by most motor neurons, but is not detectably expressed by muscle fibers. Although <italic>dpr6</italic> is expressed by MNISN-1s in embryos, <italic>dpr6</italic> mutants do not have m4-1s phenotypes. This suggests that Dpr6 does not play a direct role in the targeting of MNISN-1s to m4. DIP-α can also bind homophilically, but with reduced affinity relative to its heterophilic binding affinities for Dpr10 and Dpr6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cosmanescu et al., 2018</xref>). However, during normal development DIP-α would not have the opportunity to mediate homophilic interactions between motor axons, since it is expressed only on the MNISN-1s axon and not on the other motor axons with which it fasciculates during outgrowth.</p><p>Correct innervation of m4 and the other muscles in its immediate vicinity may require a balance between the expression levels of DIP-α’s binding partner Dpr10 on muscles relative to axons. As described above, knocking down Dpr10 in muscles eliminates innervation of m4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that transsynaptic interactions between neuronal DIP-α and muscle Dpr10 are essential for recognition of this muscle by an interstitial MNISN-1s growth cone. There is also a 50% reduction in m4 innervation when Dpr10 is knocked down in all neurons, while knockdown in MNISN-1s produces no innervation defects. This suggests that interactions between DIP-α on MNISN-1s axons and Dpr10 on other axons with which it fasciculates also contribute to correct m4 innervation.</p><p>Driving high-level expression of DIP-α or Dpr10 in all neurons abolishes m4 innervation by MNISN-1s. Normally DIP-α is not expressed in other axons in the ISN fascicle, so upon DIP-α expression ectopic axon-axon interactions mediated by homo- and heterophilic binding may alter MNISN-1s connectivity. Interestingly, these GOF phenotypes are also seen when Dpr10, but not DIP-α, is increased in MNISN-1s only. High-level expression of DIP-α or Dpr10 on muscles also eliminates (DIP-α) or reduces (Dpr10) innervation of m4. Some of these phenotypes may be due to <italic>cis</italic> Dpr10–DIP-α interactions on the same membrane, which could reduce the amount of DIP-α or Dpr10 that is available to interact with its partner in trans. Excessive adhesion between the MNISN-1s axon and the other axons in its bundle (in the case of Dpr10 overexpression in all neurons), or between the MNISN-1s axon and the muscles it traverses during its outgrowth (in the case of Dpr10 overexpression in muscles) may also affect the ability of a branch to separate from the axon and form an NMJ. Overexpression of Dpr10 in muscles may similarly cause excessive MNISN-1s adhesion to distal muscles, and this model is supported by the exuberant number of branches on m2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Knockdown or overexpression of DIP-α or Dpr10 in neurons or in muscles does not reduce the frequency of innervation of the most dorsal muscles by MNISN-1s, indicating that these muscles are recognized as targets <italic>via</italic> other cues. Interestingly, however, m1, which is adjacent to m2 and rarely innervated by MNISN-1s, gains innervation in <italic>DIP-α</italic> mutants, and the 1s NMJ on m2 becomes larger. These results suggest that MNISN-1s is normally specified to make a certain number of synaptic boutons, and that loss of boutons on proximal muscles m4, m3, m19, and m20 results in an increased number of boutons on distal muscles.</p><p>Using these results, we have constructed a model that can explain how interactions between DIP-α and Dpr10 specify targeting of MNISN-1s axon branches to m4 and the other muscles in its vicinity. DIP-α begins to be expressed in MNISN-1s (RP2) in st14 embryos, during the period of motor axon guidance. The MNISN-1s axon reaches its terminus in the vicinity of m1/m2 at st16, before it forms interstitial branches onto m20, where Dpr10 is already expressed. After the m20-1s branch forms, Dpr10 appears on m4, and binding of DIP-α on MNISN-1s to Dpr10 on m4 and surrounding muscles results in the formation of stable branches that differentiate into NMJs. During this process, DIP-α on MNISN-1s might switch from interacting with Dpr10 on fasciculated axons within the ISN bundle to binding to Dpr10 on muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functions of the Dpr-DIP network in formation of synaptic circuits</title><p>The Dpr-ome binding network was defined by a global in vitro ‘interactome’ screen for binding interactions among all <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell-surface and secreted proteins containing three common extracellular domain types: IgSF, Fibronectin Type III, and LRR. There are 21 Dpr proteins, each containing two IgSF domains, 11 DIP proteins, each containing three IgSF domains, and an LRR protein called cDIP that binds to many Dprs and DIPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cosmanescu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Özkan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of expression of individual <italic>dpr</italic> and <italic>DIP</italic> genes revealed remarkable and unprecedented patterns in the larval ventral nerve cord and pupal brain. Each <italic>dpr</italic> and <italic>DIP</italic> is expressed by a small and unique subset of interneurons. In the pupal optic lobe, neurons expressing a particular Dpr are often presynaptic to neurons expressing a DIP to which that Dpr binds in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). These findings suggested that Dpr-DIP interactions might be important for formation of synaptic circuits during brain and ventral nerve cord development.</p><p>In our earlier work, we examined the expression and function of DIP-γ and its binding partner Dpr11. Dpr11 is selectively expressed in ‘yellow’ R7 photoreceptors, which make the Rh4 rhodopsin, and DIP-γ is expressed in a subset of Dm8 amacrine neurons in the optic lobe medulla. Dm8s receive more synapses from R7 than any other neuron. DIP-γ is required for survival of the Dm8 neurons that express it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>). The fact that loss of DIP-γ causes loss of brain neurons that express these proteins suggests that DIP–Dpr interactions can transmit trophic signals. This does not appear to be the case for either DIP in the larval or adult neuromuscular system, however, since there are no missing motor neurons in <italic>DIP-γ</italic> or <italic>DIP-α</italic> mutants.</p><p>The expression patterns of DIP-γ and DIP-α suggest that they may be involved in similar processes during optic lobe development. In addition to yellow R7s, Dpr11 is expressed in a subset of motion-sensitive T4 and T5 neurons, which synapse onto large cells called Lobula Plate Tangential Cells (LPTCs). Dpr11-expressing T4 and T5 cells project to the layers 1 and 2 of the lobula plate, and DIP-γ is expressed in a small number of LPTCs that arborize in those layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>). In the optic lobe lamina, L3 and L5 neurons express Dprs 6 and 10, while L2 expresses only Dpr6. These L cells are synaptically connected to Dm4, Dm12, and Dm1 cells in the medulla, which express DIP-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Loss of DIP-α or of both Dprs 6 and 10 causes death of some Dm4 neurons and affects synaptic targeting of Dm12 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the larval neuromuscular system, however, the functions of DIP-γ appear to be very different from those of DIP-α. DIP-γ and Dpr11 are both expressed by most or all motor neurons. In <italic>DIP-γ</italic> and <italic>dpr11</italic> LOF mutants, there are no alterations in muscle targeting, but NMJs have phenotypes characterized by the presence of small clustered boutons called satellites. Retrograde BMP signaling is upregulated in these mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, DIP-α is expressed by only two motor neurons, and its interactions with Dpr10 expressed on muscles control formation and/or targeting of a specific set of interstitial axon branches.</p><p>The functions of DIP-α and Dpr10 appear to be conserved between the larval neuromuscular system and the adult leg neuromuscular system. The accompanying paper from Richard Mann’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Venkatasubramanian et al., 2019</xref>) shows that DIP-α is expressed in a subset of motor neurons that innervate specific leg muscles, while Dpr10 is expressed in muscles. In <italic>DIP-α</italic> and <italic>dpr10</italic> mutants, the axonal branches onto the muscles targeted by the DIP-α-expressing axons are absent. In summary, Dpr10 appears to be one of the long-sought targeting cues that direct recognition of specific muscle fibers as targets, while DIP-α is the corresponding receptor on the motor neurons that innervate these muscles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Egg laying chambers were setup with adult flies and grape juice plates (3% agar, 1.3% sucrose, 25% grape juice in water) and left in the dark at room temperature to lay eggs for 2 hr. Embryos were incubated overnight at 18°C, and then raised to 29°C for 2 hr to maximize GFP expression. Under a Zeiss V20 stereoscope with fluorescence, embryos were transferred to a microscope slide with double sided tape and staged using the autofluorescence and shape of the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bownes, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartenstein et al., 1987</xref>). Embryos were dechorionated on the double sided tape with a sharpened metal probe and transferred to a small agar slab. A dissection chamber was then prepared on Superfrost Plus slides (ThermoFisher #22-037-246) by outlining a rectangle with a PAP pen (Research Products International, #195506) to create a dissecting area. Embryos were transferred to a small piece of double sided tape placed into the dissection area, and then covered with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (0.01M Sodium Phosphate, 150 mM Sodium Chloride). Using a 0.1 mm electrolytically sharpened tungsten wire held in a pin vice, the embryos were carefully opened along their dorsal surface, and removed from the vitellin membrane. Dissected embryos were then trasferred to the adherent charged slide. When all embryos were dissected, the well was washed once with PBS, and then fixed for 1 hr at room temperature using 4% paraformaldehyde (20% paraformaldehyde solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) diluted into PBS). After fixation, samples were washed three times, 15 min each, in 0.05% PBST (PBS with 0.05% TritonX100), and then blocked for 1 hr in 5% normal goat serum (5% Goat serum in 0.05% PBST). Slides were incubated in primary antibody solutions overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber. Samples were then washed three times, 15 min each, with PBST, and incubated for two hours at room temperature with secondary antibodies. After incubation, samples were washed three times, 15 min each, with PBST and mounted in vectashield (Vector Laboratories).</p><p>Larval dissections were performed as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Menon et al., 2015</xref>).

All larval washes and antibody incubations were performed with mild agitation on a nutator.</p><p>For in vivo staining of larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>), we modified a previously described embryo protocol in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bali et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fox and Zinn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Supernatant from S2 cell culture containing the DIP-α-AP<sub>5</sub> fusion protein was concentrated 5-fold (Amicon Ultra-4 Filter Unit, 100 kDa cutoff). After larvae were dissected in sylgard dishes, the area surrounding each larva was patted dry with a Kimwipe.

Your article has been reviewed by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Durafshan Sakeena Syed (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Carillo, Zinn and others have previously characterized two groups of interacting immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion proteins, DIPs and dprs, and implicated them in synaptic development in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular and visual systems. Here, they provide an in-depth analysis of one pair in one system – DIP-α, expressed in a small group of larval motor neurons, and dpr10, expressed in a set of larval muscles. They analyze expression of the genes and localization of the proteins, then use genetic methods to demonstrate that interactions of DIP-α with dpr10 are required for specific connectivity of the DIP-α-expressing neurons with some of the dpr10-expressing muscles. The idea that pre- and postsynaptic cells express interacting adhesion molecules that play critical roles in the formation of a specific synaptic connection is a widely accepted dogma. Yet decisive evidence for this model is sparse. The importance of this paper is that it provides such compelling evidence. The paper is through, including detailed analysis of expression, documentation of global effects on connectivity in the relevant muscle group (some muscles gain inputs at the expense of those that lose it in mutants), proof that DIP-α acts pre- and dpr10 postsynaptically, and consideration of the stages and steps at which the critical interactions occur. It is well-illustrated, the results are thorough, if excessively, described, and the few caveats are considered and discussed in detail. Although the conclusion is not entirely novel, this really is a textbook demonstration of an extremely important concept in developmental neurobiology. Its publication will be important for the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following comments should be speedily addressed before acceptance. Comments 1-3: additional data, if available or speedily doable, will be welcome. Else, the points may simply be discussed.</p><p>1) DIP-α is expressed in only 2 out of the 35 MNs: MNISN-1s that innervates the dorsal muscles and MNSNb/d-1s that innervates the ventral muscles. How does the innervation pattern of MNSNb/d look like in DIP-α mutants?</p><p>2) Authors use DIP-α protein trap to reveal DIP-α localization in 1s boutons. Is it localized to boutons of all or specific muscle fibers? What is the expression profile of DIP-α during development? Is it localized to the growth cones or all over the axon during earlier stages?</p><p>3) Filopodia for most dorsal muscles are evident at earlier stages and later in the proximal ones (Figure 3). Are the boutons formed simultaneously in different muscle fibers or first in the dorsal-most? Does it imply that the branches are formed progressively from the distal-most region of an axon to the proximal end?</p><p>4) Authors mention that MNISN-1s innervates the dorsal muscles, the most distal of which is m1 (subsection “DIP-α does not control MNISN-1s axon guidance or defasciculation”), and at St15 MNISN-1s growth cone is visible in the m1/m2 target area (Figure 3). Later on, they show that MNISN-1s does not innervate m1 (Figure 4). If that is the case, then the growth cone visible at St15 might belong to m9 rather than m1, then it should be referred to as m2/m9 target area.</p><p>5) Authors show a differential effect on MNISN-1s innervation in DIP-α mutants. More dorsal muscles in the dorsal muscle field gain 1s branches, while more ventral muscles lose innervation. Among the dorsal-most muscles, m9 and m10 seem oblivious to DIP-α expression, while as m1 and m2 gain innervation. All these muscle fibers express Dpr10. Other dorsal-most muscles, that gain innervation are m11 and m18, do not express Dpr10. More ventral muscles (m3, 4, 19, 20) lose innervation; all these fibers express Dpr10.

There is also a bit of a conundrum here: It seems that considerable overexpression is required to detect the dpr10, yet it remains confined to synaptic sites even though one might expect that the sites would be saturated and excess dpr10 would be present extrasynaptically. Can the authors provide an explanation.</p><p>10) Figure 5E: Need a control (wild-type?) for the V5 staining.</p><p>11) The data is well documented, except in the case of Dpr10. In the Dpr10 case to identify its spatiotemporal expression authors use Dpr10-Gal4 reporter line only. This is surprising as this GAL4 line (like many others) may not fully reproduce endogenous gene expression. It is essential to use other tools (in situ hybridization if antibodies are not available) to show how Dpr10 is really expressed. Consequently, the validity of all author's comments related to Dpr10 expression and its correlation with that of DIP-α depends on this analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42690.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following comments should be speedily addressed before acceptance.

DIP-α seems to be continuously expressed throughout embryonic and larval development, based on our analysis of <italic>DIP-α</italic> gene trap and protein trap lines. In the current Figure 1 and Figure 3, we show three stages of development, and DIP-α is expressed at each stage.

To address this thoroughly, a detailed time-lapse analysis is required. This level of detail is beyond the scope of this manuscript, but to provide additional data to support our observations, we focused on st16/17 embryos and scored the appearance of motor neuron terminal ‘swellings’ in the distal vs. proximal muscle field.

Later on, they show that MNISN-1s does not innervate m1 (Figure 4). If that is the case, then the growth cone visible at St15 might belong to m9 rather than m1, then it should be referred to as m2/m9 target area.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. However, when selecting a representative image to include in Figure 4, it was very difficult to obtain an MNISN-1s that has the perfect innervation pattern. m1 is innervated infrequently by MNISN-1s (Figure 4C) so the growth cone in Figure 3 could be m1/m2 or m2/m9. We prefer to keep the m1/m2 designation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Authors show a differential effect on MNISN-1s innervation in DIP-α mutants.

The 1B ending is present but we did not label it. We have updated this Figure with the appropriate labels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Subsection “Dpr10 is able to bind DIP-α in tissue”: Presumably lack of staining in wild-types reflects limited sensitivity of the DIP-α-AP probe but this should be made explicit, along with some estimate of the degree of overexpression needed for detection. There is also a bit of a conundrum here: It seems that considerable overexpression is required to detect the dpr10, yet it remains confined to synaptic sites even though one might expect that the sites would be saturated and excess dpr10 would be present extrasynaptically. Can the authors provide an explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>Dpr10-V5 seems to be targeted specifically to the postsynapse based on anti-V5 immunohistochemistry (Figure 5E) and the DIP-α-AP probe (Figure 5G). We observe minimal extrasynaptic Dpr10 upon overexpression. There are several reasons why this may be the case. First, the extent of overexpression may not be sufficient to saturate the postsynaptic site. Also, staining with anti-V5 is more sensitive than the DIP-α-AP probe so any extrasynaptic Dpr10-V5 would more likely be detectable with anti-V5; however, we do not observe this (Figure 5E). Thus, if excess Dpr10 does not localize properly to the postsynapse, it may be degraded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 5E: Need a control (wild-type?) for the V5 staining.</p></disp-quote><p>This was an oversight on our part, as the anti-V5 labeling in control animals is almost nonexistent. This is now included in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B (subsection “Expression of DIP-α binding partners, Dpr6 and Dpr10, in the neuromuscular system”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The data is well documented, except in the case of Dpr10. In the Dpr10 case to identify its spatiotemporal expression authors use Dpr10-Gal4 reporter line only. This is surprising as this GAL4 line (like many others) may not fully reproduce endogenous gene expression. It is essential to use other tools (in situ hybridization if antibodies are not available) to show how Dpr10 is really expressed. Consequently, the validity of all author's comments related to Dpr10 expression and its correlation with that of DIP-α depends on this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that many GAL4 lines do not recapitulate endogenous gene expression. However, the <italic>dpr10-T2A-GAL4</italic> line that we utilize is a direct gene trap insertion within a <italic>dpr10</italic> coding intron derived from a MiMIC insertion (see Venken et al., 2011; Diao et al., 2015). In T2A-<italic>GAL4</italic> lines in coding introns, GAL4 can only be expressed when translation of the gene product (Dpr10, in this case) is initiated from its normal ATG. The T2A-<italic>GAL4</italic> insertion element is aberrantly spliced into the <italic>dpr10</italic> transcript due to the strong splice acceptor in the element. This hybrid <italic>dpr10</italic> transcript is then translated from the normal Dpr10 ATG to the T2A element, which then directs ribosome skipping and reinitiation, so as to generate GAL4. Therefore, GAL4 will be made under control of all endogenous <italic>dpr10</italic> transcriptional control elements, and will only be produced when Dpr10 translation is initiated from the normal ATG. It should therefore accurately reflect normal Dpr10 protein expression, except for three issues: (1) the reporter will not display the same subcellular localization as the protein; (2) there will be a delay caused by the time required for GAL4 to activate reporter expression and for reporter to be translated; (3) the reporter will not be subject to any post-translational control of Dpr10 expression, such as protein degradation, so it may have a different lifetime than normal Dpr10. In situ hybridization experiments could provide information about <italic>dpr10</italic> mRNA expression, but they would not add anything to the conclusions we can draw from the GAL4 reporter. In situs report the presence of RNA, which does not necessarily represent protein expression, so they provide less information than T2A-<italic>GAL4</italic> reporters. A better experiment, as the reviewer suggests, would be immunohistochemistry with a Dpr10 antibody. However, since this antibody is a polyclonal mouse antibody (see Xu et al., 2018), we were only able to obtain a very small quantity from the Zipursky lab. We have not utilized this antibody for embryo immunohistochemistry so some optimization is required to obtain reproducible data. Also, the detailed developmental studies (Figure 7) will require many samples at several embryonic stages to accurately depict Dpr10 temporal expression, and the antibody may not be sufficient. We hope that this explanation is sufficient to address the reviewers concerns.</p></body></sub-article></article>
