surface molecules that enable discrimination between cells from the same and from a different kind. Here, we investigate the role of Flo11-type cell surface adhesins from social yeasts in kin discrimination. We measure the adhesion forces mediated by Flo11A-type domains using single-cell force spectroscopy, quantify Flo11A-based cell aggregation in populations and determine the Flo11A-dependent segregation of competing yeast strains in biofilms. We find that Flo11A domains from diverse yeast species confer remarkably strong adhesion forces by establishing homotypic interactions between single cells, leading to efficient cell aggregation and biofilm formation in homogenous populations. Heterotypic interactions between Flo11A domains from different yeast species or <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains confer weak adhesive forces and lead to efficient strain segregation in heterogenous populations, indicating that in social yeasts Flo11A-mediated cell adhesion is a major mechanism for kin discrimination at species and sub-species levels. These findings, together with our structure and mutation analysis of selected Flo11A domains, provide a rationale of how cell surface receptors have evolved in microorganisms to mediate kin discrimination.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kin discrimination</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>biofilm</kwd><kwd>Flo11 flocculin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 987</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mösch</surname><given-names>Hans-Ulrich</given-names></name><name><surname>Brückner</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Kraushaar</surname><given-names>Timo</given-names></name><name><surname>Hartmann</surname><given-names>Raimo</given-names></name><name><surname>Jelli</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoffmann</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Drescher</surname><given-names>Knut</given-names></name><name><surname>Oliver Essen, University of Marburg</surname><given-names>Lars</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartmann</surname><given-names>Raimo</given-names></name><name><surname>Jelli</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><name><surname>Drescher</surname><given-names>Knut</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural, biophysical and physiological analysis reveals how yeast cell surface adhesins evolved to confer self-nonself discrimination in single cells and whole populations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For organisms living in communities, the ability to discriminate between kin and non-kin is fundamental for enabling close relatives to form groups with beneficial social interactions, and for preventing invasion of these groups by social cheaters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Michod, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Strassmann and Queller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wall, 2016</xref>).

The precise molecular and structural basis underlying the evolution of kin discrimination, however, is largely unexplored. In social amoebae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirose et al., 2011</xref>), bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pathak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao and Wall, 2017</xref>), and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kraushaar et al., 2015</xref>), cell surface adhesins have been suggested to confer kin discrimination by mediating adhesion between cells using either homotypic or heterotypic interactions. Homotypically acting adhesins appear to be particularly suited for kin discrimination, because they depend on only one gene and therefore always select for interaction partners that carry the exact same gene. The key question of how exactly cell surface adhesins can evolve at the structural level to permit diversification without compromising the ability to confer homotypic interaction has not yet been fully addressed.</p><p>Yeasts are ideal models to study the evolution of adhesin-based kin discrimination, because they are genetically tractable and harbor a family of cell surface adhesins that confer mating of sexual cells, the formation of social aggregates and the colonization of hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dranginis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brückner and Mösch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Groot et al., 2013</xref>). Flo11-type adhesins are of interest in the context of kin discrimination, because Flo11 from the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (ScFlo11) confers cell aggregation by homotypic protein-protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goossens and Willaert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kraushaar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barua et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, Flo11 confers the formation of diverse multicellular growth forms representing cooperative communities including biofilms, invasive filaments or adhesive aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lo and Dranginis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cullen and Sprague, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reynolds and Fink, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chow et al., 2019</xref>). It has also been shown that this adhesin confers competitive advantages through cell differentiation in clonal biofilms and might lead to kin discrimination in mixed populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Regenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oppler et al., 2019</xref>).

For this purpose, we developed novel methods to (i) measure the adhesion forces between individual Flo11A-presenting yeast cells by atomic force microscope (AFM)-based single cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benoit et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krieg et al., 2008</xref>), (ii) determine the efficiency of Flo11A-mediated cell aggregation using microscopy-based quantification of large numbers of cell aggregates, and (iii) quantify the Flo11A-dependent segregation of competing yeast strains in heterogenous biofilms. Our study shows that Flo11A domains from a variety of different yeast species confer efficient cell aggregation by facilitating homotypic interactions. The structural and mutational analysis of different Flo11A domains demonstrates that homotypic Flo11A-Flo11A interactions depend on evolutionary conserved aromatic residues, which form two bands at the Flo11A surface. Finally, we observe that heterotypic interactions between Flo11A domains from different yeast species or <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains confer weak adhesion forces and efficient strain separation, suggesting that in social yeasts Flo11A-mediated adhesion is employed for kin discrimination at species and sub-species levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The capacity of Flo11A domains for cellular adhesion is highly conserved in Saccharomycetales</title><p>We wanted to determine whether the capacity of Flo11-type proteins to confer cellular adhesion is not only found in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, but also in other yeast species. In addition, we were interested in functional diversity of Flo11A domains within the species of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. For this purpose, we constructed an evolutionary tree, which is based on 16 sequences from 11 different yeast species within the order of Saccharomycetales and on Flo11A sequences from 52 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The analysis revealed that Flo11A domains displayed a high degree of sequence variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Flo11A alleles were well separated from Flo11 variants of other Saccharomycetales with the exception of <italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic>, a non-domesticated <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> species and closest relative of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boynton and Greig, 2014</xref>).

For measuring adhesion forces between two yeast cells, we advanced existing SCFS protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Specifically, single yeast cells presenting ScFlo11A were attached on a cantilever (probe cell) and on a glass surface (target cell). The adhesion forces were determined by bringing both cells into contact and applying a force of 1 nN for varying time periods followed by the retraction of the probe from the target cell until both cells separated abruptly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). We found an average maximal adhesion force (F<sub>max</sub>) between both ScFlo11A-presenting cells of 13.4 nN, whereas the adhesion forces between ScFlo11A-presenting and non-presenting cells ranged significantly lower by almost an order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, the strength of cell-cell adhesion force is high if both cells carry the ScFlo11A domain. Kinetic cell-cell adhesion measurements using increasing contact times ranging from 0.5 s to 20 s confirm this finding and reveal that adhesion forces between Flo11-presenting cells are established within the first second of cell-cell contact and steadily increase up to 20 s contact time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). F<sub>max</sub> values produced by contact times exceeding 20 s could not be reliably assayed, because the probe cells were repeatedly torn from the cantilever. This indicates that the adhesion forces established by homophilic ScFlo11A-ScFlo11A interactions considerably exceed 13.4 nN.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Quantification of Flo11-mediated cell adhesion forces.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Outline of a single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) experiment (upper scheme).

We next tested heterotypic cell-cell interactions using KpFlo11A and ScFlo11A, showing clearly reduced F<sub>max</sub> values in comparison to the homotypic configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, we measured homotypic and heterotypic interactions using Flo11A from <italic>C. lusitaniae</italic> (ClFlo11A), a further variant from the family of Metschnikowiaceae that shows only 29% identity to ScFlo11A and 38% identity to KpFlo11A. This analysis showed that in the homotypic configuration ClFlo11A confers a cell-cell adhesion comparable to the other two variants, but clearly discriminates in heterotypic situations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In order to test, whether Flo11A is able to confer allele-specific discrimination in heterogeneous populations (groups of genetically diverse cells), we performed competitive biofilm assays with yeast strains expressing no Flo11A, ScFlo11A, KpFlo11A or ClFlo11A, respectively, and different fluorescent markers (GFP or RFP) for genotypic tracking, in all possible combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Here, we found significant differences between homotypic (single Flo11A variant) and heterotypic (two different Flo11A variants) biofilms with respect to the ratio of the Flo11A expressing strains at the outer edge. In all homotypic biofilms, this ratio was found to be very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and the sectoring observed indicates genetic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hallatschek et al., 2007</xref>). This demonstrates that strains expressing the same Flo11A variant and differing only in the fluorescent marker are both present in significant amounts at the outer biofilm edge and do not efficiently outcompete each other. In contrast, the ratio between strains expressing different Flo11A variants (heterotypic biofilms) was found to be significantly higher showing that one allele outcompetes the other and monopolizes the outer edge of the expanding biofilm. This indicates that heterogenous Flo11A alleles are able to discriminate against each other in heterogeneous populations. This conclusion is supported by the finding that in all heterotypic biofilms one of the alleles clearly dominates the biofilm with respect to its relative presence within the whole area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>).

We also tested the role of the Σ-insert in mediating sub-species kin discrimination. For this purpose, we introduced the Σ-insert into ScFlo11A creating the hybrid variant ScFlo11A<sup>Σins</sup>.

By employing biophysical (SCFS), cell aggregation (QCAM) measurements and competitive biofilm assays, we demonstrate that Flo11-type domains from diverse yeasts confer efficient cell-cell adhesion at single cell level and in populations in homotypic configurations and are able to efficiently discriminate between kin and non-kin variants in heterotypic situations in vivo. Our high-resolution structural analysis shows that the core and aromatic surface patterns of highly divergent Flo11A domains are similar, and our in vitro functional analysis demonstrates that different Flo11A variants discriminate between homophilic and heterophilic interactions. <italic>FLO11</italic>-type domains thus fulfill important criteria for single greenbeard genes, which confer benefits by homophilic interactions to cells or organisms that carry this allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamilton, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dawkins, 1976</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, the Flo11A-type domain represents the first example for a fungal adhesin, which is able to mediate kin discrimination by homophilic interaction at both species and sub-species level. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, another type of cell surface adhesion domain, the PA14/Flo5 domain, has been demonstrated to confer kin discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smukalla et al., 2008</xref>). However, this type of domain confers cell-cell adhesion by heterotypic interaction with mannan oligosaccharide chains present on the surface of neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Veelders et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the PA14/Flo5 domain mediates kin discrimination more indirectly, because two-way bonding between two cells bearing the domain is stronger than one-way bonding between a cell exposing the domain and a cell that lacks it. This mode of discrimination is different from homophilic interactions between identical Flo11A domains, which must be present on the surface of both interacting cells.</p><p>In another social microbe, the cell adhesion gene <italic>csaA</italic> of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> has been discussed to confer greenbeard recognition by homotypic interaction between bearing cells. However, <italic>csaA</italic> is not considered to confer kin discrimination in nature due to the lack of significant variability across natural clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Queller et al., 2003</xref>). More recent studies suggest that in social amoebae kin discrimination is conferred by the polymorphic proteins TgrB1 and TgrC1, which are thought to function as a heterotypic ligand-receptor pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirose et al., 2011</xref>). In social bacteria, the TraA protein of <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> is a polymorphic cell surface adhesin that confers kin discrimination by homotypic interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao and Wall, 2017</xref>). In contrast to our study, however, neither biophysical single cell analysis nor high-resolution structure-function relationships have been performed with these microbial kin discriminatory molecules.</p><p>A central outcome of our SCFS-based study are quantitative in vivo measurements of adhesion between two cells expressing fungal adhesins of both heterophilic and homophilic pairs. The Flo11A domain in certain yeast species confers adhesion forces of &gt;25 nN between two cells after only 20 s contact time. This adhesion force is considerably higher than the adhesion forces measured between mammalian cells at similar contact times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krieg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kragl et al., 2016</xref>). Our quantitative SCFS assay in combination with structural and genetic approaches provides novel insights into how individual amino acids of the Flo11A domains contribute to cell−cell recognition and to the formation and strengthening of cell−cell adhesion at the single cell level. This approach provided previously unseen mechanistic insights at the single cell level of how Flo11A domains contribute to partner selection and discrimination through differential cell−cell adhesion over time. Furthermore, the quantitative SCFS data correlates with the phenotypes observed in homogeneous populations as analyzed by QCAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, adhesion forces between cells determine macroscopic aggregate sizes.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Correlation between SCFS and QCAM data.</title><p>Correlation between maximum adhesion forces obtained by SCFS analysis and total aggregate areas obtained by QCAM analysis was calculated by Spearman's rank correlation test.

In our previous work with ScFlo11A, we presented a model suggesting that Flo11A domains confer cell-cell adhesion by hydrophobin-like interactions via aromatic surface residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kraushaar et al., 2015</xref>). Our current study with several diverse Flo11A variants supports and further refines this model. First, the systematic mutational analysis of ScFlo11A clearly emphasizes the crucial importance of conserved aromatic residues for homotypic interactions and suggests their general functional relevance in other Flo11-type domains. Secondly, our study strongly suggests that in contrast to unspecific hydrophobins, Flo11A domains interact with each other in a much more specific manner. This conclusion is based on the significant differences that we observe when comparing (i) homotypic with heterotypic single cell-cell interactions and (ii) homophilic with heterophilic protein-protein interactions. Our comparative structural analysis further indicates that the precise topology of the aromatic surface residues might be an important feature for molecular discrimination. This notion is based on the finding that the ScFlo11A and KpFlo11A surface structures are highly divergent with the exception of multiple aromatic residues, which are arranged in a similar but not identical configuration. Moreover, even variants with nearly identical aromatic surface topologies, such as ScFlo11A and Sc<sup>Σ</sup>Flo11A, can clearly discriminate between each other, given that a further surface feature is added, as exemplified by the Σ-specific insert.</p><p>An important question concerning the mechanism, by which homophilically interacting proteins are able to confer discrimination, addresses the contribution of molecular <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-interactions. In mammalian tissues and organs, teneurins, cadherins and nectins are well-studied adhesion molecules that confer homophilic and heterophilic cell-cell interactions by <italic>cis</italic>-clustering and <italic>trans</italic>-interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rikitake et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gul et al., 2017</xref>). For protocadherins, a specialized family of cadherins, structural and functional as well as biophysical investigations have recently shown that these multi-domain cell-surface proteins confer neuronal self-recognition involving separate domains for <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rubinstein et al., 2015</xref>). Whether Flo11-mediated kin discrimination involves both <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-interacting molecules cannot be unambiguously answered yet. However, previous data suggests that Flo11-mediated cell-cell adhesion involves <italic>trans</italic>-interactions of collectives of Flo11 molecules formed by <italic>cis</italic>-clustering, rather than multiple bimolecular <italic>trans</italic>-interactions of Flo11 adhesins that do not interact in cis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Here, our previous ultrastructural analysis of Flo11-Flo11 contact sites support the view that Flo11 proteins form co-aligned fibers at the cell surface by clustering of Flo11 molecules in cis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kraushaar et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the formation of such clusters could be mediated by <italic>cis</italic>-interaction of Flo11B domains via beta-aggregation-prone amyloid-forming sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ramsook et al., 2010</xref>). Our SCFS analysis with mutated Flo11 variants also supports the view that tethering of Flo11 into collectives by <italic>cis</italic>-interactions might precede <italic>trans</italic>-interactions. Here, we found that Flo11 variants that carry mutations in either aromatic band I (I) or band II (II) are only partially abrogated for single cell-cell adhesion in homotypic configurations, whereas a complete loss of adhesion is observed in heterotypic measurements. This finding supports a model, in which productive adhesive forces can be achieved by either I-I or II-II <italic>trans</italic>-interactions, but they do not support the occurrence of I-II interactions. This further implies that Flo11 molecules must be tethered in cis before either I-I or II-II <italic>trans</italic>-interactions take place, given that a free choice between I-I or II-II would be assumed in the case of only bimolecular <italic>trans</italic>-interactions, which is not in agreement with the complete loss of adhesive forces observed in the heterotypic situation. However, because our localization of Flo11 on the cell surface appears to be evenly distributed, other models for Flo11-Flo11 <italic>cis-</italic> and/or <italic>trans-</italic>interactions are conceivable and need to be tested in the future.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for kin discrimination by Flo11.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural elements for Flo11-directed discrimination.

A number of studies using diverse microbial systems have addressed the question of how cellular interactions affect the spatial structure, cooperation and competition in biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nadell et al., 2016</xref>). Our analysis of biofilm development indicates that in contrast to the formation of multicellular aggregates, the efficiency of biofilm formation as measured by the total size does not necessarily correlate with cell-cell adhesion forces. This is exemplified by comparing the properties of ScFlo11 and ClFlo11 adhesion domains in non-competitive situations. Here, ScFlo11A confers roughly 1.4-fold higher cell-cell adhesion forces, but on average leads to 1.8-fold lower biofilm sizes, when compared to ClFlo11A. This apparent discrepancy could be explained by postulating significant differences in cell-substrate adhesion conferred by these Flo11A variants. In other words, ClFlo11A might be able to interact with the substrate much more efficiently than ScFlo11A and thereby confer a significantly better spreading of the growing biofilm. It remains to be elucidated, whether and how different Flo11A variants confer adhesion to different substrate surfaces. Here, our study has provided sophisticated techniques, which might turn out to be useful for detailed analysis of cell-substrate adhesion forces at single cell level. Our study also allows to correlate cell-cell adhesion forces conferred by Flo11A domains with their ability to confer dominance in competitive situations such as mixed biofilms. Previous theoretical and experimental work has suggested that adhesion can act as an important weapon in microbial competition by demonstrating that highly adhesive bacterial cells can outcompete less adhesive cells in growing biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schluter et al., 2015</xref>). Our study also reveals that strong adhesion can correlate with dominance against less adhesive cells. This is exemplified by the Sc<sup>Σ</sup>Flo11A variant, which in competitive assays dominates against all other Flo11 variants tested and confers roughly 2-fold higher cell-cell adhesion forces in comparison to its competitors. When comparing ScFlo11A with KpFlo11A, however, our study reveals a clear dominance of KpFlo11A, although ScFlo11A confers roughly 1.5-fold higher cell-cell adhesion forces. Moreover, both variants produce biofilms of comparable sizes indicating that cell-substrate adhesion forces are comparable. Thus, one might speculate that competition forces other than cell adhesion could be involved in conferring dominance, but such forces are difficult to conceive, because our experimental setup is based on yeast strains that genetically differ only by the two Flo11 adhesion domains. We could rather imagine that the biophysical and adhesion properties of these two variants, which share only 32% identity, are differentially affected by changing microenvironments within growing biofilms. Unfortunately, however, quantification of individual cell-cell or cell-substrate adhesion forces in growing biofilms by AFM-based methods is currently not feasible.</p><p>Finally, our study has revealed that the function of Flo11-type proteins in conferring kin-directed cell-cell aggregation and discrimination can be observed in several families of Saccharomycetales. Thus, the importance of these adhesins for building multicellular consortia for kin-directed protection or other types of cooperative interaction appears to be conserved. Moreover, our study suggests that Flo11-directed kin discrimination could be accomplished at sub-species level by a single genetic event, as exemplified by the Σ-insert. Our finding that variants carrying this insert are present only in the 'Sake' lineage of non-mosaic <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains, further opens the possibility that Σ-like sub-domains originate from the domestication of sake yeast strains. However, it remains to be elucidated whether the observed sub-species discrimination is indeed the result of a selective process.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

The resulting 8bit greyscale pictures were used for segmentation and quantification of the individual signals. The distribution of RFP and GFP signals was analyzed using the Matlab software (MathWorks) using he following procedure: (i) the colony edge was obtained by fusing the fluorescent signals into a gray level image and expanding the brightest region by iteratively using Otsu’s threshold algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Otsu, 1979</xref>); (ii) prior to the comparison, the fluorescent channels were normalized to discount for the auto-fluorescence of the medium and the different magnitudes in the GFP and RFP fluorescence; (iii) the relative abundance was given by the ratio of pixels that exhibit a RFP signal higher than the GFP signal within the whole colony as well as along a line in distance of 50 pixels to the colony edge to all pixels along the same line. For quantification of the genotypic ratio at the outer edge of biofilm, the amount of the signal produced by the superior strain was divided by the amount of the signal from the inferior strain.

Clumped cells were then mechanically dissociated under a bench-top microscope (Nikon Instruments, Egg, Switzerland), using patch pipettes with a resistance of 10 MΩ mounted on a micromanipulator (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA). Patch pipettes were pulled on a P-97 Flaming/Brown pipette puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA) using Sutter glass capillaries with 1 mm outer and 0.5 mm inner diameter and subsequently flame-blunted using a Bunsen burner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging was used to monitor cellular morphology. Prior to use, each NPO-010 tip-less AFM cantilever (Bruker AFM Probes, Camarillo, CA, USA) was calibrated three times using thermal noise to eliminate errors. Spring constants were within 10% of the nominal value (~60 mN/m). Plasma-activated cantilevers were incubated with 2.5 mg/ml Concanavalin A (ConA; Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) overnight at 4°C and carefully rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schubert et al., 2014</xref>). All yeast cell adhesion experiments were carried out in YEPD media on 35 mm glass bottom petri dishes (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) carrying the appropriate target cell type. All SCFS measurements were carried out at 30°C using a Petri dish heater (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany). Probe cells were obtained by gently pressing a ConA-coated cantilever onto appropriate cells and applying a force of approximately 2 nN for 3 s, followed by lifting the cantilever for 10 min to obtain firm cell attachment. For subsequent cell-cell adhesion experiments, probe cells on the cantilever were moved above target cells fixed by ConA on the surface of 35 mm glass bottom Petri dishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kragl et al., 2016</xref>). Cell-cell adhesion was measured by applying a contact force of 1 nN for 0.5 s to 20 s and employing approach and retraction velocities of 5 μm/s. For a given cell-cell couple, the contact time was varied randomly to prevent systematic bias or history effects. Each force-distance curve measuring the adhesion between probe and target cells was repeated several times: 1 s contact time, five repetitions; 10 s contact time, three repetitions; 20 s contact time, two repetitions. A resting time of 30 s was given between recording each force-distance curve. Individual probe cells were tested against multiple target-cells. One force-distance curve was determined with any given probe cell. Cells were continuously monitored during the SCFS experiment to assure intact and stable association with the cantilever and the substrate. Force-distance curves were analyzed using the JPK analysis software to extract maximum adhesion forces (F<sub>max</sub>). Statistical analysis for calculation of average F<sub>max</sub> values at different time points was performed using the Prism software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantification of Flo11A proteins at the cell surface</title><p>Prior to adhesive growth assays, QCAM analysis and AFM measurements, the amount of Flo11A variants at the cell surface of yeast strains was quantified by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) using polyclonal anti-ScFlo11A antibodies following protocols described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Veelders et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kraushaar et al., 2015</xref>) or a monoclonal anti-STREP II antibodies (Chromeo 488, IBA, Göttingen, Germany).

their relatedness. Kin discrimination could help biological systems to direct cooperative behaviour towards their relatives.

This mechanism is based on the Flo11-type adhesins that can be highly diverse. They demonstrate that in vivo Flo11-type adhesion domains from different or even the same yeast species confer efficient cell-cell adhesion at single cell and population level in homotypic configurations and are able to efficiently discriminate between kin and non-kin variants in heterotypic situations.</p><p>The manuscript reports novel aspects and in particular describes the discovery of a novel mechanism of kin discrimination in eukaryotes; in fact a novel kin discrimination molecule was discovered.

Structural data based on x-ray and biochemical analyses show that the core and aromatic surface patterns of highly divergent Flo11A domains are similar, but not identical.</p><p>I was wondering how much the current data advance the field compared to the previous paper (Structure, 2015) of the group where the crystal structure of the N-terminal Flo11A domain was already determined. I feel that the current manuscript includes novel aspects and in particular also describes very interesting novel findings concerning the kin discrimination in a fungus.</p><p>In general, the findings are very interesting and give novel insight in the mechanisms of kin discrimination in eukaryotes; in fact a novel kin discrimination molecule was discovered. The findings were obtained by the use of sophisticated methods like single cell force microscopy. I believe the manuscript describes novel, far-reaching findings.</p><p>Although the measurements of the adhesion between single cells is convincing, an important factor was neglected. How many Flo11A molecules are present on the surface of the different yeasts? Also, what is the number of recombinant proteins on the surface of yeast expressing Flo11A derivatives on their surface? In my opinion, the adhesion force depends on hydrogen bonds but also on the number of surface molecules providing these hydrogen bonds. It cannot be excluded that the kin recognition depends more on the number of surface molecules that might be different in the different yeast strains rather than the direct adhesion force per molecule. Because the difference in adhesion force between homophilic and heterophilic configurations is at best a factor of 10, this point needs further experimental clarification, e.g., by labeling Flo11A with GFP and measuring the overall fluorescence intensity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, Brückner and co-authors investigated how yeast use the Flo11-type adhesin to mediate kin discrimination through homotypic interactions. There are several major findings including:</p><p>i) A reinforced and refined model of Flo11 homotypic interactions built from their prior work (Kraushaar et al., 2015), which incorporates new approaches, such as SCFS and QCAM. These approaches can be widely used to study other adhesins and biofilm-forming microbes.</p><p>ii) Through experimental analysis of Flo11A from 4 yeast strains that belong to 3 different species, they suggest that the Flo11A domains mediate selective cell-cell adhesion in social yeasts.</p><p>iii) They solved the crystal structure of a divergent Flo11A allele from <italic>K. pastoris</italic> to 1.4 angstroms and show that it's structure very similar to Flo11A from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>Overall, the work is nicely done and presented. However, one major shortcoming is that this study did not fully explain how discrimination between Flo11A alleles is achieved at the molecular/structural level, a key question they asked (Introduction). Nevertheless, they do show that aromatic bands I and II along with a 15 AA insert play important roles in homotypic discrimination between receptors. How this insert provides specificity and how prevalent it is in nature remains unclear.</p><p>The authors describe Flo11 as a greenbeard gene involved in kin discrimination, but they do not directly show this. To do so, isogeneic strains with different Flo11 alleles should be mixed together and tested whether discrimination actually occurs, i.e. the strains partition into distinct social groups.</p><p>Discussion section. The authors argue that Flo11 forms cell surface clusters that are driven by cis interactions between receptors. If this is true then clusters of Flo11 should be seen by IF, but instead the receptors are found to be evenly distributed around the cell surface (Figure 2—figure supplement B). This point should be considered and explained.</p><p>Western blot analysis are needed to confirm that the Flo11A mutant phenotypes (e.g. Figure 3B and C) are not caused by unstable mutant proteins.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Cell adhesion is critically important for microbial cells to form biofilms/mats, to cooperate, and to undergo a wide variety of specialized behaviors. Understanding how cell adhesion leads to regulated interactions among microbial cells can provide insight into 'social' responses among individuals and the overall regulation of microbial responses. It has previously been shown in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and yeast that cell adhesion molecules can act as 'green beard genes' that foster interactions among like individuals (kin discrimination) through homotypic interactions. Furthermore, such interactions among cells in the exterior of a biofilm can protect cells in the interior from toxins.</p><p>The study identifies the region and critical residues on Flo11p that confer the attribute of kin discrimination to various yeast cells. The authors showed that: (1) the Flo11A domain is necessary for homotypic interactions and (2) various A domains from Flo11p homologs have stronger homotypic interactions than heterotypic interactions with different A domains. The authors also identify the critical aromatic residues within the Flo11A domain that are critical for aggregation. The approaches are novel (force microscopy) and robust (protein crystallography), and the findings have merit. However, the study does not go far enough in parts to support the central hypothesis put forward in the title and in many other places in the paper that speak to &quot;Kin discrimination in social yeast&quot;. The authors may be able to address this issue by setting up corresponding assays to measure cellular interactions between strains expressing different Flo11 versions in vivo and also by establishing competition assays. Such information will complement the strong biochemical and biophysical data and allow the authors to properly interpret aspects of microbial interactions. More specific concerns and questions follow below:</p><p>1) Assays like the force measurement technique, which is quite novel and which was used to quantitate the strength of interactions, does not in itself demonstrate social interactions. This leads to problems. For example, the F<sub>max</sub> required to separate cells with or without the Flo11A domain shows a range of 2 to 15 nN. Though the difference is shown to be statistically significant, there is little to suggest that it is also biologically relevant. What natural situations would a yeast find itself in where a force difference of 13 nN would matter to it? What natural environments do yeast exist in between 2 and 15 nN where this difference in affinity would presumably be relevant? Additionally, the authors attempt to categorize the experimental system as &quot;in vivo&quot; though the natural context of this type of interaction is not clear.

The reviewers agree with each other that you have submitted a strong manuscript describing very interesting findings. This resubmitted version has improved considerably. However, there remain some questions that we ask you to address.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The interpretation of the results of the biofilm experiments is not clear. Many papers in yeast and bacteria have explored the topic using fluorescently labeled cells, and it is unclear whether you are taking all this information into account when interpreting your data. For example, in Figure 5, the biofilms have different sizes. Please take biofilm size into account for your analysis.</p><p>2) Measuring the fluorescence at the outer edge might not be the best way to measure success in biofilm populations. For example, cells 'trapped' in the middle may have an advantage being protected from the external environment. How about measuring the ratio of total fluorescence of the two signals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript is a resubmission of a previously submitted manuscript (2018) that was. It deals with Kin discrimination, broadly defined as differential treatment of conspecifics according to their relatedness. Kin discrimination could help biological systems to direct cooperative behaviour towards their relatives. In general, the question addressed is of broad relevance for all species.</p><p>In bacteria, social amoebae and yeast, cell surface adhesins have been suggested to confer kin discrimination by mediating adhesion between cells using either homotypic or heterotypic interactions, but the precise molecular and structural basis underlying the evolution of kin discrimination is largely unexplored.</p><p>In the current manuscript, the authors provide evidence that the Flo11-type adhesins of diverse social yeasts define kin discrimination. The authors demonstrate that in vivo Flo11-type adhesion domains from different or even the same yeast species confer efficient cell-cell adhesion at single cell and population level in homotypic configurations and are able to efficiently discriminate between kin and non-kin variants in heterotypic situations. Structural data based on x-ray and biochemical analyses show that the core and aromatic surface patterns of highly divergent Flo11A domains are similar, but not identical.</p><p>The current manuscript is very well written, the figures are of high quality. The manuscript includes novel aspects and in particular also describes very interesting novel findings concerning the kin discrimination in a fungus. As I wrote in my previous review, in general the findings are very interesting and give novel insight in the mechanisms of kin discrimination in eukaryotes; in fact, a novel kin discrimination molecule was discovered. The findings were obtained by the use of sophisticated methods like single cell force microscopy. I believe the manuscript describes novel, far-reaching findings.</p><p>The questions raised by myself in the last version of the manuscript were all well answered experimentally.</p><p>Specifically, the authors determined the number of Flo11A molecules present on the surface of the different yeast strains. This also included determination of the number of recombinant proteins on the surface of strains expressing Flo11A derivatives on their surface. The difference in numbers was less than 20%. Therefore, the conclusion of the authors based on differences in adhesion force (differences up to a factor of 10) between homophilic and heterophilic configurations is justified.</p><p>Also, the authors now provided in vivo competition assays addressing the behaviour of mixed populations expressing heterogenous Flo11 variants. For this purpose, the authors generated a set of isogenic yeast strains expressing Flo11 variants from different species/subspecies and different fluorescent markers (GFP or RFP) for genotypic tracking. This novel data was included as a new Figure 5 and shows significant differences between homotypic (single Flo11A variant) and heterotypic (two different Flo11A variants) biofilms with respect to the ratio of the Flo11A expressing strains at the outer edge of the growing biofilms.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In their revised manuscript Bruckner et al. have done a thorough job addressing prior reviewer concerns. In particular they developed a new fitness assay to investigate the role of the Flo11 cell surface receptor in kin recognition. This assay clearly shows that homotypic interactions between receptors provides a fitness advantage for growth at the leading edge of an expanding colony. With isogenic strains, the assay also shows that particular Flo11 alleles have stronger fitness gains than other. As I commented in my prior review, this is a very nice study that provides structural and mechanistic insight into kin recognition in microbes. I have no other concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Understanding cell adhesion is important for the study of many aspects of biological systems. Cell adhesion in microbial species is important for social organization, and in pathogens, virulence. Pioneering discoveries in yeast, <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, and other organisms have shown that homotypic interactions of adhesion molecules promote social cooperation. In yeast, Flo11 is the major adhesion molecule and a representative adhesion protein to study fungal cell adhesion, particularly during invasive growth and biofilm formation in yeast. Pioneering studies by the Fink lab, and more recently biochemical and biophysical studies by the Mosch lab, have defined the structural basis of adhesion of this molecule. In this study, the authors develop new tools to study Flo11 adhesion, including exploring the differences of Flo11 across species, measurement of adhesion forces using single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS), and quantitative cell aggregation microscopy (QCAM). They conclude that changes in the Flo11 protein in part lead to refinement of social cooperation within species and among closely related species. Overall, this is an important study and would be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The authors demonstrate that Flo11's A domain from different species can function in adhesion. They go on to show that Flo11's A domain promotes species-specific adhesion across several species. This result involved obtaining the crystal structure of Flo11 from Kp and comparing it to their previous structure in Sc. The authors go on to explore other features of the Flo11 protein, including an insertion loop, and develop two-fluorescent biofilm assays to examine competition between strains expressing Flo11 variants. The study is an interesting intersection between structural biology and evolutionary/competition biology.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, the findings are very interesting and allow for novel insight in the mechanisms of kin discrimination in eukaryotes; in fact, a novel kin discrimination molecule was discovered. The findings were obtained by the use of sophisticated methods like single cell force microscopy. However, we also identified some issues in your work before publication of your work by eLife can be considered. To address these issues additional experiments need to be performed. They concern:</p><p>1) The number of Flo11A molecules present on single cells (see reviewer 1).</p></disp-quote><p>In order to measure Flo11 molecules present at the cell surface, we routinely perform quantification by immunofluorescence microscopy, because this method is a good measure for the Flo11 molecules accessible for protein-protein interactions at the cell surface. Quantitative Western blot analysis is not feasible, because Flo11 proteins are highly glycosylated and do not reproducibly enter separation gels. In the previous version of our manuscript, we have only briefly described this quantification (Materials and methods section). We now describe the method in more detail and we have added the data as a new Supplementary file 5. Importantly, this data shows that all Flo11 variants used in the study are present at comparable amounts at the cell surface. Moreover, detectable protein amounts and functionality (as assayed by QCAM and agar adhesion) for the variants tested do not correlate, as for instance exemplified by the functional variant Y111A Y113A Y118A (86% relative surface amount) and the non-functional variant Y111D Y113D Y118D (92% relative surface amount).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Isogenic strains with different Flo11 alleles should be mixed together and tested whether discrimination actually occurs, i.e. the strains partition into distinct social groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed in vivo competition assays to address the behavior of mixed populations expressing heterogenous Flo11 variants. In order to address this issue, we have constructed a set of isogenic yeast strains expressing Flo11 variants from different species/subspecies (fitting the competitive AFM assays) and different fluorescent markers (GFP or RFP) for genotypic tracking. These strains were used for competitive biofilm assays, in order to measure Flo11-dependent segregation at population level in vivo. This novel data is included as new Figure 5 and clearly shows significant differences between homotypic (single Flo11A variant) and heterotypic (two different Flo11A variants) biofilms with respect to the ratio of the Flo11A expressing strains at the outer edge of the growing biofilms. Importantly, this ratio was found to be very low in homotypic biofilms, but significantly higher (up to more than 1000-fold) in heterotypic biofilms using strains expressing different Flo11A variants. This demonstrates that in competitive situations one Flo11 allele outcompetes the other and monopolizes the outer edge of the expanding biofilm. This novel data is in agreement with our data obtained by competitive AFM assays at single cell level and supports the conclusion that heterogenous Flo11A alleles are able to discriminate against each other at population level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Western blot analysis are needed to confirm that the Flo11A mutant phenotypes (e.g. Figure 2B and C) are not caused by unstable mutant proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>See answer to point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The study does not go far enough in parts to support the central hypothesis put forward in the title and in many other places in the paper that speak to &quot;Kin discrimination in social yeast&quot;. The authors may be able to address this issue by setting up corresponding assays to measure cellular interactions between strains expressing different Flo11 versions in vivo and also by establishing competition assays. Such information will complement the strong biochemical and biophysical data and allow the authors to properly interpret aspects of microbial interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>See answer to point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The F<sub>max</sub> required to separate cells with or without the Flo11A domain shows a range of 2 to 15 nN. Though the difference is shown to be statistically significant, there is little to suggest that it is also biologically relevant. What natural situations would a yeast find itself in where a force difference of 13 nN would matter to it? What natural environments do yeast exist in between 2 and 15 nN where this difference in affinity would presumably be relevant? Additionally, the authors attempt to categorize the experimental system as &quot;in vivo&quot; though the natural context of this type of interaction is not clear. An identical experiment could have been performed with immobilized Flo11p, yielding the same results, which is also not considered &quot;in vivo.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>See answer to point 2.</p><p>With respect to a possible natural situation, biofilm formation on semi-solid surfaces (as conducted by us now) might reflect growth of yeast on naturally viscous environments, such as rotting fruits.</p><p>Regarding the difference between our QCAM assays using living whole cells and an aggregation assay using immobilized Flo11p, we think that there might be differences with respect to the local concentration and presentation of Flo11 molecules, which could be crucial for efficient trans interaction (see our Discussion section). However, we now refer to our QCAM assay in the improved manuscript as cell aggregation assay using whole populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The phenomenon of kin discrimination in vivo implies that there exists a certain benefit to the kin, but there is no exploration of this. There are no competition assays. There are no measurements of fitness as they relate to the relative strength of Flo11A interactions. Do K. pastoris form more vulnerable biofilms because they have weaker homotypic interactions than S. cerevisiae? Will a mixed population of S. cerevisiae and K. pastoris show S. cerevisiae as dominant over time?</p></disp-quote><p>See answer to point 2. Furthermore, it is interestingly to note that in our competitive biofilm assays, strains expressing <italic>K. pastoris</italic> Flo11 become slightly dominant over strains with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Flo11. However, whereas AFM measures Flo11 interactions after 20 s (contact times exceeding 20 s could not be reliably assayed, because the probe cells were repeatedly torn from the cantilever), our competitive biofilm assays measure segregation over a much longer time period of 3 weeks. Unfortunately, we cannot measure individual cell-cell interactions by AFM at later time points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Might the relatively weak hetertypic interactions be strong enough to hold cells together in the wild? The homotypic interactions and KpFlo11A are shown to be half as strong as homotypic interactions in ScFlo11A, however the authors also say this does affect the cell-cell aggregation assays.</p></disp-quote><p>See answer to point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Will cells expressing different Flo11A domains segregate within a biofilm?</p></disp-quote><p>See answer to point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Will cells expressing different Flo11A domains form separate flocs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not addressed this question experimentally, but chosen to perform competition assays in biofilms, in order to measure separation over a long time period.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The interpretation of the results of the biofilm experiments is not clear. Many papers in yeast and bacteria have explored the topic using fluorescently labeled cells, and it is unclear whether you are taking all this information into account when interpreting your data. For example, in Figure 5, the biofilms have different sizes. Please take biofilm size into account for your analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this gap. To address this issue, we have further analyzed all biofilms with regard to the biofilm sizes and the spatial distribution of competing yeast strains within the whole biofilm. This data is included as a new figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), which shows (A) the red/green signal ratios in relation to the distance from the center (inoculation spot) of the biofilms, (B) the biofilm size for each combination of competing yeast strains, (C) the relative presence of competing strains within whole biofilms, and (D) the relative presence of competing strains at the outer biofilm edge (previously presented data). The new data shows that in all heterotypic biofilms one of the alleles clearly dominates the biofilm with respect to its relative presence within the whole area covered. In addition, the total sizes of mixed biofilms generally correspond to the sizes of the homogeneous biofilms of dominant alleles. As such, the new data supports our previous conclusion that heterogenous Flo11A alleles are able to discriminate against each other in mixed populations. We further discuss the new data in an additional paragraph with respect to the question of how cell surface presentation and interaction of Flo11-type proteins translate into the development of multicellular growth forms under non-competitive and competitive conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Measuring the fluorescence at the outer edge might not be the best way to measure success in biofilm populations. For example, cells 'trapped' in the middle may have an advantage being protected from the external environment. How about measuring the ratio of total fluorescence of the two signals.</p><p>As stated above, we have measured the ratio of the total fluorescence of the two signals. This data supports the data measuring the fluorescence at the outer edge, because we observe that in all competitive combinations assayed one strain becomes dominant with respect to the relative area 'conquered' within the whole biofilm as a measure of success. Whether the cells 'trapped' in the middle are protected against the external environment cannot be directly concluded from our data and would have to be analyzed in a separate study analyzing an array of different harmful environmental conditions. Nevertheless, our data supports the main focus of this study concerning the ability of Flo11 adhesins to confer discrimination not only at protein and at single cell level, but also in heterogeneous populations.</p><p>3) It is also not clear why ClFlo11 beats ScFlo11. Does this correspond to the relative adhesive forces of these molecules? As is, this figure could be inflammatory to the community of scientists who study social cooperation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right. We also feel that this finding is intriguing, especially because we find that ScFlo11A confers roughly 1.4-fold higher cell-cell adhesion forces as measured by AFM, but on average leads to 1.8-fold lower biofilm sizes, when compared to ClFlo11A. This apparent discrepancy could be explained by postulating significant differences in cell-substrate adhesion conferred by these Flo11A variants. In other words, ClFlo11A might be able to interact with the substrate much more efficiently than ScFlo11A and thereby confer a significantly better spreading of the growing biofilm. It remains to be elucidated, whether and how different Flo11A variants confer adhesion to different substrate surfaces. We discuss these possibilities in a new paragraph of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why are cells not seen to mix into conglomerates of self organizing communities, as reported in many papers?</p></disp-quote><p>We also think that studying the connection between intercellular adhesion and the internal structure of microbial colonies and biofilms at single cell level is an important topic. However, addressing such issues with regard to the Flo11 adhesin family would require a large body of additional experimental work such as a combination of high-resolution time-lapse microscopy and mathematical modelling, which in our opinion would clearly be beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Might other competition forces shape the patterns observed here?</p></disp-quote><p>See answer to point 3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
