The force for constriction is thought to involve actin polymerization by the ER-anchored isoform of the formin protein inverted formin 2 (INF2). Unknown is the mechanism triggering INF2-mediated actin polymerization at ER-mitochondria intersections. We show that a novel isoform of the formin-binding, actin-nucleating protein Spire, Spire1C, localizes to mitochondria and directly links mitochondria to the actin cytoskeleton and the ER. Spire1C binds INF2 and promotes actin assembly on mitochondrial surfaces. Disrupting either Spire1C actin- or formin-binding activities reduces mitochondrial constriction and division. We propose Spire1C cooperates with INF2 to regulate actin assembly at ER-mitochondrial contacts. Simulations support this model's feasibility and demonstrate polymerizing actin filaments can induce mitochondrial constriction. Thus, Spire1C is optimally positioned to serve as a molecular hub that links mitochondria to actin and the ER for regulation of mitochondrial division.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08828.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08828.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08828.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mitochondria are structures within cells that provide the energy to power many biological processes that are essential for complex life. These structures are also highly dynamic and go through cycles of fission (in which a single mitochondrion splits in two) and fusion (in which two mitochondria merge into one). These processes both maintain the correct number of mitochondria in a cell and remove damaged ones, and defects in either can result in many diseases.</p><p>Previous research had shown that mitochondria are in close contact with another cellular structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. The points of contact mark the sites where mitochondria undergo fission, as small tubes of the endoplasmic reticulum wrap around, and then constrict, to split a mitochondrion.</p><p>Other recent work revealed that a protein called INF2 is anchored on the endoplasmic reticulum where it promotes mitochondrial constriction. This protein builds actin subunits into long filaments that provide the force for constriction. However, it was not clear how INF2 became active, and whether there are proteins on mitochondria that interact with INF2 or actin.</p><p>Manor, Bartholomew et al. have now used a combination of microscopy-based methods and biochemical analysis to discover that a mitochondrial protein called Spire1C performs all of these roles. Spire1C is found on the outer membrane of mitochondria; it interacts with INF2 to drive the formation of actin filaments that constrict mitochondria. These results suggest that Spire1C bridges the endoplasmic reticulum with the network of actin filaments. Further experiments then showed that increasing Spire1C levels in cells resulted in the mitochondria becoming fragmented due to increased constriction. On the other hand, depleting Spire1C had the opposite effect and caused mitochondria to become unusually elongated. Following on from this work, the next challenge is to see if Spire1C is used differently or similarly in the different processes that involve mitochondrial fission.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08828.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08828.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>membrane</kwd><kwd>organelles</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation (ISF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>758/11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Golani</surname><given-names>Gonen</given-names></name><name><surname>Kozlov</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM106000-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Higgs</surname><given-names>Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM033289-32</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spudich</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAHD001609-21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manor</surname><given-names>Uri</given-names></name><name><surname>Lippincott-Schwartz</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAHD008928-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christenson</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An actin nucleating protein, Spire1C, localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane and interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum-anchored formin protein INF2 to drive mitochondrial fission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondrial division is a complex process that is essential for survival in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Archer, 2014</xref>) and is facilitated by the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">De Vos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DuBoff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hatch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Two distinct steps define mitochondrial division - an initial constriction of mitochondrial membranes, followed by final membrane scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korobova et al., 2014</xref>). Scission is mediated by the dynamin-related protein, Drp1, which self-assembles on the surface of the mitochondrial outer membrane into helices that drive final mitochondrial division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lackner and Nunnari, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Archer, 2014</xref>). The initial constriction step narrows the mitochondrial tube diameter, which is necessary for Drp1 helix assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Labrousse et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Legesse-Miller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ingerman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mears et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murley et al., 2013</xref>). This step is independent of Drp1 and occurs at ER-mitochondria intersection zones where ER tubules associate with and wrap around the mitochondrial outer membrane along the plane of mitochondrial division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korobova et al., 2014</xref>). Along these zones, actin filaments polymerize, providing the force needed for constriction that floppy ER tubules lack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hatch et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Inverted formin 2 (INF2) is a formin family protein that promotes actin filament polymerization in a regulated fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2014</xref>). An ER-anchored splice isoform of INF2 (usually referred to as INF2-CAAX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chhabra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>) has been shown to facilitate mitochondrial constriction and division via its actin polymerization activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>). Given INF2, but not actin assembly, is localized throughout the ER, how INF2-mediated actin assembly is specifically triggered at ER-mitochondria intersections to ensure mitochondrial division remains an open central question.</p><p>Spire proteins are membrane-binding actin-nucleators that interact with and regulate formin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quinlan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pechlivanis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerkhoff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pfender et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schuh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vizcarra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zeth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quinlan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montaville et al., 2014</xref>). Synergistic promotion of actin assembly by Spire and formin proteins has been implicated in driving a variety of processes ranging from vesicle trafficking to DNA repair in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pfender et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schuh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montaville et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belin et al., 2015</xref>). In these systems, membrane-associated Spire proteins nucleate actin filaments, which are then further polymerized by formin proteins, ultimately leading to actin-dependent translocation. Given these characteristics of Spire proteins, we set out to investigate whether any Spire proteins could be involved in helping promote INF2- and actin-dependent constriction and division of mitochondria at ER-mitochondria association zones.</p><p>Vertebrates have two known Spire genes, Spire1 and Spire2. Each Spire protein contains highly conserved domains with specific capabilities, including: four actin-monomer binding WH2 domains necessary for nucleating actin filaments; an mFYVE domain that binds to intracellular membranes and facilitates oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerkhoff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dietrich et al., 2013</xref>); and an N-terminal KIND domain that serves to bind to and regulate formin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quinlan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pechlivanis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerkhoff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pfender et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vizcarra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zeth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quinlan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montaville et al., 2014</xref>). Although no Spire proteins have been shown previously to localize to mitochondria or the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dietrich et al., 2013</xref>), here we report a previously uncharacterized alternate splice-isoform of Spire1 (named Spire1C) that localizes to mitochondria, promotes actin assembly on mitochondrial surfaces, and interacts with ER-anchored INF2 to regulate mitochondrial constriction and division. Our results support a model where Spire1C and INF2 coordinately drive actin- and ER-dependent mitochondrial division. They also reveal that Spire1C directly links mitochondria to both the actin cytoskeleton and the ER.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spire1C's previously uncharacterized alternate exon, ExonC, is highly conserved</title><p>We identified and characterized a novel alternate splice-isoform of Spire1 that contains KIND and WH2 domains common to all Spire proteins, as well as a previously uncharacterized unique 58 amino acid alternate exon sequence (ExonC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and see ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2 fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 1–3</xref> for details on Spire1C cloning, probe generation, and sequence information). Because of its alternative ExonC sequence, we named the Spire1 isoform Spire1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After determining that Spire1C mRNA was present in multiple mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), we examined its presence and conservation among species. Using the UCSC Genome Browser, we searched for additional DNA or mRNA sequences that contain Spire1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kent et al., 2002</xref>). When compared to mouse, we found striking identity in ExonC for rat, rabbit, human, dog, elephant, opossum, platypus, and chicken. It is not found in the annotated zebrafish sequence. Compared to our amplified mouse sequence of 58 amino acids, human ExonC differs by 2 residues (96% identical), platypus by 8 residues (86% identical), and chicken by 12 residues (79% identical). Sequence homology is strongest among mammals, but chicken maintains conservation that is unlikely to be solely due to chance. Conservation among species extends beyond the coding exon and into the upstream and downstream intronic regions of the gene, stretching ∼150 bases in the 3′ direction (data not shown). These conserved extensions are likely involved in splicing regulation of the exon. The high level of conservation within and surrounding ExonC suggests that its role is indispensible for the health of the organism.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08828.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Spire1 alternate exon ExonC is necessary and sufficient for localization to mitochondria.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Full length Spire1C domain structure: The number ranges indicate the amino acid regions of the conserved domains probed in this study.

Both GFP-Spire1C and GFP-ExonC lost nearly all their fluorescence within 60 seconds of trypsin treatment. By contrast, fluorescence from ExonC-GFP was protected, similar to that seen for co-expressed OMI-mCherry, which as a mitochondrial IMS protein should be insensitive to trypsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muñoz-Pinedo et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2 media3">Videos 1–3</xref>).

Prior work studying this process demonstrated that division occurs at sites where ER wraps around mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murley et al., 2013</xref>), with the ER providing a platform for actin polymerization mediated by the ER-anchored formin INF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hatch et al., 2014</xref>). This actin meshwork is proposed to provide the force that drives mitochondrial constriction prior to Drp1-mediated mitochondrial division. Missing from this picture has been a molecular player that regulates INF2-mediated actin polymerization, ensuring that polymerization occurs specifically at ER-mitochondria contact sites to drive mitochondrial constriction and division. Here, we demonstrate that Spire1C, a novel mitochondrial outer membrane protein, can serve this role by both binding to INF2 as well as by acting as an actin-nucleator.</p><p>Spire proteins are membrane-binding actin-nucleators that interact with and regulate formin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quinlan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pechlivanis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pfender et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schuh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vizcarra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quinlan, 2013</xref>). Given this, Spire proteins are potential candidates for regulating the actin polymerization activity of INF2 on mitochondrial membranes. In searching for such a protein, we identified a specific isoform of Spire1, Spire1C, which resides on mitochondria and interacts with INF2. Spire1C is distinct from other Spire proteins in having mitochondrial outer membrane localization. This localization is a result of Spire1C's unique ExonC domain, which serves as a mitochondria-targeting sequence. Spire1C undergoes lateral diffusion on the mitochondrial outer membrane, and is oriented with its formin-binding and actin-nucleating domains facing the cytoplasm. Spire1C promotes actin assembly on mitochondrial outer membranes; when Spire1C is overexpressed a massive buildup of actin around mitochondria is observed. The actin buildup is dependent on Spire1C's actin-nucleating WH2 domain, but not its formin-binding KIND domain. Therefore, Spire1C's canonical actin-nucleating domain drives actin accumulation on mitochondria independently of its interactions with formin proteins.</p><p>Given Spire1C's ability to assemble actin filaments on mitochondrial membranes, we examined whether modulating Spire1C's activity could affect mitochondrial lengths or their division rates, and we found that it can. Overexpressing Spire1C increases mitochondrial division rates while depleting Spire1C has the opposite effect, causing mitochondria to become highly elongated. Because the increased fission seen in cells overexpressing Spire1C depends not only on Spire1C's actin-nucleating WH2 domain but also its formin-binding KIND domain, we reasoned that Spire1C-mediated mitochondrial fission also depended on formin proteins. Given INF2's previously established role as a formin protein involved in ER-mediated mitochondrial constriction and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hatch et al., 2014</xref>), we hypothesized that Spire1C could be working together with INF2. We postulated that Spire1C could be promoting mitochondrial division by interacting with ER-anchored INF2, in order to enable mitochondria to come into close proximity with the ER so that actin-nucleation by Spire1C could enhance actin assembly mediated by INF2. Supporting this possibility, we found in GST pulldown and fluorescence anisotropy assays that the Spire1C KIND domain directly binds to INF2. In cells overexpressing Spire1C lacking its KIND domain-mediated INF2-binding activity (Spire1CΔKIND) or its actin-nucleating activity (Spire1C mWH2), ER-mitochondria associations leading to mitochondrial constrictions were significantly decreased. Moreover, overexpressing Spire1CΔKIND prevented mitochondria from dividing in cells expressing a constitutively active INF2 mutant (INF2 A149) that normally induces dramatic mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2014</xref>). Finally, Spire1C overexpression in cells lacking INF2 failed to induce mitochondrial fission.</p><p>All these observations suggest a model in which mitochondrial Spire1C and ER-anchored INF2 conspire to mediate mitochondrial constriction via actin filament assembly. In this scheme, Spire1C:actin complexes on mitochondria associate with INF2 on the ER, acting together with other ER-mitochondria tethering complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rowland and Voeltz, 2012</xref>) to draw the two organelles together. This results in the ER wrapping around the mitochondria. Once this occurs, actin filaments nucleated by Spire1C are elongated by the actin polymerization activity of INF2, similar to the ‘rocket launcher’ mechanism shown for other actin nucleating and formin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breitsprecher et al., 2012</xref>). Because INF2 can both polymerize and sever actin filaments, a complex meshwork of actin grows between the ER and mitochondria, which may be further impacted by myosin-II dimer recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hatch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korobova et al., 2014</xref>) as well as perhaps other actin-regulatory proteins such as cofilin or Arp2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Derivery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2015</xref>). The growing actin meshwork between the ER and mitochondria then exerts pressure on the mitochondrial outer membrane causing its constriction. Our computational modeling of this process confirmed that polymerizing actin filaments from this meshwork has sufficient force to bend and constrict the mitochondrial membrane once the filaments abut the mitochondria surface.</p><p>Clearly, further work is needed to clarify the mechanism by which Spire1C and INF2 facilitate mitochondrial division. First, a better understanding of how Spire1C and INF2 interact with and regulate one another's activities during mitochondrial constriction is required. The relatively low affinity between Spire1C's KIND domain and INF2 detected in our assays, if applicable to living cells, is consistent with Spire1C:INF2 dissociation once INF2 begins to elongate actin filaments. Second, as several proteins are known to tether ER-mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rowland and Voeltz, 2012</xref>), the role of these proteins in promoting or disrupting Spire1C's interaction with INF2 also needs to be studied. Such interactions may underlie differences in the mode of mitochondrial division seen in cells undergoing apoptosis, mitophagy, mitosis, or in response to toxins such as LLO from <italic>Listeria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoppins and Nunnari, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stavru et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the precise organization of the actin meshwork responsible for constricting mitochondria needs to be characterized at higher resolution. This will help determine whether the actin meshwork constricts mitochondria by myosin-mediated contraction, by elongating filaments pushing, or by a combination of both.</p><p>While we have focused on Spire1C's role in mitochondrial constriction, the establishment of Spire1C as a mitochondrial outer membrane protein suggests that Spire1C is optimally positioned to serve as a molecular hub that links mitochondrial dynamics to the actin cytoskeleton as well as to the ER. While our appreciation of the role of actin in mitochondrial division is rapidly growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">De Vos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hatch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2015</xref>), there are other important functions for actin in mitochondrial dynamics, such as mitochondrial motility in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hollenbeck and Saxton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pathak et al., 2010</xref>), mitochondrial partitioning prior to cell division in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quintero et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rohn et al., 2014</xref>), and perhaps also the partitioning of mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boldogh et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reyes et al., 2011</xref>). This list is almost certainly not exhaustive; there may yet be other known and unknown roles for the actin cytoskeleton in mitochondrial biology, and vice versa. Interestingly, Spire1C directly interacts with the tail domain of myosin Va (data not shown), an actin-binding motor protein that has been shown to be involved in both mitochondrial and ER movement in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). In other cellular systems myosin Vb, Rab11a, and Spire proteins cooperate to drive actin-based vesicle movements and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schuh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montaville et al., 2014</xref>)—perhaps similar mechanisms exist for mitochondrial movements. Along these lines, it is interesting to note that Rab11a has also been implicated in mitochondrial dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Landry et al., 2014</xref>)—exploring these findings in the context of Spire1C function may provide new insight towards mitochondrial movements and dynamics, and perhaps the relationship between actin-dependent motility and actin-dependent fission. Finally, the recent discovery of a role for the ER in mediating endosomal constriction and division raises the possibility that endosomal isoforms of Spire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerkhoff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2009</xref>) are playing a similar role in promoting ER/actin/INF2-mediated endosomal fission.

This means that the membrane lateral tension was taken to be zero, which guaranteed that the membrane bending energy was the sole contribution to the membrane elastic energy.</p><p>The energy minimization and the shape determination for each pressure value were performed using Brakke's ‘Surface Evolver’ program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brakke, 1992</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Margot Quinlan for purified Spire1C-KIND protein and for helpful suggestions.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Pekka Lappalainen, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the three reviewers, Liza Pon, has also agreed to share her identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Previous studies revealed that constriction of mitochondria, which precedes Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission, occurs at sites of close contact between ER and mitochondria, and is driven in part by INF2-mediated actin polymerization. Here Manor et al. show that a specific splice-variant of an actin nucleating protein Spire (named Spire1C) localizes to the mitochondria outer membrane through a specific a-helical motif encoded by its alternate exon C. Importantly, they demonstrate that Spire1C promotes actin filament assembly at the mitochondrial surfaces and modulates mitochondrial fission through its actin-binding WH2 domains and its KIND domain, which specifically binds to INF2 formin. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that Spire1C and INF2 cooperate to form mitochondria-ER intersections, and to promote efficient actin filament assembly specifically at these sites.</p><p>The majority of the data presented in the manuscript are convincing and the study provides fundamentally important new insights into the mechanisms of mitochondrial fission. However, there are few important issues that should be addressed to confirm the conclusions presented and to further strengthen this study.</p><p>Essentials revisions:</p><p>1) Most of the studies presented are based on Spire1C over-expression. The authors should thus perform the mitochondrial fission (Figure 4C) and ‘mitochondrial constriction’ assays (Figure 7) also on Spire1C knockdown cells. The effects of Spire RNAi should also be verified with an additional shRNAi construct, or the authors could try to rescue the phenotype of Spire RNAi cells. Together, these experiments would perhaps also reconcile some inconsistencies in the data. For example, while cell quantification suggests that Spire1C overexpression induces mitochondrial fragmentation (Figure 4), the images presented in the manuscript (e.g. in Figure 5) either show normal or even elongated mitochondria.</p><p>2) The lipid specificity assay (shown in Figure 2–figure supplement 1) is not particularly convincing and should be omitted from the manuscript. Lipid specificity of a transmembrane protein (or a hydrophobic protein motif that penetrates into the acyl chain region of the bilayer) cannot be studied using lipid strips, where the individual lipid molecules are most likely not organized into a proper bilayer. Thus, if the authors wish to examine lipid specificity of ExonC, they should instead perform proper vesicle co-flotation or co-sedimentation assays.</p><p>3) The authors should provide better controls for the protease sensitivity assay. This assay would benefit from analysis of a protease sensitive IMS protein to confirm that the protease treatment conditions used degrades OM protein without affecting the integrity of the OM. Furthermore, based on the sequence analysis (presented in Figure 1–figure supplement 3) ExonC is predicted to consist of two a-helices, which both are long enough (15-20 residues) to span the mitochondrial outer membrane. Would it be possible that these helices could either make a ‘hairpin’, which spans the outer membrane twice, or that this region would instead just ‘horizontally’ penetrate into the acyl-chain region of the mitochondrial outer membrane without spanning the entire bilayer? To provide stronger support for the conclusions presented, the authors should repeat the assay with a C-terminal GFP-fusion of full-length Spire1C (to confirm that the C-terminus of full-length Spire1C indeed does not face the cytosol as proposed in the current version of the manuscript).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08828.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Most of the studies presented are based on Spire1C over-expression.

While the average mitochondrial lengths significantly changed depending on Spire or INF2 activities, nearly every cell has some mitochondria that are very short, and at least a couple that are longer. For the sake of clarity in some of our experiments (for example the FRAP data in Figure 2, actin accumulation on mitochondria in Figure 3, or the ER-mitochondria intersection data in Figure 5), we used cells with longer mitochondria in order to be able to make measurements as necessary (i.e. photobleaching only a small segment of very short mitochondria is nearly impossible, measuring ER-mitochondria intersections in cells where all the mitochondria are already fragmented is similarly impossible, and actin around fragmented mitochondria is more difficult to detect than on tubulated mitochondria where a continuous line of actin accumulation is more easily detectable within the already large amount of F-actin throughout the cytoplasm). In order to clarify our data in this regard, we have added as a supplemental figure a histogram showing the distribution of mitochondrial lengths for each condition (Figure 4–figure supplement 1).</p><p><italic>2) The lipid specificity assay (shown in Figure 2</italic>–<italic>figure supplement 1) is not particularly convincing and should be omitted from the manuscript.

This will require many more experiments that go beyond the scope of this work. Therefore, we have removed the lipid dot blot and will attempt to establish ExonC’s lipid specificity in a future study.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should provide better controls for the protease sensitivity assay.

This is exactly why we used the OMI-mCherry construct as a control in all of our experiments. OMI-mCherry localizes to the IMS – if the OM was being degraded by our digitonin treatment, then OMI-mCherry would escape into the cytoplasm. Similarly, if the OM was degraded enough that trypsin was able to digest proteins in the IMS, then OMI-mCherry would be depleted upon addition of trypsin. In none of our experiments did we observe depletion of OMI-mCherry mitochondrial fluorescence, indicating that the OM was indeed intact in all of our experimental conditions.</p><p>We agree that it is important to be careful not to make any claims about the C-terminus of Spire1C being in the IMS, since our FPP assay only informs us that the C-terminal region of ExonC (which is in the middle of the full-length Spire protein) is protected from trypsinization. While our FPP assay leaves us confident that the C-terminus of ExonC is protected from the cytoplasm, we were unable to draw any conclusions from these assays as to the localization of the Spire1C C-terminus. While the secondary protein structure prediction software PHYRE identifies two putative alpha-helices within ExonC, only one of those helices was predicted to be a transmembrane domain by predictive software, so we chose not to postulate that there are two transmembrane domains in ExonC. However, we agree that the hairpin model the reviewers have proposed is just as likely to be correct, and is furthermore appealing since this would allow for the C-terminal domain of Spire1C to interact with other cytoplasmic proteins.</p><p>We agree that an additional FPP assay using a C-terminus GFP-tagged Spire1C construct would ideally clarify the topology of the Spire1C C-terminus. In order to address the reviewers’ comments, we performed an additional FPP assay using a new Spire1C-GFP construct with GFP on the C-terminus. Unfortunately, when we expressed this construct, the protein no longer localized properly to mitochondria, instead displaying a mostly cytoplasmic localization pattern (with barely detectable accumulation on mitochondria). Due to this disrupted localization pattern, we were unable to draw any conclusions from an FPP assay; upon addition of digitonin, all of the GFP fluorescence was almost immediately depleted, even without subsequent addition of trypsin. While this result may give some clue as to how Spire1C localizes to the OM, many more experiments that go beyond the scope of this work would have to be performed in order to determine what this result is telling us. Thus, we have mentioned these latest findings in the text, and modified our interpretation of our FPP data to include the likely possibility that Spire1C’s ExonC localizes in a hairpin or horizontal fashion on the outer leaflet of the outer mitochondrial membrane.</p></body></sub-article></article>
