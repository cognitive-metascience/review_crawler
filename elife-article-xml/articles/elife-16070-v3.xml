Behavioral studies in humans have shown that changes in contextual features lead to overestimation of past durations. Based on evidence that the medial temporal lobes and prefrontal cortex represent contextual features, we related the degree of fMRI pattern change in these regions with people’s subsequent duration estimates. After listening to a radio story in the scanner, participants were asked how much time had elapsed between pairs of clips from the story. Our ROI analyses found that duration estimates were correlated with the neural pattern distance between two clips at encoding in the right entorhinal cortex. Moreover, whole-brain searchlight analyses revealed a cluster spanning the right anterior temporal lobe. Our findings provide convergent support for the hypothesis that retrospective time judgments are driven by 'drift' in contextual representations supported by these regions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16070.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16070.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16070.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>How do humans judge how much time has passed during daily life, such as when waiting for the bus? Psychology studies have shown that people remember events to have lasted longer when more changes occurred during that time period. These changes can occur either in the environment (such as changes in location) or in the individual’s internal state (such as changes in goals and emotions).</p><p>Brain activity changes from moment to moment. Lositsky et al. hypothesized that when patterns of activity in a person’s brain change a lot across an interval of time, that person will judge that a long time has passed. On the other hand, if brain activity changes less over that interval, individuals will judge that less time has passed.</p><p>Some regions of the brain are sensitive to information that unfolds over several minutes; many of these regions are vital for forming memories of episodes from our lives. Using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Lositsky et al. specifically looked at the activity of these regions while volunteers listened to a 25-minute radio drama. Afterwards, the volunteers listened to clips from different events in the story and judged how much time passed between those events.</p><p>Even though each pair of audio clips occurred exactly two minutes apart in the original story, people’s time judgments were strongly influenced by how many scene changes happened in the story between the two clips. In a part of the brain called the right anterior temporal lobe – and especially in a region of it called the entorhinal cortex – Lositsky et al. found that brain activity changed more when audio clips were judged to be further apart in time. Activity in this region fluctuated more slowly overall than in the rest of the brain. This could mean that it combines sensory information (about images, sounds, smells and so on) across minutes of time, in order to form a representation of the current situation.</p><p>Future research could focus on several unanswered questions. Exactly which environmental and internal changes influence our perception of time? What form does this information take in the entorhinal cortex? Studies show that the entorhinal cortex contains “grid cells” that track our location in space. Could these cells also help judge the passage of time?</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16070.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16070.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>retrospective time estimates</kwd><kwd>episodic memory</kwd><kwd>temporal context model</kwd><kwd>multi-voxel pattern analysis</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early Stage Investigator, R01-MH094480</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hasson</surname><given-names>Uri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000925</institution-id><institution>John Templeton Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Proposal 36751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lositsky</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Norman</surname><given-names>Kenneth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Training Grant, 2T32MH065214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lositsky</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Janice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Judgments of how much time elapsed between two events in a story are predicted by changes in fMRI activity patterns.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Imagine that you are at the bus stop when you run into a colleague and the two of you become engrossed in a conversation about memory research. After a few minutes, you realize that the bus still has not arrived. Without looking at your watch, you have some sense of how long you have been waiting. Where does this intuition come from?</p><p>Estimation of durations lasting a few seconds has been probed in the neuroimaging, neuropsychology and neuropharmacology literatures (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wittmann, 2013</xref>, for a review). On the other hand, the neural mechanisms underlying time perception on the scale of minutes have remained unexplored. This is particularly true of <italic>retrospective</italic> judgments, where individuals experience an interval without paying attention to time and must subsequently estimate the interval’s duration. In such cases, individuals must rely on information stored in memory to estimate duration. How is this accomplished?</p><p>Memory scholars have long posited that the same contextual cues that help us to retrieve an item from memory can also help us determine its recency. According to extant theories of context and memory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Manning et al., 2014</xref>, for a review), <italic>mental context</italic> refers to aspects of our mental state that tend to persist over a relatively long time scale; this encompasses our representation of slowly-changing aspects of the external world (e.g., what room we are in) as well as other slowly-changing aspects of our internal mental state (e.g., our current plans). Crucially, these theories posit that slowly-changing contextual features can be episodically associated with more quickly-changing aspects of the world (e.g., stimuli that appear at a particular moment in time; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mensink and Raaijmakers, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Howard and Kahana, 2002</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bower (1972)</xref> first proposed that we could determine how long ago an item occurred by comparing our current context with the context associated with the remembered item. The similarity of these two context representations would reflect their temporal distance, with more similar representations associated with events that happened closer together in time. Thus, a slowly varying mental context could serve as a temporal tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Polyn and Kahana, 2008</xref>). In parallel, researchers in the domain of retrospective time estimation have shown that the degree of context change is a better predictor of duration judgments than alternative explanations, such as the number of items remembered from the interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Block and Reed, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Block, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">1992</xref>). Indeed, changes in task processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Block and Reed, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sahakyan and Smith, 2014</xref>), environmental context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Block, 1982</xref>), and emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pollatos et al., 2014</xref>), as well as event boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Poynter, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zakay et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Faber and Gennari, 2015</xref>), lead to overestimation of past durations.</p><p>In our study, we set out to obtain neural evidence in support of the hypothesis that mental context change drives duration estimates. Specifically, we hypothesized that, in brain regions representing mental context, the degree of neural pattern change between two events (operationalized as change in multi-voxel patterns of fMRI activity) should predict participants’ estimates of how much time passed between those events.</p><p>Extensive prior work has implicated the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in representing contextual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Polyn and Kahana, 2008</xref>; for reviews of MTL contributions to representing context, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Eichenbaum et al., 2007</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ritchey and Ranganath, 2012</xref>; for related computational modeling work, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Howard and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>). In keeping with our hypothesis, multiple studies have obtained evidence linking neural pattern change in these regions to temporal memory judgments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Manns et al. (2007)</xref> recorded from rat hippocampus during an odor memory task; they found that greater change in hippocampal activity patterns between two stimuli predicted better memory for the order in which the stimuli occurred. In the human neuroimaging literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jenkins and Ranganath (2010)</xref> found that the degree to which activity patterns in rostrolateral prefrontal cortex changed during the encoding of a stimulus predicted better memory for the temporal position of that stimulus in the experiment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jenkins and Ranganath (2016)</xref> also showed that greater pattern distance between two stimuli at encoding in the hippocampus, medial and anterior prefrontal cortex predicted better order memory. Only one study has directly related neural pattern drift to judgments of elapsed time in humans: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ezzyat and Davachi (2014)</xref> found that patterns of fMRI activity in left hippocampus were more similar for pairs of stimuli that were later estimated to have occurred closer together in time, despite equivalent time passage between all pairs (a little less than a minute).</p><p>While the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ezzyat and Davachi (2014)</xref> study provides support for our hypothesis, it has some limitations. First, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ezzyat and Davachi (2014)</xref>, participants estimated the temporal distance of stimuli that were linked to their contexts in an artificial way (by placing pictures of objects or famous faces on unrelated scene backgrounds); it is unclear whether these results will generalize to more naturalistic situations where events are linked through a narrative. Second, since participants performed the temporal memory test after each encoding run, they were not entirely naïve to the manipulation. Knowing that they would have to estimate durations between stimuli could have changed participants’ strategy and enhanced their attention to time (for evidence that estimating time prospectively engages different mechanisms, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hicks et al., 1976</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zakay and Block, 2004</xref>). In the current study, we sought to address the above issues by eliciting temporal distance judgments for pairs of events that had occurred several minutes apart and that were embedded in the context of a rich naturalistic story; participants listened to the entire story before being informed about the temporal judgment task.</p><p>Based on the studies reviewed above, we predicted that neural pattern drift in medial temporal and lateral prefrontal regions might support duration estimation. In our study, we examined these regions of interest (ROIs), as well as a broader set of regions that have been implicated in fMRI studies of time estimation, including the inferior parietal cortex, putamen, insula and frontal operculum (see <xref ref-type="box" rid="B1">Box 1</xref> for a review). In addition to the ROI analysis, which examined activity patterns in masks that were anatomically defined, we performed a searchlight analysis, which examined activity patterns within small cubes over the whole brain.</p><p>Participants were scanned while they listened to a 25-minute science fiction radio story. Outside the scanner, they were surprised with a time perception test, in which they had to estimate how much time had passed between pairs of auditory clips from the story. Controlling for objective time, we found that the degree of neural pattern distance between two clips at the time of encoding predicted how much time an individual would later estimate passed between them. The effect was significant in the right entorhinal cortex ROI. Extending the anatomical analysis to all masks in cortex revealed an additional effect in the left caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Moreover, whole-brain searchlight analyses yielded significant clusters spanning the right anterior temporal lobe. Our results suggest that patterns of neural activity in these regions may carry contextual information that helps us make retrospective time judgments on the order of minutes.</p><boxed-text id="B1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16070.003</object-id><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title>fMRI literature on prospective time estimation.</title></caption><p>As noted in the main text, only one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ezzyat and Davachi, 2014</xref>) has used fMRI to study retrospective estimation of time intervals lasting more than a few seconds. The vast majority of fMRI studies of time estimation have used prospective tasks, in which participants are asked to deliberately track the duration of a short stimulus or compare the duration of two stimuli. Such studies have repeatedly shown that activity in the putamen, insula, inferior frontal cortex (frontal operculum), and inferior parietal cortex increases as participants pay more attention to the duration of stimuli, as opposed to another time-varying attribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Coull, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Coull et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Livesey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wiener et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wittmann et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dirnberger et al. (2012)</xref> showed that greater activity in the putamen and insula during encoding of aversive emotional pictures predicted better subsequent memory for those pictures, but only when their duration was overestimated relative to neutral images.

Based on this measure, we grouped each participant’s duration estimates into high-confidence and low-confidence intervals. To verify that participants were better at distinguishing 6-min intervals from 2-min intervals when they were confident, we calculated the difference between the mean duration estimates for 6-min intervals and the mean duration estimates for 2-min intervals for every participant. The difference score was significantly higher for high-confidence intervals (<italic>M</italic>=2.43, <italic>SD</italic>=1.82) than for all intervals (<italic>M</italic>=2.01, <italic>SD</italic>=1.64), <italic>t</italic>(17)=2.33, <italic>p</italic>=0.0324. Thus, participants were significantly more accurate at estimating an interval’s duration when they confidently remembered the temporal position of both clips delimiting that interval in the story (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>For a given interval duration, some intervals were consistently judged to be longer than other intervals across participants, although the actual amount of elapsed time was held constant. To test the reliability of duration estimates across participants, we split the subjects randomly into two groups, averaged the duration estimates within each group, and correlated the two averages with each other. We repeated this procedure 1000 times to ensure that we sampled a variety of group splits. The average correlation between the two groups was 0.64 (<italic>SD</italic>=0.09) for 2-min intervals and 0.54 (<italic>SD</italic>=0.15) for 6-min intervals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis suggests that features of the story made some intervals appear consistently shorter and other intervals appear consistently longer across participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Duration estimates are influenced by memory of the story</title><p>We found that participants estimated six-minute intervals to be significantly longer than two-minute intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and that some intervals in the story tended to be systematically over-estimated by participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, it is possible that participants could judge the temporal distance between two clips purely based on the similarity between them (e.g. Are the same characters speaking? Is the background music the same? Is the topic of conversation similar?).</p><p>To ensure that participants were using their memory of the story to judge temporal distance, we ran a control experiment in which 17 participants who had never heard the story were given the exact same memory test. They were asked to try to estimate the amount of time that had elapsed between each pair of clips during the original telling of the story. During debriefing, participants reported making duration estimates based on the perceptual and semantic similarity between the two clips (e.g., which character voices were present, which background music was playing, the topic of conversation).</p><p>We found that naïve participants estimated 6-min intervals (<italic>M</italic>=6.21 min, <italic>SD</italic>=1.91) to be longer than 2-min intervals (<italic>M</italic>=5.63 min, <italic>SD</italic>=1.74; <italic>t</italic>(16)=2.62, <italic>p</italic>=0.019), suggesting that the similarity between two clips carried some information about the temporal distance between them. However, naïve participants were significantly less accurate at distinguishing 6-min intervals from 2-min intervals than our original participants who had heard the story. To quantify this, we calculated the difference between the mean duration estimates for 6-min intervals and the mean duration estimates for 2-min intervals for every participant (exactly as above). The difference score was significantly higher for our original participants (<italic>M</italic>=2.01 min, <italic>SD</italic>=1.64 min) than for naïve participants (<italic>M</italic>=0.59 min, <italic>SD</italic>=0.91 min), <italic>t</italic>(26.86)=−3.22, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005. Thus, having memory of the story enabled our participants to estimate durations with significantly higher accuracy.</p><p>We hypothesized that both our original participants and the naïve participants would use consistent strategies to estimate the temporal distance between two clips, but that these strategies would differ across groups. If this is the case, duration estimates should be more correlated across participants within groups than across participants between groups. The correlation in duration estimates across participants within a group (see Materials and methods) was as strong for naïve participants (<italic>M</italic>=0.43, <italic>SD</italic>=0.18, 95% CI [0.40, 0.56]) as for our original participants (<italic>M</italic>=0.43, <italic>SD</italic>=0.25, 95% CI=[0.37, 0.58]), suggesting that both groups used a consistent strategy to estimate the distance between two clips. When we correlated duration estimates from our original group of participants with those of our naïve participants, we found that the between-group correlations (<italic>M</italic>=0.18, <italic>SD</italic>=0.22, 95% CI=[0.04, 0.28]) were significantly above 0, suggesting that a component of the original duration estimates was influenced by the similarity in content between clips. However, the between-group correlations were significantly lower than the within-group correlations (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, as assessed by a permutation test described in the <italic>Materials and methods</italic>). In other words, there is a reliable component of our original participants’ behavior that cannot be captured by accounting for the perceptual and semantic similarity between clips. In summary, having memory of the story induced a qualitatively different pattern of behavior and produced significantly more accurate duration estimates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-3"><title>Correlation between number of event boundaries and duration estimates</title><p>To gain additional evidence that duration estimates were related to contextual change, we looked at the correlation between estimated duration and the number of event boundaries in the interval between the clips. The number of intervening event boundaries can be viewed as a proxy for contextual change, insofar as event boundaries often encompass changes in scene, characters and conversation topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kurby and Zacks, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zacks et al., 2009</xref>).

Thus, our participants’ duration estimates could correlate with the number of event boundaries, even if they were basing their estimates purely on the perceptual similarity between clips. To explore this possibility, we tested whether the number of event boundaries would correlate with duration estimates from naïve participants, who could <italic>only</italic> judge temporal distance based on the similarity between clips, given that they had never heard the story.</p><p>Importantly, we found that the number of event boundaries in an interval did not significantly correlate with duration estimates of naïve participants (<italic>r</italic>=0.09, 95% CI [−0.05, 0.21]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Of course, we cannot definitively prove the null hypothesis that naïve duration estimates do not correlate with the number of event boundaries. However, the correlation between the number of boundaries and duration estimates was significantly higher for our original participants than for naïve participants (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>=0.40, 95% CI [0.15 0.56]). In other words, duration estimates from participants who remembered the story were significantly more correlated with the number of contextual changes between two clips than duration estimates from participants who were judging temporal distance based merely on the similarity between the two clips. This suggests that the number of event boundaries carries information about temporal context that is not contained within the clips alone, and that our original participants’ estimates were influenced by their memory of this contextual information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>fMRI results</title><p>We tested whether BOLD pattern change between two clips correlated with temporal distance estimates, using both ROI and whole-brain searchlight analyses.

In the within-interval analysis, we correlated individual differences in subjective duration for a given interval with individual differences in neural pattern distance for that interval (see <italic>Within-Interval Correlation between Pattern Change and Duration Estimates</italic> and <italic>Within-Interval Whole-brain Searchlight</italic>). The two versions of each analysis were performed in order to rule out the possibility that our effects were driven either by participant or interval random effects. In particular, we were concerned that correlations between neural pattern distance and behavior could reflect sensitivity to perceptual or semantic features of the clips (i.e., clip pairs with similar perceptual/semantic features might be associated with shorter duration estimates and greater neural similarity, relative to clip pairs with more dissimilar features). The within-interval analysis addresses this concern by holding clip identity constant.</p><p>Next, we fit a mixed-effects model for each ROI (see <italic>Mixed-Effects Model Accounting for Naïve Duration Estimates</italic>), in which we estimated whether pattern distance in that ROI could predict duration estimates, even when accounting for participant random effects, item (interval) random effects, as well as naïve duration estimates (which are a proxy for the perceptual and semantic similarity between two clips, see <italic>Behavioral results</italic>).</p><p>Finally, we discuss the brain regions that showed significant effects across all analyses (see <italic>Comparing Results from ROI and Searchlight Analyses</italic>).</p><p>As noted in the Materials and methods, the ROI and searchlight analyses were conducted only on high-confidence two-minute intervals.

This analysis estimates population-level effects of interest, while controlling for the possibility of individual variability between subjects and between clip pairs. In other words, this approach leverages the power of the within-interval analysis to control for the objective content similarity between two clips, while also taking into account variability in the effect across participants. In addition, we included the mean duration estimates from our naïve participants as a covariate in the model (see <italic>Behavioral results</italic>). Since naïve participants had estimated the temporal distance between each pair of clips without hearing the story, this covariate is a further control for the inherent guessability of the temporal distance between two clips. Both controls strengthen our interpretation that the remaining effect of neural pattern distance on duration estimates is driven by the contextual dissimilarity (rather than perceptual or content dissimilarity) between two clips.</p><p>For each anatomical region derived from FreeSurfer and MTL segmentation (42 in each hemisphere), we fit a model where duration estimates were predicted by naïve duration estimates as well as the neural pattern distance in that region (see Materials and methods for the complete formula).

Following the anatomy is particularly important for small, elongated regions like entorhinal cortex and caudal ACC, which are unlikely to be perfectly aligned across participants. For the searchlight analyses, the data needed to be transformed to MNI space in order to aggregate the results; consequently, imperfections in alignment can reduce the significance of searchlight results in these regions.

(2) Since this analysis was performed on anatomical masks derived from FreeSurfer parcellation, they varied substantially in size. To ensure that differences in the speed of pattern change were not due to differences in ROI size, we also performed the multivariate procedure after regressing the vector of ROI sizes (number of voxels) out of the vector of FWHM values for each participant. (3) Finally, we performed the above analysis for every voxel individually. Rather than calculating the mean auto-correlation function of the pattern in every region, we calculated the auto-correlation function of every voxel’s time course and averaged the auto-correlation functions across all the voxels in a given region.

These results suggest that the relationship between duration estimates and pattern dissimilarity in these regions was not driven by a shared effect of story position.

There was no brain region whose pattern of activity changed more at the beginning than at the end of the story. Given that we were looking for a slow change in neural signal (unfolding over the entire course of the story), we thought that our high-pass filter might be removing this slow change; to address this possibility, we analyzed the unfiltered data. When we did this, we found that neural pattern change in the unfiltered data showed a consistent correlation in the <italic>opposite</italic> direction: almost all brain patterns changed more at the end of the story than at the beginning, including the CSF and white matter (<italic>q</italic>&lt;0.05, FDR), suggesting that a signal unrelated to neural processing, such as scanner drift or motion, may cause activity patterns to change more as time passes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 11—source data 1</xref>). Thus, even if the degree of neural pattern change were decreasing over time, we might not be able to detect this effect, as it would have to overcome a global signal in the opposite direction that is not due to neural activity and that is present everywhere, including the CSF.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-6"><title>Replication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jenkins and Ranganath (2010)</xref>: activity at encoding predicts accuracy of temporal context memory</title><p>As described in the Materials and methods (<italic>Time perception test</italic> section), besides estimating the elapsed duration between pairs of clips from the story, participants were given an additional test, where they indicated each clip’s position on the timeline of the story.

Such studies have typically employed <italic>prospective paradigms</italic>, in which participants must deliberately attend to the duration of a stimulus. However, behavioral studies in humans have consistently demonstrated that <italic>retrospective paradigms</italic>, in which participants are asked to estimate the duration of an elapsed interval from memory, tap into different cognitive mechanisms from prospective ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hicks et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zakay and Block, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Block and Zakay, 2008</xref>). In retrospective paradigms, changes in spatial, emotional and cognitive context tend to modulate estimates of elapsed time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Block, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Block and Reed, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sahakyan and Smith, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pollatos et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we used changes in patterns of BOLD activity as a proxy for mental context change. We sought to extend previous neuroimaging work by testing whether neural pattern change predicts duration estimates on the scale of several minutes and in a more naturalistic setting, where spatial location, situational inference, characters, and emotional elements can all drive contextual change.</p><p>Participants were scanned while they listened to a 25-minute radio story and were subsequently asked how much time (in minutes and seconds) had elapsed between pairs of clips from the story (all pairs were in fact two minutes apart). Using this approach, we were able to probe retrospective duration memory repeatedly within participants without needing to interrupt the encoding of the story. This allowed us to leverage within-participant variability in neural pattern change and relate it to a participant’s retrospective duration estimates.</p><p>Using a within-participant anatomical ROI analysis (encompassing 16 regions selected <italic>a priori</italic>), we found that neural pattern distance in the right entorhinal cortex and right pars orbitalis at the time of encoding was correlated with subsequent duration estimates. Extending this analysis to all anatomical ROIs in cortex revealed an additional effect in the left caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These results converged qualitatively with the results of our whole-brain searchlight analysis, which revealed a significant cluster spanning the right anterior temporal lobe.</p><p>To test our interpretation that duration estimates were driven by contextual change, we asked a separate group of participants to identify event boundaries in the story. We found that the number of event boundaries between two clips was very highly correlated with participants’ subsequent duration estimates. Importantly, the number of event boundaries was significantly less correlated with duration estimates for a separate group of 'naïve' participants, who had been asked to estimate the elapsed time between clips without first hearing the story. These behavioral experiments provide evidence that retrospective duration estimates were indeed influenced by memory for intervening contextual changes between clips.</p><p>In addition, we sought to rule out the possibility that neural pattern distance between two clips reflected only the perceptual or semantic similarity between them, rather than the degree of mental context change. We performed a within-interval analysis, in which pattern distances for the same pair of clips were correlated with duration estimates <italic>across participants</italic>. The within-interval ROI analysis yielded effects of the same size in the right entorhinal cortex, right amygdala and right insula. The within-interval whole-brain searchlight revealed a significant cluster in the right anterior temporal lobe. Thus, pattern distance in the right anterior temporal lobe, particularly the right entorhinal cortex, predicted variability in duration estimates even when the perceptual and semantic distance of the clips was controlled as much as possible, suggesting that pattern change in these regions may capture idiosyncratic differences in mental context that cannot be predicted from the stimulus alone.</p><p>Finally, if neural pattern distance between two clips reflected only the similarity in content between them, rather than abstract contextual similarity, we would expect the correlation between pattern distance and duration estimates to be weakened when controlling for naïve duration estimates, which were based solely on the perceptual and semantic similarity between two clips. Fitting a mixed-effects model to each ROI showed that neural pattern distance in the right entorhinal cortex, along with the left caudal ACC, exhibited a significant effect on duration estimates even when all other factors, including random effects of participants and intervals, as well as naïve duration estimates, were controlled for.</p><p>In support of the hypothesis that these regions represent slowly varying contextual information, we found that the right entorhinal cortex, as well as adjacent regions of the MTL, temporal pole and orbitofrontal cortex, had some of the slowest neural pattern change in the entire brain. This is in line with findings that brain regions at the top of the processing hierarchy (furthest from the primary perceptual areas) integrate information over longer time scales and are therefore best suited for representing abstract information extracted from multiple streams of sensory observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stephens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lerner et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our results implicating the right entorhinal cortex in representing context fit well with other results in the literature. Multiple lines of evidence have suggested an important role for the entorhinal cortex in representing relationships between the spatial environment, task and incoming stimuli. Lesions of the lateral entorhinal cortex in rodents have shown that this region is necessary for discriminating between novel and familiar associations of object and place, object and non-spatial context, or place and context, while leaving non-associative forms of memory unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Buckmaster et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wilson et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">2013b</xref>). Moreover, electrophysiological recordings in rats performing a spatial memory task showed that neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex exhibited greater context sensitivity and greater modulation by task-relevant mnemonic information than hippocampal neurons, while hippocampal neurons carried more specific spatial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lipton et al., 2007</xref>). Medial entorhinal neurons also exhibited longer firing periods, which led the authors to propose that they could bind a series of hippocampal representations of distinct events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lipton and Eichenbaum, 2008</xref>). Thus, changes in distributed entorhinal activity patterns on the scale of minutes might represent changes in contextual elements that are later retrieved to make duration judgments (for theoretical discussion of the role of entorhinal cortex in contextual representation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Howard et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>While the right entorhinal cortex was the only medial temporal lobe region that survived FDR correction in both our within-participant and within-interval ROI analyses, our whole-brain searchlights found a significant relationship between pattern change and duration estimates in two extensive clusters that overlapped in the right hippocampus, the right perirhinal cortex, right amygdala and right temporal pole.</p><p>Two previous studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Noulhiane et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ezzyat and Davachi (2014)</xref>, have directly implicated the MTL in retrospective time estimation in humans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ezzyat and Davachi (2014)</xref> scanned participants while they were presented with trial-unique faces and objects on a scene background, which changed every four trials. After each run, participants were asked whether pairs of stimuli had occurred close together or far apart in time (all pairs were about 50 s apart). They found that neural pattern distance in the left hippocampus at the time of encoding was greater for pairs of stimuli later rated as 'far apart', though only when the stimuli were separated by a scene change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Noulhiane et al. (2007)</xref> used a retrospective behavioral paradigm similar to ours in patients with unilateral MTL lesions. In that study, participants were asked to estimate the temporal distance between object pictures that had been randomly inserted into a silent documentary film. They found that the degree of left entorhinal, left perirhinal and left temporopolar cortex damage correlated with the degree to which patients overestimated minutes-long intervals in retrospect. (For related evidence from the animal literature, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jacobs et al., 2013</xref>, who showed that bilateral inactivation of the hippocampus impaired rats’ ability to discriminate between similarly long durations, such as 8 and 12 minutes, but not between less similar intervals, such as 3 and 12 minutes.)</p><p>Our ROI and searchlight results are in line with the above set of findings, and suggest that patients with anterior MTL lesions might be impaired in retrospective time estimation because patterns of activity in entorhinal, perirhinal, and temporopolar cortex encode contextual changes on the scale of minutes. The set of regions we found is more extensive than those in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ezzyat and Davachi (2014)</xref> and mostly right-lateralized. It is possible that the difference in the extent of our effects could be explained by differences in the paradigms that were used. In both the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Noulhiane et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ezzyat and Davachi (2014)</xref> studies, the links between objects and their context had to be deliberately constructed. In our study, the clips whose temporal distance participants estimated were excerpts from a story, and therefore strongly linked with a situational, spatial, and emotional context. Thus, it is possible that activity patterns in a more extensive cluster tracked temporal distance estimates because our auditory story caused changes in a broader set of contextual features.</p><p>Extending our anatomical ROI analysis to the entire brain showed that pattern change in the left caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) predicted subsequent duration estimates, and this region remained significant in a mixed-effects model controlling for the effect of naïve duration estimates. However, caudal ACC exhibited more rapid pattern change than the anterior and medial temporal lobe, suggesting that it may represent a qualitatively different, faster-changing signal. Caudal ACC activity has been shown to increase in response to shifts in task contingencies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shenhav et al., 2013</xref>, for a review) and there is converging evidence that ACC responses are important for adjusting behavior to unexpected changes by increasing attention and learning rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bryden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">O’Reilly et al. (2013)</xref> have provided evidence that the ACC only responds to surprising outcomes when they necessitate updating beliefs about the current state of the world. Although the present study was not designed to test such accounts, our findings are consistent with a role for ACC in updating predictive models. Events in the story that prompt participants to update their beliefs about the characters’ situation are also likely to cause changes in cognitive context and therefore overestimation of duration. However, future studies are needed to test this interpretation, for instance by manipulating belief updating independently of surprise and measuring its effect on retrospective duration estimates.</p><p>In addition to the anatomical ROI analysis, we performed a whole-brain searchlight that yielded an extensive cluster covering the right anterior temporal lobe, extending from the medial temporal regions described above to the middle temporal gyrus and temporal pole. Prior work has suggested that the middle temporal gyrus and temporal pole are involved in narrative comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ferstl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mar, 2004</xref>) and narrative item memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hasson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Maguire et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ezzyat and Davachi (2011)</xref> found a similarly located cluster (extending from the right perirhinal cortex to the right middle temporal gyrus) to be involved in integrating information within narrative events. In particular, they showed that activity within these regions gradually increases within events and that this increase predicts the degree to which memories become clustered within events. Retrospective time judgments have been shown to increase with the number of events an interval contains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Poynter, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zakay et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Faber and Gennari, 2015</xref>), suggesting that brain regions involved in clustering memories by events may carry important information for estimating durations.</p><p>Finally, we were able to replicate an analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jenkins and Ranganath (2010)</xref>, who showed that activity during encoding in the left lateral prefrontal cortex and right anterior hippocampus predicted accuracy in remembering when a trial had occurred in the experiment. Our analysis revealed a cluster in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that is similar to that found in their study. However, we also found significant clusters in the medial prefrontal and medial parietal cortex. These regions may be important for maintaining narrative information over minutes-long timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lerner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hasson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), which might explain why their activity predicted temporal context memory for clips from an auditory story, but did not appear in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jenkins and Ranganath (2010)</xref>, where participants recalled the timing of trials which were not linked by a narrative. Moreover, our clusters overlap highly with the 'posterior medial network' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ritchey and Ranganath, 2012</xref>), which has been consistently implicated in episodic memory, episodic simulation and theory of mind.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>After probing human participants’ time perception for intervals from an auditory story they had just heard, we found substantial variability in subjective estimates of the passage of time. This variability was significantly correlated with changes in BOLD activity patterns in the right anterior temporal lobe, particularly the right entorhinal cortex, between the start and end of each interval. Control experiments demonstrated that duration estimates were strongly driven by contextual boundaries and that the relationship between neural distance and behavior still held when we controlled for the perceptual and semantic similarity of the clips. Our findings suggest that patterns of activity in these regions might encode contextual information that participants can later retrieve to infer the durations of intervals on the scale of minutes. Additional work is needed to assess how these regions contribute to representing particular contextual features (such as physical environment, abstract task states, and emotional states) and whether changes in each of these features affect retrospective duration estimates differently.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>18 participants (13 female) took part in the study.

They were also asked to make the judgments as intuitively as possible, without resorting to deductive reasoning about the sequence of events that unfolded in between the two excerpts.</p><p>Participants had complete control over the pacing of the test. On each question, they initiated the playing of the clips, and were able to replay the clips if they missed them the first time.

Thus, we were faced with the challenge of preserving slower components of the BOLD signal that reflect neural activity, while removing low-frequency components attributable to non-neuronal noise, including scanner drift and physiological noise (such as low-frequency respiratory variation and heart rate variation). Physiological noise (and a substantial component of scanner noise) was factored out using the residualization procedure described above. This enabled us to select a gentler high-pass filter than is generally used in the literature.</p><p>We then performed a separate analysis to determine the optimal high-pass filter cut-off period, i.e. the lowest frequency cut-off that still enabled us to remove most of the non-neuronal noise. This analysis relies on the idea that, when participants listen to the same story or watch the same film, the signal in brain regions processing the story is highly correlated across participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hasson et al., 2004</xref>). While such correlations should not be present in CSF or white matter, spurious inter-subject correlations in these regions can arise due to low-frequency noise. In addition, listening to the same story could induce correlated motion across participants, but these correlations would also be present in CSF and white matter. Thus, we searched for a high-pass filter that could remove nonspecific correlations in CSF and white matter, while preserving correlations in brain regions known to be important for processing the stimulus. For each participant, the inter-subject correlation (ISC) of a brain region was defined as the correlation between that participant’s ROI time course (averaged over voxels in that region) with the average time course of all the other participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hasson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lerner et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Since the functional scan length was 1560 s (26 min), high-pass filter cut-off periods of 140 s, 240 s, 300 s, 400 s, 480 s, 600 s and 720 s were attempted. The minimal cut-off attempted, 140 s, was the cut-off used in several previous studies with naturalistic stimuli (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lerner et al., 2011</xref>), while 720 s represented approximately half of the scan duration and was the longest cut-off that could reasonably make a difference to data quality.</p><p>Given that roughly half the clip pairs in our time perception test were 2 min apart and the other half were 6 min apart, we hoped to find a filter that would allow us to measure pattern distances at both of these time scales. However, we were unable to find a high-pass filter that would allow us to examine activity patterns that were 6 min (360 s) apart. In order to meaningfully measure distances between neural patterns that are 360 s apart, the Nyquist theorem suggests we would need a high-pass filter cut-off of 720 s or larger. However, plotting ISC as a function of high-pass filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>) showed that a cut-off like 720 s was not able to remove inter-subject correlations in the CSF, which remained of the same magnitude as those in some grey matter regions. We concluded that pattern distances at the 6-minute time scale are too confounded with low-frequency noise (as reflected in spurious correlations in the CSF), and therefore restricted our analysis to intervals that were 2 min long.</p><p>According to the Nyquist theorem, we need a filter cut-off of 4 min (240 s) or longer in order to measure distances between patterns that are 2 min apart (120 s). Out of the filters tested (240 s – 720 s), a cut-off of 480 s was selected to be the gentlest (i.e. the longest) filter that reduced the magnitude of inter-subject correlations in ventricles and CSF, such that they were significantly below the correlations in most grey matter regions.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> illustrates that, even for regions like the hippocampus – with relatively low inter-subject correlations – the 480 s filter cut-off, combined with the residualization procedure, succeeded at raising the grey matter ISCs significantly above those of the white matter and CSF.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>fMRI data analysis</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Within-participant correlation between pattern change and duration estimates</title><p>Our primary hypothesis was that greater pattern dissimilarity between two clips (at the time of encoding) would correlate with greater subsequent duration estimates. For each pair of clips from the time perception test, we located the TRs (volumes) corresponding to when the participant first heard those clips and extracted the activity patterns for each ROI at those time points. Since the auditory clips were between 5 s and 10 s in duration (corresponding to about 5 volumes), we averaged the patterns over 5 consecutive TRs for every clip, with the 5-TR window centered on the middle of each clip.</p><p>We then related the pattern distance between the two clips at encoding to how much time the participant thought passed between them. Specifically, we calculated the dissimilarity (1 – Pearson correlation) between the two averaged activity patterns. The pattern dissimilarity scores for a given region were then correlated with that participant’s subsequent duration estimates. This was performed separately for every ROI and searchlight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We thus obtained a Pearson correlation score for every ROI in every participant.

It is possible that participants would invoke different retrieval strategies in such cases (for instance, they might base their duration estimates purely on the content of the clips, without recollecting their context). It is also possible that such estimates could be random guesses. To filter out guesses, we used the confidence ratings collected after the time perception test, in which participants rated how well they could remember when in the story each individual clip had occurred. Specifically, we located the participant’s confidence for the two clips delimiting each temporal interval, and took the smaller of the two ratings as the confidence for that interval. We performed the main analysis relating neural drift to time estimation only on high-confidence intervals, removing pairs of clips with the lowest confidence. Since participants calibrated their confidence ratings differently (some were more prone to rate their confidence as 4/5, while others were more prone to rate it as 2/5), we picked the confidence threshold for each participant that removed at least 33% of the intervals with the lowest confidence, while preserving at least 33% of the intervals with the highest confidence.

To address the concern that pattern distance between two clips might reflect only the difference in story content between those clips (rather than change in abstract factors like mental context), we performed the same analysis for a given interval across participants and aggregated the results across intervals. Since this analysis is performed within intervals, it ensures that story content is held constant across participants, such that differences in pattern distances and duration estimates are due to individual differences only. To ensure that pattern distances and duration estimates were comparable across participants, all vectors were z-scored within participants. The Pearson correlation between pattern distances and duration estimates across participants was then calculated for every 2 min interval in every ROI.</p><p>As for the within-participant analysis, this procedure was performed on high-confidence intervals. For each interval, we only included participants who had confidently recollected the temporal position of the two clips delimiting that particular interval.</p><p>The significance of each correlation score was assessed using a permutation test: 10,000 null correlations were obtained by scrambling the duration estimates across participants, such that a given participant’s duration estimate was matched with a different participant’s pattern distance.

We then averaged the auto-correlation curves across TRs to obtain a mean auto-correlation function for every region in every participant. The more rapidly a pattern changes over time, the more sharply the auto-correlation should decrease as we move away from 0. To quantify this, we defined the Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) of the auto-correlation curve as the number of time points (TRs) for which the auto-correlation was equal to or greater than half its maximum value (the maximum was always 1.)</p><p>To compare the speed of pattern change in the regions we found (right entorhinal cortex and left caudal ACC) with regions involved in auditory and language processing, we performed a paired Wilcoxon signed rank test on the FWHM values across participants. The p-values from this test were subjected to multiple comparisons correction using FDR.</p><p>Since the anatomical masks we used varied substantially in size, we sought to ensure that differences in the speed of pattern change were not due to differences in ROI size. For this purpose, we performed the same analysis after regressing the vector of ROI sizes out of the vector of FWHM values for every participant.</p><p>Since the above regression would only account for a linear effect of ROI size on the speed of pattern change, we additionally performed a univariate analysis that calculated the auto-correlation function for each voxel individually. The auto-correlation curve was obtained by correlating the BOLD time course of every voxel with itself at all possible lags. The mean auto-correlation for an ROI was obtained by averaging the auto-correlation curves across all the voxels in that ROI. The FWHM values were then calculated in the same manner as above for every ROI in every participant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-9"><title>Replication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jenkins and Ranganath (2010)</xref> 'coarse temporal memory' fMRI analysis</title><p>As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jenkins and Ranganath (2010)</xref>, we correlated each voxel’s activity during encoding of a clip with the accuracy of a participant’s placement of that clip on the timeline. Voxel activity was averaged over a 5-TR window centered on the mid-point of the clip. For each participant, the estimated clip position on the timeline was regressed against actual position. Accuracy was defined as the negative error, which was the absolute value of the residual for a clip. Within participants, voxel activity was then correlated with accuracy across all clips, and the Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> score was Fisher-transformed. As for the within-participant searchlight analysis, transformed <italic>r</italic> score maps were registered to 3mm MNI space, and FSL’s <italic>randomise</italic> was used to control the FWE rate.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Lucy Lin for her assistance with data collection for the event boundary experiment.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior editor) and two peer reviewers and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The logic of the paper is that in some regions (notably EC and pars orbitalis) the RSA distance between the multivoxel response at two moments predicts the time subjects judge between those two events later on. The authors argue that this result suggests that retrospective time judgements depend on a gradually changing state of temporal context that resides in these regions. If we take its conclusions at face value, this paper would make an important contribution. The paper is potentially an important advance over previous studies because it uses realistic stimuli.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't quite accept the conclusions. The fundamental problem is that I can imagine obtaining the result without any memory demands whatsoever. Imagine that the participants were played audio clips from a radio drama and asked to judge how far apart they were in the show. Let's say for one pair of clips both have the sound of the ocean in the background and the same speakers speaking. The other pair of clips does not sound alike---different people are speaking in different locations. Which of these pairs would be judged to be closer in time? Now, insofar as an aspect of brain activity measures any property of the clips (power spectrum, semantic content, etc), we would readily expect that brain activity to correctly categorize the pairs of clips. But this is certainly not a memory effect as by construction, there is no actual memory for anything. This account seems to naturally account for the finding that many many brain regions show a tendency towards a correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), although most of them do not reach significance.</p><p>I would feel much better about accepting the conclusions if, rather than assessing significance relative to chance, the analysis was done relative to some control region that ought to be sensitive to auditory and/or semantic similarity. I am not enough of an expert in the auditory system (or fMRI more broadly) to suggest a specific comparison region, but as it is I think the conclusions either need to be significantly moderated or the empirical support for those conclusions needs to be stronger.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Using multivoxel pattern similarity, the authors find that right entorhinal cortex, right ATL, right pars orbitalis and left ACC show patterns of activity that correlate with cued retrospective duration judgments while keeping objective duration constant. They show this using both an ROI and searchlight approach and find an overlapping, though not completely identical, set of regions which they attribute to differences between the two methods in size, shape, and respect of anatomical boundaries. The experiment is interesting and methodologically sound but would be more impactful if the authors did more work to understand what is driving their effect. As is, the authors don't do much to make the reader excited about the findings or to better differentiate it from prior related work.</p><p>For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> suggests that certain pairs of story clips are consistently rated as closer together versus further apart. There appears to be no attempt to characterize what features of the story drive this effect. Moreover, it is unclear how much such features may produce the effect of neural dissimilarity correlating with greater distance judgments. For instance, if two clips with two different sets of characters are rated as further apart that two clips with the same set of characters, the regions that show dissimilarity scaling with subjective duration may be those sensitive specifically to characters rather than context more broadly. Thus an alternate explanation for their results is that the regions that show their effect are just sensitive to the content of the story that can produce both neural dissimilarity and greater duration ratings. The authors should discuss/examine this alternative.</p><p>One analysis that might support their account of effects being due to gradual change in context tracking regions would be to split their 2 min interval into 20-30s chunks and see if the change is indeed gradual. Otherwise the dissimilarity measure could be simply a result in differences in evoked activity between the two time points, which would be more likely if the effects were due to content sensitivity.</p><p>It would be informative to know whether the pattern similarity values in their regions correlate with each other as they should if they are tracking the same context state representation?</p><p>Did duration ratings change as a function of position in the story? One could imagine that overall recency would have an effect on duration judgments. And if so, did pattern similarity values change?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neural pattern change during encoding of a narrative predicts retrospective duration estimates&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marc Howard (Reviewer #1); Lila Davachi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) Please analyze and report univariate data – to see if they replicate Jenkins and Ranganath – or not.</p><p>2) Focus the paper more on the host of regions that show a slowly changing neural signal over time – instead of focusing on entorhinal and pars orbitalis (area 47).</p><p>3) Please discuss the divergence in their neural data from the primacy and recency effects in behavior.</p><p>4) Please test control duration judgments vs experimental duration judgments directly. If there's a reliable effect, then at least part of what they're calling mental context is most likely not mental context. This outcome probably does not lead to an <italic>eLife</italic> paper.</p><p>5) Given that there isn't a reliable effect, the reviewers need to be convinced that this lack of an effect is meaningful. One way to do this would be to do a power analysis. Another way would be to place a confidence interval on the correlation and show that the correlation, while possibly non-zero, would have to be so small we wouldn't care about it. Even better if you can argue it would have to be so small it couldn't account for the correlation between the experimental judgments and the drift. There are also fancy ways to approach this (e.g., Bayesian inference). In sum, the authors need to make a positive case for the null if they want to argue that this is a memory effect rather than some property of their stimuli.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>On the previous round of review, my major concern was that the change attributed to putative contextual drift that correlates with duration judgments could more simply be attributed to perceptual/semantic differences in the patterns themselves. Real world stimuli that unfold in time are autocorrelated over just about every time scale. Compounding the problem, it is impossible to measure the similarity on all relevant dimensions. This revision makes a substantive attempt to argue against the perceptual hypothesis, there are two behavioral controls that attempt to address the question of whether the results attributed to contextual change could be driven by perceptual effects. To summarize my reaction to the revision, while the controls make for a stronger case than the previous submission, I am not convinced that these controls address the concern in a satisfactory way. I suggest additional analyses with the existing data that could clarify this point. If this concern were resolved (which is not at all clear) the manuscript would result in a very nice contribution.</p><p>The first control asks subjects to describe event boundaries during presentation of the story. This allows a rough estimate of the change in context between the two clips. Indeed the number of event boundaries predicted duration judgments by the original participants. The assumption seems to be that there is no perceptual/semantic similarity across event boundaries, but is not an assumption that I can accept. Imagine a story where Alice and Betty have a discussion at the beach. Then there's an event boundary and Alice and Betty move to the coffee shop. Then there's another event boundary as Alice leaves and Betty and Chris have a conversation in the coffee shop. The number of event boundaries correlates with the overlap of perceptual/semantic features present in the scene. More broadly, if the perceptual/semantic content is autocorrelated over long time scales (and it almost surely is) and if event boundaries are a proxy for abrupt drops in the autocorrelation, then number of event boundaries really ought to predict perceptual/semantic similarity of the available features. So this control is not at all convincing.</p><p>In the second control, a group of naive subjects are asked to rate the similarity of the clips. There is no evidence that their ratings correspond to the number of event boundaries between the clips. The suggestion is that because number of event boundaries indexes contextual change (but not presumably perceptual/semantic similarity), the null result requires us to accept that there is no difference in the similarity of the two clips. Leaving aside for a moment the issue of asking the reader to accept the null (which is a really serious problem!), this is kind of an indirect test of what we're really after. The finding is that duration judgments of the fMRI subjects correlate with number of event boundaries whereas the judgments of the naive controls do not correlate with number of event boundaries. Why not just ask whether the judgments of the fMRI subjects correlate with the judgments of the naive subjects? If they do, then there is no way to argue that the change in the multivoxel signal is due to contextual drift per se. It might be possible to partial out the effect attributable to the naive subjects' judgments. If there is not a correlation, then the authors still have to successfully argue for the null, but it's at least a clean and direct (and much more sensitive!) test of the question of interest.</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>This revision has been responsive to prior concerns about whether visual or semantic dissimilarity during temporal memory judgments could be used to infer how far apart the clips had been presented during encoding. The authors conducted behavioral analyses to show that distance judgments were related to listening to the story and could not be deduced based on the test stimuli alone. They show that the number of event boundaries experienced in between the test stimuli also modulated distance judgments. These new results remove any doubts that the reported effects are not driven by visual confounds.</p><p>However, I am somehow not that excited about the new ms as it now provides a list of more regions that show pattern change related to distance judgments – much of the medial temporal lobe, frontal cortex, anterior temporal cortex, ACC… given the effects are more widespread, the laser focus on entorhinal and pars orbitalis makes the paper not easy to digest. Is this a general broad signal? Or is it focused?</p><p>Also new data that has been added in response to other concerns that now raise some skepticism. The most intrusive is the fact that distance judgments vary predictably by 'list' position – events early in the audiovisual recording are remembered as farther apart than those later in the tape. (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> – top panel). However, pattern similarity estimates do not track this behavioral effect. This result raises questions about why, if entorhinal and frontal cortex are representing temporal context signal, would they not also some what mirror the behavioral judgments. I could imagine that context representations may play less of a role as item memory fades? This is not discussed but should be for the authors' views on this to be clear. Otherwise, the impact of the final result is unclear.</p><p>In my original review, I had requested that they examine whether univariate activity was related to temporal memory success. The did run that analysis but only in entorhinal cortex and pars orbitalis -and do not see any effects but beg off reporting it since they did not have <italic>a priori</italic> predictions about it. however, published work (Jenkins and Ranganath) has shown that univariate activity in more dorsal parts of lateral frontal cortex is related to coarse temporal memory judgments. so there is a clear precedent for this effect. I am not sure why they say they did not have that prediction but this analysis, even if the results DO NOT show a univariate effect would be informative and could even bolster their conclusions that patterns across time, rather than activity to any single event, is a better predictor of temporal memory judgments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16070.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The logic of the paper is that in some regions (notably EC and pars orbitalis) the RSA distance between the multivoxel response at two moments predicts the time subjects judge between those two events later on.

In order to address them, we conducted two new behavioral experiments, as well as two new analyses of the neural data:</p><p>1) We show that our participants' duration estimates correlate strongly with the number of event boundaries between two clips, suggesting that their estimates were influenced by their memory for the content of the story in between two clips (rather than the similarity between the two clips alone).</p><p>2) A separate group of participants was asked to complete the same time perception test without first listening to the story. Since these &quot;naive participants&quot; had no memory of the story, they could only base their duration estimates on the similarity between the two clips. We show that duration estimates from these naive participants do not correlate with the number of event boundaries between two clips, proving that the intervening content between clips does not influence duration estimates when participants have no memory of the story.</p><p>3) A related concern was that neural pattern change might be driven by the perceptual and semantic dissimilarity of the clips, rather than the degree of contextual drift between the clips. To address this, we performed a within-interval version of our main ROI analysis. This analysis holds constant the two clips whose pattern distance is being measured. We show that individual differences in neural pattern change for a given pair of clips correlate with individual differences in duration estimates in the right entorhinal cortex and right pars orbitalis, as well as other regions that had been sub-threshold in our main analysis. Thus, pattern change in these regions correlates with duration estimates even when the perceptual and semantic content of the two clips is held constant. If neural pattern change were being driven by story content, we would have expected the effect to be larger for the across-interval, within-participants analysis (where story content differed across intervals) than for the across-participants, within- interval version of the analysis (where story content is held constant). The fact that the effect was similar in size for the two analyses suggests that story content is not a major factor driving the observed correlation between neural pattern change and duration estimates.</p><p>4) We show that patterns of activity in entorhinal cortex and pars orbitalis change significantly more slowly over time than patterns in cortical regions implicated in auditory and language processing, suggesting that they may integrate information over longer time scales.</p><p>We believe, and we hope the reviewer will agree, that these analyses directly address and alleviate the concern that our results could be obtained &quot;without any memory demands whatsoever&quot;.</p><p>A summary of the new analyses is now presented in a section titled &quot;Factors Driving the Correlation between Pattern Change and Duration Estimates&quot;:</p><p>“[…]we conducted two control behavioral studies. One group of participants indicated when event boundaries were occurring in the story. […]Moreover, pattern change in the right entorhinal cortex correlates highly with pattern change in the right pars orbitalis, suggesting that the two regions may cooperate to represent different facets of a unified, slowly changing context signal.”</p><p>A more detailed description of each analysis follows this section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>Using multivoxel pattern similarity, the authors find that right entorhinal cortex, right ATL, right pars orbitalis and left ACC show patterns of activity that correlate with cued retrospective duration judgments while keeping objective duration constant.

As is, the authors don't do much to make the reader excited about the findings or to better differentiate it from prior related work.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for their comments on how to increase the impact of the work. As described below, we have made several substantial changes to the paper to further specify what is driving our effect.</p><p><italic>For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> suggests that certain pairs of story clips are consistently rated as closer together versus further apart. There appears to be no attempt to characterize what features of the story drive this effect. Moreover, it is unclear how much such features may produce the effect of neural dissimilarity correlating with greater distance judgments. For instance, if two clips with two different sets of characters are rated as further apart that two clips with the same set of characters, the regions that show dissimilarity scaling with subjective duration may be those sensitive specifically to characters rather than context more broadly. Thus an alternate explanation for their results is that the regions that show their effect are just sensitive to the content of the story that can produce both neural dissimilarity and greater duration ratings. The authors should discuss/examine this alternative.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this important concern. Reviewer #1 raised essentially the same question: are the regions that show dissimilarity scaling with subjective duration sensitive to story content (e.g., which characters are present), rather than to context more broadly? Please see our response to Reviewer # 1 above (Major comment #1), in which we describe new behavioral control experiments and new neural analyses. The behavioral controls suggest that the number of event boundaries between two clips is a strong driver of duration estimates (but only for participants who have heard the story), and may be the reason why duration estimates are so consistent across participants. We also present a new neural analysis showing that all of the regions we found display a significant correlation between neural pattern dissimilarity and duration estimates across participants for a given pair of clips, in other words, even when the (objective) content of the story is held constant.</p><p>A summary of the new analyses is now presented in the section titled &quot;Factors Driving the Correlation between Pattern Change and Duration Estimates&quot;; a more detailed description of each analysis follows this section.</p><p><italic>One analysis that might support their account of effects being due to gradual change in context tracking regions would be to split their 2 min interval into 20-30s chunks and see if the change is indeed gradual. Otherwise the dissimilarity measure could be simply a result in differences in evoked activity between the two time points, which would be more likely if the effects were due to content sensitivity.</italic> </p><p>We greatly appreciated the reviewer's suggestion to &quot;split the 2 min interval into 20-30s chunks and see if the change is indeed gradual&quot;, and decided to expand on this idea to analyze the speed of pattern change across the entire story timecourse.</p><p>We quantified the speed of pattern change by calculating the auto-correlation of the pattern in a given region for every time point (TR) and averaging across time points to obtain a mean auto- correlation curve. The full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of this curve was taken as a measure of pattern change speed (the wider the peak of this curve is, the more gradually the pattern changes over time). We found that patterns of activity in the right entorhinal cortex and right pars orbitalis changed significantly more slowly than patterns in the right transverse temporal cortex (primary auditory cortex), right banks of the superior temporal sulcus and right superior temporal cortex (involved in auditory and language processing). Importantly, we also found that the right entorhinal cortex and right pars orbitalis, along with neighboring regions in the temporal pole, medial temporal lobe, orbitofrontal cortex and frontal pole, had the highest FWHMs (slowest pattern change) in the entire brain.</p><p>These results are now presented in the manuscript (section titled &quot;Patterns of activity in entorhinal cortex and pars orbitalis change slowly over time&quot;).</p><p>Since the anatomical masks used in the above analysis were of different sizes, we performed two control analyses to ensure that differences in the speed of pattern change were not due to differences in ROI size.</p><p>First, we regressed the vector of ROI size out of the vector of FWHM values across regions for every participant. This modified analysis replicated the results reported above: the entorhinal cortex, pars orbitalis, as well as other ROIs in the anterior temporal lobe, medial temporal lobe and orbitofrontal cortex, still had the slowest pattern change in the brain, and significantly slower than in primary auditory cortex. These results are reported in the manuscript.</p><p>Second, we performed a univariate version of the above analysis by calculating the auto- correlation function of each voxel individually, averaging the auto-correlation curves across all voxels of a given ROI and then computing the FWHM value for the average curve. The univariate analysis replicated the above findings, and showed that the right entorhinal cortex ROI had the slowest changing voxels of all the regions in our atlas. These results are reported in the manuscript.</p><p>Taken together, we feel that these new analyses provide strong support for our interpretation that entorhinal cortex and pars orbitalis process information that changes gradually over time.</p><p><italic>It would be informative to know whether the pattern similarity values in their regions correlate with each other as they should if they are tracking the same context state representation?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that regions tracking the same context state representation should have correlated pattern change values across two-minute intervals. To explore this, we extracted the pattern dissimilarity for each of the 24 pairs of clips (which were 2 min apart) and averaged the vectors across participants. The correlation between the mean pattern distance vectors in the right entorhinal cortex and right pars orbitalis was r = 0.73. In order to interpret the magnitude of this correlation, we also calculated the correlation between every possible pair of mean pattern distance vectors (for all 84 anatomical masks). This resulted in a distribution of 3486 correlations for every possible pair of regions ((84 x 84 – 84) I 2 = 3486).</p><p>Out of 3486 pairs of regions, only 242 exhibited a correlation that was higher than the one observed between the right entorhinal and right pars orbitalis. Thus, the correlation between the pattern distances in these two regions is higher than for 93% of region pairs.</p><p>A phase randomization procedure showed that the likelihood of obtaining a correlation of this magnitude by chance – given the auto-correlation in the pattern change vectors – was p=0.0011.</p><p>The strong correlation in pattern change between the two regions suggests that they may cooperate to represent different facets of a unified, slowly changing context signal.</p><p>This analysis is now reported in greater detail in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Did duration ratings change as a function of position in the story? One could imagine that overall recency would have an effect on duration judgments. And if so, did pattern similarity values change?</italic> </p><p>Duration estimates did change as a function of position in the story, with earlier intervals being estimated as longer than later intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). The correlation between the estimated duration of an interval and its time in the story was consistently negative across participants (M= -0.40, SD= 0.22; t(16)= -7.59, p&lt;0.00001). These results replicate the positive time-order effect, which is the finding that people judge earlier durations in a series of durations to be longer than later durations (Block, 1982, 1985; Brown &amp; Stubbs, 1988). The effect has been interpreted to mean that context changes more rapidly at the start of a novel episode (Block, 1982, 1986).</p><p>Interestingly, the pattern dissimilarity values in right entorhinal cortex and right pars orbitalis did not exhibit the same overall decrease across time. In fact, there was no consistent correlation between pattern change during an interval and its time in the story for the right entorhinal cortex (M=0.03, SD=0.21; t(16)= 0.65; p=0.53) or the right pars orbitalis (M=-0.10, SD=0.22; t(16)= -1.83, p=0.09). These results suggest that the relationship between duration estimates and pattern dissimilarity in these regions was not driven by a shared linear trend. Rather, it seems that pattern dissimilarity in these regions correlated with more fine-grained variations in the estimated durations of nearby intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><p>This analysis is now presented in the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Please analyze and report univariate data – to see if they replicate Jenkins and Ranganath – or not.</italic> </p><p><italic>2) Focus the paper more on the host of regions that show a slowly changing neural signal over time – instead of focusing on entorhinal and pars orbitalis (area 47).</italic> </p><p><italic>3) Please discuss the divergence in their neural data from the primacy and recency effects in behavior.</italic> </p><p><italic>4) Please test control duration judgments vs experimental duration judgments directly.

One way to do this would be to do a power analysis. Another way would be to place a confidence interval on the correlation and show that the correlation, while possibly non-zero, would have to be so small we wouldn't care about it. Even better if you can argue it would have to be so small it couldn't account for the correlation between the experimental judgments and the drift. There are also fancy ways to approach this (e.g., Bayesian inference). In sum, the authors need to make a positive case for the null if they want to argue that this is a memory effect rather than some property of their stimuli.</italic> </p><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their tremendously helpful comments, which have guided our revisions and inspired us to add new analyses that we feel have substantially improved the rigor of our contribution. These revisions have also enabled us to reorganize our manuscript into a far more coherent structure that helps highlight the consistency of our findings across analyses.</p><p>The following is a summary of the most important changes.</p><p>Reviewer 1 was concerned that, if our original behavioral data is correlated with the behavioral data from the control (naïve) group who had not heard the story, then a component of our original behavior could be correlated with the perceptual or semantic similarity between clip pairs and that this component could be driving the correlation with neural pattern change. We address this concern in the following ways:</p><p>First, we emphasize the importance of the within-interval analysis, which correlates individual differences in subjective duration for a pair of clips with individual differences in neural pattern drift. This analysis holds constant the objective similarity of the two clips and leverages variance across participants. In addition to the ROI analysis from the previous version of the manuscript, we report a new searchlight version of the within-interval analysis, demonstrating that a cluster in the right anterior temporal lobe, overlapping with the right entorhinal region found in the ROI analysis, is significant even when the objective similarity between two clips is controlled for.</p><p>Second, we perform a highly conservative mixed-effects version of the ROI analysis. For each ROI, we fit a model that estimates the population-level effect of neural pattern distance on duration estimates, while controlling for individual variability between participants and between clip pairs. This analysis combines the virtues of both the within-participant and within-interval analyses. We show that the right entorhinal cortex and left caudal ACC exhibit confidence intervals that do not include 0, even when the most conservative fitting procedure and power transform of the behavioral data are applied. Moreover, we show that these effects are not weakened by including the mean duration estimates from the control (naïve) group in the model.</p><p>The new analyses above also help us to address the concern from Reviewer 2 that, while we reported effects in a distributed set of brain regions, our discussion focused on only two or three of those regions. The revised manuscript explicitly synthesizes the findings from all of the above analyses in a section entitled “Comparing Results from ROI and Searchlight Analyses”. The synthesis shows that regions of the right anterior temporal lobe, peaking in the right entorhinal cortex, emerge consistently across the within-participant and within-interval versions of the ROI and searchlight analyses, as well as the mixed-effects ROI analysis.</p><p>As requested by Reviewer 2, in the new manuscript, we discuss in detail the lack of linear decrease in neural pattern change with time in the story. Raw fMRI data prior to high-pass filtering shows that if such a trend were present, it would be obscured by an existing linear trend in the opposite direction, which seems to be caused by non-neuronal scanner artifacts.</p><p>Finally, we report an exciting new replication of the Jenkins and Ranganath (2010) coarse temporal memory analysis. After performing a whole-brain univariate analysis, we find a significant correlation between activity during encoding of a clip and the participant’s later accuracy in placing that clip on the timeline of the story in extensive clusters of the lateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC) and dorsomedial PFC, as well as sub-threshold clusters in the medial parietal. Our results suggest the importance of the default mode network in subsequent memory for the temporal context of a clip, especially when the clip is part of a coherent narrative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p><italic>On the previous round of review, my major concern was that the change attributed to putative contextual drift that correlates with duration judgments could more simply be attributed to perceptual/semantic differences in the patterns themselves. Real world stimuli that unfold in time are autocorrelated over just about every time scale. Compounding the problem, it is impossible to measure the similarity on all relevant dimensions. This revision makes a substantive attempt to argue against the perceptual hypothesis, there are two behavioral controls that attempt to address the question of whether the results attributed to contextual change could be driven by perceptual effects. To summarize my reaction to the revision, while the controls make for a stronger case than the previous submission, I am not convinced that these controls address the concern in a satisfactory way. I suggest additional analyses with the existing data that could clarify this point. If this concern were resolved (which is not at all clear) the manuscript would result in a very nice contribution.</italic> </p><p> <italic>The first control asks subjects to describe event boundaries during presentation of the story. This allows a rough estimate of the change in context between the two clips. Indeed the number of event boundaries predicted duration judgments by the original participants. The assumption seems to be that there is no perceptual/semantic similarity across event boundaries, but is not an assumption that I can accept. Imagine a story where Alice and Betty have a discussion at the beach. Then there's an event boundary and Alice and Betty move to the coffee shop. Then there's another event boundary as Alice leaves and Betty and Chris have a conversation in the coffee shop. The number of event boundaries correlates with the overlap of perceptual/semantic features present in the scene. More broadly, if the perceptual/semantic content is autocorrelated over long time scales (and it almost surely is) and if event boundaries are a proxy for abrupt drops in the autocorrelation, then number of event boundaries really ought to predict perceptual/semantic similarity of the available features. So this control is not at all convincing.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this important concern and completely agree that the number of event boundaries between two clips should correlate with the degree of perceptual and semantic dissimilarity between them. In fact, we discussed this possibility in the previous version of the manuscript but did not make it sufficiently explicit in our argument:</p><p>In the previous manuscript, we showed that the number of event boundaries between two clips was significantly more correlated with original duration estimates than with naïve duration estimates. Based on this result, we concluded that having memory of the story caused the original participants to be more influenced by the number of event boundaries. In other words, we hoped to infer that our original participants were influenced by their memory of events that had occurred between the two clips when estimating durations.</p><p>We have modified this section in order to better emphasize this logic and placed it in the Behavioral Results section of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“However, it is important to note that the number of event boundaries between two clips also influences the perceptual and semantic similarity between them (e.g., clips from the same scene might sound more similar than clips from different scenes). […] This suggests that the number of event boundaries carries information about temporal context that is not contained within the clips alone, and that our original participants’ estimates were influenced by their memory of this contextual information.”</p><p><italic>In the second control, a group of naive subjects are asked to rate the similarity of the clips. There is no evidence that their ratings correspond to the number of event boundaries between the clips. The suggestion is that because number of event boundaries indexes contextual change (but not presumably perceptual/semantic similarity), the null result requires us to accept that there is no difference in the similarity of the two clips. Leaving aside for a moment the issue of asking the reader to accept the null (which is a really serious problem!), this is kind of an indirect test of what we're really after. The finding is that duration judgments of the fMRI subjects correlate with number of event boundaries whereas the judgments of the naive controls do not correlate with number of event boundaries. Why not just ask whether the judgments of the fMRI subjects correlate with the judgments of the naive subjects? If they do, then there is no way to argue that the change in the multivoxel signal is due to contextual drift per se. It might be possible to partial out the effect attributable to the naive subjects' judgments. If there is not a correlation, then the authors still have to successfully argue for the null, but it's at least a clean and direct (and much more sensitive!) test of the question of interest.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the importance of discussing the correlation between original behavior and naïve behavior. In the previous manuscript, we did correlate the naïve duration judgments directly with the original duration judgments and reported the results:</p><p>“The inter-subject correlation in duration estimates was as strong for naïve participants (M=0.43, SD=0.18) as for our original participants (M=0.43, SD=0.25), suggesting that they used a consistent strategy to estimate durations. However, when we correlated duration estimates from our original group of participants with those of our naïve participants, we found that between-group correlations (M=0.18, SD=0.22) were significantly lower than the within-group correlations (p&lt;0.0001, as assessed by a permutation test described in the Materials and methods). This suggests that while both groups used a consistent strategy to estimate durations, the nature of the strategy differed across groups.”</p><p>Using these results, we never meant to argue that <italic>none</italic> of the original duration estimates could be explained by the perceptual or semantic similarity of the clips. In other words, we never meant to argue for the null. In fact, we feel it would be surprising if the duration estimates did not correlate with perceptual and semantic similarity, since presumably a large component of mental context change is driven by changes in perceptual and semantic changes.</p><p>By showing that the within-group correlations were significantly stronger than the between-group correlations, we hoped only to show that the two groups were using qualitatively different strategies. Together with the significantly greater correlation between original estimates and event boundaries, we hope these results show that there is a component of the duration estimates that was driven by memory and that could not be explained by perceptual similarity alone.</p><p>To avoid a misinterpretation of the argument, we have made these claims more explicit in the revised manuscript. We have also added confidence intervals for the within-group and between-group correlations.</p><p>“When we correlated duration estimates from our original group of participants with those of our naïve participants, we found that the between-group correlations (M=0.18, SD=0.22, 95% CI=[0.04, 0.28]) were significantly above 0, suggesting that a component of the original duration estimates was influenced by the similarity in content between clips. However, the between-group correlations were significantly lower than the within-group correlations (p&lt;0.0001, as assessed by a permutation test described in the Materials and methods). In other words, there is a reliable component of our original participants’ behavior that cannot be captured by accounting for the perceptual and semantic similarity between clips. In summary, having memory of the story induced a qualitatively different pattern of behavior and produced significantly more accurate duration estimates.”</p><p>Most importantly, we did not mean to argue that these behavioral results show anything about the neural data. In the previous manuscript, we attempted to delimit the implications of the behavioral data, and to point out that only the within-interval neural analysis enables us to rule out perceptual similarity as an explanation of the neural effects:</p><p>“These results suggest that duration estimates do not correlate with the number of contextual changes when participants are judging temporal distance based purely on the content of the clips. […]</p><p>However, it is still possible that pattern distance in the brain regions we found correlates with the component of duration estimates that is driven by the perceptual and semantic similarity between clips, rather than by contextual changes. To rule out this possibility, we performed a version of our main analysis that holds constant the perceptual and semantic similarity between two clips.”</p><p>In the within-interval analysis, we correlated individual differences in subjective duration for a given interval with individual differences in neural pattern distance for that interval. By performing the correlation within a given interval, we hold constant the perceptual and semantic content of the two clips and only leverage individual differences in how long the interval appeared retrospectively.</p><p>To better emphasize the importance of the within-interval analysis as a control for the objective similarity between two clips, we have placed the within-interval ROI analysis in the Results section of the revised manuscript, directly after the within-participant ROI analysis. We have also added a whole-brain searchlight version of the within-interval analysis, which we have placed directly after within-participant whole-brain searchlight, in the revised manuscript. Throughout the Results and Discussion of the revised manuscript, we have tried to highlight the importance of showing that a brain region is significant in both the within-participant analysis, which controls for subject random effects, and the within-interval analysis, which controls for item random effects. This is particularly evident in the section entitled “Comparing Results from ROI and Searchlight Analyses” (pp. 33-35), where we highlight that the right entorhinal cortex was the only ROI that survived both types of analyses, whereas the searchlight clusters from both types of analyses overlapped in areas like the right amygdala, right temporal pole and right posterior parahippocampal gyrus.</p><p>Mixed-Effects Modeling</p><p>In addition to the within-interval analysis, we sought to more thoroughly address the concern that patterns of activity in the regions we found might represent the perceptual or semantic content of the clips, rather than abstract contextual information. For this purpose, we fit a mixed-effects model to the data from each ROI, controlling for the effect of naïve duration estimates. For each ROI, we fit a model of this form:</p><p><italic>SubjectiveDuration ~ 1 + NeuralDistance + NaiveDuration + (1 + NeuralDistance | Interval) + (1 + NeuralDistance + NaiveDuration | Subject)</italic> </p><p>As described in the revised manuscript,</p><p>“This analysis estimates population-level effects of interest, while controlling for the possibility of individual variability between subjects and between clip pairs. In other words, this approach leverages the power of the within-interval analysis to control for the objective content similarity between two clips, while also taking into account variability in the effect across participants. In addition, we included the mean duration estimates from our naïve participants as a covariate in the model (see Behavioral Results). Since naïve participants had estimated the temporal distance between each pair of clips without hearing the story, this covariate is a further control for the inherent guessability of the temporal distance between two clips. Both controls strengthen our interpretation that the remaining effect of neural pattern distance on duration estimates is driven by the contextual dissimilarity (rather than perceptual or content dissimilarity) between two clips.”</p><p>Out of the 84 anatomical ROIs, we found that the fixed effect of neural pattern distance on duration estimates was positive (i.e., had bootstrapped confidence intervals that did not include 0) in the right entorhinal cortex and left caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We also found near-significant effects in the right amygdala and right superior temporal cortex. In this model, a significant fixed effect means that the effect generalizes to the population, even after variability across participants and intervals, as well as the other covariates (i.e., naïve duration estimates) have been accounted for.</p><p>Importantly, including the naïve duration estimates in the model did not have a significant impact on the size of the fixed effect in these regions, suggesting that the relationship between neural distance and duration estimates was not driven solely by the perceptual or semantic dissimilarity between clips. These results are detailed in subsection “Mixed-Effects Model Accounting for Naïve Duration Estimates” of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p><italic>This revision has been responsive to prior concerns about whether visual or semantic dissimilarity during temporal memory judgments could be used to infer how far apart the clips had been presented during encoding. The authors conducted behavioral analyses to show that distance judgments were related to listening to the story and could not be deduced based on the test stimuli alone. They show that the number of event boundaries experienced in between the test stimuli also modulated distance judgments. These new results remove any doubts that the reported effects are not driven by visual confounds.</italic> </p><p> <italic>However, I am somehow not that excited about the new ms as it now provides a list of more regions that show pattern change related to distance judgments – much of the medial temporal lobe, frontal cortex, anterior temporal cortex, ACC… given the effects are more widespread, the laser focus on entorhinal and pars orbitalis makes the paper not easy to digest. Is this a general broad signal? Or is it focused?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this inconsistency between the breadth of our results and the focus on two specific regions in our discussion. Our Results section has undergone substantial revisions, which now make it easier to compare and synthesize the results across analyses.</p><p>We have restructured the Results section to have the following sub-sections:</p><p>1) Within-participant ROI analysis</p><p>2) Within-interval ROI analysis</p><p>3) Mixed-Effects ROI analysis</p><p>4) Within-participant Searchlight analysis</p><p>5) Within-interval Searchlight analysis</p><p>6) Comparing ROI and Searchlight analyses</p><p>Sub-section 1 reports significant effects in the right entorhinal, right pars orbitalis and left caudal ACC. Sub-section 2 reports significant effects in the right entorhinal, right amygdala and right insula. Sub-section 3 reports significant effects in the right entorhinal cortex and left caudal ACC. Sub-sections 4 and 5 both report significant clusters in the right anterior temporal lobe.</p><p>Sub-section 6 summarizes all the above results and highlights the fact that only the right entorhinal cortex reliably survived all versions of the ROI analysis, whereas the searchlight clusters overlap with this region as well as parts of the right amygdala, temporal pole, anterior middle temporal gyrus and posterior parahippocampal gyrus. Thus, our final results are localized to the right anterior temporal lobe, peaking in the right entorhinal cortex.</p><p>Please note that the results for the within-interval ROI analysis (sub-section 2) have changed very slightly in the revised manuscript. When we were reproducing these results, we noticed a mistake in the MATLAB code, which used a slightly different threshold to determine which intervals were labeled as “confident”. In the rest of the paper, we ensured that the confidence threshold for each participant would keep at least <italic>1/3</italic> of the behavioral data. However, for the within-interval analysis, we had mistakenly used a confidence threshold for each participant that would keep at least <italic>1/2</italic> of the behavioral data. Thus, the within-interval analysis was mistakenly using more of the behavioral data (a less stringent confidence threshold) than the other analyses in the paper. Correcting this error resulted in a very minor change in the Z-values for this analysis, though this change was sufficient to bring several of the ROIs below the q&lt;0.05 FDR threshold. Using the correct confidence threshold, the new results show that only the right entorhinal, right amygdala and right insula pass FDR correction (q&lt;0.05) for the within-interval ROI analysis, and the right entorhinal cortex even survives whole-brain correction (among 84 anatomical regions) at q&lt;0.05.</p><p><italic>Also new data that has been added in response to other concerns that now raise some skepticism. The most intrusive is the fact that distance judgments vary predictably by 'list' position – events early in the audiovisual recording are remembered as farther apart than those later in the tape. (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> – top panel). However, pattern similarity estimates do not track this behavioral effect. This result raises questions about why, if entorhinal and frontal cortex are representing temporal context signal, would they not also some what mirror the behavioral judgments. I could imagine that context representations may play less of a role as item memory fades? This is not discussed but should be for the authors' views on this to be clear. Otherwise, the impact of the final result is unclear.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the importance of investigating this discrepancy between the neural and behavioral data. We have modified this section of the manuscript and included an extensive discussion of the possible reasons for this discrepancy.</p><p>First, we discuss the positive time-order effect, the canonical finding that duration estimates are larger at the start of a new “episode” and decrease over time within the episode (i.e., duration estimates might be longer at the beginning of the story because context changes more at the start of a novel episode). Second, we show that there are significantly more event boundaries in the beginning of our story, and that the number of event boundaries decreases with time in story. Both of these factors might explain why duration estimates decrease with time in story.</p><p>Importantly, we then discuss why neural pattern change did not decrease over time in the story. Since this trend was not present in any of the regions uncovered by our ROI analyses (right entorhinal, right OFC, left caudal ACC, right amygdala, right insula), we performed a whole-brain search, to check whether any anatomical region exhibits this decrease in pattern change over time. Surprisingly, we did not find any region exhibiting this pattern significantly. Given that we were looking for a slow change in neural signal (unfolding over the entire time course of the story), we thought that our high-pass filter might be removing this slow change; to address this possibility, we analyzed the unfiltered data. When we did this, we found an overwhelming trend in the opposite direction, with most brain patterns changing <italic>more</italic> with time in the experiment. This increase in pattern change over time was even present in the CSF and white matter, suggesting that it was not reflective of neuronal activity, but was probably caused by a non-neuronal artifact, such as scanner drift or motion, that increased slowly with time.</p><p>In conclusion, we argue that even if neural activity patterns were changing less and less as the story unfolds, in concert with the behavior, we might not be able to see this effect, as it would have to overcome a global signal in the opposite direction that is not due to neural activity and is present everywhere, including the CSF.</p><p> <italic>In my original review, I had requested that they examine whether univariate activity was related to temporal memory success. The did run that analysis but only in entorhinal cortex and pars orbitalis -and do not see any effects but beg off reporting it since they did not have a priori predictions about it. however, published work (Jenkins and Ranganath) has shown that univariate activity in more dorsal parts of lateral frontal cortex is related to coarse temporal memory judgments. so there is a clear precedent for this effect. I am not sure why they say they did not have that prediction but this analysis, even if the results DO NOT show a univariate effect would be informative and could even bolster their conclusions that patterns across time, rather than activity to any single event, is a better predictor of temporal memory judgments.</italic></p><p>We apologize for not having addressed the reviewer’s question more thoroughly in our previous round of revisions, and we appreciate the suggestion of performing a whole-brain analysis to search for the relationship found by Jenkins and Ranganath (2010) between univariate activity at encoding and subsequent coarse temporal memory judgments.</p><p>In addressing this request, we found that (in our previous analysis) we had quantified the accuracy of participants’ timeline judgments in a slightly different manner from the Jenkins and Ranganath (2010) analysis. Jenkins and Ranganath (2010) had performed a linear regression of estimated temporal position against actual temporal position, and used the absolute value of the residuals as their measure of “error”. In contrast, we had used the absolute value of the distance between the estimated place in the story and the actual place in the story as our measure of error. Using this absolute distance method, we reported null effects in the right entorhinal cortex and right pars orbitalis, and in fact we did not find significant effects in any ROI in the brain.</p><p>In a new version of this analysis, we have now followed the Jenkins and Ranganath procedure more closely by performing a linear regression on the behavior. We then correlated the negative of the error (our measure of accuracy) with the activity of each brain voxel at encoding. We found highly significant clusters in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (replicating the above report), as well as the medial prefrontal cortex, and slightly sub-threshold clusters in the medial parietal (precuneus and retrosplenial) and left superior temporal gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Author response image 1</xref>, left panel, blue clusters). Thus, it seems that the linear regression procedure mattered for the final results.</p><p>Importantly, in this analysis, we performed a full correlation between a voxel’s activity when a clip was encoded and the participant’s accuracy in placing that clip on the timeline. Jenkins and Ranganath had binarized the behavior into “Hits” (bottom 1/3 of residual errors) and “Misses” (top 1/3 of residual errors). When we binned the behavior in a similar way, we found that the medial parietal, medial prefrontal and left superior temporal clusters were all highly significant, whereas the left dorsolateral PFC cluster was no longer significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Author response image 1</xref>, right panel, red-yellow clusters).<fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16070.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Clusters whose activity at encoding correlated with subsequent accuracy at placing clips on the timeline of the story.</title><p>The left panel (in blue) shows the results of the Pearson’s correlation between accuracy on a clip and the encoding activity for that clip.

We do not report both versions for the sake of brevity.</p><p>To summarize, both versions of the whole-brain analysis revealed that regions of the Default Mode Network (DMN) were significantly more active during the encoding of clips whose place in the timeline of the story participants later recalled more accurately.</p><p>In the manuscript’s discussion, we propose that one reason for the discrepancy between the Jenkins &amp; Ranganath results and our results may be due to the narrative structure of our stimulus, which seems to elicit strong inter-subject correlations in regions of the DMN (Lerner et al., 2011). It is possible that this network is particularly important for encoding the temporal context of stimuli that are part of a narrative (Chen et al., 2015), but that another strategy is used when the stimuli whose timing is recalled were not related to one another.</p><p>Regarding the reviewer’s comment:</p><p> <italic>“even if the results DO NOT show a univariate effect would be informative and could even bolster their conclusions that patterns across time, rather than activity to any single event, is a better predictor of temporal memory judgments.”</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is suggesting that the results of the univariate analysis could potentially bolster our conclusions from the multivariate analysis. However, please note that it is not necessarily surprising that our multivariate analyses (which constitute the bulk of the manuscript) reveal different results from this univariate analysis, given that the behavioral tests used are different. In the bulk of the manuscript, we relate multivariate pattern change to duration estimates, where participants explicitly estimated the relative distance between two clips. On the other hand, the univariate analysis leverages data from a separate behavioral test where participants placed each clip, individually, on the timeline of the story (not a comparison between two clips).</p></body></sub-article></article>
