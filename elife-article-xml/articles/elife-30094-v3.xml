human genomes. L1-encoded ORF1 and ORF2 proteins bind L1 RNAs, forming ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). These RNPs interact with diverse host proteins, some repressive and others required for the L1 lifecycle. Using differential affinity purifications, quantitative mass spectrometry, and next generation RNA sequencing, we have characterized the proteins and nucleic acids associated with distinctive, enzymatically active L1 macromolecular complexes. Among them, we describe a cytoplasmic intermediate that we hypothesize to be the canonical ORF1p/ORF2p/L1<italic>-</italic>RNA-containing RNP, and we describe a nuclear population containing ORF2p, but lacking ORF1p, which likely contains host factors participating in target-primed reverse transcription.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30094.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our genome consists of about two percent genes, while around 60 to 70 percent are made up of hundreds of thousands of copies of very similar DNA sequences. These repeats have accumulated over time due to specific genetic elements called transposons.</p><p>Transposons are often referred to as ‘jumping genes’, as they can move within the genome and thereby create mutations that may lead to cancer or other genetic diseases. LINE-1 is the only remaining active transposon in humans, and it expands by copying and pasting itself to new locations. To do so, it is first transcribed into RNA – the molecules that help to make proteins – and then converted back into identical DNA sequences.</p><p>In a never-ending battle, our cells have been fighting to keep LINE-1 and its ancestors from replicating, and so evolved various defense mechanisms. Yet, LINE-1 has learned to circumvent these barriers, and continues to replicate and cause disease. Our understanding of these defenses and of how LINE-1 evades them is limited.</p><p>Previous research has shown that the LINE-1 RNA and its two encoded proteins, called ORF1p and ORF2p, interact with a series of other proteins, with which they can form different types of complexes. Now, Taylor, Altukhov, Molloy et al. used human embryonic kidney cells grown in the laboratory with different LINE-1 mutations to identify how they affect the bound proteins and RNAs. The results showed that LINE-1 can form at least two different sets of complexes with other proteins.</p><p>The complex containing ORF1p and ORF2p and several other proteins was located in the cytoplasm, the fluid that fills the cells. However, the experiments also revealed a new complex in the cell nucleus, which contained ORF2p and proteins involved in DNA replication and repair, but not ORF1p. The results suggest ORF1p delivers RNPs to the nucleus around the time the cell divides. Another group of researchers has looked more closely at what happens during cell division.</p><p>A next step will be to study how exactly LINE-1 contributes to cancer. In the future, overactive LINE-1 proteins could be targeted to kill cancer cells, to identify cancer early, or to see if the cancer has come back. LINE-1 may also provide clues on how the genome has evolved.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LINE-1</kwd><kwd>retrotransposon</kwd><kwd>ribonucleoprotein</kwd><kwd>interactome</kwd><kwd>affinity proteomics</kwd><kwd>biochemistry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chait</surname><given-names>Brian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM109824</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rout</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50GM107632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boeke</surname><given-names>Jef D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM126170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LaCava</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The range of molecular forms adopted by L1 retrotransposons reflect a tapestry of lifecycle-permissive and -restrictive host-parasite interactions occurring within cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sequences resulting from retrotransposition constitute more than half of the human genome and are considered to be major change agents in eukaryotic genome evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kazazian, 2004</xref>). L1 retrotransposons have been particularly active in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Furano et al., 2004</xref>), comprising ~20% of the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lander et al., 2001</xref>); somatic retrotransposition has been widely implicated in cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tubio et al., 2014</xref>) and may even play a role in neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Muotri et al., 2005</xref>). Despite the magnitude of their contributions to mammalian genomes, L1 genes are modest in size. A full-length L1 transcript is ~6 knt long and functions as a bicistronic mRNA that encodes two polypeptides, ORF1p and ORF2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ostertag and Kazazian, 2001</xref>), which respectively comprise a homotrimeric RNA binding protein with nucleic acid chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Martin and Bushman, 2001</xref>) and a multifunctional protein with endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mathias et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 1996</xref>). Recently, a putative primate-specific third ORF, named <italic>ORF0</italic>, has been identified on the Crick strand of the L1 gene; this ORF encodes a 71 amino acid peptide and may generate insertion-site-dependent ORFs via splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Denli et al., 2015</xref>). ORF1p and ORF2p are thought to interact preferentially with the L1 RNA from which they were translated (in cis), forming a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kulpa and Moran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>) considered to be the canonical direct intermediate of retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hohjoh and Singer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kulpa and Moran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Martin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kulpa and Moran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doucet et al., 2010</xref>). L1 RNPs also require host factors to complete their lifecycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Peddigari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>) and, consistent with a fundamentally parasitic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beauregard et al., 2008</xref>), the host has responded by evolving mechanisms that suppress retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goodier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arjan-Odedra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goodier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Niewiadomska et al., 2007</xref>). It follows that as the host and the parasite compete, L1 expression is likely to produce a multiplicity of RNP forms engaged in discrete stages of retrotransposition, suppression, or degradation.</p><p>Although L1 DNA sequences are modestly sized compared to typical human genes, L1 intermediates are nevertheless RNPs with a substantially sized RNA component; e.g. larger than the ~5 knt 28S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gonzalez et al., 1985</xref>) and approximately three to four times the size of a ‘typical’ mRNA transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lander et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sommer and Cohen, 1980</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that many proteins within L1 RNPs form interactions influenced directly and indirectly by physical contacts with the L1 RNA. We previously reported that L1 RNA comprised an estimated ~25% of mapped RNA sequencing reads in ORF2p-3xFLAG affinity captured fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). We also observed that the retention of ORF1p and UPF1 within affinity captured L1 RNPs was reduced by treatment with RNases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). In the same study we observed that two populations of ORF2p-associated proteins could be separated by split-tandem affinity capture (ORF2p followed by ORF1p), a two-dimensional affinity enrichment procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caspary et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). Initial characterization of these two L1 populations by western blotting suggested that discrete L1 populations were likely primed for function in different stages of the lifecycle. We therefore expected additional uncharacterized complexity in the spectrum of L1-associated complexes present in our affinity enriched fractions.</p><p>In this study, we have used quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to investigate the proteomic characteristics of endogenously assembled ectopic L1-derived macromolecules present in an assortment of affinity-enriched fractions. We revisited RNase treatment and split-tandem affinity capture approaches and complemented them with RNA sequencing, enzymatic analysis, and in-cell localization of ORF proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy (see also the companion manuscript by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mita et al., 2018</xref>). We additionally explored proteomes associated with catalytically-inactivated ORF2p point mutants and monitored the rates of protein exchange from L1 macromolecules in vitro. Taken together, our data support the existence of a variety of putative L1-related protein complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Affinity proteomic experiments conducted in this study use quantitative MS based upon metabolic labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Oda et al., 1999</xref>). Two main experimental designs (and modifications thereof) facilitating quantitative cross-sample comparisons have been used: SILAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang and Huang, 2008</xref>) and I-DIRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tackett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). In these approaches, cells are grown for several doublings in media containing amino acids composed either of naturally-occurring ‘light' isotopes or biologically identical 'heavy' isotopes (e.g. <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N lysine and arginine), such that the proteomes are thoroughly labeled. Protein fractions derived from the differently labeled cell populations, obtained e.g. before and after experimental manipulations are applied, are mixed and the relative differences in proteins contributed by each fraction are precisely measured by mass spectrometry. In addition to the above cited studies, these approaches have been adapted to numerous biological questions using a variety of analytical frameworks e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Byrum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ohta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaake et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geiger et al., 2011</xref>). Because it is challenging to speculate on the potential physiological roles of protein interactions that form after extraction from the cell, we often use I-DIRT, which allows the discrimination of protein-protein interactions formed in-cell from those occurring post-extraction. Our prior affinity proteomic study, based on I-DIRT, identified 37 putative <italic>in vivo</italic> interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>), described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. In this study we primarily analyze the behaviors of these ‘I-DIRT significant’ L1 interactors, in order to determine their molecular associations and ascertain the variety of distinctive macromolecular complexes formed in-cell that copurify with affinity-tagged ORF2p. The complete lists of proteins detected in each experiment are presented in the supplementary information (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We have represented any ambiguous protein group, which occurs when the same peptides identify a group of homologous protein sequences, with a single, consistently applied gene symbol and a superscript 'a' in all figures. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> contains the references to other proteins explaining the presence of the same peptides. For example, RPS27A, (ubiquitin) UBB, UBC, and (ribosomal Protein L40) UBA52 can be explained by common ubiquitin peptides shared by these genes. RPS27A-specific peptides were not identified in this study, but we retained the nomenclature for consistency with our previous work; HSPA1A is reported in this study, but cannot be distinguished from the essentially identical protein product of HSPA1B.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30094.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Putative L1 interactors: Through a series of affinity capture experiments (co-IP) using I-DIRT, we characterized a set of putative host-encoded L1 interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). </title><p>The proteins observed were associated with both ORF1p and ORF2p (highlighted in blue), only in association with ORF2p (highlighted in magenta), or only in association with ORF1p (no highlight).

synthetic L1 construct - <italic>ORFeus</italic>-HS - driving the expression 3xFLAG-tagged L1 (<italic>ORF1; ORF2::3xFLAG</italic>; 3’-UTR) from a tetracycline inducible minimal-CMV promoter, harbored on a mammalian episome (pLD401 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dai et al., 2012</xref>)). All L1-related macromolecules described in this study were obtained by affinity capture of ORF2p-3xFLAG before further experimental manipulations were applied. We consider macromolecules containing L1 RNA (L1 RNPs, discussed throughout) and/or an L1 cDNA (i.e. L1 coding potential) to be L1s, as are their ectopic plasmid-borne and endogenous gDNA counterparts, reflecting the complexity and diversity of L1 forms arising from its lifecycle. In an effort to characterize this complexity, we have carried out RNA sequencing and enzymatic activity analyses on several affinity captured fractions, complementing the proteomic analyses.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNase-sensitivity exhibited by components of affinity captured L1 RNPs</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (panels A-C) illustrates the approach and displays the findings of our assay designed to reveal which proteins depend upon the presence of intact L1 RNA for retention within the obtained L1 RNPs. Briefly, metabolically-labeled affinity captured L1s were treated either with a mixture of RNases A and T1 — thus releasing proteins that require intact RNA to remain linked to ORF2p and the affinity medium — or BSA, as an inert control. After removing the fractions released by the RNase or BSA treatments, the proteins remaining on the affinity media were eluted with lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS), mixed together, and then analyzed by MS. Proteins released, and so depleted, by RNase treatment were thus found to be more abundant in the BSA-treated control. The results obtained corroborate and extend our previous findings: ORF1p and UPF1 exhibited RNase-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). We also observed that ZCCHC3 and MOV10 exhibited RNase-sensitivity to a level similar to ORF1p. The remaining I-DIRT significant proteins were RNase-resistant in this assay. With the exception of the PABPC1/4 proteins (and ORF2p itself, see Discussion), the I-DIRT significant proteins (colored nodes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) that were resistant to RNase treatment (nearest the origin of the graph) classify ontologically as nuclear proteins (GO:0005634, p ≈ 3 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, see Materials and methods). These same proteins were previously observed as specific L1 interactors in I-DIRT experiments targeting ORF2p but not in those targeting ORF1p; in contrast, the proteins that demonstrated RNase-sensitivity: ORF1, MOV10, ZCCHC3, and UPF1 were observed in both ORF1p and ORF2p I-DIRT experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Stated another way, the proteins released upon treating an affinity captured ORF2p fraction with RNases are among those that can also be obtained when affinity capturing ORF1p directly, while those that are RNase-resistant are not ORF1p interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). The ORF1p-linked, I-DIRT significant, RNase-sensitive proteins were too few to obtain a high confidence assessment of ontological enrichment; but, when combined with the remaining proteins exhibiting sensitivity to RNase treatment (black nodes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), they together classified as 'RNA binding' (GO:0003723, p ≈ 1 × 10<sup>−11</sup>). This analysis also revealed a statistically significant overrepresentation of genes associated with the exon junction complex (EJC, GO: 0035145, p ≈ 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, discussed below). Hence, the overlapping portion of the ORF1p- and ORF2p-associated interactomes appeared to depend upon intact L1 RNA. Host-encoded proteins segregated into groups that responded differentially to RNase treatment, with a substantial population of RNase-resistant interactors linked to both ORF2p and the nucleus. This observation led to the hypothesis that our ORF2p-3xFLAG affinity captured L1s constitute a composite purification of at least, but not limited to, (1) a population of L1-RNA-dependent, ORF1p/ORF2p-containing L1 RNPs, and (2) an ORF1p-independent nuclear population associated with ORF2p.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30094.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNase sensitivity and split-tandem affinity capture of L1 ORF2p RNPs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) On-bead RNase-sensitivity assay: L1 complexes were affinity captured by ORF2p-3xFLAG. The magnetic media were then treated with a solution containing either a mixture of RNases A and T1 or BSA. After treatment, the supernatants were removed and the remaining bound material was released with LDS. Proteins requiring intact RNA to maintain stable interactions with immobilized ORF2p were released from the RNase-treated medium, while the BSA-treated sample controlled for the spontaneous release of proteins from the medium. Representative SDS-PAGE/Coomassie blue stained gel lanes are shown for each fraction. (<bold>B</bold>) The experiments described above were carried out in duplicate, once with light isotopically labeled cells (<bold>L</bold>) and once with heavy isotopically labeled cells (<bold>H</bold>), resulting in four label-swapped, SILAC duplicates (one light set and one heavy set). The four fractions were cross-mixed and the differential protein retention upon the affinity medium during the treatments (BSA vs. RNase) was assessed by quantitative MS. (<bold>C</bold>) Results from the RNase-sensitivity assay graphed as the fraction of each detected protein present in the BSA-treated sample (RNase-sensitive proteins are <italic>more</italic> present in the BSA treated sample), normalized such that proteins that did not change upon treatment with RNases are centered at the origin. A cut-off of p=10<sup>−3</sup> for RNase-sensitivity is indicated by a light gray circle; proteins that are RNase-sensitive with a statistical significance of p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup> are outside the circle.

(<bold>D</bold>) <italic>Split-tandem affinity capture</italic>: L1 complexes were affinity captured by ORF2p-3xFLAG. After native elution with 3xFLAG peptide, this fraction was depleted of ORF1p-containing complexes using an α-ORF1 conjugated magnetic medium, resulting in a supernatant fraction depleted of ORF1p-containing complexes. The α-ORF1 bound material was then released with LDS, yielding an elution fraction enriched for ORF1p-containing complexes. Representative SDS-PAGE/Coomassie blue stained results for each fraction are shown. (<bold>E</bold>) SILAC duplicates, two supernatants and two elutions, were cross-mixed to enable an assessment of the relative protein content of each fraction by quantitative MS. (<bold>F</bold>) The results from split-tandem affinity capture graphed as the fraction of each protein observed in the elution sample. In order to easily visualize the relative degree of co-partitioning of constituent proteins with ORF1p, these data were normalized, setting the fraction of ORF1p in the elution to 1. Proteins which were previously ranked significant by I-DIRT analysis are labeled and displayed in blue or magenta (as indicated); gray, unlabeled nodes were not found to be significant by I-DIRT. MOV10 is marked with a dagger because in one replicate of this experiment it was detected by a single unique peptide, whereas we have enforced a minimum of two peptides (see Materials and methods) for all other proteins, throughout all other proteomic analyses presented here.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30094-fig1-v3"/></fig><p>While effects of PABPC1, MOV10, and UPF1 on L1 activity have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arjan-Odedra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dai et al., 2012</xref>), effects of ZCCHC3 on L1 remained uncharacterized. ZCCHC3 is an RNA-binding protein associated with poly(A)+ RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Castello et al., 2012</xref>) but otherwise little is known concerning its functions. Notably, in a genome-wide screen, small interfering (si)RNA knockdown of ZCCHC3 was observed to increase the infectivity of the Hepatitis C, a positive sense RNA virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2009</xref>); and ZCCHC3 was observed to copurify with affinity captured HIV, a retrovirus, at a very high SILAC ratio (&gt;10), supporting the specificity of this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engeland et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore explored the effects on L1 mobility both of over-expression and siRNA knockdown of ZCCHC3. Over-expression of ZCCHC3 reduced L1 retrotransposition to ~10% that observed in the control, consistent with a negative regulatory role for ZCCHC3 in the L1 lifecycle; small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of ZCCHC3 induced a modest increase in retrotransposition compared to a scrambled control siRNA (~1.9x ± 0.1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Moreover, although not among our I-DIRT hits (see Discussion), the presence of EJC components (MAGOH, RBM8A, EIF4A3, UPF1) among the RNase-sensitive fraction of proteins intrigued us, given that L1 genes are intronless. We speculated that L1s may use EJCs to enhance nuclear export, evade degradation by host defenses, and/or aggregate with mRNPs within cytoplasmic granules. For this reason we carried out a series of siRNA knockdowns of these EJC components and other physically or functionally related proteins found in the affinity captured fraction (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). siRNA knockdowns of RBM8A and EIF4A3 caused inviability of the cell line. We found that knocking-down MAGOH or the EJC-linked protein IGF2BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jønson et al., 2007</xref>) reduced retrotransposition by ~50%, consistent with a role in L1 proliferation; although these knockdowns also caused a reduction in viability of the cell line (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Split-tandem separation of compartment-specific L1 ORF-associated complexes</title><p>To further test our hypothesis and better characterize the components of our L1 fraction, we conducted split-tandem affinity capture. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (panels D-F) illustrates the approach and displays the findings of the assay, which physically separated ORF1p/ORF2p-containing L1 RNPs from a presumptive 'only-ORF2p-associated' population. Briefly, metabolically-labeled L1s were affinity captured by ORF2p-3xFLAG (first dimension) and the obtained composite was subsequently further fractionated by α-ORF1p affinity capture (second dimension, or split-tandem capture), resulting in α-ORF1p-bound and unbound (supernatant) fractions. The bound fraction was eluted from the affinity medium with LDS (elution). The supernatant and elution fractions were then mixed and analyzed by MS to ascertain proteomic differences between them. The α-ORF1p elution contained the population of proteins physically linked to <italic>both</italic> ORF2p and ORF1p, whereas the supernatant contained the proteins associated <italic>only</italic> with ORF2p (and, formally, those which have dissociated from the ORF1p/ORF2p RNP). The results corroborated our previous observations that: (i) almost all of the ORF1p partitioned into the elution fractions, (ii) a quarter of the ORF2p (~26%) followed ORF1p during the α-ORF1p affinity capture, (iii) roughly half of the UPF1 (~55%) followed ORF1p, and (iv) most of the PCNA (~87%) remained in the ORF1p-depleted supernatant fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, and consistent with prior estimates based on protein staining and western blotting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>]); thus (v) supporting the existence of at least two distinct populations of L1-ORF-protein-containing complexes in our affinity purifications.</p><p>The population eluted from the α-ORF1p affinity medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, far right gel lane, and nodes located in the upper right of the graph, panel F) is consistent with the composition of the ORF1p/ORF2p-containing L1 RNP suggested above. Our split-tandem separation segregated the constituents of the L1 fraction comparably to the RNase-sensitivity assay, both in terms of which proteins co-segregated with ORF1p/ORF2p (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>, blue nodes, upper right of graphs) as well as those which appear to be linked only to ORF2p (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>, magenta nodes, lower left of the graphs). The ORF1p/ORF2p RNPs obtained by split-tandem capture included putative in vivo interactions associated with both α-ORF1p and α-ORF2p I-DIRT affinity capture experiments; whereas the unbound, ORF1p-independent fraction includes proteins previously observed as significant only in α-ORF2p I-DIRT experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Analysis of the nodes whose degree of ORF1p association was similar to that of UPF1 (blue nodes exhibiting ≥55% ORF1p co-partitioning, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) revealed that they map ontologically to a ‘cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granule’ classification (GO:0036464, p ≈ 6 × 10<sup>−8</sup>; see Discussion). In contrast, all sixteen proteins exhibiting ORF1p co-partitioning approximately equal to or less than that of ORF2p were predominantly found in the supernatant fraction and were enriched for cell-compartment-specific association with the nucleus (GO:0005634, p ≈ 4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>: all magenta nodes ≤36%). These two fractions therefore appear to be associated with different cell compartments, reaffirming our postulate: the ORF1p/ORF2p-containing population is a cytoplasmic intermediate related to the canonical L1 RNP typically ascribed to L1 assembly in the literature, and the predominantly ORF2p-associated population comprises a putative nuclear interactome.</p><p>From the same analysis, we noted that PURA, PURB, PCNA, and TOP1 which all partition predominantly with nuclear L1, exhibited an ontological co-enrichment (termed 'nuclear replication fork,' GO:0043596, p ≈ 3 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). The nodes representative of PURA, PURB, and PCNA appeared to exhibit a striking proximity to one another, suggesting highly similar co-fractionation behavior potentially indicative of direct physical interactions. In an effort to examine this possibility, we graphed the frequency distribution of the proximities of all three-node-clusters observed within <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, revealing the likelihood of the PURA/PURB/PCNA cluster to be p=3.2×10<sup>−7</sup> (see Appendix 1). We therefore concluded that PURA, PURB, PCNA, and (perhaps at a lower affinity) TOP1, likely constitute a physically associated functional module interacting with L1. In further support of this assertion, we noted that known functionally linked protein pairs PABPC1/PABPC4 (cytoplasmic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jønson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Katzenellenbogen et al., 2007</xref>) and HSPA8/HSPA1A (nuclear) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jønson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nellist et al., 2005</xref>) also exhibited comparable co-partitioning by visual inspection, and statistical testing of these clusters revealed the similarity of their co-partitioning to be significant at p ≈ 0.001 for the former, and p ≈ 0.0002 for the latter. The observed variation in co-partitioning behavior between the different proteins comprising the nuclear L1 fraction might reflect the presence of multiple distinctive (sub)complexes present within this population.</p><p>To validate our hypothesis that these proteins are associated with ORF2p in the nucleus, possibly engaged with host genomic DNA, we carried out ORF2p-3xFLAG affinity capture from chromatin-enriched sub-cellular fractions and found that the co-captured proteins we identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) overlapped with those described above as nuclear interactors, including: PARP1, PCNA, UPF1, PURA, and TOP1. We previously demonstrated that silencing PCNA expression adversely affects L1 retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>), in this study we found that knocking down TOP1 approximately doubled retrotransposition frequency, while a more modest 1.4x increase effect was observed for PURA, and no substantial effect was observed for PURB, compared to a scrambled siRNA control. In contrast, over-expression of PURA reduced retrotransposition to ~20% of the expected level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Given that ORF1/2p partitioned to the split-tandem elution fraction (cytoplasmic) along with the greater fraction of L1 RNA, yet only ORF2p and a lesser portion of the L1 RNA were observed in the supernatant (nuclear), an important consideration regarding these fractions is: to what extent they contain L1 macromolecules capable of proliferation. To address this question, we performed the LINE-1 element amplification protocol (LEAP) on split-tandem affinity captured fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), including a <italic>ΔORF1</italic> construct (pLD561) as a control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). LEAP is currently the best biochemical assay for functional co-assembly of L1 RNA and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kulpa and Moran, 2006</xref>); it measures the ability of ORF2p to amplify its associated L1 RNA by reverse transcription. To execute LEAP on the α-ORF1p affinity captured fraction, we developed a competitive di-peptide elution reagent based on the linear peptide sequence used to generate the α-ORF1p 4H1 monoclonal antibody: residues 35–44 in ORF1p ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Khazina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>]; see Materials and methods). We were thus able to assay the partitioning of enzymatic activity within the different populations of copurifying proteins in a split-tandem affinity capture experiment. Our data showed robust LEAP activity in both nuclear and cytoplasmic split-tandem supernatant and elution fractions. We note that our 3xFLAG eluted fractions have been shown to possess ~70 fold higher specific activity than L1 RNPs obtained by sucrose cushion velocity sedimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>), hence the activity levels detected far exceed those obtained by sedimentation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ORF1p/ORF2p immunofluorescence protein localization</title><p>Although our proteomic and biochemical analyses supported the existence of distinctive nuclear and cytoplasmic L1 populations, our prior immunofluorescence (IF) analyses did not reveal an apparent nuclear population, leading us to revisit IF studies.

We reasoned that such mutants may bottleneck L1 intermediates at the catalytic steps associated with host gDNA cleavage and L1 cDNA synthesis, potentially revealing protein associations that are important for these discrete aspects of target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT), the presumed mechanism of L1 transposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Luan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cost et al., 2002</xref>). For this we used an H230A mutation to inactivate the endonuclease activity (EN<sup>-</sup>/pLD567), and a D702Y mutation to inactivate the reverse transcriptase activity (RT<sup>-</sup>/pLD624) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the approach and displays the findings of our assay. Broadly, while we observed comparable RNA-level properties between samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), our findings revealed several classes of distinctive protein-level behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Two classes of behavior appeared to be particularly striking: (1) the yield of constituents of cytoplasmic L1s was reduced, relative to WT, by the EN<sup>-</sup> mutation, yet elevated by the RT<sup>-</sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left side); and (2) numerous constituents of nuclear L1s were elevated in yield by the EN<sup>-</sup> mutation but reduced or nominally unchanged, relative to WT, by the RT<sup>-</sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right side). With respect to the second group, IPO7, NAP1L4, NAP1L1, FKBP4, HSP90AA1, and HSP90AB1 were all elevated in the EN<sup>-</sup> mutants, potentially implicating these proteins as part of an L1 complex (or complexes) immediately preceding DNA cleavage. Notably, there is a third class of proteins, including PURA/B, PCNA, TOP1, and PARP1, that all respond similarly to both EN<sup>-</sup> and RT<sup>-</sup> mutants compared to WT, exhibiting reduced associations with the mutant L1s; although, the RT<sup>-</sup> mutant showed a larger effect size on the PURA/B proteins. These data suggest that cleavage of the host genomic DNA by ORF2p fosters associations between L1 and this third class of proteins, but that interactions with PURA/B may be further enhanced by L1 cDNA production. Other nuclear L1 proteins: HSPA8, HAX1, HSPA1A, TUBB, and TUBB4B were increased in both mutants. To better visualize the range of behaviors exhibited by our proteins of interest, and the population at large, we cross-referenced the relative enrichments of each protein detected in both experiments, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. We noted the same striking trend mentioned above, that two seemingly opposite behavioral classes of interactors could also be observed globally among all proteins associating with ORF2p catalytic mutants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left side and right side, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), creating the crisscross pattern displayed (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, the pattern observed appears to track with the relative behavior of ORF1p, which, along with other cytoplasmic L1 factors is elevated in RT<sup>-</sup> mutants and reduced in EN<sup>-</sup> mutants.

We propose a cytoplasmic L1, composed of ORF1/2 p, L1 RNA, PABPC1/4, MOV10, UPF1, and ZCCHC3, that constitutes an abundant, canonical RNP intermediate often referred to in the literature. MOV10, UPF1, and ZCCHC3 are apparently substoichiometric to ORF2p in our preparations, therefore it may be that only a subset of cytoplasmic intermediates engages these host restriction factors.

We reported that L1 constituted ~25% of mapped reads previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>); a comparable result was obtained when we reanalyzed that data using the pipeline described here (see Materials and methods): ~93% of reads in our reanalyzed 2013 dataset mapped to the human genome, and L1 constituted ~20% of reads mapped to annotated features (‘annotated reads’) in 3xFLAG eluates. In this study we report that ~60% of annotated reads mapped to synthetic L1 in 3xFLAG eluates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The higher proportion of L1 recovered may be due to the combination of higher fidelity RNA preparative methods and advanced sequencing technology used here; we observed ~10x more total reads mapping to L1 and comparatively improved, more uniform coverage across the entire L1 sequence, likely explaining the discrepancy. We also noted that the number of normalized reads mapped to L1 in our initial 3xFLAG elutions (‘input’) and subsequent tandem-purified α-ORF1p elutions were comparable, and yet ~1/2 as many were seen in the α-ORF1p supernatant fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). We suspect that this is due to saturation in library preparations or sequencing steps for the ‘input’ and ‘elution’ fractions, but conclude that more L1 RNA is in the ‘cytoplasmic’ elution fraction than the ‘nuclear’ supernatant.</p><p>We observed substantial and comparable LEAP activity in both our tandem-purified ORF1p+ (‘elution’) and ORF1p– (immuno-depleted ‘supernatant’) populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). To our knowledge, these represent the simplest and purest endogenously assembled L1 RNPs yet reported that exhibit robust signal in the LEAP assay. We note that, our results demonstrating robust activity in the nuclear-enriched supernatant fraction (depleted of ORF1p) may contrast with previous reports of reduced LEAP activity in constructs where ORF1p RNA binding was compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kulpa and Moran, 2006</xref>), but our fractions merit further study and comparisons on the basis of ORF2p and RNA levels to determine specific activity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cytoplasmic L1 macromolecules</title><p>ORF1p, MOV10, UPF1, and ZCCHC3 are released from L1 RNPs by treatment with RNases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), indicating the importance of the L1 RNA in the maintenance of these interactions. In this context, the L1 ORF and poly(A) binding proteins support L1 proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kulpa and Moran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wei et al., 2001</xref>), whereas ZCCHC3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and MOV10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goodier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arjan-Odedra et al., 2012</xref>) function in repressive capacities. Although UPF1 might also be expected to operate in a repressive capacity through its role in nonsense mediated decay (NMD), we previously demonstrated that UPF1's role does not apparently resemble that of canonical NMD and it acts as an enhancer of retrotransposition despite negatively affecting L1 RNA and protein levels, supporting the possibility of repressive activity in the cytoplasm and proliferative activity in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, MOV10 has been implicated in the recruitment of UPF1 to mRNA targets through protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gregersen et al., 2014</xref>). However, we observed that MOV10 exhibited a greater degree of RNase-sensitivity than UPF1, indicating that, if MOV10 directly modulates the UPF1 interactions with L1, a sub-fraction of UPF1 exhibits a distinct behavior (UPF1 is ~62% as sensitive to RNase treatment as MOV10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Bimodal UPF1 behavior can also be seen in split-tandem capture experiments, only about half of the UPF1 exhibited ORF1p-like partitioning with the canonical L1 RNP (Figure 1F). Moreover, UPF1 was recovered with L1s affinity captured from fractionated chromatin (further discussed below), and only about half of the UPF1 exhibits ORF1p-like partitioning with the canonical L1 RNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Presumably, the RNase-sensitive fraction, released in concert with MOV10, is the same fraction observed in cytoplasmic L1s obtained by split-tandem capture. In contrast, PABPC1 and C4 exhibit strong ORF1p-like partitioning (comparable to MOV10), but appear wholly insensitive to RNase treatment. This is most likely due to the fact that neither RNase A nor T1 cleave RNA at adenosine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Volkin and Cohn, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yoshida, 2001</xref>); hence poly(A) binding proteins may not be ready targets for release from direct RNA binding by the assay implemented here (or generally, using these ribonucleases). Failure to release ORF2p into the supernatant upon RNase treatment is expected due to its immobilization upon the affinity medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dai et al., 2014</xref>). However, we note that ORF2p binding to the L1 RNA has also been proposed to occur at the poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doucet et al., 2015</xref>), raising the related possibility of close physical association on the L1 RNA between ORF2p and PABPC1/4 in cytoplasmic L1 RNPs. ORF1p, PABPC1/4, MOV10, ZCCHC3, and UPF1, all behaved comparably in response to EN<sup>-</sup> and RT<sup>-</sup> catalytic mutations, decreasing together in EN<sup>-</sup> mutants, and increasing together in RT<sup>-</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, when the exchange of proteins within L1 RNPs was monitored directly, PABPC1/4 and ZCCHC3 exhibited nearly identical stability, well above the background distribution; UPF1 and MOV10 also exhibited comparable kinetics to one another, falling into an intermediary stability cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>).</p><p>RNase-sensitivity was displayed by numerous proteins not previously identified as putative L1 interactors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>]). A known limitation of I-DIRT (and many SILAC-based analyses) is that it cannot discriminate non-specific interactors from specific but rapidly exchanging interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang and Huang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smart et al., 2009</xref>). Our samples likely contain rapidly exchanging, physiologically relevant factors that were not revealed by I-DIRT under the experimental conditions used. With this in mind, we note members of the exon junction complex (EJC), RBM8A (Y14), EIF4A3 (DDX48), and MAGOH, are among our RNase-sensitive constituents, all exhibiting a similar degree of RNase-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, labeled black dots). Crucially, these proteins are physically and functionally connected to UPF1 (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schweingruber et al., 2013</xref>]), and physically to MOV10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gregersen et al., 2014</xref>), both validated L1 interactors. We therefore hypothesize that EJCs may constitute bona fide L1 interactors missed in our original screen. This may seem unexpected because canonical L1 RNAs are thought not to be spliced, but this assumption has been challenged by one group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belancio et al., 2006</xref>), and splicing-independent recruitment of EJCs has also been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Budiman et al., 2009</xref>). Perhaps more compelling, EJC proteins exhibited a striking similarity in RNase-sensitivity to MOV10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). EIF4A3 has been suggested to form an RNA-independent interaction with MOV10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gregersen et al., 2014</xref>), and MOV10 is a known negative regulator of L1, making it attractive to speculate that these proteins were recruited and released in concert with MOV10 and/or UPF1.</p><p>Ectopically expressed canonical L1 RNPs have been shown to accumulate in cytoplasmic stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doucet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goodier et al., 2010</xref>), and our observation of UPF1, MOV10, and MAGOH in the RNase-sensitive fraction is consistent with this characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jain et al., 2016</xref>). However, the additional presence of EIF4A3 and RBM8A suggested that our RNPs may instead overlap with IGF2BP1 (IMP1) granules, reported to be distinct from stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jønson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Weidensdorfer et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, we observed IGF2BP1, YBX1, DHX9, and HNRNPU within the mixture of co-captured proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We did not, however, observe canonical stress granule markers G3BP1 or TIA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goodier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doucet et al., 2010</xref>). Surprisingly, siRNA knockdown of IGF2BP1 substantially reduced L1 retrotransposition; however, we note that the cytotoxicity associated with knocking-down EJC components may confound interpretation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Given the result obtained, IGF2BP1 appears to support L1 proliferation. Consistent with an established function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Weidensdorfer et al., 2009</xref>), IGF2BP1 granules may sequester and stabilize L1 RNPs in the cytoplasm, creating a balance of L1 supply and demand that favors proliferation over degradation. Although human L1 does not contain a known IRES, it is known that <italic>ORF2</italic> is translated by a non-canonical mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alisch et al., 2006</xref>), and IGF2BP1 may promote this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Weinlich et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Nuclear L1 macromolecules</title><p>The fraction eluted from the α-ORF1p medium contained the population of proteins physically linked to both ORF2p and ORF1p and greatly resembled the components released upon RNase treatment, hence these linkages primarily occur through the L1 RNA (or are greatly influenced by it). In contrast, the supernatant from the α-ORF1p affinity capture contained the proteins we speculate to be associated with ORF2p, but not ORF1p; moreover, fully intact RNA does not appear to be essential to the maintenance of these interactions. An exciting alternate interpretation to direct protein-protein linkage is that some of the L1 RNAs in this population may be at least partially hybridized to L1 cDNAs, which would render them RNase resistant: at the salt concentration used in our RNase assay (0.5 M; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), RNase A is unlikely to cleave the RNA component of DNA/RNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Halász et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wyers et al., 1973</xref>), and such activity is not expected of RNase T1. This interpretation is supported by several pieces of indirect evidence: (1) the presence of well-known DNA binding factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); (2) the presence of several of these same factors (PARP1, PCNA, PURA, and TOP1) in ORF2p-3xFLAG affinity captured from enriched chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>); (3) The pronounced decrease in stable in vivo co-assembly of TOP1, PCNA, PARP1, PURA, and PURB in affinity captured L1 fractions harboring ORF2p EN<sup>-</sup> and RT<sup>-</sup> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), with a greater effect in RT<sup>-</sup> mutations; and (4) our L1 preparations exhibit RT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, in vitro; as well as in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>]). If true, linkage of subcomplexes via DNA/RNA hybrids would further support the nuclear origin of much of this fraction; further study is needed. Notable within this group of putative nuclear interactors was the PURA/PURB/PCNA cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), with TOP1 also in close proximity, ontologically grouping to the nuclear replication fork (GO:0043596). Separately, a few physical and functional connections have been shown for PURA/PURB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Knapp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kelm et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mittler et al., 2009</xref>), PCNA/TOP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Takasaki et al., 2001</xref>), and PURA/PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Qin et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, PURA, PURB, and PCNA have been independently linked to replication-factor-C/replication factor-C-like clamp loaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kubota et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Havugimana et al., 2012</xref>). Given that we also observe tight clustering of protein pairs known to be physically and functionally linked, e.g. PABPC1/4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jønson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Katzenellenbogen et al., 2007</xref>) and HSPA8/1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jønson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nellist et al., 2005</xref>), and because we have established PCNA as a positive regulator of L1 retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>), we propose that the [PURA/B/PCNA/TOP1] group is a functional sub-complex of nuclear L1. In addition, although it does not cluster as closely to the [PURA/B/PCNA/TOP1] group, PARP1 is found within the putative nuclear L1 population and is functionally linked with PCNA, specifically stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bryant et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Min et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Ying et al., 2016</xref>). Further tying them together, these proteins all also exhibited substantial affinity capture yield decreases in response to mutations that abrogated ORF2p EN or RT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This is compelling because these ORF2p enzymatic activities are required in order for it to manipulate DNA and traverse the steps of the L1 lifecycle that benefit from physical association with replication forks. One caveat to this interpretation is that, while knocking down PCNA reduced L1 retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>), no such effect was observed for TOP1 or PURA/B, which led instead to mild increases in L1 activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These proteins may be physically assembled within a common intermediate, but functionally antagonistic. HSP90 proteins were also observed in this fraction, and are also linked with stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arlander et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ha et al., 2011</xref>), but exhibited a distinctive response to catalytic mutants, accumulating in EN<sup>-</sup> mutants while exhibiting a modest decrease in RT<sup>-</sup> mutants. The recruitment of the ORF2p/PCNA complex to stalled replication forks has been also proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mita et al., 2018</xref>.</p><p>As mentioned above, we previously speculated that an RNase-insensitive fraction of L1-associated UPF1 may support retrotransposition in conjunction with PCNA in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azzalin and Lingner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mita et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to other PCNA-linked proteins, catalytic inactivation of ORF2p did not robustly affect the relative levels of co-captured UPF1, and UPF1 behaved in a distinct manner during tandem capture. The equivocal behavior of UPF1 in several assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) supports UPF1’s association with both the putative cytoplasmic and nuclear L1 populations, the latter being additionally supported by the association of UPF1 with ORF2p-3xFLAG captured from chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). NAP1L4, NAP1L1, FKBP4, HSP90AA1, and HSP90AB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baltz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Castello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Simon et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rodriguez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Peattie et al., 1992</xref>) are associated with RNA binding, involved in protein folding and unfolding, and function as nucleosome chaperones. An interesting possibility is that they have a nucleosome remodeling activity that may be required to allow reverse transcription to begin elongating efficiently, or for assembly of nucleosomes on newly synthesized DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Future studies</title><p>An obvious need is the continued validation of putative interactors by in vivo assays. Genetic knockdowns coupled with L1 insertion measurements by GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ostertag et al., 2000</xref>) provide a powerful method to detect effects on L1 exerted by host factors. However, this approach can sometimes be limited by cell viability problems associated with important genes; it is therefore critical to control for this (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). IF and high-resolution microscopy may be useful to demonstrate co-localization of putative L1-associated proteins and may also be informative, warranting effort to identify appropriate antibodies and assay conditions. Bolstered by our analytical successes, RNA-sequencing, LEAP, and RNase-based affinity proteomics appear as notably high-value assays for further application-specific expansion and refinement.</p><p>Throughout this and our prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>) we have used comparable in vitro conditions for the capture and analysis of L1 interactomes. However, we are aware that this practice has enforced a single biochemical ‘keyhole’ through which we have viewed L1-host protein associations. It is important to expand the condition space in which we practice L1 interactome capture and analysis in order to expand our vantage point on the breadth of L1-related macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hakhverdyan et al., 2015</xref>). In concert with this, we must develop sophisticated, automated, reliable, low-noise methods to integrate biochemical, proteomic, genomic, and ontological data; the first stages of which we have attempted in the present study. Although we have used I-DIRT to increase our chances of identifying bona fide interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tackett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>), it is clear, and generally understood, that some proteins not making the significance cut-off will nevertheless prove to be critical to L1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Byrum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Joshi et al., 2013</xref>), such as demonstrated by our unexpected findings with IGF2BP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Through further development, including reliable integration with diverse, publicly available interactome studies, we hope to enable the detection of extremely subtle physical and functional distinctions between (sub)complexes and their components, considerably enhancing reliable exploration and hypothesis formation. Furthermore, it is striking that no structures of assembled L1s yet exist; these are missing data that are likely to provide a profound advance for the mechanistic understanding of L1 molecular physiology. However, we believe that with the methods presented here, endogenously assembled ORF1p/ORF2p/L1<italic>-</italic>RNA-containing cytoplasmic L1 RNPs can be prepared at sufficiently high purity and yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) to enable electron microscopy studies.

After centrifugal clarification, all of the L and H supernatants were pooled, respectively, and then split, resulting in two sets of cleared L and H extracts equivalent to duplicate 400 mg samples from each SILAC cell powder. These four samples were each subjected to affinity capture upon 20 μl α-FLAG magnetic medium. After binding and washing, one set of L and H samples were treated with a control solution consisting of 2 μl of 2 mg/ml BSA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, #23209) and 50 μl extraction solution, v:v (Ctrl); the other set of L and H samples was treated with a solution of 2 μl 2 mg/ml RNase A/5000 u/ml RNase T1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific #EN0551) and 50 μl extraction solution, v:v (RNase).

Searches were performed against human protein sequences (UP000005640, April 2016), custom L1 ORF1p and ORF2p protein sequences, common exogenous contaminants, and a decoy database of reversed protein sequences. Search parameters included fixed modification: carbamidomethyl (C); variable modification: Arg10, Lys8, methionine oxidation; razor and unique peptides used for protein quantitation; requantify: enabled. Contaminants, low-scoring proteins and proteins with one razor+unique peptides were filtered out from the MaxQuant output file ‘proteingroups.txt’. The list of contaminants was uploaded from the MaxQuant web-site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.coxdocs.org/">http://www.coxdocs.org/</ext-link>; ‘contaminants’). Additionally, proteins with the ‘POTENTIAL CONTAMINANT’ column value ‘+' were filtered out. Proteins with at least two razor+unique peptides were retained for the analysis. H/(H + L) and L/(H + L) values were derived from unnormalized ‘ratio H/L’ values and were used for plotting label-swapped RNase-sensitivity and split-tandem data. Unnormalized ‘ratio H/L’ values were used to calculate H/(H + L) in ORF2p catalytic mutant comparisons and in vitro exchange experiments. These values have been referred to as ‘affinities’ within the Supplementary Materials. Normalization and clustering procedures applied to data presented in the figures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) are detailed below and also in Appendix 1. Raw and processed data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD008542.</p><p>To plot RNase-sensitivity affinity capture results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), these data were normalized such that proteins that did not change upon treatment with RNases are centered at the origin. The mean value and standard deviation were calculated using the distribution of distances from the origin. The distance threshold for p-value=0.001 was calculated using the R programming language. A circle with radius equal to the threshold was plotted. Points with distances higher than the threshold were marked as black. To plot split-tandem affinity capture results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), these data were normalized such that the ORF1p affinity was set to one and the distribution median was maintained. Probabilities associated with selected clusters were calculated based on the frequency distributions of 2- and 3-node clusters present in the data. To plot EN<sup>-</sup> and RT<sup>-</sup> mutant affinity capture results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), the matrix of detected proteins for each experiment (EN<sup>-</sup> and RT<sup>-</sup>) was filtered to retain only proteins detected in at least two replicate experiments. The difference between the affinity value of ORF2p and 0.5 value was calculated for each experiment. The affinities of each protein were shifted by the calculated difference. To determine the statistical significance of differentially co-captured proteins between EN<sup>-</sup> or RT<sup>-</sup> and WT, respectively, we used a 1-sample t-test and applied Benjamini-Hochberg p-value correction. To determine the statistical significance of differentially co-captured proteins between EN<sup>-</sup> and RT<sup>-</sup> we used an unpaired t-test and applied Benjamini-Hochberg p-value correction. To plot in vitro dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>), only proteins which were identified at all time points were used. The cosine similarity method was used to calculate distances between proteins, and hierarchical clustering was used to visualize these distances. To integrate and plot the combined data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we calculated Euclidean and cosine distances for each I-DIRT-significant protein pair present in each experiment. Euclidean distances were rescaled to the range (0, 0.9). Proteins not detected in any common experiments were assigned a Euclidian distance of 1 after rescaling. The total distance between protein pairs was calculated as d = log((rescaled Euclidean distance) * (cosine distance)). This distance was rescaled to the range (0, 1). Hierarchical clustering was used to visualize the calculated distances.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Gene ontology (GO) analysis</title><p>Genes corresponding to the proteins previously reported as significant by I-DIRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>) were tested for statistical overrepresentation using the default settings provided by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.panthnerdb.org">http://www.panthnerdb.org</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mi et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">2013</xref>), searches were conducted using GO complete molecular function, biological process, and cellular compartment: all results are compiled in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA sequencing sample preparation and data acquisition</title><p>RNA fractions were obtained from fractions of L1 macromolecules isolated from pLD401 expressing cells by split-tandem affinity capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and from pLD567 and pLD624 expressing cells by affinity capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

The pooled extracts were combined with magnetic affinity medium from 30 µl of slurry. 75 µl of 1 mg/mL 3xFLAG peptide was used for elution. ½ of the sample was saved for RNA extraction (input) and the other ½ was carried forward to split-tandem IP, using 15 µl α-ORF1 affinity medium slurry.

In a perfect experiment, unchanging proteins would yield a ratio of 0.5 when comparing the fraction of each protein present in the BSA-treated sample to the sum of both the BSA- and RNase-treated samples; i.e. 1 / (1 + 1). However, our data show some variability (below, left and also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), with one replicate centering on ~0.4 (red) and another ~0.6 (blue). Therefore, we normalized the data such that the peaks at ~0.4 and~0.6 were both re-centered at 0.5. From this set, 0.5 was subtracted from the data (centering insensitive proteins at the origin, and completely sensitive proteins at 0.5), followed by multiplication by two to expand the data to cover the range from 0 (insensitive) to 1 (completely sensitive); depicted below, right.

The samples were loaded on a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Gel 1.0 mm (Life Technologies) and run for 6 min at 200V. The gel was stained with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Thermo). The gel plugs were excised and destained for 15 min in a 1:1 (v/v) solution of methanol and 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The buffer was exchanged and the samples were destained for another 15 min. This was repeated for another three cycles. The gel plugs were dehydrated by washing with acetonitrile, and then further dried by placing in a SpeedVac for 20 min. The gel plugs were treated with 250 ng of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) by adding directly on top of the dried gel plugs, and then enough 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added in order to cover the gel pieces. The gel plugs were allowed to shake at room temperature and digestion proceeded overnight. The digestion was halted by adding a slurry of R2 50 μm Poros beads (Applied Biosystems) in 5% formic acid and 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to each sample at a volume equal to that of the ammonium bicarbonate added for digestion. The samples were allowed to shake at 4⁰C for three hours. The beads were loaded onto C18 ziptips (Millipore), equilibrated with 0.1% TFA, using a microcentrifuge for 30 s at 6,000 rpm. The beads were washed with 0.5% acetic acid. Peptides were eluted with 40% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid followed by 80% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor.

The authors employ sophisticated, quantitative methods to interrogate protein interactions of (primarily) the LINE-1 ORF2 protein, thereby gaining new insight into the complexity of the host-parasite relationship and process of LINE-1 retrotransposition. It represents a significant step forward for the field, building on results of Taylor published in 2013 in Cell. There are however some issues with the wording of some conclusions overstepping the limits of what is documented by the data presented, as specifically noted below. With wording changes to more accurately describe/interpret the data the most serious limitation of this work (the lack of a co-analysis of the L1 nucleic acid intermediates), could be considered minor.</p><p>In Abstract &quot;our findings support the presence of multiple L1-derived retrotransposition intermediates in vivo&quot;; oversteps the actual data because there is no direct evidence to address which of these various complexes are bona fide retrotransposition intermediates vs which reflect the various ways the cell interferes with/prevents retrotransposition.</p><p>In numerous instances the term &quot;purified&quot; is used when the data support &quot;enrichment&quot; but not purification.

Agreed that the data show a persistent complex of ORF2p that lacks ORF1p, but that is not the same as the above. There is likewise no data to support &quot;ORF1p may be displaced from the L1 RNA during the nuclear portion of the lifecycle&quot; – maybe there is also no remaining L1 RNA by the time the ORF2 complexes lacking ORF1p are formed. The authors should provide supporting data to support this claim or remove it.</p><p>Subsection “4.4.

The effects of retrotransposition-blocking point mutations on the interactomes of purified L1 RNPs”. What evidence suggests that ORF2 traverses L1 RNA in cytoplasm? Given that this RT gets its primer from the target DNA this comment seems unwarranted. This unnecessary speculation is not appropriate for the Results section. In fact the effects of the RT and EN mutations are actually so subtle (~2x) compared to the robust effects they have on retrotransposition (&gt;&gt;100X) it may speak more to the fact that neither of these most abundant L1-containing protein complexes (both nuclear and cytoplasmic) are on the productive retrotransposition pathway.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> model – there is no evidence linking the L1 RNA to this nuclear complex with ORF2p and without ORF1p. Given that ORF1p is required to get ORF2p into the nucleus, that some ORF1p does get to the nucleus and in a form that is somehow unique (based on different reactivity of the various antibodies), and that 25% of the ORF2p follows ORF1p in the sequential enrichments, an important role for ORF1p in the nucleus seems highly likely. It would be reasonable from the data presented to consider at least two nuclear forms with ORF2p containing complexes, one with the L1 RNA and ORF1p and one without these other L1 components but with the other nuclear components.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Molloy et al. perform affinity purifications followed by quantitative mass spectrometry to identify proteins that interact with the L1-encoded proteins and mRNA in ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). Their results suggest the existence of multiple different L1 RNPs that contain the L1-encoded proteins ORF1p and ORF2p and various cellular factors at distinct stoichiometries and in discrete subcellular locations. The major advance of this manuscript over the work of Taylor et al. (Cell, 2013) is the resolution of the subcellular localisation of the different RNP intermediates. These data are really interesting and should be the starting point for a range of follow-up investigations. However, the strength with which some of the conclusions are presented is not sufficiently justified by the available data and this should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>1) Most of the conclusions about the subcellular localisation of ORF1p/ORF2p versus ORF2p-only RNP complexes are drawn from the known subcellular localisation and ontological classification of their interacting protein partners. While these data are interesting, the paper would be greatly improved by the direct demonstration of differential subcellular colocalisation of the L1 proteins with their interacting partners. Indeed, the experiments aimed at verifying these conclusions are not entirely convincing, and in some cases the results are overstated or overgeneralised (see below).</p><p>2) The authors performed ORF2p-3XFLAG affinity capture from chromatin-enriched subcellular fractions to support the conclusion that ORF2p-only RNPs localise to the nucleus. The text states that proteins co-purifying with chromatin-associated ORF2p &quot;largely overlapped&quot; with those described as nuclear ORF2p-only RNP interactors. However, comparing the list of these proteins in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> to the list of ORF2-only interactors in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> reveals relatively little overlap. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> contains 21 ORF2p-only interactors and Table S3 contains 15 nuclear ORF2p interactors, yet only five factors (PARP1, IPO7, PCNA, PURA, and TOP1) are actually shared by both lists. The statement that the lists &quot;largely overlapped&quot; needs to be softened, and the extent of the overlap explicitly stated in the text.</p><p>3) Immunofluorescence experiments have little quantitative information. Statements like &quot;these cells accounted for &lt;10% of the population&quot; and &quot;Expression of ORF2p in the absence of ORF1p resulted in &gt;90% of cells exhibiting cytoplasmic ORF2p&quot; and &quot;they always occurred in proximal pairs&quot; would be much more convincing with some statistical information about the experiment. How many cells were analysed? How many times were the results replicated? Clarity here would bolster the results.</p><p>4) Immunofluorescence experiments could also be used to demonstrate colocalisation of ORF1p and ORF2p with their presumed interaction partners in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and would provide more direct support for the conclusions drawn regarding subcellular localisation of different L1 RNPs. Such experiments would understandably be limited by the availability of antibodies to the interacting factors, but would almost certainly be feasible in some cases.</p><p>5) Analysis of host factors differentially associated with RT and EN mutant L1 RNPs is also intriguing, but the results are over-interpreted. As a whole, most of the conclusions drawn in the manuscript need to be backed up by more direct functional assays, or the language in which the conclusions are stated needs to be softened considerably.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an experimentally sound, well-written manuscript demonstrating the existence of distinct L1 complexes with potentially different roles in L1 retrotransposition. The results presented in this manuscript are novel and provide significant insights into L1 RNPs and its role in the L1 replication cycle. In addition to identifying L1 interactors with a previously reported role in L1 retrotransposition, the authors provide experimental validation of additional and previously unknown interactors. Another important finding is the demonstration that the proportions of proteins within L1 complexes is affected by individual mutations of the L1 ORF2p catalytic activities. I am very enthusiastic about the findings described in this manuscript. I think they significantly advance the research related to transposable elements and viruses and would be helpful to the future progress of studies conducted by other labs.</p><p>This reviewer did not have access to the co-submitted manuscript by Mita et al.</p><p>• Indicate if the status of L1ORFeus mRNA in the different fractions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.</p><p>• Subsection “4.2.

The remaining schematic accordingly shows ORF2p as the protein interaction hub, in keeping with our lack of evidence to support RNA as a key player in those interactions. We note additionally that the presumed mechanism of L1 insertion, TPRT, would require an ORF2p-L1 RNA interaction at the chromatin. Disruption of e.g. PCNA and UPF1 interactions with ORF2p have strong negative effects on retrotransposition; mild positive effects were observed when knocking down TOP1 and PURA/B; we also identified most of these proteins in ORF2p affinity captured from fractionated chromatin. We conclude that these ORF2p interactions modulate retrotransposition and very likely occur at the chromatin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) Most of the conclusions about the subcellular localisation of ORF1p/ORF2p versus ORF2p-only RNP complexes are drawn from the known subcellular localisation and ontological classification of their interacting protein partners.

The overlapping proteins have been more explicitly stated in the main text, and the supplementary table has been amended to draw attention to the proteins in question. We purposefully restricted the stated overlap between the proteins identified in the two different experimental designs to those proteins meeting the conservative filter of “I-DIRT specific;” detection alone was not considered sufficient. The rationale is set out in the first two paragraphs of the Results. E.g. the proteins SSBP1, PRPF6, RBM14, U2SURP, SRSF5 (not described as overlapping) were detected in the chromatin fraction ORF2p IP as well as at least one other IP presented in this study, but we do not consider that a compelling enough case to present them as putative L1 interactors at this time. Moreover, we note that in the chromatin fraction ORF2p IP experiment presented in the supplement, of the proteins found to be enriched with ORF2p in the chromatin fraction, only PCNA was also detected after IP of ORF2p from unfractionated cell extracts – this is a general limitation in the sensitivity and dynamic range provided by shotgun proteomic experiments – such that it is not uncommon to observe limited overlap in different proteomic experimental regimes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Immunofluorescence experiments have little quantitative information.

We counted many cells we observed and estimated frequencies of subpopulations, but did not record images from the population that were not “interesting” with respect to observed ORF1p/ORF2p expression – moreover, aside from the nuclear ORF2p cells, the results were comparable to those we previously published in Taylor et al. 2013. Unfortunately, we currently lack the personnel to revisit this experimental regime. We therefore softened our language regarding the precise proportions of the populations observed. However, to respond to the reviewer and strengthen the manuscript, we added a new companion analysis. We possess 11 such IF images displaying the described ORF2p staining phenomenon, among other non-staining cells (now provided in supplement along with the extracted/analyzed data tables). We analyzed the distributions of cell-cell proximities (nuclei) in these images to provide a quantitative validation of our claim regarding the proximity of cells displaying nuclear ORF2p – now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.

As stated above, there are some expected limitations related to identifying reagents, as well as expectations that some may not generate discrete/enriched co-localization foci. E.g. as annotated in Uniprot, many have broad, diffuse, or complex localizations – we also agree with the reviewer’s point that localization of these proteins in the context of L1 expression may differ from that defined by normal conditions, curated in databases. Hence, this experiment would require some time for trial and error on our part and, given IF is not the expertise of our core-team, was not an experiment we could implement within the post-review timeframe.</p><p>We have instead softened our language throughout (in response to this and other reviewer points), in order to compensate for the reviewer’s degree of skepticism regarding putative L1 complexes, and we have added additional IF co-localization as a future experimental direction in the discussion. We also believe this point is at least partly addressed by the chromatin fractionation experiment (pt. 1, above) which showed compositional overlap with our proposed nuclear L1 intermediates inferred from alternative fractionation schemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Analysis of host factors differentially associated with RT and EN mutant L1 RNPs is also intriguing, but the results are over-interpreted. As a whole, most of the conclusions drawn in the manuscript need to be backed up by more direct functional assays, or the language in which the conclusions are stated needs to be softened considerably.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript as a whole has been modified to soften tone, including the changes made in response to reviewer #1; in this section we removed the text pertaining to ORF2p traversing L1 RNA in cytoplasm, as well as other modifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] • Indicate if the status of L1ORFeus mRNA in the different fractions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>RNA-seq and LEAP analysis of the fractions has now been provided, see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Subsection “4.2. Split-tandem separation of compartment-specific L1 ORF-associated complexes”, the last paragraph provides experimental validation of the significant overlap between putative nuclear L1 complexes and complexes detected in chromatic enriched fractions. Please discuss this validation earlier in this study as it provides important experimental support for the references to these complexes as nuclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to accommodate this critique, however, we cannot move this section to an early position in the manuscript because the section, as written, leverages the observation of TOP1 as part of the putative nuclear L1 complex. TOP1 was not detected in the RNase experiment, and therefore, moving this section requires some acrobatics to narrate the significance of the TOP1 observation and testing of TOP1 by over-expression, etc. If the reviewer is adamant on this request, we could accommodate it with a more involved re-write where we excise the text describing the chromatin fractionation and move it to the previous section, but leave the over-expression results where they are (following the observation of TOP1). We note that, as it stands, this information is provided in the Results section attached to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, so, it is provided at a reasonably early juncture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Comment on how these nuclear and cytoplasmic complexes align with the existing literature showing that L1 RT present in the cytoplasm generates cDNA when provided with a primer (LEAP protocol).</p></disp-quote><p>We have done LEAP experiments on split-tandem affinity captured L1 fractions (those of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and all fractions are highly active (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The absolute activity between the fractions is similar (within 2-fold for LD401) but the RNA and protein partitioning is not, and thus depending on how the data is normalized (to ORF2p or the L1 RNA) the specific activity can be viewed in different ways. These experiments require further investigation and the data will require a thorough and nuanced discussion that will be included in a follow-up study we’re conducting on the enzymatic activities of purified L1 macromolecules. For now, we can conclude that the RNA-ORF2p complex seems competent to perform LEAP given the appropriate primer, with or without detectable ORF1p. Further we would note that the precise subcellular localization of the active L1 RT in previously reported LEAP preparations is far from clear. Our prior work was whole cell extracts made by cryomilling; the Moran lab protocol uses roughly 3 packed cell volumes of a hypotonic buffer with 1% Triton X-100 and 1% deoxycholate detergents before ultracentrifugation and contains protein from multiple cellular compartments, along with ~65-fold less specific activity than the affinity-purified fractions. Thus at least formally, we don’t know that the subcellular origin of LEAP-competent RT in these assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• &quot;We did not observe instances of nuclear ORF2p using the construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, bottom row), suggesting that ORF1p is required for ORF2p nuclear localization.&quot; This statement needs to be put in the context of published data demonstrating that the ORF2p expressing plasmids support efficient Alu retrotransposition.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the distance is presented &quot;on a one-unit arbitrary scale.&quot; Provide more information on how this unit was developed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is explained in the Materials and methods section: “To integrate and plot the combined data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> – now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we calculated Euclidean and cosine distances for each I-DIRT-significant protein pair present in each experiment. Euclidean distances were rescaled to the range (0, 0.9). Proteins not detected in any common experiments were assigned a Euclidian distance of 1 after rescaling. The total distance between protein pairs was calculated as d = log((rescaled Euclidean distance) * (cosine distance)). This distance was rescaled to the range (0, 1). Hierarchical clustering was used to visualize the calculated distances.” We have added a note to the figure legend referring the reader to this part of the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and several statements throughout the manuscript indicate a complete lack of specific proteins in the nuclear and cytoplasmic complexes. Please clarify if this is an accurate interpretation. Are some proteins enriched in specific complexes and depleted in others rather than absent?</p></disp-quote><p>If we understand the reviewer’s question correctly, using the split tandem experiment as a model to answer – only ORF1p was quantitatively shifted at or nearly 100% to the elution fraction of the 2D purification (binary relationship – it is in one fraction and not in another). Note that, for technical reasons related to quantitation using shotgun proteomics, zero-values for proteins (that may actually not be present) are not recorded in any sample, and small values instead are derived either from noise or imputed. ORF1p was shown to be ~100% in the final elution fraction by western blot (Taylor et al. 2013) and by MS (this study). Other proteins generated much of their signal (as graphed) in the ORF1p containing fraction, but some proportion may have decayed away (remaining in the supernatant) or be partially associated with the ORF2p-only fraction. We cannot distinguish between these scenarios based on that data alone. The inverse is also true for proteins in the supernatant. UPF1 represents a protein that we hypothesize to be specifically present in both complexes because of its borderline behavior in numerous experiments. Being an RNP that evolves from one lifecycle stage to the next, proteins likely exchange on and off the complex dynamically along the way. These proteins may exhibit absolute or conditional dependencies, resulting in heterogeneous mixtures or continua of RNPs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) demonstrates varying degrees of coordination of protein associations with L1 based on catalytic mutants. E.g. association with TOP1 seems nearly-dependent on catalytic activity or an activity-associated cellular context. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) demonstrates varying degrees of coordination in protein decay and exchange from L1s in vitro. Several proteins appear to behave nearly identically, within different classes. However, there are few binary, strictly present/not present, relationships observed across these many experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is an attempt to synthesize the sum of the data into a model of co-behavioral patterns that explain the results. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) is a schematic that reflects our degree of belief, based on the data, of physiologically relevant steady state features of L1. We cannot rule out that some nuclear proteins that are also found in the cytoplasm could join L1s in the cytoplasm (making no assumptions about a given RNP’s continued progress in the lifecycle), or the vice versa. We assume that some host factors assembled in the cytoplasm may indeed carry through to the nucleus, perhaps UPF1 is an example, or, perhaps UPF1 joins cytoplasmic and nuclear L1 fractions in distinct binding events with distinct outcomes. Dissecting these relationships in greater resolution is the topic of our ongoing work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Statements that are supported by unpublished data that are not shown in this or the accompanying manuscript should be eliminated or restated.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Discuss the possibility that the lack of detection of the L1 ORF1p in the nucleus by IHC could be due to technical problems rather than the lack of the protein?</p></disp-quote><p>This section has been re-written; we do not make a point of not detecting ORF1p in the nucleus in our IF assays anymore, and instead refer to Mita et al. the co-submission that does demonstrate nuclear ORF1p.
