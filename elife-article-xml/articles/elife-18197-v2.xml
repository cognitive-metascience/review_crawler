cortical folding remain poorly understood. The hominoid-specific gene <italic>TBC1D3</italic> undergoes segmental duplications during hominoid evolution, but its role in brain development has not been explored. Here, we found that expression of <italic>TBC1D3</italic> in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice via <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation caused delamination of ventricular radial glia cells (vRGs) and promoted generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with typical morphology of outer radial glia (oRG), which are most abundant in primates. Furthermore, down-regulation of <italic>TBC1D3</italic> in cultured human brain slices decreased generation of oRGs. Interestingly, localized oRG proliferation resulting from either <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3, was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. Thus, we have identified a hominoid gene that is required for oRG generation in regulating the cortical expansion and folding.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18197.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18197.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18197.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The outer layer of the mammalian brain the cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory, attention, awareness and thought. While rodents have a smooth cortical surface, the cortex of larger mammals such as primates is organized into folds and furrows. These folds increase the amount of cortex that can fit inside the confines of the skull, and are thought to have allowed the evolution of more advanced thought processes.</p><p>Mutations in various genes are likely to have contributed to the expansion and folding of the cortex. These mutations may not always have involved changes in the instructions encoded within the genes, but might instead have involved changes in the number of copies of a gene. One plausible candidate gene is <italic>TBC1D3</italic>, which is only found in the great apes and is active in the cortex. The chimpanzee genome contains a single copy of <italic>TBC1D3</italic> whereas the human genome contains multiple copies.</p><p>Ju, Hou et al. have now shown that introducing the <italic>TBC1D3</italic> gene into mouse embryos triggers changes in the embryonic cortex. Specifically, this gene increases the number of a type of cell called the outer radial glial cell in the cortex. These cells give rise to new neurons, and are usually rare in mice but abundant in the brains of animals with a folded cortex. Additional experiments using samples of human brain tissue confirmed that <italic>TBC1D3</italic> is required for the outer radial glial cells to form. The samples were collected from miscarried fetuses with the informed consent of the patients and following approved protocols and ethical guidelines.</p><p>Finally, introducing the <italic>TBC1D3</italic> gene into the mouse genome also gave rise to animals with a folded cortex, rather than their usual smooth brain surface. Further work is now required to identify how <italic>TBC1D3</italic> helps to generate outer radial glial cells, and to work out how these cells cause the cortex to expand. Testing the behavior of mice with the <italic>TBC1D3</italic> gene could also uncover the links between cortical folding and thought processes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18197.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18197.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neural progenitors</kwd><kwd>cortical folding</kwd><kwd>hominoid-specific gene</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014CB910203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Zhen-Ge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31330032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Zhen-Ge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31490591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Zhen-Ge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31321091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Zhen-Ge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>61327902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Zhen-Ge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB02040003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Zhen-Ge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Introducing a hominoid-specific gene into mice induces cortical folding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is generally assumed that the expansion of the mammalian neocortex during evolution correlates with the increase in intelligence, and this process involves increased production of cortical neurons, resulting from an extended neurogenic period as well as increased proliferative ability of neural stem cells and progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geschwind and Rakic, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun and Hevner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zilles et al., 2013</xref>). To fit into a limited cranium, expanded cortical surfaces are folded to form gyri and sulci. Recent cross-species studies have shown the emergence of an outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) in the primate cortex, consisting of a massive pool of proliferating basal progenitors (BPs) and post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smart et al., 2002</xref>). Unlike the neuroepithelia-derived ventricular radial glial cells, which undergo repeated and typically asymmetric cell division at the apical surface of the ventricular zone, the BPs, after delamination from the apical surface, translocate to the SVZ, where they exhibit symmetric or asymmetric divisions. In primates, the recently identified outer (basal) radial glia (referred to as oRG or bRG) and the intermediate progenitors (IPs) in the OSVZ, which can undergo multiple rounds of symmetric or asymmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>), are two major forms of BPs. By contrast, the IPs and minimal oRG cells in the mouse SVZ usually exhibit final division to generate a pair of post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). The radial and lateral expansion of BPs is thought to be a main cause of cortical folding of gyrencephalic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fietz and Huttner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewitus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, forced expansion of BPs by down-regulating the DNA-associated protein Trnp1 or overexpressing cell cycle regulatory proteins Cdk4/Cyclin D1 resulted in gyrification of the cerebral cortex in naturally lissencephalic mouse or gyrencephalic ferret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nonaka-Kinoshita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stahl et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Given that genetic differences between humans and other species are likely to be the causes of human-specific traits, including complexity of cortical morphology, extensive studies have been performed in comparing genes and genetic elements of different species of primates and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arcila et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fietz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Florio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Konopka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Bleness et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, several recent studies have aimed to uncover the distinctive transcriptional signature of the expanded human OSVZ or BPs that reside there, leading to the identification of a group of genes highly expressed in the human OSVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2014</xref>), and human-specific orthologs preferentially expressed in human RGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Florio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>). For examples, platelet-derived growth factor D is expressed specifically and functionally important in human but not mouse RGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lui et al., 2014</xref>). A human lineage-specific Rho GTPase-activating protein could enhance the generation of IPs and cause neocortex expansion when expressed in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Florio et al., 2015</xref>). Since cortical folding emerges progressively during primate evolution, multiple primate- and hominid-specific genes are likely to be involved in the emergence of cortical folding.</p><p>Gene duplication may play critical roles in brain evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geschwind and Rakic, 2013</xref>). In particular, duplication of specific genes in humans may be responsible for the marked increase in cortical folding. The <italic>TBC1D3</italic> gene is derived from a segmental duplication, with multiple copies present in the human chromosome 17 and present in the chimpanzee genome as a single copy gene (but absent in other species) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodzic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pei et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zody et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, <italic>TBC1D3</italic> corresponds to one of the core duplicons that have been implicated in the expansion of intrachromosomal segmental duplications during hominoid evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2007</xref>). Because the timing of origination and amplification of the <italic>TBC1D3</italic> gene is consistent with the evolutionary divergence of primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stahl and Wainszelbaum, 2009</xref>), we decided to explore its role in brain development by expressing this gene in mice.</p><p>We found <italic>TBC1D3</italic> expression markedly elevated the generation and proliferation of BPs and resulted in extensive cortex folding in the mouse brain, and further delineated the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its action. Furthermore, <italic>TBC1D3</italic> is essential for the generation of BPs in cultured developing human brain slices. The transgenic mice generated in this study may provide a feasible model to link cortical folding to higher brain functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TBC1D3 expression in mice delaminates ventricular neuroprogenitors</title><p>A previous study showed that TBC1D3 paralogues are expressed in most human tissues, including the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodzic et al., 2006</xref>).

Interestingly, expression of TBC1D3 caused delamination of ventricular radial glia (vRG), and a decreased level of N-cadherin at adherens junctions (AJs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) at the ventricular surface. The reduction in N-cadherin was probably due to either the transcriptional inhibition or destabilization of transcripts, because in situ hybridization and real-time PCR showed marked reduction of <italic>N-cadherin (Cdh2</italic>) transcript in VZ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and flow cytometry-sorted YFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressing TBC1D3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>), respectively.

We thus examine the effect of TBC1D3 expression via <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation on neuroprogenitor proliferation by calculating the proportion of cells in S phase, as assayed by the incorporation of pyrimidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 2 hr before sacrificing the electroporated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). We found that TBC1D3 expression caused an increase in BrdU-positive (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) proliferating cells, as compared to that of control mice electroporated with vehicle construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). In an additional control experiment, we found that expressing a mutated form of TBC1D3, with the deletion of amino acids 286 to 353 (∆286–353) essential for its cytoplasmic retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2014</xref>), in neural progenitors had no effect on BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). These results suggest that cytoplasmic presence of TBC1D3 promotes the proliferation of early neural precursors. Interestingly, the TBC1D3-induced population of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells scattered widely across the cortex, from VZ to CP, with the highest concentration in SVZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C,F</xref>), indicating increased generation of BPs. The identity of these basal localized cells as BPs was further revealed by positive labeling by Ki67, a marker for cells in cell cycle, and negative labeling by NeuN, a marker for post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This effect of TBC1D3 expression was also confirmed by the increase in the proportion of cells stained with the mitotic marker phosphorylated Histone (PH3<sup>+</sup>) in basal regions and a decrease in cells attached to the ventricular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,G</xref>). The seemingly non-cell autonomous effect of TBC1D3 expression on proliferation of BPs was most likely caused by different dosages of pE/nestin-TBC1D3 and pCAG-YFP (3:1) used in electroporation, because electroporation with pCAGGS-TBC1D3-IRES-EGFP, a vector co-expressing both TBC1D3 and EGFP, caused increase in numbers of basal BrdU<sup>+</sup> or PH3<sup>+</sup> cells in EGFP<sup>+</sup> but not in EGFP<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To determine whether delamination itself is sufficient to transform vRG to BPs, we over-expressed in vRG the extracellular domain (EC1) of N-cadherin, which has been shown to be capable of disrupting the homophilic intercellular N-cadherin interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2010</xref>), and found that EC1 expression caused detachment of vRG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>) but had no effect on the proliferation of either apical or basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C–F</xref>).

The RG identity of these cells was further corroborated by the oRG-like morphology and the mode of division. In TBC1D3-expressing mouse cortical slices, we observed that many Sox2<sup>+</sup> or Pax6<sup>+</sup> BPs exhibited a single process pointing to the pial surface with intense signals of mitosis-specific phospho-Vimentin (p-Vim) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), similar to unipolar oRGs identified in the human fetal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>).

We labeled individual progenitors with H2B-GFP to trace nuclear motion and tdTomato to reveal cell morphology without or with co-electroporation with TBC1D3 expression vector pCS2-Myc-TBC1D3, and brains were sliced 24 hr later for time-lapse imaging. In agreement with the above finding of increased oRG population, the number of cells with MST was markedly higher in TBC1D3-expressing slices, as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,G</xref>). To visualize and identify the types of oRGs and their daughter cells generated by TBC1D3 expression, we electroporated E13.5 mice with pCAGGS-TBC1D3-IRES-EGFP plasmids (or pCAGGS-IRES-EGFP as the control), followed with time-lapse imaging (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>) and immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–L</xref>) of E14.5 brain slices. More than half (74/120) of proliferating cells labeled by pCAGGS-TBC1D3-IRES-EGFP were typical oRG with a single basal process and an upward MST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). In agreement with that observed in the primate OSVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>), we also observed other types of oRGs, including bipolar cells with both apical and basal processes (42/120) and a few cells with a single apical process and a downward MST (4/120) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). Post-imaging immunostaining of cell markers showed that, in TBC1D3-electroporated samples, a large fraction of either apical or basal daughter cells derived from oRG cells exhibiting MST continued to express Sox2 but not Tbr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–L</xref>), consistent with oRG cells with the capacity for multiple rounds of cell division.

Thus, TBC1D3 expression in mice had endowed the primate-like proliferative potency of oRG cells.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the constructs encoding TBC1D3 siRNAs (1033, 3B, or 440) down-regulated the expression of TBC1D3 in cultured Hela cells in various degrees with siTBC1D3-440 exhibiting most effective effect. Next, vRG cells in cultured fetal human brain slices were transfected with TBC1D3 or control siRNA using electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). After culture for 72 hr, we found that electroporated cells in control samples exhibited normal delamination and a large fraction of them translocated to SVZ regions with typical morphology of oRG cells, whereas majority of siTBC1D3-electroporated cells remained in VZ regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). These results suggest that TBC1D3 is critical for the generation of oRG cells.

Similar to that observed in electroporation experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), some of the basal Sox2<sup>+</sup>Tbr2<sup>-</sup> cells exhibited clustered distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>). Notably, clustered columns of Sox2<sup>+</sup>Pax6<sup>+</sup>Tbr2<sup>-</sup> cells were observed beneath regions of protrusion (as defined by DAPI staining of cells) at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), supporting the ontogeny unit hypothesis for cortex expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rakic, 1988</xref>). Unlike basal Pax6<sup>+</sup> cells, relative density of total Pax6<sup>+</sup> only slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>).

These results further support the conclusion based on <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation studies that TBC1D3 expression promotes the generation of highly proliferative BPs in mice.

Importantly, this oRG generation is accompanied by the appearance of cortical folding. Furthermore, we elucidated the cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of proliferative oRG cells by showing that TBC1D3 expresssion caused increased delamination of VZ neuroprogenitors via down-regulation of N-cadherin, and elevated proliferative ability of BPs is accompanied by a reduced expression of <italic>Trnp1</italic> and likely involves Ras-ERK signaling cascade. These effects together resulted in the expansion and dispersion of BPs, giving rise to increased number of newborn neurons and leading to cortical folding (for model see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>).</p><p>In small rodents, RGs in the VZ and IPs in the SVZ are two major cell types responsible for cortex development. However, amplification of VZ progenitors via overexpression of β-catenin in the mouse brain led to the folding of the ventricular rather than cortical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chenn and Walsh, 2002</xref>), and amplification of IPs only increased the brain size without inducing cortical folding in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nonaka-Kinoshita et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies have established the association between the relative abundance of oRG and the degree of cortical folding in various species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). In the present study, we showed that increased population of oRG in mice is accompanied with cortical fold formation, supporting the critical role of highly proliferative oRG in cortical expansion and gyrification in primates.</p><p>It is postulated that oRG cells are derived from the ventricular RGs, presumably requiring delamination from apical anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borrell and Gotz, 2014</xref>). However, loss of adherens junction proteins or breaking their linkage to the cytoskeletal belts by down-regulating the small GTPase RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cappello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lien et al., 2006</xref>) had little effect on oRG generation or cortical folding, although apically anchored progenitor cells became delaminated. Thus, delamination of VZ progenitors is not sufficient for generating highly proliferative BPs, and changes in cell cycle regulatory factors are also be required. In the present study, we showed that expression of TBC1D3 led to not only down-regulation of N-cadherin, leading to VZ progenitor delamination, but also reduced Trnp1 expression and enhanced ERK signaling that could be involved in elevated proliferation of delaminated cells. Furthermore, other functions of TBC1D3 may also contribute to the cortical folding phenotype we observed. For examples, cell culture studies of TBC1D3 have suggested its potential role in membrane endocytosis, as well as Ras activation and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wainszelbaum et al., 2008</xref>), processes that may be involved in various aspects of neural development leading to cortical folding and gyrification. Indeed, we found that Ras activity was involved in TBC1D3-induced proliferation of BPs. Recent single-cell transcriptome analyses of human oRG cells have identified multiple preferentially expressed genes related to extracellular matrix formation, cell migration, and stemness, including the most specific oRG marker HOPX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>). Strikingly, many HOPX positive cells were observed in TBC1D3 TG mice. The relationship between TBC1D3 expression and these oRG markers remains to be clarified. Simple ectopic localization of RG cells outside of the ventricular zone may not be sufficient to cause cortical expansion or folding as shown in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoon et al., 2014</xref>). Appearance of oRG-like features, including the contact with pia surface by the basal process, multiple rounds of cell division, expression of specific markers, as well as clustered regional distribution of BPs observed in this study, may play prominent roles in cortical folding.</p><p>Cortical expansion is assumed to be associated with the emergence of uniquely cognitive skills in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luders et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zilles et al., 2013</xref>). However, this hypothesis has been mainly based on across species comparative studies. Global or regional-specific changes in gyrification index (GI) have been observed in brains of subjects following various types of extensive training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amunts et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luders et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luders et al., 2008</xref>). For example, in keyboard players, the local GI increases in response to early onset of professional training and duration of practice, and correlates with motor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amunts et al., 1997</xref>). Conversely, a significant decline in the cortical GI was observed in patients with mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonnici et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wolosin et al., 2009</xref>). Understanding of the precise contribution of cortical expansion and gyrification to cognition functions has been challenging due to the lack of appropriate animal model systems. The deliberate behavior analyses for TG mice generated in this work may provide a link between cortex expansion and higher brain functions.</p><p>Recently, a human-specific gene <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> has been shown to promote production of basal IPs and cause cortical folding in the electroporated mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Florio et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that <italic>TBC1D3</italic>, which appeared earlier than <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic> during human evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Florio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodzic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perry et al., 2008</xref>), acts as a candidate gene that controls many other genes involved in cortex expansion and folding. Multiple genes underlying different or shared cellular processes associated with neurogenesis may all contribute in part to the formation of cortical folding and gyrification found in primates. Thus, it would be of great interest to elucidate gene expression networks related with TBC1D3 expression. Identification of the ‘hub’ genes of such networks may further clarify the role of TBC1D3 in the cytoarchitectural development on the cortex. This study provides proof-of-concept that the brain development can be regulated by duplicated genes during hominoid evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human fetal brain collection</title><p>Human fetal brain tissue samples were collected at autopsy within 3 hr of spontaneous abortion with the informed consent of the patients following protocols and institutional ethic guidelines stated in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2013</xref>).

The key conclusion the authors made is that TBC1D3 is required for oRG generation in regulating cortical expansion and folding.

It is still possible that TBC1D3 simply regulates attachment to ventricular surface, lack of which leads to aberrant proliferation in basal location.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Expression of a hominoid-specific gene in mice induces cortical folding and enhances motor learning&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, the experiments required to address the major points raised by the reviewers would exceed the time limit imposed by <italic>eLife</italic> guidelines, so we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Increased population of oRG in human OSVZ has been recently suggested as a potential mechanism for cortical expansion that differentiates brain structures between human and rodent. In this study, Ju et al. investigated the function of TBC1D3, a hominoid-specific gene, in regulating the expansion and folding of the mammalian neocortex. TBC1D3 has previously been shown to be a hominoid-specific oncoprotein that promotes cell proliferation (Pei et al., 2002), activates RAS and enhances EGF/EGFR and insulin signaling (Wainszelbaum et al., 2008; Wainszelbaum et al., 2012).</p><p>Here, the authors expressed TBC1D3 in the developing mouse cortex using in utero electroporation and transgenic, and found that (over)expression of TBC1D3 led to a disruption of the junction at the ventricular zone surface, a delamination of radial glial progenitors, increase in self-renewable outer radial glia (oRGs) and intermediate progenitors, and an effect on motor strip cortical folding. Moreover, the authors showed that the TBC1D3 transgenic mice exhibit an improvement in a certain aspect of motor learning compared with the control. The authors also suggested a potential link between TBC1D3 and TRNP1, a DNA-binding protein that has previously been shown to regulate cortical progenitor behavior and folding.</p><p>The impression of the reviewers and the board is that this manuscript addresses an interesting and timely topic in the field and the authors performed analyses to support the main conclusions. The finding that TBC1D3 overexpression is sufficient to lead to some gyrification of the rodent cortex is interesting, but questions from reviewers about the underlying mechanisms of gyrification, and the relevance of the motor learning enhancement remain. The issues raised by the reviewers would, in our opinion, require more time than the 2 months maximum allowed at <italic>eLife</italic> for to receive revisions, and thus <italic>eLife</italic> has decided to reject the manuscript but is willing to consider a revision to be returned to the reviewers if these issues can be addressed sufficiently. The number of criticisms and the time that might be required to address these criticisms might be more than you are willing to accept to see the work published in <italic>eLife</italic>, and thus you may decide to seek submission to an alternative journal.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>The authors should carefully characterize the ventricular zone organization (e.g. junction integrity), radial glial fiber scaffold, and pial basement membrane integrity. Some of the phenotypes presented may be due to disruption of the integrity of these structures, which can lead to many secondary effects, in which case the gyrification phenotype may be an artifact of anatomic disruption. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>: The authors indicated a defect at the ventricular zone surface in the TBC1D3 section do the authors find a spatial correlation between the presence of &quot;oRG-like cells&quot; (and/or cell clumps) and the ventricular zone surface defect? Since TBC1D3 is most highly expressed at the surface of VZ, TBC1D3 might not directly transform vRG to oRG.</p><p>It appears that TBC1D3 expression exerts a strong non-cell autonomous effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and supplemental figures) reflected in the electroporation experiments. For all these analyses, the authors should quantify cell autonomous (EYFP<sup>+</sup>) and non-cell autonomous (EYFP<sup>-</sup>) effects, e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C/D</xref>, BrdU and PHH3 increase/decrease in EYFP<sup>+</sup> or EYFP<sup>-</sup> cells? Could the non-cell autonomous effect arise from the disruption of junction and disorganization of the ventricular zone? In principle, the disruption of junction could result in a detachment of radial glia (to be oRG-like; but not really oRG produced by RG division; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), clumps of cells, non-cell autonomous effects, and neuronal migration and organization defects. However, this line of processes may not really be related to neocortical expansion and folding.</p><p>The subcellular localization of TBC1D3 is mainly cytosolic in the developing human brain, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. The cytosolic role of overexpression TBC1D3 is further supported a lack of proliferation-increasing effect without cytosolic retention signal (?286-353, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). The authors suggested a transcriptional suppression of N-cadherin and Trnp1 by TBC1D3, but the altered expressions on those genes may be just indirect effects of cytosolic role of TBC1D3. Overexpressed TBC1D3 in human carcinoma cell lines is exclusively cytosol, via direct protein-protein interaction with microtubule (He et al. PLoS One 2014). Do the authors think that TBC1D3 directly regulates gene transcription? What exactly is ectopic TBC1D3 doing in vRG and oRG. How might the cytoplasmic retention influence its function? How may the phenotype that the authors observed in the mouse cortex be related to the known functions of TBC1D3, e.g. activating RAS and enhancing EGF and Insulin signaling?</p><p>How were quantification described <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref> obtained? How were the numbers of total RGs and oRG-like cells defined in 3F? (e.g. There are 3 DiI-labeled cells in the right panel (TBC1D3) of 3D. Was the one in the upper layer having both basal and apical process counted as an oRG or a soma translocating neuron?). In 3G, does # of events described indicate total dividing cells in a certain area of the imaged slice? The method of quantification should be clearly described.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, the authors perform IUE electroporation of TBC1D3 followed by DiI pial surface labeling to back-label potential outer Radial Glial cells (with an basal endfeet touching the pia but lacking an apical attachment in the ventricular zone). How can the authors observe such a significant effect on oRG-like cell density following DiI labeling since the IUE electroporation is usually sparse. The only potential explanation is that TBC1D3 has significant cell non-autonomous effects on non-electroporated cells. The authors should at least discuss this or perform DiI back-labeling on embryos from the transgenic mouse line where presumably all the neural progenitors in the dorsal telencephalon express TBC1D3.</p><p>The behavioral analysis is inadequate to conclude that motor learning is enhanced. Because results of rotarod test in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> is the only evidence that the gene or cortical folding enhances learning, it would be better to provide further information or supportive evidence. Figure 8 is not convincing and the phenotypes shown do not relate well to the rest of the paper. It's not clear why increasing the number of neurons in superficial layers of the cortex would be responsible for the rotarod phenotype shown in Figure 8. Why did authors use average foot position from the top instead of latency to fall, which is widely used and more distinct? This type of motor learning involving balance on the rotator is generally thought to require changes in cerebellar circuits, which was not explore here. Behavioral tests usually more dependent on hippocampal and cortical circuits include novel object recognition or some sensory discrimination/associative learning tests. The authors should either perform a broader range of behavioral tests in order to determine if there is a general improvement in 'cognitive' or 'motor' performance in these transgenic mouse line(s) and more carefully interpret the results in the context of the motor learning field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18197.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer 2 still has concerns, shared by the other reviewers upon consultation, about specificity of finding, that TBC1D3 could be regulating attachment to ventricular surface rather than fate, resulting in aberrant proliferation in basal location.

Since TBC1D3 is most highly expressed at the surface of VZ, TBC1D3 might not directly transform vRG to oRG.</italic> </p><p>These are reasonable concerns. We performed several additional experiments to address these questions. First, we found that expression of TBC1D3 caused dislocalization of Numb and integrin ?1 (ITGB1) which, were originally polarized distributed in endfeet of vRG cells (Campos et al., 2004; Katayama et al., 2011; Rasin et al., 2007), without disrupting the junction integrity of the ventricular zone as revealed by actin filaments (F-actin) (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Second, DiI tracing shows that radial glial fiber scaffold is intact in TBC1D3 transgenic mice (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Third, TBC1D3 electroporation has no effect on the pial basement membrane integrity as revealed by staining with laminin (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the observed cortical folding was not due to disruption of the integrity of these structures. Indeed, delamination itself is not sufficient for the generation of real oRG-like cells. As shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, detachment of vRG cells induced by blocking N-cadherin-mediated adhesion does not promote generation of basal progenitors. The concerted effects on cell adhesion and stemness pathways, including N-cadherin, Trnp1, and Ras/ERK signaling (see below), may render TBC1D3's function in promoting oRG generation.</p><p>To further determine the physiological role of TBC1D3, we performed loss-of-function study in cultured human brain slices, and found that TBC1D3 is required for the generation of oRG cells or basal progenitors (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p> <italic>It appears that TBC1D3 expression exerts a strong non-cell autonomous effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and supplemental figures) reflected in the electroporation experiments.

However, this line of processes may not really be related to neocortical expansion and folding.</italic> </p><p>The seemingly non-cell autonomous effect of TBC1D3 expression on proliferation of BPs was most likely caused by different dosage of pE/nestin-TBC1D3 and pCAG-YFP (3:1) used in electroporation, because electroporation with pCAGGS-TBC1D3-IRES-EGFP, a vector co-expressing both TBC1D3 and EGFP, caused increase in numbers of basal BrdU<sup>+</sup> or PH3<sup>+</sup> cells in EGFP<sup>+</sup> but not in EGFP<sup>-</sup> cells (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The notable slight decrease of EGFP<sup>-</sup> apical neural progenitors might be due to the disruption of proliferation niche in VZ regions (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,D</xref>, left). Indeed, detachment of vRG cells is not sufficient for the generation of real oRG-like cells.

We have adjusted this point in the revised manuscript. First, we performed additional experiments to determine how does TBC1D3 regulate N-cadherin and Trnp1 transcripts and found that expression of TBC1D3 indeed caused destabilization of N-cadherin transcript (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). The decrease in the level of Trnp1 might also be indirect. We propose that the expression of TBC1D3 in the VZ leads to detachment of vRGs via downregulation of N-cadherin and/or Trnp1, and promotes proliferation of oRG-like cells through Ras-ERK signaling. Several newly added lines of evidence support this model:</p><p>First, co-expression of a dominant-negative form of Ras<sup>S17N</sup> (Ras-DN) inhibited proliferation of TBC1D3-induced basal progenitors (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>); Second, phosphorylated active ERK (pERK) was up-regulated in TBC1D3 transgenic mice; Third, pERK was mostly present in Pax6<sup>+</sup>Tbr2<sup>-</sup> oRG cells in the developing human brain (see revised Figure 7figure supplement 2). Thus, TBC1D3 promotes oRG generation and proliferation through concerted actions on multiple molecules.</p><p> <italic>How were quantification described <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref> obtained?
