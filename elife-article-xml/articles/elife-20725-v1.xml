(ISR) is implicated in neurodegenerative disease, although the regulators and consequences of PERK activation following neuronal injury are poorly understood. Here we show that PERK signaling is a component of the mouse MAP kinase neuronal stress response controlled by the Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK) and contributes to DLK-mediated neurodegeneration. We find that DLK-activating insults ranging from nerve injury to neurotrophin deprivation result in both c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling and the PERK- and ISR-dependent upregulation of the Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4). Disruption of PERK signaling delays neurodegeneration without reducing JNK signaling. Furthermore, DLK is both sufficient for PERK activation and necessary for engaging the ISR subsequent to JNK-mediated retrograde injury signaling. These findings identify DLK as a central regulator of not only JNK but also PERK stress signaling in neurons, with both pathways contributing to neurodegeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20725.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20725.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>optic nerve</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>axonal injury</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004328</institution-id><institution>Genentech</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larhammar</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Huntwork-Rodriguez</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Zhiyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Solanoy</surname><given-names>Hilda</given-names></name><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Arundhati Sengupta</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Bei</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaminker</surname><given-names>Joshua S</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name><name><surname>Eastham-Anderson</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name><name><surname>Siu</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Modrusan</surname><given-names>Zora</given-names></name><name><surname>Tessier-Lavigne</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name><name><surname>Lewcock</surname><given-names>Joseph W</given-names></name><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>Trent A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mission Connect, a program of TIRR Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farley</surname><given-names>Madeline M</given-names></name><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>Trent A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two seemingly distinct cellular stress response pathways that contribute to neurodegeneration after axonal insults are now revealed to be under the control of a single master regulator of the neuronal injury response, the kinase DLK.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal stress response pathways are engaged following acute neuronal injury and in chronic neurodegenerative disease. The resulting regulation of gene expression controls both cellular repair processes and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheper and Hoozemans, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tedeschi and Bradke, 2013</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms underlying these stress responses may therefore offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention. One such pathway is the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), which is thought to be engaged in models of neurodegenerative diseases by PERK, one of four eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halliday and Mallucci, 2014</xref>). The resulting phosphorylation of eIF2α suppresses general translation but enhances the translation of select mRNAs, including that of the <italic>Activating transcription factor-4</italic> (<italic>Atf4</italic>), <italic>Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A</italic> (<italic>Ppp1r15a</italic>, which encodes the protein Gadd34), and <italic>DNA damage-inducible transcript-3</italic> (<italic>Ddit3</italic>, which encodes the protein CHOP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wek et al., 2006</xref>). Disrupting PERK signaling is neuroprotective in models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), prion diseases, and other disorders involving protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halliday et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moreno et al., 2013</xref>). Canonically, PERK is stimulated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and initiates the ISR as one of the three branches, along with IRE1α and ATF6α, of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wek et al., 2006</xref>), although the upstream regulators of PERK activation in the context of disease have not yet been determined.</p><p>Whereas emerging evidence indicates that neuronal PERK activity may be a feature of progressive neurodegenerative conditions, the role of PERK following acute neuronal insults remains poorly understood. Components and regulators of the UPR, including phosphorylated PERK, phosphorylated IRE1α, CHOP, and the ATF6-related transcription factor Luman, have recently been noted after nerve damage, with Luman serving a pro-regenerative role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ying et al., 2015</xref>). However, a seemingly distinct cellular stress response pathway driven by the mixed lineage kinase DLK appears to be a predominant factor in determining neuronal fate in these settings. Following neurotrophin deprivation or axonal damage, DLK stabilization leads to the activation of the stress-responsive c-Jun N-terminal kinases JNK2 and JNK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Sengupta Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tedeschi and Bradke, 2013</xref>). Downstream of JNK2 and JNK3 kinase activity, phosphorylation of the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun leads to the induction of multiple regeneration-associated genes, and this pathway is required for robust axon regrowth after peripheral nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raivich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shin et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, c-Jun also regulates the survival of injured neurons, perhaps in part through transcription of ISR-associated genes. For instance, it is necessary for the upregulation of the UPR-associated mRNA <italic>Gadd45a</italic> that is important for neuronal survival after peripheral nerve damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). c-Jun also contributes to the expression of a number of pro-apoptotic genes, including the UPR-associated mRNAs <italic>Ddit3</italic> and <italic>Atf3</italic> that contribute to the death of axotomized retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following optic nerve crush (ONC) injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2012</xref>). JNK2/JNK3 or c-Jun deficiency is neuroprotective over the first two weeks after ONC but does not enable the sustained RGC survival provided by DLK deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welsbie et al., 2013</xref>), raising the possibility that DLK controls additional signaling pathways. In the current study, our efforts to understand neuronal stress signaling pathways after acute injury uncovered a functional role for PERK signaling in regulating apoptotic responses downstream of DLK.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ISR-related expression changes in both PNS and CNS models of axonal damage</title><p>To explore pathways induced by acute neuronal stress, we began by evaluating a model of peripheral nerve injury that is known to initiate transcriptional stress responses in the axotomized neurons residing within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Expression profiling of lumbar (L4) DRG 24 hr after sciatic nerve transection revealed a number of injury-regulated mRNAs resembling those observed in similar studies of both peripheral and CNS axonal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yasuda et al., 2014</xref>), including our previous study of ONC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In addition to known c-Jun-dependent expression changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandes et al., 2013</xref>), in both models we noted the presence of ISR-associated mRNAs, including <italic>Atf4</italic> and its target genes <italic>Chac1</italic> and <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mungrue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamaguchi et al., 2008</xref>), as well as <italic>Eif2ak3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), but not other eIF2α kinases (<italic>data not shown</italic>). Further analysis comparing nerve injury-induced mRNAs to genes known to be upregulated in an ATF4-dependent manner after neuronal oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lange et al., 2008</xref>) revealed that the expression changes observed in this ISR-related gene set is greater than would be expected by chance in both axonal injury models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>). Together these observations suggested the hypothesis that the acute neuronal stress response may include activation of PERK signaling in multiple settings, consistent with a report that nerve crush leads to PERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ying et al., 2015</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20725.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Acute neuronal insults activate the integrated stress response (ISR).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of sciatic nerve crush (SNC) and optic nerve crush (ONC).

In addition to the expected phosphorylation of c-Jun indicative of stress-responsive JNK signaling, immunoblot analysis revealed a robust elevation of the transcription factor ATF4 after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), consistent with activation of the ISR. We also noted potential increases in the levels of PERK, the phosphorylated form of PERK (p-PERK) and its target eIF2α (p-eIF2α) over multiple experiments and time points, although as noted previously in assessments of PERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qi et al., 2011</xref>), the changes in these markers were less definitive than those observed with ATF4. We found a similarly significant upregulation of ATF4 in retina following ONC, along with more modest and variable elevation of p-PERK and p-eIF2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Together, the induction of ATF4 protein following both SNC and ONC provided further support for ISR activation as a feature of the acute axonal injury response. However, with only a small fraction of cells in each tissue representing axotomized neurons, we found quantitative assessment of other markers of PERK signaling to be of limited utility.</p><p>Given these limitations and the possibility that PERK activation is a general characteristic of acute neuronal stress, we hypothesized that quantitative analysis of the PERK pathway may be more suitable utilizing a distinct in vitro model. Withdrawal of nerve growth factor (NGF) from cultured embryonic DRG neurons initiates an acute stress response that shares several aspects with adult axonal injury responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). We observed that NGF withdrawal results in induction of not only JNK signaling, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Sengupta Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>), but also the ISR, as shown by activation of PERK and ATF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), and an elevation in the phosphorylated form of eIF2α. Though not as substantial as PERK activation in response to thapsigargin (Tgn), a positive control that potently induces ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth and Koch, 1989</xref>), these responses provided additional evidence that acute neuronal insults engage PERK signaling.</p><p>We next determined whether ATF4 upregulation following NGF withdrawal is dependent on PERK activity or is controlled by other ISR kinases, a question that we addressed using two distinct in vitro stress response assays, one employing embryonic neurons and one employing adult neurons. In the first, utilizing the embryonic DRG culture model described above, we targeted each of the four eIF2α kinases with distinct siRNA pools following NGF deprivation. Whereas targeting <italic>Eif2ak1</italic>, <italic>Eif2ak2</italic>, or <italic>Eif2ak4</italic> resulted in modest, variable effects on ATF4 protein levels, knockdown of <italic>Eif2ak3</italic> consistently abrogated the upregulation of ATF4, suggesting that PERK is largely responsible for this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). In the second approach, we probed the role of ISR kinases in adult axonal injury. Isolation of adult DRG neurons axotomizes them and serves as an in vitro model of peripheral nerve stress signaling and axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith and Skene, 1997</xref>). By quantifying neurite growth of these adult sensory neurons on a growth-restrictive substrate over two days in culture, we found that knockdown of ATF4 enhances axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Although we and others have found that disruption of the ISR is not sufficient to impact regeneration in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oñate et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, and <italic>data not shown</italic>), this system provided a sensitive bioassay that revealed that siRNAs targeting <italic>Eif2ak3</italic> but not other eIF2α kinases mimicked the effect of siRNA targeting <italic>Atf4</italic>, with no additive effect of targeting both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>).

DLK activity is required for this effect, as increasing concentrations of DLK inhibitor reduced DLK-mediated activation of PERK, c-Jun, and ATF4, whereas ISRIB selectively blocked ATF4 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Furthermore, HEK293T cells expressing wildtype DLK, but not a kinase-dead mutant (S302A) of DLK, resulted in upregulation of ATF4 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that DLK activity is both necessary and sufficient for initiating both the ISR and JNK signaling, with both contributing to neurodegeneration following acute insults.

Accordingly, we next investigated whether PERK signaling following acute insults originates in axons at site of injury or subsequent to retrograde signaling. First, we attempted to assess whether elevated p-PERK and ATF4 protein could be observed in sciatic nerve segments proximal to the injury site after SNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In contrast to the elevated p-PERK and ATF4 levels observed in L3/L4 DRGs, associated sciatic nerve segments did not exhibit clear evidence of ATF4 and p-PERK, and the marginal signal sometimes detected in nerve could potentially represent induction of the ISR in neighboring cells rather than axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mantuano et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). To examine axonal activation independently of surrounding cells, we next established embryonic DRG explant cultures on membranes in which the axons grow through the pores of the membrane allowing for isolation of axons from cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Unsain et al., 2014</xref>). Although p-PERK and ATF4 increase over the first six hours following NGF withdrawal in the chamber containing cell bodies and proximal axons, the corresponding distal axons did not exhibit detectable levels of either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the possibility that sub-detectable levels of ISR activation at the site of axonal insult are important, we next established compartmentalized Campenot chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campenot, 1977</xref>), in which distal axons can be locally deprived of NGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Consistent with our observations following nerve crush in vivo, we observed that distal axonal NGF deprivation is sufficient to result in elevated ATF4 protein in the central compartment containing NGF-treated DRG cell bodies and proximal axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Inhibition of JNK signaling in either the central or distal chambers prevented the induction of ATF4. In contrast, ISRIB only had this effect when applied centrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Together, these data do not preclude a role for low levels of axonally translated ATF4 in regulating acute injury responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baleriola et al., 2014</xref>) but suggest a prominent contribution of PERK activity that occurs after JNK-mediated retrograde signaling.</p><p>The observation that ISR activation occurs subsequent to retrograde signaling raised the possibility that injury-induced transcriptional changes downstream of c-Jun may mediate PERK activation. We therefore asked if upregulation of ATF4 protein is influenced by the levels of c-Jun, finding that reducing c-Jun expression by siRNA in DRG neurons does not reduce induction of ATF4 upon NGF deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although a small increase in ATF4 transcription can be observed following nerve crush (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), these results are consistent with the central role for translational control of ATF4 implied by ISRIB sensitivity and suggest that DLK does not control activation of the ISR primarily through c-Jun-mediated transcriptional changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Profiling of ISR-dependent gene expression changes following NGF deprivation</title><p>The preceding data argues that ISR activation by PERK represents a previously unappreciated general feature of the DLK-mediated stress response that is more commonly associated with MAP kinase stress signaling.

Further analysis revealed that the DLK-dependence is particularly enriched among upregulated RNAs, with over 80% of the 581 upregulated RNAs exhibiting DLKi sensitivity that reached statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Together these findings argue that DLK-mediated stress signaling following NGF deprivation contributes more prominently to induction of stress responsive genes than to downregulation of neuronal gene expression (<italic>e.g.</italic>, the transcription factor <italic>Pou4f2</italic>), distinct from the influential role of DLK in both up- and down-regulated mRNAs previously observed in ONC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We next asked what portion of the DLK-mediated expression changes are dependent on the ISR. Approximately half of the DLKi-sensitive expression changes exhibit ISRIB sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), indicating the ISR is a major component of the DLK-mediated stress response, including pro-apoptotic genes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>Bbc3</italic>, which encodes the protein PUMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simon et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Importantly, however, a substantial number of DLK-mediated expression changes exhibit little to no ISR-dependence, including additional apoptotic regulators, such as <italic>Bcl2l11</italic>, which encodes the protein Bim, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biswas et al., 2007</xref>) and Dusp16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maor-Nof et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Conversely, we evaluated the portion of ISR-mediated expression changes that exhibit DLK-dependence. Of the approximately 50% of upregulated mRNAs suppressed by ISRIB, 85% also exhibit statistically significant DLKi sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). These estimates of dual sensitivity are consistent with substantial control of the ISR by DLK.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The ISR contributes to neurodegeneration in vitro</title><p>Given that the ISR controls a significant portion of the DLK-dependent genes induced by NGF withdrawal, we next asked whether the ISR also contributes to the DLK-mediated neuronal degeneration in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Sengupta Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>). We first scored axon degeneration in the presence of ISRIB by assessing the integrity of neurites extending from DRG explants, as this represents, at least in part, somatic pro-apoptotic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simon et al., 2016</xref>). We observed that, similar to inhibition of DLK (GNE-3511, 100 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patel et al., 2015</xref>) and JNK (JNKi, AS601245, 1 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carboni et al., 2004</xref>), ISRIB treatment is sufficient to reduce degeneration at 16 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,b</xref>). However, in contrast to DLK/JNK inhibition, this protection is not sustained at 20 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c,d</xref>).

The observations reported here reveal that following acute neuronal injury, these seemingly distinct cellular stress response pathways are tightly linked via the neuronal MAP kinase kinase kinase DLK. We found that the ISR-activating kinase PERK contributes to DLK-mediated gene expression changes and neurodegeneration. Thus, activation of PERK represents a second functional component, along with JNK signaling, of the DLK-driven stress response that regulates the fates of distressed neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes the observations that acute insults known to stimulate DLK stabilization also engage the ISR through PERK, that DLK deficiency prevents ISR activation following these insults, and that DLK activity is sufficient to drive PERK phosphorylation and ATF4 upregulation in non-neuronal cells. Furthermore, our RNA-seq data suggest that greater than 80% of ISRIB-sensitive expression changes are also DLKi-sensitive. This estimate suggests a remarkable degree of overlap, given that it does not account for the many potential differences in the selectivity, metabolism, and stability of DLKi and ISRIB or differences in basal ISR and DLK pathway activity, both of which may influence the relative sensitivity of each transcript to each compound. c-Jun deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandes et al., 2012</xref>) and PERK deficiency are each partially neuroprotective after ONC, and the control of both of these pro-apoptotic signaling pathways by DLK is consistent with the potent neuroprotection provided by DLK disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welsbie et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20725.030</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A working model of DLK as a master regulator of multiple neuronal stress response pathways.</title><p>DLK (orange) regulates apoptotic transcriptional changes through both JNK signaling (green) and the PERK-driven ISR (blue) (which can also be activated by misfolded proteins in the ER).

It is possible that extensive DLK-driven gene expression overwhelms the protein folding machinery resulting in ER stress. However, a distinct PERK-independent branch of the UPR is only transiently activated after ONC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2012</xref>), and protein synthesis inhibitors fail to prevent PERK activation during neuronal ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanderson et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings from Campenot chamber experiments suggests that PERK activation occurs downstream of DLK/JNK-mediated retrograde injury signaling, though additional experiments suggest that it is not dependent on c-Jun. Perhaps DLK or one of its downstream effectors directly or indirectly mediates phosphorylation (or other post-translational modification) events of PERK or PERK regulators to initiate the ISR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Further studies may therefore uncover novel molecular interactions between the UPR and MAP kinase signaling components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Urano et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Our findings reveal that PERK signaling, which is initiated by ER stress as one branch of the UPR, can also be triggered by the MAP kinase DLK following acute neuronal insults. This raises the question of whether regulation of the ISR is a general feature of neuronal MAP kinase stress signaling. Our observation that DLK activation is sufficient to activate PERK suggests the possibility that activation of the ISR may be a common consequence of MAP kinase stress signaling in DLK-expressing cells, such as neurons. A number of recent studies implicate the ISR in models of neurodegenerative conditions, with beneficial effects of PERK and ISR inhibition that are tempered by concerns of pancreatic toxicity, yet it remains to be determined whether ER stress and the classical UPR account for PERK activation in these settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halliday et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moreno et al., 2013</xref>). Although the precise role(s) of DLK in neurodegenerative diseases requires further investigation, JNK activation has been noted in many models of progressive neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coffey, 2014</xref>). It is therefore possible that DLK activity influences or mediates PERK signaling in these settings. Given the neuronally restricted expression of DLK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirai et al., 2006</xref>) and the viability of adult DLK-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>), blocking DLK activity may provide an appealing therapeutic strategy for simultaneously targeting pro-degenerative PERK and JNK signaling in neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse models</title><p>DLK-deficient mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>), utilizing tamoxifen feeding of <italic>CAG<sup>ERT-Cre</sup></italic> (Jackson Laboratory) mice crossed to <italic>Map3k12<sup>lx/lx</sup></italic> mice (<italic>CAG-ERT<sup>pos</sup>;Map3k12<sup>lx/lx</sup></italic> referred to as DLK cKO, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5502227">MGI:5502227</ext-link>). <italic>Map3k12<sup>lx/lx</sup></italic> mice lacking Cre but treated with tamoxifen were used as controls (<italic>CAG-ERT<sup>neg</sup>; Map3k12<sup>lx/lx</sup></italic> referred to as DLK WT RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5294552">MGI:5294552</ext-link>).</p><p><italic>Mapk9</italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3619033">MGI:3619033</ext-link>) <italic>and Mapk10</italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5551975">MGI:5551975</ext-link>) double knockout mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>).

Whole mounted retinas were scanned with a Nanozoomer XR automated slide scanning platform (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Pref., Japan) at 200x final magnification. Scanned slides were analyzed using Matlab (version R2013a by Mathworks, Natick, MA). Standard morphological filters were used to define regions approximately 150 µm distance from the edge on the periphery of each leaf of the whole-mount retina with a thickness of approximately 500 µm. Individual RGC nuclei within these regions were identified using an algorithm based on radial symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veta et al., 2013</xref>) applied to the γ-synuclein channel. A ring-shaped region was created for each cell, centered on the border of the nucleus.

One of the strengths of our study – the broad conclusions possible by the use of multiple models and the opportunity to utilize the most advantageous model for each experimental question (validating across models wherever possible) – also had a downside in reduced clarity of presentation. Moreover, while the similarities across diverse models indicate that PERK activation is a common feature of DLK activation, our focus on that aspect may obscure important differences among these models. We have worked to address both of these concerns in the updated manuscript by making the following changes:</p><p>1) In the revised manuscript, we have made a number of edits to the text in order to more clearly describe these results and improve both the transitions and comparisons of the results from each model.</p><p>2) In the original manuscript, we organized figures largely by experimental question rather than by model. This organization was driven in part by the cross-model (SNC vs. ONC) expression analysis that was the initial hypothesis generator and in part by the technical limitations of demonstrating the entire pathway in a single model. With our new data addressing this last difficulty (see point #3 below), the ONC model takes an even more prominent role in the revised manuscript. We have therefore made some adjustments to the ordering of the figure panels to group the ONC experiments demonstrating the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and its consequences more closely together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>3) We have highlighted some differences observed between models. For example, we have included new qPCR data, which indicate that ISR disruption impacts not only <italic>Chac1</italic> and <italic>4ebp1</italic> upregulation in the NGF withdrawal model but also <italic>Chop</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic> upregulation (the latter two being unaffected in the nerve crush models). This suggests a difference in the relative contributions of PERK and <italic>JNK</italic> signaling to their regulation of some mRNAs in each model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>4) In describing our new RNA-seq data in the NGF deprivation model (see point #2 below for more detail), we compare the differences in global expression changes in this model as compared to SNC and ONC. These distinctions help to emphasize the important differences in cell type, stage of development, and type of insult among these models, perhaps making the general commonality of ISR activation even more striking. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The microarray data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) come from a previous publication. It is surprising that the authors haven't repeated this with more current approaches like RNA-seq which might identify additional pathway components. In particular, single cell RNA-seq may circumvent the problems of heterogeneity in their in vivo models, especially if these could be combined with loss of function studies.</italic> </p><p>We agree that RNA-seq can serve as a valuable tool. Indeed, several high quality expression SNC and ONC profiling studies, including RNA-seq, have been reported in recent years (Hu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015; Michaelevski et al., 2010; Whitworth et al., 2016; Yasuda et al., 2016; Yasuda et al., 2014; Yi et al., 2015). Rather than repeating these, we have carefully considered how RNA-seq could most directly inform our current study. We now present a new RNA-seq experiment that addresses a question that follows naturally from our work: Which subset of DLK-mediated expression changes can be attributed, at least in part, to activation of the ISR?The rationale and results of this experiment are detailed below, and these new data significantly extend our understanding of ISR-dependent expression changes following acute neuronal injury.</p><p>Our initial submission included a cross-analysis of our unpublished SNC microarray and our previously published ONC microarray. Although neither is uniquely valuable, this analysis was presented by way of introduction to the hypothesis that the ISR could be engaged in acute neuronal insults. We note that the same hypothesis could have been generated by assessment of various published expression profiles (Yang et al., 2016; Yasuda et al., 2014).</p><p>To directly extend our current study, we focused on the NGF deprivation model as a system for which: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) there is relatively little published expression profiling (Maor-Nof et al., 2016); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) there is a relatively homogenous neuron-enriched population of cells, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) pharmacological manipulation of DLK and the ISR can be performed without assessment of complicated in vivo pharmacodynamics. We utilized this model to determine which aspects of the DLK-mediated stress response are ISR-dependent and which are ISR-independent. Because this question arises directly from our discovery that ISR activation is DLK/JNK-dependent (presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), it is presented in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> rather than in conjunction with the hypothesis-generating ONC and SNC expression profiling presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This experiment yielded a number of interesting results, including:</p><p>1) Further support for the upregulation of ISR-related genes following NGF withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>).</p><p>2) Identification of ISR-dependent expression changes as largely DLK-dependent, consistent with our findings across all three models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>3) Novel candidates for DLK- and ISR-dependent expression changes, some of which are shared among all models and some of which appear to be characteristic only of the NGF-deprivation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>4) Evaluation of the relative proportions of the DLK-mediated response that is ISRIB-sensitive and ISRIB-insensitive, which suggests that both groups include a broad range of expression changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>).</p><p>The RNA-seq will be provided to the public following publication through GEO but a link has also been created to allow review of record GSE95672 while it remains in private status.</p><p><italic>3) Data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> nicely demonstrates ATF4 deficient mice display a decrease in 4ebp1 and Chac1 (known targets) in only SNC, yet data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> demonstrates PERK null mice decrease 4ebp1 and Chac1 in only ONC. To fully validate the manuscripts conclusion, the authors should determine if PERK null mice display a decrease in ATF4, 4ebp1 and Chac1 following SNC and/or determine if ATF4 null mice display a decrease in 4ebp1 and Chac1 following ONC as was done nicely in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-F</xref> for DLK.</italic> </p><p>These suggested reciprocal experiments are certainly appealing, and we regret not fully explaining the technical challenges that precludes their inclusion. We have now completed alternative experiments to fill in the gaps and demonstrate the complete the pathway in a single model.</p><p>Specifically, the exclusion of these precise experiments is the result of limitations of the genetic models. ATF4-deficient mice have severe microphthalmia (Masuoka and Townes, 2002), a phenotype that is incompatible with ONC (noted in the subsection “PERK signaling contributes to neurodegeneration after axon injury”). We therefore only utilized these mice for SNC. To overcome this limitation and complete the demonstration of the entire pathway in the ONC model, we have included new experiments demonstrating that ISRIB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) and AAV-shRNA-mediated partial knockdown of ATF4 in retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>) reduces <italic>Chac1</italic> mRNA induction.</p><p>Conversely, we utilized the PERK cKO mice only for ONC experiments because of inefficient knockout of PERK in DRG neurons. Although the Synapsin1-Cre transgene efficiently drives recombination in RGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), we found that it is effective only in <italic>large-diameter</italic> DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), limiting the utility of SNC experiments that require whole DRG lysates for analysis (e.g., immunoblots for ATF4, qPCR for ATF4 target genes). With no appropriate Cre lines available on a reasonable timeline, we considered alternative approaches, each with its own limitation: IHC for ATF4 (which lacked specificity, with signal still observed in ATF4-deficient tissue); AAV injection (engages stress responses on its own); or dissociation of DRG for single cell analysis (also engages stress responses on its own). Given these limitations, we have pursued pharmacological approaches. We found that PERK inhibitors reduced injury-induced ATF4 upregulation following SNC (not shown), but poor drug tolerance and moderate induction of ATF4 by PERKi even in the absence of nerve crush make those results unsuitable for confident interpretation. We instead now provide data from ISRIB-treated mice following SNC, which gave results consistent with our data utilizing ATF4-deficient mice and expand the description of the pathway in this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these new SNC and ONC experiments provide further evidence of a consistent pathway across models.</p><p><italic>4) Finally, can the authors comment/test whether ISRIB can in fact protect RGC survival in the ONC model?</italic> </p><p>We share the interest in this question, and we now report the results of a new experiment that demonstrates partial neuroprotection by ISRIB in the ONC model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Technical differences, including the complicated in vivo pharmacodynamics of long-term inhibitor dosing, suggest cautious interpretation in direct comparisons with the efficacy of genetic disruption. Nevertheless, these results are consistent with our findings in the PERK cKO mice, providing further support for the involvement of the ISR in the death of RGCs following ONC.</p></body></sub-article></article>
