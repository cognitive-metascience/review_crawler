that enables organisms to survive under fluctuating environmental conditions. While signalling pathways that inhibit cell cycle progression have been elucidated, the putative core module orchestrating cell cycle arrest in response to various stresses is still elusive. Here we report that in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the NAC-type transcription factors ANAC044 and ANAC085 are required for DNA damage-induced G2 arrest. Under genotoxic stress conditions, ANAC044 and ANAC085 enhance protein accumulation of the R1R2R3-type Myb transcription factor (Rep-MYB), which represses G2/M-specific genes. ANAC044/ANAC085-dependent accumulation of Rep-MYB and cell cycle arrest are also observed in the response to heat stress that causes G2 arrest, but not to osmotic stress that retards G1 progression. These results suggest that plants deploy the ANAC044/ANAC085-mediated signalling module as a hub which perceives distinct stress signals and leads to G2 arrest.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43944.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During environmental stresses, such as high light or a drought, plants do not have the opportunity to up and leave. Instead, they need to buy time and energy by pausing their growth, which means stopping their cells from dividing. In this case, the cell cycle, a series of stages during which a cell prepares itself for division, must be halted.</p><p>If the genetic information in cells is damaged, often under the influence of the environment, plants stop their cell cycle in the step just before division. However, it is still unclear how this process takes place, and which proteins participate in it. Researchers also do not know whether environmental stresses can directly trigger this mechanism.</p><p>To investigate, Takahashi et al. conducted a series of genetic experiments on a common plant known as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and they identified two proteins, ANAC044 and ANAC085, which could stop the cell cycle when the genetic information is damaged. In particular, ANAC044 and ANAC085 worked by stabilizing other proteins that turn off certain genes that the cell needed to divide. Additional experiments showed that other types of stresses, such as heat, halted the cell cycle using the ANAC044 and ANAC085 pathway. This suggests that this mechanism may be a central ‘hub’ that responds to various stress signals from the environment to prevent cells from dividing.</p><p>In the field, environmental stresses stop plants from growing, which reduces crop yields; ultimately, manipulating ANAC044 or ANAC085 might help to boost plant productivity even when external conditions fluctuate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell cycle arrest</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>heat stress</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>protein stability</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H03965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Umeda</surname><given-names>Masaaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H06470</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Umeda</surname><given-names>Masaaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H06477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Umeda</surname><given-names>Masaaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K15141</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Naoki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H01243</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Naoki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> deploys the core signalling module that perceives distinct stress signals, such as DNA damage and heat stresses, and represses G2/M-specific genes, thereby causing cell cycle arrest.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To survive under fluctuating environmental conditions, all organisms have the ability to deal with various kinds of internal and external stresses. In animals, failure to adapt against disadvantageous stresses leads to various diseases such as cancer, and, in severe cases, cells perish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Twayana and Ravanan, 2018</xref>). To avoid such consequences, cells deploy mechanisms to temporarily arrest proliferation, thereby ensuring appropriate stress responses. For instance, the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade induces cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the transcription of cyclin genes in response to hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saito and Posas, 2012</xref>). However, while such individual pathways inducing inhibition of cell proliferation have been well characterized, our understanding of the central module that is presumed to govern cell cycle arrest in response to different stresses is still limited. Due to their sessile lifestyle, plants also need to handle many kinds of abiotic and biotic stresses, and to adapt themselves to environmental conditions by activating particular signalling cascades. Various transcription factors that respond to abiotic stresses have been well studied, such as those belonging to the MYB, bZIP, drought-responsive element-binding protein (DREB) and DREB1s/C-repeat binding factor (CBF) families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinocur and Altman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Umezawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Golldack et al., 2011</xref>). However, downstream signalling pathways that inhibit cell proliferation remain largely unknown; therefore, it remains to be established whether plants deploy central signalling pathway(s) that induce cell cycle arrest upon exposure to multiple stresses.</p><p>DNA damage also arrests the cell cycle to allow DNA repair to occur before DNA replication or mitosis begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harper and Elledge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). The programmed response to DNA damage is therefore crucial to maintain genome integrity. DNA damage is sensed by two kinases, ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED (ATM) and ATM AND RAD3-RELATED (ATR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garcia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Culligan et al., 2004</xref>). ATM is activated by double-strand breaks (DSBs), whereas ATR senses single-strand breaks (SSBs) and stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bensimon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flynn and Zou, 2011</xref>). In animals, ATM phosphorylates the checkpoint kinase CHK2, which stabilizes the transcription factor p53 and induces expression of the CDK inhibitor p21, resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donjerkovic and Scott, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartek and Lukas, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng and Chen, 2010</xref>). CHK1, which is phosphorylated by ATR, and CHK2 also activate the G2/M-phase checkpoint by phosphorylating CDC25 phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karlsson-Rosenthal and Millar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perry and Kornbluth, 2007</xref>). In contrast, while plants possess ATM and ATR, they lack functional orthologues for p21, p53, CDC25 or CHK1/2. Instead, a plant-specific NAC-type transcription factor, SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 (SOG1), is phosphorylated and activated by ATM and ATR, and triggers DNA damage responses (DDRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshiyama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshiyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sjogren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshiyama et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A previous study demonstrated that in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, SOG1 regulates the expression of almost all genes induced by DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshiyama et al., 2009</xref>), causes G2 arrest in the meristem, enhances the transition from cell division to endoreplication (a repeated cycle of DNA replication without mitosis), and triggers stem cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furukawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adachi et al., 2011</xref>). Expression of CDK inhibitors, such as <italic>SMR5</italic> and <italic>SMR7</italic>, is directly induced by SOG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogita et al., 2018</xref>); however, their induction also occurs in DSB-tolerant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants, suggesting that it is not sufficient to arrest the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). We previously demonstrated that simultaneous suppression of a set of G2/M-specific genes is accompanied by DNA damage-induced G2 arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adachi et al., 2011</xref>). G2/M-specific genes, such as those encoding mitotic cyclins, are controlled by three Myb repeat-containing transcription factors, called R1R2R3-Myb or MYB3R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ito, 2005</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> possesses five genes for MYB3R, MYB3R1 to MYB3R5, among which MYB3R4 acts as a transcriptional activator (Act-MYB), and MYB3R3 and MYB3R5 are transcriptional repressors (Rep-MYB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>). MYB3R1 functions as both an activator and a repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>). MYB3Rs bind to target gene promoters via a <italic>cis</italic>-acting element called the mitosis-specific activator (MSA) element, and control the expression of G2/M-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>). We recently reported that Rep-MYBs are actively degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, but become stabilized under DNA damage conditions, thereby suppressing G2/M-specific genes and causing G2 arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Protein stability of Rep-MYBs is dependent on CDK activity: CDK phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of MYB3R3/5 and promotes their degradation. Therefore, we proposed a model in which DNA damage phosphorylates and activates SOG1, and reduces CDK activities, probably by inducing CDK inhibitor genes, thereby stabilizing Rep-MYBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Since Rep-MYBs repress mitotic cyclin expression, their stabilization further decreases CDK activities, thus resulting in cell cycle arrest. A recent report also demonstrated that Rep-MYBs function as major repressors of cell cycle genes in the response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourbousse et al., 2018</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether the initial reduction of CDK activity is sufficient to trigger Rep-MYB stabilization, or whether another signalling pathway is required to accumulate a sufficient amount of Rep-MYB for the suppression of numerous G2/M-specific genes.</p><p>In this study, we show that the NAC-type transcription factors ANAC044 and ANAC085, which are direct targets of SOG1, play a crucial role in causing G2 arrest in response to DNA damage. In the absence of ANAC044 or ANAC085, Rep-MYB does not accumulate and cannot inhibit G2/M progression, and the plants exhibit DNA damage tolerance. ANAC044 and ANAC085 are not required for the induction of genes for DNA repair proteins or CDK inhibitors, but rather are engaged in accumulation of Rep-MYBs. Our data show that they also participate in heat stress-induced inhibition of G2 progression, suggesting that an ANAC044- and ANAC085-mediated pathway plays a central role in orchestrating stress-induced G2 arrest by controlling Rep-MYB accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>ANAC044</italic> and <italic>ANAC085</italic> are induced by DNA damage</title><p>Previous studies demonstrated that the SOG1 transcription factor controls cell cycle arrest and stem cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshiyama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furukawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adachi et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that DNA damage-induced G2 arrest is controlled by signalling pathways downstream of SOG1. Recently we identified 146 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes that are directly targeted by SOG1, among which were the NAC transcription factors ANAC044 and ANAC085 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogita et al., 2018</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of NAC transcription factors indicated that ANAC044 and ANAC085 are the closest relatives of SOG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); indeed, in the NAC domain, which is essential for DNA binding, their amino acid similarity to SOG1 is 72.0% for ANAC044 and 72.6% for ANAC085. A striking difference is that the C-terminal regions carrying the domain needed for transcriptional regulation are shorter in ANAC044 and ANAC085 than in SOG1. Moreover, five serine-glutamine (SQ) motifs, which are targets for phosphorylation by ATM and ATR, are present towards the C terminus of SOG1, but missing in ANAC044 and ANAC085 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We therefore predicted that ANAC044 and ANAC085 exert distinct functions in the DDR.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43944.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Similarities among SOG1, ANAC044 and ANAC085.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree of the NAC transcription factors in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.

We also tested heat and osmotic stresses that retard cell cycle progression in G2 and G1 phases, respectively. Although the <italic>anac044 anac085</italic> mutant was as sensitive as WT to osmotic stress, it was tolerant to heat stress and defective in heat-induced accumulation of Rep-MYB. These data suggest that ANAC044 and ANAC085 play a crucial role in controlling cell cycle arrest at G2, but not at the other phases, in response to stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Deployment of the ANAC044/085-mediated signalling module indicates that although eukaryotic cells commit to enter a new cell cycle during G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertoli et al., 2013</xref>), plants have an additional critical point at G2 for deciding whether or not cells resume proliferation after escaping from stress. Indeed, DNA damage enhances the onset of endoreplication by inhibiting G2/M progression, thereby prohibiting resumption of the mitotic cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adachi et al., 2011</xref>). The deployment of such a module controlling G2 progression may be specific to plants, in which the induction of endoreplication is a sensible strategy to avoid cell death and enable continuous growth under stressful conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adachi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Veylder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Radziejwoski et al., 2011</xref>). Since ANAC044 and ANAC085 are also involved in DNA damage-induced stem cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), G2 arrest may be prerequisite for choosing between life and death of mitotic cells as well. Further studies will reveal how the ANAC044/085-mediated pathway is associated with the onset of endoreplication and cell death in response to stresses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43944.041</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>ANAC044/ANAC085-mediated pathway involved in stress-induced G2 arrest.</title><p>Both DNA damage and heat stress induce <italic>ANAC044</italic> and <italic>ANAC085</italic>, which then promote Rep-MYB accumulation and repress a set of G2/M-specific genes, thereby leading to G2 arrest.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43944-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig10s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43944.042</object-id><label>Figure 10—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of SOG1 target genes in <italic>anac044 anac085</italic>.</title><p>Five-day-old seedlings of WT, <italic>sog1-101</italic> and <italic>anac044-1 anac085-1</italic> were treated with or without 0.6 µg/ml bleomycin for 10 hr, and subjected to microarray analysis.

(2018)</xref> conducted transcriptomic analyses over a 24 hr time course after gamma irradiation and revealed that Rep-MYBs play a major role in repressing cell cycle-related genes in response to DSBs. We previously reported that Rep-MYBs are actively degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and that this degradation is triggered by CDK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Under normal growth conditions, higher CDK activity enhances Rep-MYB degradation and maintains the expression of G2/M-specific genes; under DNA damage conditions, CDK activity is reduced by the induction and repression, respectively, of genes for CDK inhibitors and Act-MYB, resulting in stabilization of Rep-MYBs and suppression of G2/M-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). In the <italic>anac044 anac085</italic> mutant, DNA damage up- and down-regulates the expression of CDK inhibitors (<italic>SMR5</italic> and <italic>SMR7</italic>) and <italic>MYB3R4</italic>, respectively, to the same extent as in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the initial reduction of CDK activities occurs normally. This idea is supported by the fact that transcript levels of G2/M-specific genes, which are induced by MYB3R4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haga et al., 2011</xref>), decreased by 12 hr after bleomycin treatment as observed in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, in <italic>anac044 anac085</italic>, further reduction in G2/M-specific gene expression after 12 hr was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating that ANAC044 and ANAC085 stabilize Rep-MYBs at a later stage of the DDR by controlling factors other than CDK activity. One possibility is that ANAC044 and ANAC085 inhibit the expression, accumulation or activity of the degradation machinery for Rep-MYBs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al. (2017)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kobayashi et al. (2015)</xref> reported that under normal growth conditions, MYB3R3 protein preferentially accumulates around early S phase, and that Rep-MYBs repress transcription of target genes along the cell cycle except for G2/M. Therefore, it is likely that ubiquitin E3 ligases such as SCF (Skp-Cullin1-F-box) mark Rep-MYBs by polyubiquitination for proteolysis during the cell cycle. A previous study showed that transcript levels of several F-box genes were reduced by gamma-irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Culligan et al., 2006</xref>); therefore, such factors related to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis may be under the control of ANAC044 and ANAC085, thereby regulating the protein stability of Rep-MYBs under DNA damage conditions.</p><p>We revealed that ANAC044 and ANAC085 are not required for induction of DNA repair-related genes, and that the frequency of HR was dramatically reduced in <italic>sog1-101</italic>, but not in <italic>anac044 anac085</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This indicates that ANAC044 and ANAC085 are engaged in inhibiting cell division, whereas SOG1 is involved in DNA repair as well as cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogita et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al. (2018)</xref> reported that when the <italic>sog1</italic> mutant is exposed to an acute dose of ionizing radiation, SOG1-independent cell death occurs in the root meristem, and root organization is severely impaired. We also observed a similar phenotype by transient treatment with bleomycin. It is noteworthy that unlike <italic>sog1</italic>, <italic>anac044 anac085</italic> displayed proper arrangement of root cells after recovery from bleomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, although stem cell death is suppressed in both <italic>sog1</italic> and <italic>anac044 anac085</italic>, stem cells in <italic>sog1</italic>, but not <italic>anac044 anac085</italic>, may seriously suffer from DNA damage, thus failing to undergo mitotic cell division and to maintain root organization. It is likely that defects in activation of DNA repair make stem cells hypersensitive to DNA damage in the <italic>sog1</italic> mutant. On the other hand, the phenotype of <italic>anac044 anac085</italic> suggests that SOG1-mediated activation of DNA repair is sufficient to preserve stem cells, whereas stem cell death and regeneration of new stem cells are probably also important to preserve genome integrity in stem cells.</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, SOG1 is phosphorylated by ATM and ATR; ATM phosphorylates five serine-glutamine (SQ) motifs in the C-terminal region of SOG1 upon exposure to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshiyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sjogren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshiyama et al., 2017</xref>). Such phosphorylation is essential for SOG1’s ability to bind to target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogita et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, ANAC044 and ANAC085 lack SQ motifs, raising the possibility that they do not require phosphorylation of the SQ motif for their transcriptional function. Their involvement in cell cycle arrest in response to heat stress also indicates that ATM/ATR-mediated phosphorylation is not necessary for activation. Nonetheless, we found that <italic>ANAC044</italic> overexpression by itself could not induce cell cycle arrest, and that DNA damage signals are required for ANAC044 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This suggests that ANAC044/085 are phosphorylated by other kinase(s) or subjected to other modifications that are responsive to stresses. The DNA damage sensitivity of the <italic>anac044 anac085</italic> double mutant was indistinguishable from that of the single mutants, implying that ANAC044 and ANAC085 work together in DDRs. Several NAC transcription factors are known to form homo- or heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mitsuda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamaguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gladman et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting the possibility that ANAC044 and ANAC085 form dimers to act on target genes. This hypothesis is supported by our obsevation that <italic>ANAC044</italic> overexpression further retarded G2 progression only in the presence of bleomycin, which induces <italic>ANAC085</italic>. On the other hand, it is unlikely that ANAC044 and ANAC085 form heterodimers with SOG1 to control the SOG1 target genes, because transcript levels of SOG1 target genes were elevated by bleomycin treatment in <italic>anac044 anac085</italic>, as they were in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, it remains possible that ANAC044/085 interact with other NAC transcription factors including SOG1, which are induced and/or activated by DNA damage, and control the expression of their target genes.</p><p>Here we identified a core signalling module that controls G2 arrest in response to stresses. The promoter region of <italic>ANAC085</italic>, but not <italic>ANAC044</italic>, contains several consensus motifs of the heat shock element, which is recognized by heat shock transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, our preliminary results show that <italic>ANAC044</italic> is also up-regulated by cold and salt stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, we propose that ANAC044 and ANAC085 are induced by distinct stress factors, thereby functioning as a hub in transmitting environmental signals to the cell cycle machinery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kobayashi et al. (2015)</xref> reported that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Rep-MYBs form a protein complex with retinoblastoma-related protein and the E2F transcription factor E2FC, thereby existing as a component of the DREAM/dREAM-like complex, which has been characterized in vertebrates and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Georlette et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sadasivam and DeCaprio, 2013</xref>). It is therefore likely that the ANAC044/ANAC085-mediated pathway also controls other subunits of the DREAM complex, thereby differentially controlling downstream genes in response to various stresses. Further studies will reveal whether vertebrate DREAM complexes are also involved in the transition from the mitotic to the quiescent state upon exposure to stresses, and how their activity is regulated to cope with distinct stresses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

To generate <italic>ProANAC044:GUS</italic> and <italic>ProANAC085:GUS</italic>, the 1.5 kb promoters of <italic>ANAC044</italic> and <italic>ANAC085</italic> were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into the Gateway entry vector pDONR221 by BP reaction according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primer sequences used for PCR are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. An LR reaction was performed with the destination vector pGWB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakagawa et al., 2007</xref>) to generate a binary vector carrying the fusion construct with <italic>GUS</italic>. The construct was transferred into the <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> GV3101 strain harbouring the plasmid pMP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koncz and Schell, 1986</xref>), and the obtained strain was used to generate stably transformed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by the floral dip transformation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clough and Bent, 1998</xref>). Plants were grown in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium under continuous light conditions. For root growth analysis, five-day-old seedlings grown on MS plates were transferred to MS medium containing mannitol or the following DNA-damaging agents: bleomycin (Wako), MMS (Wako), MMC (Nacalai Tesque) or HU (Nacalai Tesque). Seedlings were grown vertically, and the position of root tips was marked every 24 hr. Root growth was measured using ImageJ software by calculating the distance between successive marks along the root axis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots with a Plant Total RNA Mini Kit (Favorgen). First-strand cDNAs were prepared from total RNA using ReverTra Ace (Toyobo) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with a THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo) with 100 nM primers and 0.1 µg of first-strand cDNA. PCR reactions were conducted with the Light Cycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche) under the following conditions: 95°C for 5 min; 60 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 20 s and 72°C for 30 s.

The samples were cleared with a transparent solution [chloral hydrate, glycerol and water (8 g: 1 ml: 1 ml)] and observed under a light microscope, Axioskop 2 Plus (Zeiss) or SZX16 (Olympus).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation</title><p>ChIP was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gendrel et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>pSOG1:SOG1-MYC</italic> seeds were germinated in 100 ml of liquid MS medium, and cultured under continuous light at 23°C with gentle shaking (50 rpm). After a 2 week culture period, bleomycin was added to the medium to a final concentration of 0.6 µg/ml, and the seedlings were cultured for 12 hr. Chromatin bound to the SOG1-Myc fusion protein was precipitated with anti-Myc antibody (Millipore). ChIP-qPCR was performed using immunoprecipitated DNA. Three independent ChIP experiments were conducted. To quantify the precipitated chromatin, gene-specific primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> were used for real-time qPCR.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers greatly valued your discoveries on how specific a stress condition, such as heat stress, triggers cell cycle arrest. They furthermore concluded that the work is suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, we would like you to still experimentally assess the cell numbers after heat stress (essential for revision).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors describe a novel regulatory module, which suppresses the progress of G2/M phase in response to DNA damage repair (DDR) and heat shock stress in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In the previous study, the authors found that promoter regions of two ANAC transcription factors, <italic>ANAC044</italic> and <italic>ANAC085</italic>, are bound the SOG1. SOG1 is functional ortholog of the animal p53 protein and an integrator of plant DNA damage repair responses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both <italic>ANAC044</italic> and <italic>ANAC085</italic> TFs are closely related to SOG1, suggesting a possible functional relationship. However, both proteins lack the SQ phosphorylation sites typical for the genes activated by phosphorylation signal during DDR. However, both <italic>ANAC044/085</italic> contain SOG1 binding sites in their promoters and are transcriptionally activated in response to DSB inducer bleocin in WT but in <italic>sog1-101</italic> plants. This suggests that <italic>ANAC044/085</italic> are transcriptionally regulated by SOG1. <italic>anac044</italic> and <italic>anac085</italic> mutant plants showed increased tolerance towards several DNA damaging agents and their double mutant repeated the single mutant phenotype. Analysis of the triple mutant with <italic>sog1-101</italic> revealed that both factors are epistatic to SOG1. However, the core DDR genes were transcriptionally up-regulated and HR frequency reached WT-like levels in the <italic>anac044/085</italic> single and double mutants, indicating that they are not involved directly in the repair process. Instead, the <italic>ANAC044/085</italic> seem to influence progression of the cell cycle by enhancing accumulation of the R1R2R3-type Myb transcription factor (Rep-MYB), which represses G2/M-specific genes.</p><p>The authors also show that the same module controls cell cycle progression in response to extended heat stress (37 C for 24h) but not osmotic stress.</p><p>This is timely study, which characterizes functions of two previously unannotated genes and places them into specific DDR signalling pathway.</p><p>The experiments are performed in solid way and have all necessary controls.</p><p>The text is clear and easy to read.</p><p>I have only one major comment. I am puzzled by the connection between ANAC044/085 and heat stress. I wonder if this is genuine heat stress signalling response or the treatment (far from natural dose for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) produces some kind of DNA damage, which then triggers the DDR response. Are the authors able to distinguish between these options by specific experiments?</p><p>Here are specific suggestions:</p><p>Subsection “<italic>ANAC044</italic> and <italic>ANAC085</italic> are induced by DNA damage” and throughout the manuscript: &quot;generated <italic>promoter::GUS</italic> reporter lines and found that <italic>ProANAC085::GUS</italic> showed”. I suggest using standard nomenclature <italic>Promoter::Gene:Fusion</italic>. It is also recommended using Pro instead of p, which should be reserved for plasmids.</p><p>Subsection “SOG1 directly induces <italic>ANAC044</italic> and <italic>ANAC085</italic> under DNA damage conditions”, last paragraph: we conducted ChIP-PCR analysis. Change to qPCR?</p><p>The authors could save some space by using more abbreviations: e.g. HR, DDR, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> or <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>Subsection “<italic>ANAC044</italic> and <italic>ANAC085</italic> are not involved in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair”, last paragraph: the authors cite the review on HR system. I would like to suggest using original papers where the principle is described.</p><p>&quot;…number of EdU-labelled cells with mitotic figures…&quot; EdU positive cells in interphase were not counted? This is not very clear. Please describe in more detail and/or provide images.</p><p>&quot;In contrast, <italic>ANAC044</italic> and <italic>ANAC085</italic> lack the SQ motif, raising the possibility that they do not require phosphorylation for their transcriptional function.&quot; Could they contain other than SQ phosphorylation site?</p><p>&quot;The GUS recombination reporter line #1406.&quot; Please describe which type of the HR construct this reporter line contains.</p><p>Figures: It would be great to show also plants (not only graphs) for the Figures 3 and 6B, 7C and 8C.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The SOG1 transcription factor is a key regulator in the plant DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, controlling expression of DNA repair genes and cell cycle checkpoint regulators. In this work, two related proteins (<italic>ANAC044</italic> and <italic>ANACO85</italic>) are demonstrated to work immediately downstream of SOG1. Differently from SOG1 they appear to specifically control (a late) G2 arrest through (indirect) control of the repressive MYB3R3 protein, likely through proteolytic control. <italic>ANAC044</italic> (and <italic>ANACO85</italic>) is as well linked to a heat stress induced G2 arrest, here working independently from SOG1.</p><p>The work represents a truly and interesting expansion of the current knowledge on the SOG1 pathway, illustrating a bifurcation of the DDR pathway into a pathway controlling DNA repair and one pathway responsible for a G2 arrest. All experiment are well executed and the manuscript is well written. I only have some doubts on the heat stress data:</p><p>1) The difference in growth between control and <italic>anac044 anac085</italic> mutants is only marginal, being about 4 mm over a period of 4 days (Figures 7C and 8C). That is a difference of 1mm/day (control plants grow about 10 mm/day). Can't a different setup be found in which the difference becomes more convincing?</p><p>2) I also miss cellular data showing that under these conditions the difference is due to a difference in meristematic cell number and not cell size (thus truly linked with a cell cycle checkpoint control).</p><p>Having said this, the manuscript holds more than sufficient interesting data to stand without the heat stress data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Background: Plants exhibit elaborate and robust regulatory responses to DNA double strand breaks, affecting repair, programmed cell death, and regulation of the cell cycle. SOG1 is a transcriptional activator that regulates virtually all of the rapid transcriptional activation arm of this response. (SOG1 is activated post-translationally through phosphorylation by the damage-detectors ATM and ATR). rep-Myb3R proteins (which repress the expression of G2/M genes) are responsible for most of the transcriptional repression arm, which arises more later and is focused on the repression of the G2/M transition. The regulation of these rep-Myb proteins is only partly understood. It has been established that CDK's routinely promote the degradation of these proteins in G2, and so one proposed mechanism for their regulation in DDR is through the transcriptional induction (by activated SOG1, which directly targets the promoters of these genes) of CDK inhibitors. The authors here state that &quot;…the induction is not sufficient to lead to cell cycle arrest…&quot; and so they further investigate the mechanism of this arrest.</p><p>Results: The authors convincingly demonstrate that the SOG1-induced (and closely related) NAC domain transcription factors NAC 044 and 085 are required for damage-induced arrest in G2, and also for SOG1-dependent programmed cell death (as well at SOG1-independent DNA damage-induced mitotic cell death- this is a new function), but not for SOG1-dependent induction of HR. They also show that these TF's are required for the accumulation of MYB3R3 protein in response to DNA damage (though, interestingly, not for the accumulation of MYB3R3 transcript).</p><p>They then go on to demonstrate that the transcriptional upregulation of NAC044 and NAC085-and their induction of G2 arrest is recapitulated, without SOG1-dependence, in the response to heat. Thus NAC044 and NAC085 govern a G2-arrest module that can be activated independently by a variety of stresses. The mode of action through which NAC044 and 085 stabilize repMYB3R remains a matter of speculation, but possible pathways are discussed. Given the wide range of assays and phenomenologies discussed here, the paper is remarkably clear.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43944.050</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] I have only one major comment. I am puzzled by the connection between ANAC044/085 and heat stress. I wonder if this is genuine heat stress signalling response or the treatment (far from natural dose for Arabidopsis) produces some kind of DNA damage, which then triggers the DDR response. Are the authors able to distinguish between these options by specific experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We distinguished these two possibilities using the <italic>sog1</italic> mutant. As shown in Figure 8C, <italic>sog1-101</italic> exhibited root growth retardation in response to heat stress to the same extent as wild-type, suggesting that SOG1 is not involved in heat stress-triggered growth arrest. Moreover, <italic>ANAC044</italic> and <italic>ANAC085</italic> were induced normally in <italic>sog1-101</italic> by heat stress, indicating that SOG1 is not required for their induction (Figure 8E, F). Since SOG1 is the central regulator that transmits DNA damage signals, we therefore think that DNA damage is not the cause of cell cycle arrest when plants are exposed to heat stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Here are specific suggestions:</p><p>Subsection “ANAC044 and ANAC085 are induced by DNA damage” and throughout the manuscript: &quot;generated promoter::GUS reporter lines and found that ProANAC085::GUS showed”.
