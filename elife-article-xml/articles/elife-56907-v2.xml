Here, the effects of high glucose levels on influenza severity were investigated using an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier as well as an <italic>in vivo</italic> murine model of type II diabetes. <italic>In vitro</italic> we show that high glucose conditions prior to IAV infection increased virus-induced barrier damage. This was associated with an increased pro-inflammatory response in endothelial cells and the subsequent damage of the epithelial junctional complex. These results were subsequently validated <italic>in vivo</italic>. This study provides the first evidence that hyperglycaemia may increase influenza severity by damaging the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier and increasing pulmonary oedema. These data suggest that maintaining long-term glucose control in individuals with diabetes is paramount in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza virus infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>glucose</kwd><kwd>junctional complex</kwd><kwd>tight junction</kwd><kwd>JAM</kwd><kwd>claudin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1159959</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gallo</surname><given-names>Linda A</given-names></name><name><surname>Short</surname><given-names>Kirsty R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early-Career Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gallo</surname><given-names>Linda A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1130815</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Upton</surname><given-names>Kyle R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE180100512</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Short</surname><given-names>Kirsty R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hyperglycaemia increases influenza severity by damaging the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier and increasing pulmonary oedema during Influenza A virus infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Every year influenza A virus (IAV) infects 5–15% of the world’s population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goeijenbier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stöhr, 2002</xref>). Typically, influenza virus causes an acute and self-limiting disease. However, influenza virus can cause severe disease in individuals with certain chronic medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Short et al., 2014</xref>). Upon infection with influenza virus, patients with diabetes have triple the risk of hospitalisation, quadruple the risk of admission to the intensive care unit and double the risk of a fatal outcome compared to individuals with no underlying illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilking et al., 2010</xref>). However, the mechanisms that drive this susceptibility remain incompletely understood.</p><p>Diabetes is characterised by chronically high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) and is separated into two primary categories: type I (T1D) and type II (T2D). T1D accounts for ~10% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chatterjee et al., 2017</xref>) and is generally regarded as an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brody, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Federation ID, 2015</xref>). The remaining ~90% of cases belong to the T2D category which is characterised by relative insulin deficiency as a result of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chatterjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Defronzo, 2009</xref>). Diabetes is associated with complications that affect multiple organ systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Rahman et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, when compared to healthy individuals, people with diabetes have a two- to fourfold increased risk of cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rao Kondapally Seshasai et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, elevated blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes are associated with kidney damage and the development of diabetic kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpentier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition to being associated with the micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes, hyperglycaemia is also associated with the increased susceptibility to infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Critchley et al., 2018</xref>). For example, in a Danish population, each 1 mmol/L increase in plasma glucose level was associated with a 6% increased risk of hospitalisation for pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benfield et al., 2007</xref>). In the specific case of IAV, hyperglycaemia may increase disease severity via either; immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reading et al., 1998</xref>), increased epithelial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kohio and Adamson, 2013</xref>) and/or, altered activity of transporters responsible for keeping the lung free of oedematous fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamashita et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rivelli et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Thaiss and colleagues recently showed that hyperglycaemia contributes to the elevated severity of enteric infections in patients with diabetes by increasing the permeability of the gut epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thaiss et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, GLUT2, a bidirectional glucose transporter, was identified as a key driver of dysfunction of the epithelial junctional complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thaiss et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to their role in the gut, the epithelial junctional complex plays an important role in the lung by limiting the amount of fluid present in the alveolar airspace. Junctional proteins are formed between both pulmonary epithelial cells and pulmonary endothelial cells, although the epithelial cell component plays a more significant role keeping the lung free of fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Short et al., 2014</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that IAV can damage junctional proteins between adjacent human alveolar epithelial cells and therefore impair efficient gas-exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Short et al., 2016</xref>). The findings of Thaiss and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thaiss et al., 2018</xref>) raise the intriguing possibility that IAV-induced damage to epithelial tight junctions is further exacerbated in the context of hyperglycaemia and that this may account for the increased severity of influenza seen in patients with diabetes.</p><p>Here, we use an <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture model of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier and a murine model of T2D to provide new insights into the role of hyperglycaemia and IAV-induced barrier damage in the lung. We show that compared to normal glucose concentrations, elevated glucose levels prior to IAV infection increase virus-induced barrier damage, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that this damage is associated with endothelial-driven inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A history of high glucose increases influenza-induced barrier damage in an <italic>in vitro</italic> epithelial-endothelial co-culture</title><p>To determine the role of high glucose levels (representative of hyperglycaemia) in IAV-induced barrier damage, we adapted our previously described model of the human alveolar epithelial-endothelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Short et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This is a model of the distal lung region where, <italic>in vivo</italic>, epithelial cells are entirely covered by a fluid layer, known as the alveolar lining fluid, to facilitate efficient gas exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fronius et al., 2012</xref>). As such, in the <italic>in vitro</italic> model of this region the cells are cultured in medium rather than at an air-liquid interface, which is more appropriate for upper airway models. To mimic normal or hyperglycaemic conditions, respectively, the medium of the lower co-culture compartment contained either 7 mM glucose or 12 mM glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These concentrations were selected as these reflect clinically relevant glucose levels (i.e. &gt;7 mM glucose is considered diabetic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Danaei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, 2003</xref>). Cells differentiated within 3–5 days of culture as previously characterised within this co-culture model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermanns et al., 2004</xref>). The development of an elevated TEER was not affected by the differing glucose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and culture of primary endothelial cells in RPMI media did not affect their endothelial phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) as has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Short et al., 2016</xref>). IAV was then added to the upper compartment to mimic IAV infection via the respiratory route. Importantly, infections of all treatment groups were performed in the presence of 12 mM glucose (in both the upper and lower compartment) to mimic the fact that upon physiological stressors, such as IAV infection, individuals typically experience elevated blood glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marik and Bellomo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karlsson et al., 2019</xref>). Barrier integrity was then compared between co-cultures with a history of elevated (12 mM) glucose levels (henceforth referred to as ‘high glucose co-cultures’) and a history of healthy (7 mM) glucose (levels henceforth referred to as ‘low glucose co-cultures’) Strikingly, following IAV infection, high glucose co-cultures had a significantly greater decrease in TEER compared to low glucose co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These data were consistent with the increased permeability to FITC-labeled dextran observed in infected high glucose co-cultures relative to infected low glucose co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High glucose conditions increase IAV-induced barrier independent of cell death.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture model of the alveolar epithelial-endothelial barrier.

Therefore, the possibility that the observed barrier damage in the high glucose co-cultures was the result of increased viral replication was explored. However, no statistically significant difference in viral messenger RNA (mRNA) or infectious virus in supernatant was observed between the different glucose conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to high glucose concentrations have an increased level of apoptosis compared to cells in lower glucose concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Risso et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we next investigated whether the observed barrier damage in the infected high glucose co-cultures was the result of increased cell death via the crude measure of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. While LDH levels cannot definitively rule out a role of cell death, no significant difference was observed in cells from the high and low glucose co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data suggest that a history of high glucose increases the IAV-induced damage to the epithelial-endothelial barrier <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of wide-spread cell death or increased viral replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>High glucose barrier damage was dependent upon the presence of endothelial cells</title><p>To assess if endothelial cells contributed to the observed barrier damage, mono-cultures of epithelial cells were established and subjected to the same experimental protocols as the co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, as epithelial cells constitute the main component of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier, mono-cultures still displayed an elevated TEER after 4–5 days in culture (data not shown). However, endothelial cells provided a stabilising effect on the integrity of the epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), with co-cultures having a significantly higher pre-infection TEER when compared to epithelial mono-cultures. Accordingly, mono and co-cultures were not directly compared; rather mono-cultures with 7 mM glucose were compared to mono-cultures with 12 mM glucose. Following IAV infection, infected high glucose mono-cultures showed no statistically significant decrease in TEER overtime compared to infected low glucose mono-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, no difference in epithelial permeability to FITC-labelled dextran was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with these data, no significant difference in viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) nor LDH release was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, given that high glucose IAV-induced barrier damage was not observed in the absence of endothelial cells, these data suggest that endothelial cells are the main drivers of barrier damage observed in this <italic>in vitro</italic> model.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>IAV-induced barrier damage in high glucose condition is dependent upon the presence of endothelial cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the <italic>in vitro</italic> mono-culture model of the alveolar epithelial-endothelial barrier.

To this end, the transcriptome of endothelial cells from high and low glucose co-cultures was assessed using RNASeq. At 24 hr post-IAV infection, numerous differentially expressed genes were identified in endothelial cells derived from infected co-cultures relative to endothelial cells derived from uninfected co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Many of these genes were differentially expressed after infection under both low and high glucose conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Strikingly, certain pathways that were enriched in endothelial cells derived from infected, low glucose co-cultures were not enriched in endothelial cells derived from infected, high glucose co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Namely, while both low and high glucose endothelial cells expressed pathways associated with ‘defence response to virus’ and ‘immune system processes’, high glucose endothelial cells lacked a concomitant increase in regulatory pathways otherwise seen in low glucose endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data suggest that endothelial cells derived from infected high glucose co-cultures may be in a more pro-inflammatory state than their counterparts in low glucose conditions. Consistent with this hypothesis, endothelial cells from IAV-infected high glucose co-cultures expressed significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory chemokine <italic>CXCL8</italic> compared to endothelial cells from IAV-infected low glucose co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Similarly, we observed an increase in IL-6 and IL-8 protein levels in endothelial supernatant 24 hr post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To determine whether high glucose endothelial cells, in the presence of IAV, produced a soluble pro-inflammatory factor that damaged the epithelial-endothelial barrier, the basolateral supernatant from high and low glucose co-cultures was harvested. This supernatant was then transferred to uninfected high and low glucose co-cultures. The transfer of the cell culture supernatant from high-glucose, infected co-cultures was sufficient to induce barrier damage in uninfected cells when compared to normal glucose conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Consistent with a heat-labile soluble protein (such as a cytokine) driving the observed phenotype, the transfer of heat-treated supernatant from high glucose conditions did not damage the epithelial-endothelial barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Furthermore, infection using ultraviolet inactivated virus did not induce barrier damage, even under hyperglycaemic conditions, indicating that initially, active virus is required to induce a reduction in TEER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that the observed TEER decrease is not due to the presence of viral PAMPS/antigen in the media as it has been previously demonstrated that vRNA and mRNA remains present up to 70°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jonges et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, the somewhat slower kinetics of the TEER drop after supernatant transfer indicates a possibility of indirect action of the cytokine(s); that is, cytokines could trigger epithelial cells in the co-culture to produce another cytokine that then in turn damages the barrier. IL-1β is known to increase interstitial epithelial barrier permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Sadi and Ma, 2007</xref>). We therefore assessed the effect of introducing an IL-1 antagonist to the system. No difference in barrier integrity with and without Anakinra was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that while the phenotype is likely due to a soluble factor, it is not IL-1 dependent.

Similarly, hyperglycaemia can damage the integrity of junctional complex between epithelial cells in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thaiss et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore assessed the integrity of the epithelial junctional complex in infected high and low glucose co-cultures. We elected to focus on the junctional proteins between adjacent epithelial cells, rather than endothelial cells, as the epithelium constitutes more than 90% of resistance to protein transport across the epithelial-endothelial barrier and thus contributes the largest amount to the TEER in the co-culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Short et al., 2014</xref>).

To this end, we employed a well-established murine model of T2D where homozygote mice (<italic>lepr<sup>db/db</sup></italic>) are obese and hyperglycaemic whilst their heterozygote (<italic>lepr<sup>db/+</sup></italic>) counterparts are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kodama et al., 1994</xref>).

Consistent with these results, <italic>lepr<sup>db/db</sup></italic> mice showed less weight loss than their <italic>lepr<sup>db/+</sup></italic> counterparts (data not shown). It is well recognised that pulse-oximetry is a non-invasive measure of lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lax et al., 2014</xref>) that more accurately predicts disease severity than systemic weight loss in the case of murine influenza studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verhoeven et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, blood oxygen saturation is a non-invasive measure of barrier damage – as when the epithelial-endothelial barrier is damaged gas exchange will occur less efficiently resulting in lower blood oxygen saturation.

However, the underlying mechanism for this observation remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we show that elevated glucose levels are associated with endothelial cell inflammation, destruction of the epithelial junctional complex and increased IAV severity. We therefore propose that in patients with hyperglycaemia, IAV triggers a pronounced inflammatory response in pulmonary endothelial cells. Secreted protein components of this inflammatory response (most likely cytokines) then damage the epithelial junctional complex and worsen IAV-induced barrier damage.</p><p>Hyperglycaemia has long been implicated in development of the various macro- and micro-vascular complications of diabetes. Similarly, hyperglycaemia has been implicated in the severity of both bacterial and viral infections in the respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hulme et al., 2017</xref>). Elevated blood glucose levels can directly increase glucose concentrations in airway secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Philips et al., 2003</xref>). Exposure of epithelial cells to elevated glucose concentrations then facilitates increased IAV replication by augmenting the assembly and activity of the cellular vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup> ATPase (V-ATPase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kohio and Adamson, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, in the present study, we observed that hyperglycaemia increased IAV-induced barrier damage <italic>in vitro</italic> and increased influenza severity <italic>in vivo</italic> in the absence of increased viral replication (although initial viral replication was required to trigger epithelial barrier damage). This discrepancy may be the result of different disease models, IAV strains and/or time points used between studies. Similarly, IAV strain-dependent differences in pathogenesis, difference in cell culture glucose concentrations and the type of endothelial cell used may account for the inconsistencies between the results presented herein and those of our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Short et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, previous studies have described elevated glucose levels can directly affect the activity of ATPases in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kohio and Adamson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamashita et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rivelli et al., 2012</xref>). This is of interest given that the Na,K-ATPase (located on the basolateral side of pulmonary epithelial cells) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peteranderl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van de Sandt et al., 2017</xref>). Altering the activity of this pump can not only facilitate pulmonary oedema, but it can also affect the formation of the junctional complex between adjacent epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rajasekaran and Rajasekaran, 2003</xref>). Therefore, the role of hyperglycaemia, Na,K-ATPase activity and influenza severity warrants further investigation.</p><p>At present, we do not know which protein component(s) secreted by endothelial cells are responsible for the barrier damage observed <italic>in vitro</italic> after exposure to high glucose. Our observation that barrier damage of infected and bystander cells was dependent on heat-labile factors in the cell culture supernatant, as well as the increased inflammatory response under high glucose conditions, is consistent with a causative role for cytokines in this system. Numerous different cytokines, including TNF-α, CXCL8, TNF-β, IFN-γ and IL-6, have been reported to damage the tight junctions of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van de Sandt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohkuni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that a combination TNF-α and IFN-γ can reduce the integrity of the epithelial barrier via inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van de Sandt et al., 2017</xref>), and it is tempting to speculate that a similar cascade of events may occur under high glucose conditions. The <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture model developed herein, whilst reductionist and excluding the role that leukocytes may play in disease development, offers a relatively high-throughput model for future studies to delineate the specific role of different pro-inflammatory mediators in barrier damage. It is possible that blocking one or more of these cytokines could be used as a novel treatment option for influenza positive diabetes patients. However, traditionally such therapeutic approaches have been thwarted by inherent redundancies in cytokine signalling and inflammation, as well as the risk of increased viral shedding in treated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karawita et al., 2019</xref>). Rather, our findings would suggest that a more beneficial therapeutic approach would be the administration of pharmacological agents to enhance the integrity of the epithelial junctional complex.</p><p>Thaiss and colleagues recently showed that hyperglycaemia, through GLUT2-dependent transcriptional reprogramming of epithelial cells, facilitated intestinal tight junction dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thaiss et al., 2018</xref>). In the present study, we also observed tight junction dysfunction under high glucose conditions. However, it is important to recognise that in contrast to the work of Thaiss and colleagues, the epithelial cells in the present study were only <italic>indirectly</italic> exposed to differential glucose levels (i.e. differing glucose concentrations were restricted to the lower chamber of the co-culture). Moreover, unlike the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thaiss et al., 2018</xref> the endothelial cells in the present study only differed in their <italic>history</italic> of glucose exposure, and all <italic>in vitro</italic> groups were exposed to the same glucose concentration at the time of IAV infection. Therefore, the data presented here are more congruent with the so-called ‘legacy effect’ described in patients with diabetes. The legacy effect has been used to explain the observation that the detrimental effects of elevated glucose levels in patients persist beyond the period of hyperglycaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El-Osta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miao et al., 2014</xref>). Why the legacy effect occurs is unclear but it has been proposed that epigenetic changes (which persist even after transient hyperglycaemia) influence the regulation of NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El-Osta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miao et al., 2014</xref>). This could represent a significant challenge to reducing the severity of influenza virus in patients with diabetes, as it would suggest that controlling one’s blood glucose levels for only a limited period of time would not be sufficient to reduce the risk of disease development. Of particular concern are observations that the physiological effects of changes in blood glucose levels can persist for up to 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>At present, 1 in 11 adults are living with diabetes.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The major points of the study are that the presence of high concentrations of glucose in blood (as in uncontrolled diabetes) increases the influenza virus-associated damage to lung tissue at the level of the epithelial-endothelial barrier. Degradation of the tight junctions between epithelial cells in the lung is part of this pathology. This study provides a potential explanation for the severity of influenza in patients with diabetes, and suggests that blood glucose control might contribute to a more favourable course of influenza in these patients.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;High glucose levels increase influenza-associated damage to the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jos van der Meer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Clinically, it is well established that diabetes increases the risk of developing severe influenza infections. In this manuscript Dr. Short and colleagues characterize the effect of high glucose levels on the integrity of the pulmonary epithelial- endothelial barrier in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system as well as in an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model. Exposure of the endothelial cell layer to higher levels of glucose results in more pronounced decreases of transepithelial/endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) upon influenza A (IAV) infection. This seemingly occurs without differences in replication efficiency. Higher glucose levels lead to a more pronounced innate immune response in the endothelial cells, and the secreted cytokines might underlie the damage to the epithelial layer, as assessed by reduced protein levels of markers for the apical junctional complex. The study further establishes a (testable) mechanisms that supports the observation of higher mortality of IAV infection in diabetes. Overall, the work is well performed, timely and the conclusions are largely supported by the dataset. There are few areas that need to be clarified.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The proposed mechanisms that endothelial cell injury precedes the epithelial cell damage is well supported by the <italic>in vitro</italic> data, however, not been causally linked <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additional evidence on endothelial cell injury, for example by immunofluorescence localization and earlier time points would significantly substantiate this conclusion. Please provide additional data or adapt the claims accordingly.</p><p>2) It will be important to shed more light on whether the initial effects are mediated through active viral replication or innate immune responses. The authors mention the discrepancy with previous data where the effect of glucose (Kohio and Adamson, 2013) was attributed to higher levels of replication, which on itself could attribute to enhanced damage to the epithelial cell tight junctions (Short et al., 2016). The authors show at a late time point that viral replication (PFU and viral RNA levels) is not different at high and low glucose <italic>in vitro</italic>. Does this mean that viral RNA replication is not important for the difference in TER and the effects are perhaps due to innate immune responses rather than direct damage of viral gene products? I noticed that the difference between the low and high glucose in TER is already significant at 6hpi (Figure 1B) and the magnitude of the difference does not become much more at later time-points. This suggests that it is quite an immediate effect and perhaps does not require viral replication to occur. To shed more light on the apparent discrepancy of viral replication it would be important to test if exposure to UV-inactivated IAV leads to a similar difference in TER between high and low glucose.</p><p>3) The data presented suggests that the difference between high and low glucose conditions on the epithelial cell layer for a large part can be explained by cytokines secreted by endothelial cells going against a model where viral replication (more expression of viral gene products) directly does the damage. Yet, <italic>in vivo</italic> there is higher viral mRNA accumulation, which still leaves the viral replication hypothesis open. Of course it could also be that loss of integrity requires both replication and cytokines.

Due to COVID-19 we no longer have access to the strain of mice required for these experiments and thus and cannot perform earlier time points than the D3 provided in the manuscript. We would also like to remind the reviewer that rather than endothelial cell injury and death, we hypothesise that it is a pro-inflammatory state of the endothelial cells that is driving the phenotype. Consistent with this notion, using activated caspase 3 staining on the <italic>in vivo</italic> sections, we can confirm that there is no difference in endothelial cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). To clarify this point further we have now altered the revised manuscript to read: “Whilst we cannot offer definitive evidence that these cytokines were endothelial cell derived (as was the case with the <italic>in vitro</italic> data), these data are consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data that loss of intact tight junctions in the context of IAV and hyperglycaemia is associated with a pro-inflammatory response”.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Histopathology scoring of lung sections for activated caspase 3.</title><p>Data are pooled from two independent experiments, with mean ± SEM.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56907-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It will be important to shed more light on whether the initial effects are mediated through active viral replication or innate immune responses. The authors mention the discrepancy with previous data where the effect of glucose (Kohio and Adamson, 2013) was attributed to higher levels of replication, which on itself could attribute to enhanced damage to the epithelial cell tight junctions (Short et al., 2016). The authors show at a late time point that viral replication (PFU and viral RNA levels) is not different at high and low glucose <italic>in vitro</italic>. Does this mean that viral RNA replication is not important for the difference in TER and the effects are perhaps due to innate immune responses rather than direct damage of viral gene products? I noticed that the difference between the low and high glucose in TER is already significant at 6hpi (Figure 1B) and the magnitude of the difference does not become much more at later time-points. This suggests that it is quite an immediate effect and perhaps does not require viral replication to occur. To shed more light on the apparent discrepancy of viral replication it would be important to test if exposure to UV-inactivated IAV leads to a similar difference in TER between high and low glucose.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting query and we thank the reviewer for suggesting it. We have now performed additional <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments using UV-inactivated virus (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). UV inactivated virus did not induce barrier damage, even under hyperglycaemic conditions, indicating that active virus is required to induce a reduction in TEER. In our manuscript we suggest that it is a soluble protein (such as a cytokine) produced in response to IAV infection that is driving barrier damage. Therefore, these data may suggest that the production of this soluble factor is dependent on active viral replication. Alternatively, it is possible that UV-inactivated virus does not active PRRs in the same manner that active replicating virus does, thus resulting in a differential immune response.</p><p>We have included these data in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript and a discussion of these points in the Results: “Furthermore, infection using ultraviolet inactivated virus did not induce barrier damage, even under hyperglycaemic conditions, indicating that initially, active virus is required to induce a reduction in TEER (Figure 3—figure supplement 1)”.</p><p>In the Discussion: “Interestingly, in the present study, we observed that hyperglycaemia increased IAV-induced barrier damage <italic>in vitro</italic> and increased influenza severity <italic>in vivo</italic> in the absence of increased viral replication (although initial viral replication was required to trigger epithelial barrier damage)”.</p><p>Additionally: “Our observation that barrier damage of infected and bystander cells was dependent on heat-labile factors in the cell culture supernatant, as well as the increased inflammatory response under high glucose conditions, is consistent with a causative role for cytokines in this system”.</p><p>The Materials and methods section has been adjusted to include: “<italic>In vitro</italic> ultra-violet inactivated viral infection. A/Solomon Islands/03/2006 (Solomon Islands/06; H1N1) was irradiated with 4x1J/cm2 using a Stratagene crosslinker (UVC 500 Ultraviolet Crosslinker, 254nm bulbs, Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). The irradiated virus was assessed for viral titre prior to infection of the co-culture. <italic>In vitro</italic> viral infection was performed as previously described in the Materials and methods”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data presented suggests that the difference between high and low glucose conditions on the epithelial cell layer for a large part can be explained by cytokines secreted by endothelial cells going against a model where viral replication (more expression of viral gene products) directly does the damage. Yet, <italic>in vivo</italic> there is higher viral mRNA accumulation, which still leaves the viral replication hypothesis open. Of course it could also be that loss of integrity requires both replication and cytokines. A co-staining in Figure 4B of the tight junction marker with a viral gene product could clarify whether loss of integrity only occurs in infected cells or whether also bystanders are affected.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have now performed a co-staining for influenza virus antigen and tight junctions as the reviewer has suggested (<bold>Figure 4D</bold>). These results show there is a reduction in tight junction integrity in uninfected cells, suggesting that a loss of integrity is not restricted to infected cells. The role of viral replication vs. inflammation in the observed phenotype is an interesting question. Based on the new data generated using the UV virus (reviewer question 2), we would hypothesise that initial viral replication in epithelial cells triggers the release of a soluble factor from endothelial cells that is then responsible for epithelial barrier damage (independent of whether the cell was virally infected or not). Accordingly, the phenotype is dependent upon active virus (as shown with the UV experiments) but barrier damage occurs in both infected and bystander cells (demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><p>We have now included a discussion of this proposed model in the Results: “Consistent with our hypothesis that a soluble factor is driving the loss of barrier integrity, co-staining of Claudin-4 and the influenza A nucleoprotein demonstrate that barrier damage occurs in both infected and bystander cells (Figure 4D)”. As well as: “Our observation that barrier damage of infected and bystander cells was dependent on heat-labile factors in the cell culture supernatant, as well as the increased inflammatory response under high glucose conditions, is consistent with a causative role for cytokines in this system”.</p><p>Similarly, the Materials and methods section has been updated to reflect this: “Primary antibodies used were α-E-cadherin (Bioss Company, Beijing, China), α-junctional adhesion molecule 1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), α-claudin-4 (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and a monoclonal antibody (clone HB65 IgG2a) directed against the nucleoprotein of influenza A virus (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA). Secondary antibodies were Alexa 488 α-mouse IgG2a, Alexa 647 α-mouse IgG2a and Alexa 488 α-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies).”</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of hypothesised mechanism of tight junction barrier damage under hyperglycaemic conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>.</title><p>Active replicating virus triggers signalling either directly or indirectly acting on the endothelial cells (1).
