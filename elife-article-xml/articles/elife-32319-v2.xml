To identify molecular players that confer regenerative capacities to non-regenerative species is of key relevance for basic research and translational approaches. Here, we report a differential response in retinal regeneration between medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) and zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>). In contrast to zebrafish, medaka Müller glia (olMG) cells behave like progenitors and exhibit a restricted capacity to regenerate the retina. After injury, olMG cells proliferate but fail to self-renew and ultimately only restore photoreceptors. In our injury paradigm, we observed that in contrast to zebrafish, proliferating olMG cells do not maintain <italic>sox2</italic> expression. Sustained <italic>sox2</italic> expression in olMG cells confers regenerative responses similar to those of zebrafish MG (drMG) cells. We show that a single, cell-autonomous factor reprograms olMG cells and establishes a regeneration-like mode. Our results position medaka as an attractive model to delineate key regeneration factors with translational potential.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32319.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All animals have at least some ability to repair their bodies after injury. But certain species can regenerate entire body parts and even internal organs. Salamanders, for example, can regrow their tail and limbs, as well as their eyes and heart. Many species of fish can also regenerate organs and tissues. In comparison, mammals have only limited regenerative capacity. Why does regeneration vary between species, and is it possible to convert a non-regenerating system into a regenerating one?</p><p>Laboratory studies of regeneration often use the model organism, zebrafish. Zebrafish can restore their sight after an eye injury by regenerating the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. They are able to do this thanks to cells in the retina called Müller glial cells. These behave like stem cells. They divide to produce identical copies of themselves, which then transform into all of the different cell types necessary to produce a new retina.</p><p>Lust and Wittbrodt now show that a distant relative of the zebrafish, the Japanese ricefish ‘medaka’, lacks these regenerative skills. Although Müller glial cells in medaka also divide after injury, they give rise to only a single type of retinal cell. This means that these fish cannot regenerate an entire retina. Lust and Wittbrodt demonstrate that in medaka, but not zebrafish, levels of a protein called Sox2 fall after eye injury. As Sox2 has been shown to be important for regeneration in zebrafish Müller glial cells, the loss of Sox2 may be preventing regeneration in medaka. Consistent with this, restoring Sox2 levels in medaka Müller glial cells enabled them to turn into several different types of retinal cell.</p><p>Sox2 is also present in the Müller glial cells of other species with backbones, including chickens, mice, and humans. Future experiments should test whether loss of Sox2 after injury contributes to the lack of regeneration in these species. If it does, the next question will be whether restoring Sox2 can drive a regenerative response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Müller glia cells</kwd><kwd>retina regeneration</kwd><kwd>Sox2</kwd><kwd>in vivo imaging</kwd><kwd>lineage tracing</kwd><kwd>medaka</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant 294354</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wittbrodt</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Müller glia cells in the medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) retina act as lineage restricted progenitors which only regenerate photoreceptors but can be activated to perform as potent stem cells using Sox2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to regenerate individual cells, lost organs or even the structure of the entire body is widespread in the animal kingdom. The means by which certain species achieve remarkable feats of regeneration, whereas others have restricted or no capacity to do so is poorly understood. Teleost fishes are widely used models to study development, growth and regeneration of the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Centanin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raymond et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rembold et al., 2006</xref>). The retina of these fish undergoes lifelong neurogenesis, and the range of retinal cell types is generated from two sources. The first are the cells of the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ), which include retinal stem cells that give rise to progenitor cells and ultimately differentiated cell types of the growing neural retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Centanin et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Raymond et al., 2006</xref>). A second source for new retinal cells are Müller glia (MG) cells, which generate new cell types during homeostasis and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Some teleost species, including goldfish (<italic>Carassius auratus</italic>) and zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), have been analyzed with respect to their ability to regenerate the retina and recover visual function after injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braisted and Raymond, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raymond et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sherpa et al., 2008</xref>). Among these, zebrafish is the best-studied and has been shown to contain multipotent MG cells which can self-renew and regenerate all retinal neuronal and glial cell types after injuries. It is currently assumed that other teleost species possess the same regenerative capacities; however, detailed analyses have been lacking.</p><p>To investigate MG cell-mediated retina regeneration in a distantly related teleost, we chose the Japanese ricefish medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>), which is a well-established model organism that shared its last common ancestor with zebrafish between 200 and 300 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schartl et al., 2013</xref>). Few regeneration studies have been carried out in medaka, but the literature reveals some interesting differences to zebrafish. Whereas fins can be fully regenerated in adult medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakatani et al., 2007</xref>), the heart has no regenerative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lai et al., 2017</xref>). The development and growth of the neural retina of medaka has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Centanin et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</xref>), but regeneration studies are missing.</p><p>After injuries, multipotent MG cells of the zebrafish retina have been shown to upregulate the expression of pluripotency factors including <italic>lin-28</italic>, <italic>oct-4</italic>, <italic>c-myc</italic> and <italic>sox2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ramachandran et al., 2010</xref>). Sox2 is well known for its role in maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Masui et al., 2007</xref>) and is one of the four original Yamanaka factors required for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). Sox2 has been frequently used in reprogramming studies, such as the conversion of mouse and human fibroblasts directly into induced neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ring et al., 2012</xref>), or the transformation of NG2 glia into functional neurons following stab lesions in the adult mouse cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heinrich et al., 2014</xref>). In the regenerating zebrafish retina, <italic>sox2</italic> expression is upregulated 2 days post injury (dpi) and is necessary and sufficient for the MG proliferation associated with regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ramachandran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gorsuch et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we find that medaka MG (olMG) cells display a restricted regenerative potential after injury and only generate photoreceptors (PRCs). We observed that olMG cells can re-enter the cell cycle after injures but fail to divide asymmetrically or generate neurogenic clusters, two steps which are essential to full regeneration. Using in vivo imaging, two-photon mediated specific cell ablations and lineage tracing, we find that olMG cells react preferentially to injuries of PRCs and are only able to regenerate this cell type. We demonstrate that <italic>sox2</italic> is expressed in olMG cells in the absence of injury but, in contrast to zebrafish, is not maintained in proliferating olMG cells after injury. We show that inducing targeted expression of <italic>sox2</italic> in olMG cells is sufficient to shift olMG cells into a regenerative mode reminiscent of zebrafish, where they self-renew and regenerate multiple retinal cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>olMG cells re-enter the cell cycle after injury but do not generate neurogenic clusters</title><p>In contrast to zebrafish and goldfish, where MG cells are described as the source of rod PRCs that gradually accumulate during the early larval period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>), it has been shown previously that olMG cells are quiescent at a comparable developmental stage in the hatchling (8 dpf) retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lust et al., 2016</xref>).

To address the proliferative behavior of Sox2-sustaining olMG cells in response to injury, we treated fish with mifepristone and BrdU for 2 days, performed a needle injury, maintained the fish in mifepristone and BrdU until 3 dpi and analyzed immediately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We observed increased formation of proliferating clusters as well as the distribution of BrdU-positive cells in all layers of the retina after needle injury (4 out of 6 fish) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E'</xref>). To address the long-term potential of Sox2-induced olMG cells, we ablated all retinal cell types by needle injury and performed BrdU-mediated lineage tracing as described above. We induced <italic>sox2</italic> expression for 2 days and provided BrdU in parallel, performed a needle injury and maintained the expression of <italic>sox2</italic> until 3 dpi. After a chase until 14 dpi, the retinae and regenerated cell types were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). In needle-injured wild-type fish which were also treated with mifepristone as well as in transgenic fish (<italic>rx2</italic>::LexPR OP::<italic>sox2</italic>, OP::H2B-eGFP) which were not treated with mifepristone, olMG cells did not self-renew and gave predominantly rise to PRCs, mostly rod PRCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). In contrast, olMG cells experiencing persistent expression of <italic>sox2</italic> showed self-renewal and differentiation into different cell types in the ONL and INL as indicated by BrdU lineage tracing. In particular, the olMG cells maintaining <italic>sox2</italic> expression after injury regenerated olMG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–C'' and F</xref>) and exhibited a significant increase in regenerated ACs and RGCs, which were positive for HuC/D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E'' and 8F</xref>). Furthermore, a slight increase in cone PRCs and a decrease in rod PRCs was observed after <italic>sox2 </italic>induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–F</xref>). These data indicate that a targeted maintenance of <italic>sox2</italic> expression after injury is sufficient to induce self-renewal and increase potency in olMG cells in the medaka retina turning a mono-potent repair system into a regeneration system with increased potency.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32319.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Expression of <italic>sox2</italic> via the LexPR system increases Sox2 protein levels in olMG cells and triggers proliferating cluster formation after injury in medaka.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genetic construct used for <italic>sox2</italic> induction.

By using a combination of in vivo imaging, targeted cell type ablation and lineage tracing, we investigated the dynamics of the injury response in the medaka retina. We focused on MG cells, which play a prominent role in zebrafish retinal regeneration. While upon injury olMG cells re-enter the cell cycle, they fail to undergo self-renewal. Furthermore, olMG cells do not generate the neurogenic clusters which arise in zebrafish, nor do they produce all neuronal cell types in the retina. We traced this effect prominently to Sox2, the expression of which is maintained in proliferating drMG cells after injury, but not in olMG cells. We demonstrated that the sustained expression of <italic>sox2</italic> is sufficient to convert an olMG into a dr-like MG cell. The fact that this response is acquired cell-autonomously and in the context of a non-regenerative retina can be relevant for putative translational approaches.</p><p>Since olMG cells do not self-renew after injuries and only have the capacity to regenerate PRCs, olMG cells are not true multipotent retinal stem cells. Instead, olMG cells should be considered lineage-restricted progenitors. They re-enter the cell cycle between 1 and 2 dpi, similar to the re-entry observed in zebrafish. This indicates that the signals that are essential for cell cycle re-entry are present in medaka and are activated in a window of time similar to that in zebrafish. After retinal injures olMG nuclei migrate into the PRC layer; the cell bodies of nucleus-depleted olMG cells are maintained in the retina. This could be important since MG cell bodies play a crucial role in mechanical stability of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">MacDonald et al., 2015</xref>) as well as light guiding through the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Franze et al., 2007</xref>). After retinal injures, olMG cell bodies were maintained in the absence of a nucleus in the INL reflecting the necessity to preserve this structural and optical element.</p><p>In the uninjured retina, olMG cells express <italic>sox2</italic>, as is the case for many other vertebrates, including humans. However, <italic>sox2</italic> expression in olMG cells is downregulated in response to injury, in contrast to the injury response of drMG cells, which upregulate <italic>sox2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gorsuch et al., 2017</xref>). We speculate that this upregulation is due to epigenetic modifications of the <italic>sox2</italic> locus. A recent study in the mouse retina showed that the expression of <italic>oct4</italic> is upregulated shortly after injury and then downregulated at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reyes-Aguirre and Lamas, 2016</xref>). This correlates with a decrease in the expression of DNA methyltransferase 3b and its subsequent upregulation at 24 hpi, triggering a decrease in methylation and subsequent re-methylation of <italic>oct4</italic>. Furthermore, a recent study on zebrafish regeneration discovered the existence of so-called tissue regeneration enhancer elements (TREEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kang et al., 2016</xref>). One TREE was associated with <italic>leptin b</italic>, which is expressed in response to injuries of the fin and heart. This TREE acquires open chromatin marks after injury, can be divided into tissue-specific modules and can drive injury-dependent expression in mouse tissue. This raises the possibility that the <italic>sox2</italic> locus in olMG cells experiences epigenetic modifications after injury which differ from modifications in zebrafish. The fact that <italic>sox2</italic> expression is detected in all vertebrate MG cells analyzed to date in the absence of injury raises the question whether a decrease in <italic>sox2</italic> expression after injury might be a common feature of non-regenerative species like chicken, mouse and even humans. Data from a conditional <italic>sox2</italic> knockout in mouse shows that Sox2 is necessary for maintenance of MG morphology and quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Surzenko et al., 2013</xref>). While its expression is maintained in response to the injection of growth factors after retinal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karl et al., 2008</xref>) its regulation in response to injury alone has not been described. Data obtained in cultures of human MG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhatia et al., 2011</xref>) provide additional important insights. Strikingly similar to medaka, silencing the expression of <italic>sox2</italic> caused MG cells to lose stem and progenitor cell markers and adopt a neural phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhatia et al., 2011</xref>). These findings align well with the results from medaka presented here und suggest that olMG cells and their behavior as progenitor cells can serve as a model for mammalian and in particular human MG cells.</p><p>The results shown here may provoke an evolutionary question: is retinal regeneration an ancestral or derived feature within the infraclass of teleosts? The question might be resolved by investigations of this capacity in other fish species more closely related to medaka, such as <italic>Xiphophorus maculatus</italic>, whose last common ancestor with medaka lived around 120 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schartl et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, species like the spotted gar, whose lineage diverged from teleosts before teleost genome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Braasch et al., 2016</xref>), might provide insights about the ancestral mode of retinal regeneration. Recently, the retinal architecture of the spotted gar has been analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sukeena et al., 2016</xref>). There, proliferative cells have been detected in the central retina likely representing proliferating MG cells, which generate rod PRCs during homeostasis as seen in zebrafish, suggesting that regeneration is indeed an ancestral feature in the ray-finned fish lineage.</p><p>Additionally, one wonders whether the ability of MG cells to regenerate injured retinal cells is directly related to their involvement in rod genesis during post-embryonic growth and conversely whether the lack of regenerative abilities of MG cells is a result of the lack of rod genesis? The differences in rod layer increase in zebrafish and medaka as well as the differences in rod genesis by MG cells might be due to the natural habitats and photic environment of the fish. While larval zebrafish live near the water surface, adults live in deeper waters where rods become more important for visual function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lenkowski and Raymond, 2014</xref>). Medaka on the other hand are surface fish their entire life, since they live in shallow waters like rice paddies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kirchmaier et al., 2015</xref>) which decreases the need for a massive increase in rods.</p><p>With a potential translational perspective, regenerating and non-regenerating systems can now be systematically compared to delineate the underlying factors and mechanisms.</p><p>To date, our cumulative results show that the regenerative potential of olMG cells in the context of homeostasis and injury in medaka resemble that of mammals and birds more than zebrafish. We propose that this provides an added value to medaka as a model species for regeneration studies that bridge the differences between zebrafish and mammals. Studies of heart regeneration that have compared zebrafish and medaka lend additional support to this statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lai et al., 2017</xref>). As reprogrammable multipotent retinal stem cells, MG cells harbor a great potential for treating degenerative retinal diseases. Our work indicates that the addition of a single reprogramming factor facilitates a regeneration-like response mediated by olMG cells. Their multiple resemblances of features of mammalian and human MG cells position them as an ideal model for the development of new treatments preventing the degeneration and initiating the regeneration of the retina.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Follow-up imaging was performed using same laser at 880 nm and a 40x objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Retinal needle injuries</title><p>Larvae (zebrafish 5 dpf, medaka 8 dpf) were anesthetized in 1x Tricaine in 1x ERM and placed on a wet tissue. Under microscopic visualization, the right retina was stabbed multiple times in the dorsal part with a glass needle (0.05 mm diameter). Left retinae were used as controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry on cryosections</title><p>Fish were euthanized using Tricaine and fixed over night in 4% PFA, 1x PTW at 4°C. After fixation samples were washed with 1x PTW and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 1x PTW. To improve section quality, the samples were incubated in a half/half mixture of 30% sucrose and Tissue Freezing Medium (Leica) for at least 3 days. 16-µM-thick serial sections were obtained on a Leica cryostat. Sections were rehydrated in 1x PTW for 30 min at room temperature. Blocking was performed for 1–2 hr with 10% NGS (normal goat serum) in 1x PTW at room temperature. The respective primary antibodies were applied diluted in 1% NGS o/n at 4˚C. The secondary antibody was applied in 1% NGS together with DAPI (1:500 dilution in 1xPTW of 5 mg/ml stock) for 2–3 hr at 37˚C. Slides were mounted with 60% glycerol and kept at 4°C until imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Antibodies</title><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Primary antibody</th><th valign="top">Species</th><th valign="top">Concentration</th><th valign="top">Company</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Anti-BrdU</td><td valign="top">rat</td><td valign="top">1:200</td><td valign="top">AbD Serotec, BU1/75</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anti-eGFP</td><td valign="top">chicken</td><td valign="top">1:500</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher, A10262</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anti-HuC/D</td><td valign="top">mouse</td><td valign="top">1:200</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher, A21271</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anti-GS</td><td valign="top">mouse</td><td valign="top">1:500</td><td valign="top">Chemicon, MAB302</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anti-pH3 (Ser10)</td><td valign="top">rabbit</td><td valign="top">1:500</td><td valign="top">Millipore, 06–570</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anti-Recoverin</td><td valign="top">rabbit</td><td valign="top">1:200</td><td valign="top">Millipore, AB5585</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anti-Sox2</td><td valign="top">rabbit</td><td valign="top">1:100</td><td valign="top">Genetex, GTX101506</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anti-Zpr-1</td><td valign="top">mouse</td><td valign="top">1:200</td><td valign="top">ZIRC</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Secondary antibody</th><th valign="top">Species</th><th valign="top">Concentration</th><th valign="top">Company</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488</td><td valign="top">donkey</td><td valign="top">1:750</td><td valign="top">Jackson, 703-485-155</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anti-mouse Alexa 546</td><td valign="top">goat</td><td valign="top">1:750</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher, A-11030</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anti-mouse Cy5</td><td valign="top">donkey</td><td valign="top">1:750</td><td valign="top">Jackson, 715-175-151</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anti-rabbit DyLight549</td><td valign="top">goat</td><td valign="top">1:750</td><td valign="top">Jackson, 112-505-144</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anti-rabbit 647</td><td valign="top">goat</td><td valign="top">1:750</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher, A-21245</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anti-rat DyLight549</td><td valign="top">goat</td><td valign="top">1:750</td><td valign="top">Jackson, 112-505-143</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anti-rat Alexa633</td><td valign="top">goat</td><td valign="top">1:750</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher, A-21094</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>BrdU immunohistochemistry</title><p>BrdU antibody staining was performed with an antigen retrieval step.

Statistical analysis and graphical representation of the data were performed using the Prism software package (GraphPad). Box plots show the median, 25th and 75th percentiles; whiskers show maximum and minimum data points. Unpaired t-tests were performed to determine the statistical significances. The p-value p&lt;0.05 was considered significant and p-values are given in the figure legends. Sample size (n) and number of independent experiments are mentioned in every figure legend. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those generally used in the field. The experimental groups were allocated randomly, and no blinding was done during allocation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Wittbrodt department for constructive discussions on the project; L Centanin and A Gutierrez-Triana for valuable input on the project and the manuscript; N Aghaallaei, C Becker, F Caroti, A-K Heilig, I Krämer, S Lemke, C Lischik, T Tavhelidse and E Tsingos for critical reading of the manuscript; R Hodge for manuscript editing.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Activating the regenerative potential of Müller glia cells in a regeneration-deficient retina&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado (Reviewer #1) Pamela A Raymond (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper investigates whether medaka and zebrafish have the same capacity for retina regeneration. The authors find that in contrast to zebrafish, medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) has limited regeneration capacity. They also show that Sox2 expression is not maintained to the same extent in medaka Müller glia (MG) as in zebrafish. Forced expression of Sox2 grants medaka MG cells traits, which are more similar to injury responses observed in zebrafish. In general this is a well-executed study with highly advanced and beautiful imaging.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewers agreed on the importance of this work, but also concluded that the functional assays reported are somewhat preliminary, with some of the conclusions not well supported by the reported data. As such, we would like for the authors to address these general technical concerns as follows:</p><p>1)Subsection “olMG cells reenter the cell cycle after injury but do not generate neurogenic clusters!” – The statement that medaka Müller glia are quiescent in juveniles cites a previous study (Lust et al., 2016) dealing with embryonic and larval stages, not juvenile fish. The present study also appears to use larval fish (8 days post-fertilization), as stated in the Materials and methods section. The authors need to clarify the stages being used for the reported experiments. For example, the layer of rod nuclei in the ONL in the larval medaka retina (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) is a scant one-cell thick, whereas in adult medaka retinas, there are 2-3 rows of rod nuclei (e.g. Imanishi et al., 2007,). During this early larval period, as in all species of teleost fish studied, rod photoreceptors accumulate gradually, and they are generated by rare stem cell divisions of Müller glia and the rapidly dividing rod progenitors they produce, which migrate apically into the ONL and differentiate into rods. Addressing this concern, therefore, is important.</p><p>2) Subsection “olMG nuclei but not their cell bodies are depleted after PRC injuries” and Discussion section – The statement that after photoreceptor injury medaka Müller glial &quot;nuclei migrate apically into the wound site but remain there&quot; and that &quot;cell bodies are maintained at 10 days after injury in the absence of a nucleus in the INL&quot; whereas radial glial fibers remain intact is not entirely justified. The only marker used for cell nuclei (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is the transgenic rx2:H2B-eGFP reporter; another possible interpretation of the results is that this reporter is no longer expressed in Müller glia that responded to the injury. This possibility is supported by the in vivo image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,A',A''</xref>, in which the arrowhead points to a Müller glial radial fiber labeled with rx2:lifeact-GFP cytoplasmic reporter. careful examination shows a 'hole' of reduced fluorescence in the soma, which likely corresponds to the nucleus in the inner nuclear layer (INL). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the injury site in the ONL is not apparent, and co-localization of BrdU and GFP is not readily apparent.</p><p>3) Subsection “olMG cells divide in the INL with an apico-basal distribution” – The data measuring cleavage plane of dividing Müller glia are not robust (only 6 cells were examined). In the example shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), there is no obvious damage in the photoreceptor layer. How do the authors exclude the possibility that these dividing cells could be neuronal progenitors in the rod lineage, reflecting normal development, not regeneration? The PH3 labeled cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and the mitotic cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) could both represent rod progenitors. Note that the mitotic cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> is slightly above and in front of a Müller glial nucleus with a distinctive glial shape (elongated, polygonal), which could indicate that the mitotic cell may be a Müller-derived, early progenitor in the rod lineage.</p><p>4) Subsection “<italic>Sox2</italic> expression is not maintained in proliferating olMG cells after injury” – The authors find that proliferating cells in medaka do not sustain Sox 2 expression and don't form neurogenic clusters. Based on these data they assign a role to Sox2 in MG cells. Nevertheless, there are a fairly large number of Sox 2 expressing cells in medaka after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, a major role of Sox2 might be sustaining proliferation in the cycling progeny of MG cells rather than only determining MG cell fate. Along the same line, it would be important to quantify Sox2 expression after the different injury models rather than just carrying out comparisons between the two species in the same injury model. More importantly: one wonders what is the percentage of Sox 2 expressing cells that are BrdU<sup>+</sup>? This is the counting that would support the conclusion reached rather than the percentage of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells that are Sox2<sup>+</sup>. This is insufficient information: how many cells were counted and from how many retinas?</p><p>5) Subsection “Sustained <italic>Sox2</italic> expression restores olMG driven regeneration” – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. No evidence is provided for induced expression of Sox2 in Müller glia. The effect of overexpression of Sox2 on 'regeneration' is very small, and only a single marker (HuC/D) was used to identify retinal cells. The co-localization of HuC/D and BrdU is not convincing in the absence of a panel showing HuC/D only. The quantification data are incomplete; only percentages shown, no information on number of cells counted and number of retinas. Several experiments would strengthen the conclusions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Please show that more MG cells express Sox 2 for example with double staining with GS. Please comment on whether MG progeny form proliferating clusters after sustained Sox 2 expression. A movie (of similar kind that is shown earlier) would be a very nice illustration to demonstrate the increased regenerative response by MG. Wildtype animals treated with mifepristone were used as control. Would be also necessary to show the control with the transgenic line without drug.</p><p>6) Discussion section – No evidence is provided for depletion of the medaka Müller glia or for &quot;symmetric division into two differentiating cells, depleting the olMG pool&quot;. In fact, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, B'</xref> shows that in the region designated as a photoreceptor lesion at 2, 4, and 6 days after injury, labeling with the glial antibody glutamine synthetase (GS) shows that radial fibers of Müller glia persist at densities equivalent to the flanking, uninjured regions. These results are contrary to the conclusion that Müller glia are converted into photoreceptors by a symmetric division.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32319.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewers agreed on the importance of this work, but also concluded that the functional assays reported are somewhat preliminary, with some of the conclusions not well supported by the reported data.
