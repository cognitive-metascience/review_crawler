We suspect a complex recombination event that brought back the Cecropin locus nearby the deletion. Thus, flies carrying the <italic>Cec<sup>SK6</sup></italic> deletion were in fact also carrying a wild-type locus for Cecropins. We are analyzing the exact nature of this unfortunate recombination event and will reassess the function of Cecropin in host defense. This finding does not affect the main conclusions of our study except that we do not make any conclusions regarding Cecropin and host defence. Compound mutants that we have used including the ΔAMP flies were wild-type for Cecropin. The contribution of Cecropins to the overall antimicrobial peptide defense, as well as eventual synergy with other peptides or any specific roles for this family of peptides will require us to re-generate novel <italic>Cecropin</italic> deficient fly lines. We apologize for only discovering this after publication. We intend to perform a careful exploration of the Cecropins in the future.
