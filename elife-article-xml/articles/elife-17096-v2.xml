We investigated combinatorial translational regulation by <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pumilio (Pum) and Nanos (Nos), which control development, fertility, and neuronal functions. Our results show how the specificity of one RBP (Pum) is modulated by cooperative RNA recognition with a second RBP (Nos) to synergistically repress mRNAs. Crystal structures of Nos-Pum-RNA complexes reveal that Nos embraces Pum and RNA, contributes sequence-specific contacts, and increases Pum RNA-binding affinity. Nos shifts the recognition sequence and promotes repression complex formation on mRNAs that are not stably bound by Pum alone, explaining the preponderance of sub-optimal Pum sites regulated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results illuminate the molecular mechanism of a regulatory switch controlling crucial gene expression programs, and provide a framework for understanding how the partnering of RBPs evokes changes in binding specificity that underlie regulatory network dynamics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17096.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17096.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17096.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Molecules of DNA contain the instructions needed to make proteins inside cells. Proteins perform many different roles and each needs to be produced at the right time and in the right amounts to enable the cells to survive. The DNA is first copied to make molecules of ribonucleic acid (RNA), which are then used as templates to make the proteins. One way to control protein production is to regulate the RNA molecules. A family of proteins called RNA-binding proteins can recognise and bind to specific RNA molecules and determine whether a RNA molecule is destroyed, used to produce proteins, or stored for later use. In effect, these RNA-binding proteins act as switches that turn protein production on or off.</p><p>Nanos and Pumilio are two RNA-binding proteins that are found in many organisms, including humans and other animals. Genetic studies in fruit flies show that these two proteins influence development, the nervous system and the behaviour of stem cells by switching off the production of certain proteins. To investigate how Nanos and Pumilio work together to regulate protein production, Weidmann, Qiu et al. used a variety of techniques to study the activity of these proteins in cells taken from fruit fly embryos.</p><p>The experiments reveal that Nanos acts like a clamp to hold Pumilio close to specific RNAs, which allows Pumilio to switch off the production of the corresponding proteins. The presence of Nanos allows Pumilio to regulate RNAs that it cannot bind to alone. Therefore, the experiments show that by working together with Nanos, Pumilio is able to regulate a wider variety of RNAs than it would otherwise be able to. These findings provide a molecular understanding for why fruit fly mutants that lack Nanos or Pumilio have severe body defects and reduced fertility. The next challenge is to identify the specific RNAs targeted by Nanos and Pumilio in stem cells, the nervous system and during development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17096.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17096.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Nanos</kwd><kwd>Pumilio</kwd><kwd>translational repression</kwd><kwd>cooperative RNA-binding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM105707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weidmann</surname><given-names>Chase A</given-names></name><name><surname>Arvola</surname><given-names>René M</given-names></name><name><surname>Killingsworth</surname><given-names>Jordan</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstrohm</surname><given-names>Aaron C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRSA 5T32GM007544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weidmann</surname><given-names>Chase A</given-names></name><name><surname>Arvola</surname><given-names>René M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-13-080-01-RMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weidmann</surname><given-names>Chase A</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstrohm</surname><given-names>Aaron C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanaka Hall</surname><given-names>Traci M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W-31-109-Eng-38</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanaka Hall</surname><given-names>Traci M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE 1256260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arvola</surname><given-names>René M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Crystal structures of Nanos bound to Pumilio and target RNAs demonstrate how Nanos forms a molecular clamp to alter Pumilio RNA regulation and specificity in embryonic development and germline maintenance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms are widespread and mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that interact dynamically with target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baltz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerstberger et al., 2014</xref>). Understanding how RBPs function together to control the location, timing and level of protein expression is paramount. Decades of research have established the crucial roles of two archetypal RBPs, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Nanos (Nos) and Pumilio (Pum), in developmental patterning, fertility, and nervous system development and function. We use this system to explore how two RBPs cooperatively define regulatory networks.</p><p>Pum is a founding member of the Pum/<italic>fem-3</italic> mRNA-binding factor (FBF), or PUF family, of eukaryotic RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wickens et al., 2002</xref>). PUF proteins share a sequence-specific RNA-binding domain known as the Pum Homology Domain (PUM-HD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Macdonald, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wharton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zamore et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 1997</xref>). Crystal structures of PUF proteins have illuminated their unique RNA recognition properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edwards et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilinski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). Pum binds with high affinity to specific sequences in target mRNAs and represses protein expression and enhances mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weidmann et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wharton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wreden et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zamore et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">1997</xref>). A classic example of Pum activity is the establishment of embryonic body pattern through repression of maternal <italic>hunchback (hb</italic>) mRNA, which requires collaboration with Nos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehmann and Nusslein-Volhard, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murata and Wharton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonoda and Wharton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang and Lehmann, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of <italic>hb</italic> mRNA by Pum relies on the spatial distribution of Nos, a tandem CCHC Zn finger (ZF) RBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curtis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forbes and Lehmann, 1998</xref>). Maternal <italic>hb</italic> mRNA and Pum protein are distributed throughout the syncytial <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Macdonald, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tautz, 1988</xref>), whereas Nos protein forms a gradient emanating from the posterior end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang and Lehmann, 1991</xref>). Where their expression overlaps, Pum and Nos together repress <italic>hb</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lehmann and Nusslein-Volhard, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murata and Wharton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonoda and Wharton, 1999</xref>). In the absence of Nos or Pum expression, Hb protein is produced throughout the embryo, and no abdominal segments are formed.</p><p>Regulation of <italic>hb</italic> mRNA by Pum and Nos is dependent on two Nanos Response Elements (NREs) in the 3´UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murata and Wharton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wharton and Struhl, 1991</xref>). Each NRE contains a binding site for Pum with the RNA consensus sequence, 5´-UGUAHAUA (where H is A, U or C), the Pumilio Response Element (PRE). Additional nucleotides in the NRE, located 5´ of the PRE, are functionally important for <italic>hb</italic> regulation and were proposed to be recognized by Nos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edwards et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonoda and Wharton, 1999</xref>). By itself, Nos appeared to lack RNA sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curtis et al., 1997</xref>). Instead, Nos binding to <italic>hb</italic> NREs requires Pum RNA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonoda and Wharton, 1999</xref>). Hence, combinatorial <italic>hb</italic> mRNA repression requires the sequence specificity of Pum and the spatial information provided by the Nos gradient.</p><p>Nos and Pum also regulate germline and neurological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forbes and Lehmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Menon et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ye et al., 2004</xref>). Nos and Pum collaborate to repress expression of <italic>Cyclin B</italic> mRNA (<italic>CycB</italic>) in primordial germ cells and germline stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asaoka-Taguchi et al., 1999</xref>) and the sodium channel <italic>paralytic (para</italic>) in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muraro et al., 2008</xref>). Like <italic>hb</italic> mRNA, <italic>CycB</italic> and <italic>para</italic> mRNAs possess NREs with PRE-like motifs. Furthermore, genome-wide analyses have identified hundreds of Pum-associated mRNAs, suggesting that Pum may play an expansive regulatory role beyond the few validated target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laver et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While collaboration between Nos and Pum is firmly established, the mechanism by which they do so remains to be determined. Here, we report the crystal structures of Nos-Pum-RNA complexes, which reveal that Nos acts as a molecular clamp that embraces both Pum and RNA. The C-terminal region of Pum undergoes conformational changes to make new contacts with the RNA and Nos. We explored the hypothesis that Nos promotes repression by modulating the RNA-binding activity of Pum. We show that Nos enhances the cellular repression activity and in vitro RNA-binding affinity of Pum. Moreover, Nos contacts nucleotides upstream of the PRE. In doing so, Nos alters the specificity of the repression complex and promotes repression of RNAs that are not stably bound by Pum alone. We performed RNA target selection and high-throughput sequencing, which, together with RNA-binding and cellular repression assays, demonstrate that Nos diversifies Pum RNA regulatory networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nanos Zn Finger and C-terminal regions collaborate with Pumilio to repress target gene expression</title><p>We established a cell-based <italic>hb</italic> reporter mRNA assay, wherein exogenous Nos robustly repressed reporter protein and RNA expression in a manner dependent on the PREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and Pum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weidmann and Goldstrohm, 2012</xref>).

Conserved tandem ZFs are necessary for RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curtis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonoda and Wharton, 1999</xref>), and mutations that disrupt either ZF (C319Y or C354Y) completely blocked Nos repression activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, a Nos variant lacking the C-terminal region (NZ) displayed limited repression activity, 16% repression versus 79% for full-length Nos (NZC). In contrast, a Nos variant lacking the N-terminal region (ZC) retained 43% repression. No individual Nos region (N, Z, or C) was sufficient for repression. These findings indicate that multiple regions of Nos contribute to enhancing Pum-mediated repression: the ZFs and the C-terminal region are crucial, and the N-terminal region makes a minor contribution. Because the Nos ZC region retained most of the Nos-enhanced repression activity and was amenable to biochemical and structural studies, we focused on determining its mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Structural basis for interactions between Nanos, Pumilio and RNA</title><p>We determined a 3.7 Å crystal structure that reveals the molecular architecture of the Nos-Pum-RNA ternary complex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

While the overall structure of Pum in the ternary complex is similar to that in the binary complex (RMSD of 1.2 Å over 324 Pum Cα atoms), the C-terminal region of Pum undergoes notable changes. Loop residues between repeats R7 and R8 rearrange in the ternary complex to promote interaction of F1367<sub>Pum</sub> with the C-terminal α helix of Nos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, the C-terminal α helix of Pum (helix α2 of repeat R8´) unfolds to promote interaction of residues with the upstream RNA backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Since the upstream nucleotides were not present in the binary complex, the change in the structure of the C-terminal region of Pum may be induced by the presence of the upstream RNA and/or Nos. With these conformational changes, Pum and Nos interact with one another and together recognize RNA immediately 5´ of the core PRE motif.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Nanos increases the binding affinity of Pumilio for <italic>hunchback</italic> RNA</title><p>Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we demonstrated that Nos ZC binds stably and tightly to a Pum-<italic>hb</italic> NRE2 RNA complex and cooperatively strengthens the binding affinity of Pum for <italic>hb</italic> RNA.

Since deletion of the C-terminal region severely limited Nos repression of the <italic>hb</italic> 3´UTR reporter in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we probed this interaction more precisely. We tested a Δ376–382 deletion, which eliminated much of the Pum-binding interface and corresponds to the lesion in the <italic>nos</italic><sup>L7</sup> allele that disrupts Nos function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curtis et al., 1997</xref>). This deletion impaired Nos repression activity to a similar extent as deletion of the entire C-terminal region: 27% repression compared to 14% repression for Nos NZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Since our crystal structure indicates that the deleted region includes part of the C-terminal helix that interacts with Pum, it is possible that the protein, although expressed, could be incorrectly folded. We further examined this region by introducing single amino acid substitutions, including the I376<sub>Nos</sub> and M378<sub>Nos</sub> residues that contact Pum in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Repression activity of Nos I376A was diminished to 46%, and more so for Nos M378A (29%), whereas Nos I382A caused a modest decrease to 60%, relative to 70% repression by wild type Nos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). A Δ383–393 deletion, which removed the final three ordered residues in the structure and eight subsequent residues, also diminished repression activity to 43% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, a Δ394–401 deletion retained full repression activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These C-terminal eight residues of Nos were disordered in the ternary complex structure, and therefore did not contact Pum. These results confirm the functional importance of the observed protein contacts between Pum and Nos for regulation in cells.</p><p>We also found that single amino acid substitutions in Pum disrupt formation of the repression complex. No ternary complex was formed with Pum F1367S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), an R7-R8 loop mutant that binds RNA, but does not interact with Nos in a yeast 3-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edwards et al., 2001</xref>) or respond to Nos in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weidmann and Goldstrohm, 2012</xref>). Similarly, a Q1337A<sub>Pum</sub> mutation eliminated ternary complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Importantly, both Pum mutants retained the ability to bind to <italic>hb</italic> NRE2 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). Thus, Nos must interact with both repeat R7 and the R7-R8 loop of Pum to form a stable ternary complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Interaction of Nanos Zn fingers with RNA extends the binding site and is critical for repression</title><p>The crystal structure of the Nos-Pum-<italic>hb</italic> RNA complex reveals that Nos binds to three nucleotides upstream of the core PRE when it joins the ternary complex, and we find that repression activity is highly sensitive to mutation of the interface.

Individual mutations that disrupted the hydrophobic binding pocket for the −1U base (F321A, T366A, and Y369A) abrogated repression activity. Another mutant, K368Q, designed to eliminate a salt bridge interaction with the phosphate group of −1U, reduced repression activity to 32% vs 75% for WT protein. Mutations targeting interactions with nucleotides−2A and −3A (N325A and Y352A) had smaller, but measurable effects on repression activity. The effects of these single residue substitutions indicate the importance of Nos recognition of the −1 nucleotide and interactions with other upstream NRE nucleotides.</p><p>We next investigated whether the sequence of the upstream nucleotides (defined structurally as the Nos binding site, NBS) is important for ternary complex formation and repression activity. Substitution of both the −1 and −2 positions of <italic>hb</italic> NRE2 with cytosine had been shown previously to disrupt abdominal segmentation, but did not affect Pum RNA association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murata and Wharton, 1995</xref>), so we designed <italic>hb</italic> NRE2 RNAs that substituted cytosine bases at either the −1 or −2 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, −1C and −2C). Neither mutation hindered RNA binding by Pum, but both mutations blocked ternary complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We then probed whether the cytosine substitutions in the NBS affect mRNA regulation in cells using reporters bearing a 3´UTR with a single <italic>hb</italic> NRE (RnLuc 1x <italic>hb</italic> NRE2). Expression of full-length Nos resulted in 50% repression of WT reporter activity compared to the negative control Halo-tag protein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), similar to a mutant <italic>hb</italic> 3´UTR reporter with only a functional NRE2 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, mt1). In contrast, Nos did not repress mutant −1C or −2C reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), consistent with disruption of ternary complex formation by these substitutions. Thus, the identities of the nucleotides in the NBS are critical for repression activity. Although we did not observe sequence-specific contacts to the −2A base in our crystal structure of the ternary complex, this likely reflects the modest 3.7 Å resolution that was not sufficient to resolve all direct contacts or identify water molecules that may mediate protein-RNA interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Nanos alters Pumilio RNA-binding specificity and affinity</title><p>Given the importance of the NBS sequence for Nos-enhanced Pum regulation, we examined whether differences in natural Nos-Pum mRNA target sequences affect regulatory activity.

The <italic>Cyclin B (CycB</italic>) NRE contains a PRE that diverges from the consensus with uracils in place of adenines at positions +6 and +8, and it has a different NBS sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Taken together, our results demonstrate that Nos can stabilize binding of Pum to RNAs containing a wider range of consensus or divergent NREs, but cannot overcome complete disruption of the UGU trinucleotide sequence.</p><p>To gain molecular insight into how Nos enhances Pum recognition of different NRE sequences, we determined a 4.0 Å crystal structure of a ternary complex with a <italic>CycB</italic> NRE RNA (5´-UAUU<underline>UGUAAUUU</underline>AU, core PRE underlined)(<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The protein structures are essentially unchanged compared to the complex with <italic>hb</italic> NRE2 RNA; however, differences in Pum binding to bases +5 to +8 result in distinct conformations of <italic>hb</italic> and <italic>CycB</italic> RNAs in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6―figure supplement 5</xref>).

Pum binds specifically to the 3´ AUA sequence at positions +6 to +8 of <italic>hb</italic> PRE2 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, for the <italic>CycB</italic> RNA, recognition of +6U is suboptimal and the +8U nucleotide is disordered in the ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, Nos stabilizes binding of Pum to RNAs that do not match the PRE consensus sequence in the 3´ half, reducing Pum specificity to allow regulation of a broader range of mRNA targets than Pum alone.</p><p>To define changes in Pum specificity induced by Nos, we examined sequence preferences using SEQRS (in vitro<underline> s</underline>election, high-throughput s<underline>eq</underline>uencing of <underline>R</underline>NA, and <underline>s</underline>equence specificity landscapes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2012a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

To understand their regulatory functions, the emerging challenge is to classify these regulatory RBPs by their protein folds, specificities, <italic>in vivo</italic> target RNAs, and expression patterns. Furthermore, as the regulatory targets of individual RBPs are established, it will be crucial to examine overlapping networks to identify cooperative regulation by multiple RBPs. However, our current knowledge of how multiple RBPs collaboratively regulate an mRNA is limited. In this context, the mechanisms of combinatorial regulation by Nos and Pum revealed in this study, which visually capture decades of genetic and biochemical data, provide a foundation to derive general principles for how RBPs co-regulate target mRNAs.</p><p>Nos uses its three functional regions: N, Z, and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) to elicit repression of target mRNAs, and each region illustrates principles of combinatorial control. The Nos tandem ZFs form a module that adds protein-RNA contacts that strengthen RNA binding, using both side chain and main chain atoms to interact with the NBS. Nanos orthologs are found throughout Bilateria, and the tandem CCHC domains define the ZF-Nanos superfamily (PF05741) based on unique sequence, spacing and length compared to other ZFs. Interestingly, these ZFs were reported to be unique to Nos orthologs, and no structural homology to other RNA-binding ZFs was detected using a DALI structural search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holm and Rosenström, 2010</xref>).

Incorporation of Nos into the Pum-RNA complex induced conformational changes in Pum that added additional RNA contacts. Protein interaction modules may also strengthen regulation by enhancing recruitment of cofactors. The N-terminal region of Nos, not included in our crystal structures, increases repression by the Nos-Pum complex by recruiting the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kadyrova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raisch et al., 2016</xref>), which strengthens the independent repression activity of Pum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weidmann et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2014</xref>).</p><p>The functional importance of the interactions visualized by the Nos-Pum-RNA structures is corroborated by our findings and previous genetic and biochemical data. One of the first <italic>nos</italic> mutant alleles identified, <italic>nos</italic><sup>L7</sup>, causes a lethal loss of abdominal segments during embryogenesis and encodes a Nos protein with a deletion of residues 376–382 near the C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arrizabalaga and Lehmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lehmann, 1988</xref>). This deletion prevents formation of a Nos-Pum-RNA complex as assessed by yeast three-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonoda and Wharton, 1999</xref>). Our crystal structures illustrate how contacts between the C-terminal region of Nos and Pum residues F1367<sub>Pum</sub> and Q1337<sub>Pum</sub> are lost with the <italic>nos</italic><sup>L7</sup> deletion. A Pum mutation, F1367S, which blocks Pum and Nos association in a yeast 3-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edwards et al., 2001</xref>) and impairs Nos enhancement of repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weidmann and Goldstrohm, 2012</xref>), also abrogated ternary complex formation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Similarly, mutation of Q1337<sub>Pum</sub> prevented incorporation of Nos into the ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In addition, F1367<sub>Pum</sub> is within the loop between Pum repeats R7 and R8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), explaining why insertion of four residues in the R7-R8 loop in the Pum<sup>Mlu</sup> mutant disrupts complex formation, <italic>hb</italic> repression and abdominal segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonoda and Wharton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wharton et al., 1998</xref>). These results show the crucial function of the interaction between the Nos C-terminal region and the convex surface presented by Pum repeats R7 and R8.</p><p>Based on our current understanding of the Pum-Nos interface and phylogenetic comparisons, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Nos-Pum interaction is conserved among Dipteran orthologs, but it is not possible to predict conservation of the interaction in vertebrates. The Nos C-terminal region that contacts Pum is conserved within Diptera, but substantially diverges beyond that order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curtis et al., 1995</xref>). Vertebrates have three Nos orthologs which share the tandem Nos ZFs but diverge substantially in their C termini. For example, the C termini of human Nos proteins are not homologous to each other or <italic>Drosophila</italic> Nos. The amino acid sequence of the 42-residue C-terminus of human NOS1 is enriched in prolines and is conserved throughout vertebrate NOS1 orthologs. The sequence of the 23-residue C-terminus of human NOS2 is enriched in arginines and is conserved among vertebrate NOS2 orthologs. Likewise, the sequence of the 63-residue C-terminus of human NOS3 is only shared by vertebrate NOS3 proteins. We also analyzed the conservation of the Nos-binding interface of Pum proteins and find that the contacts points observed in the Nos-Pum structure are conserved in Dipteran orthologs, but diverge throughout the tree of life. For example, residues equivalent to Pum Q1337 and F1367 change to proline and methionine, respectively, in vertebrate Pum homologs. In addition, vertebrate PUM proteins possess a three residue (GPH) insertion in the R7-R8 loop region that could augment protein contacts with vertebrate Nos proteins. Interestingly, deletion of these residues allows human Pum1 to interact with <italic>Drosophila</italic> Nos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonoda and Wharton, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Given these differences in Nos and Pum proteins, several possible evolutionary scenarios are worth consideration. First, the direct interaction between <italic>Drosophila</italic> Nos and Pum might be unique to Dipterans; however, Nos and Pum homologs from <italic>C. elegans, Xenopus</italic> and humans have been reported to interact and a simple loop deletion allows human Pum1 to interact with <italic>Drosophila</italic> Nos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaruzelska et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kraemer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lolicato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakahata et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonoda and Wharton 1999</xref>). Instead, the Nos and Pum contacts likely coevolved as the number of Nos and Pum homologs increased, perhaps restricting interactions between particular Nos and Pum proteins. Nos and Pum homologs may also interact indirectly, mediated by a bridging partner(s), as was suggested for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kraemer et al., 1999</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We found that Nos stabilizes the ternary complex and adds 5´ sequence specificity. Nos specifically recognizes the 5´ sequence only in the context of the ternary complex and also induces a localized conformational change of Pum that adds contacts with the phosphate backbone of nucleotides -1 to -4. Previous reports indicated that the Nos tandem ZFs in isolation exhibit non-specific RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curtis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 2010</xref>). With our structure-based definition of the NBS, we find that the mutations in the RNAs tested by Curtis <italic>et al.</italic> were outside the NBS and thus would not have detected sequence-specific differences in Nos binding. With our findings, we can now attribute the negative effect of NBS mutations on abdominal segmentation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wharton et al., 1998</xref>) and ternary complex formation in yeast three-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonoda and Wharton, 1999</xref>) to the loss of RNA recognition by Nos. Intriguingly, these newly identified Nos and Pum contacts with the 5´ NBS relax the sequence recognition requirements at the 3´ end of the PRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), thereby allowing Nos and Pum to regulate mRNA targets bearing imperfect PREs, including <italic>CycB</italic> and <italic>bcd</italic>, that are not bound stably by Pum alone. As a result, the cooperative activity of a second RBP (Nos) adds upstream RNA sequence specificity, which alters mRNA target selection of the primary RBP (Pum) and diversifies the range of target sequences.</p><p>Cooperative RNA recognition by Nos and Pum is reminiscent of cooperative binding of <italic>msl2</italic> RNA by Sex lethal (Sxl) and Upstream of N-Ras (Unr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hennig et al., 2014</xref>), yet the mechanisms and effects of cooperative recognition by Nos and Pum display novel distinguishing characteristics. Similar to Nos and Pum, Sxl and Unr proteins interact with each other only in the presence of target RNA, cooperatively interacting with a regulatory element that contains binding sites for each protein. Sxl and Unr recognize the RNA nucleotides between their individual binding sites, forming a sandwich or a “triple zipper” arrangement that creates a longer recognition element than either protein alone. Nos and Pum recognize their respective NBS and PRE elements; however, Nos recognition of the 5´ NBS and clamp-like binding to Pum and RNA relaxes the sequence requirements of Pum interaction with the 3´ end of the PRE, as with <italic>CycB</italic> mRNA, which effectively shifts the recognition sequence, rather than extending it. As a consequence, Nos and Pum cooperatively bind to RNAs that neither protein stably binds on its own.</p><p>Nos appears to dramatically alter the repertoire of transcripts bound by Pum. Our analysis of Pum target mRNAs using the SEQRS-derived Nos-Pum motif indicates that the majority of Pum target mRNAs contain the Nos-Pum motif but lack the full canonical PRE Pum recognition sequence. This suggests that, in addition to strengthening Pum repression activity, Nos can alter the identity of mRNAs regulated by Pum. Moreover, enrichment of specific gene ontology terms in the mRNAs bearing the Nos-Pum motif suggest that Nos can alter the biological functions controlled by Pum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These analyses allude to the utility of the combinatorial specificity <italic>in vivo</italic> and explain broadened regulation by Nos and Pum in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and adults.</p><p>In addition to altering sequence specificity, our studies highlight other advantages of combinatorial RNA target regulation by Nos and Pum in vivo. First, repression is responsive to the Nos protein concentration. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, the Nos protein gradient is highest at the posterior end where <italic>hb</italic> expression must be repressed for abdomen formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 1992</xref>). We showed that higher Nos levels induced greater repression of reporters bearing <italic>hb</italic> NREs, mirroring the effect in the embryonic posterior. Interestingly, the expression of Nos is dynamic over the course of development and likely modulates Pum activity temporally as well as spatially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang and Lehmann, 1991</xref>). Second, repression is affected by the sequence of the NREs; reporters bearing imperfect PREs were also repressed, but required higher Nos protein levels for equivalent effect. Third, the number of Nos-Pum binding sites in the mRNA modulates regulatory activity. For example, <italic>hb</italic> mRNA bears two NREs, each with consensus NBS and PRE sites. We found that each site was highly responsive to Nos-enhanced, Pum-mediated repression, and multiple sites conferred greater responsiveness. Repression of the <italic>CycB</italic> PRE reporter required higher concentrations of transfected Nos, mirroring the requirement for concentrated Nos protein in pole cells where <italic>CycB</italic> translation is repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asaoka-Taguchi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kadyrova et al., 2007</xref>). Inclusion of three <italic>CycB</italic> PREs supported repression at lower Nos concentrations, consistent with previous studies showing how the number and quality of PREs in the <italic>hb</italic> 3´UTR, and the amount of Nos protein expressed, confer the precise level of regulation upon the <italic>hb</italic> transcript in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wharton and Struhl, 1991</xref>). Indeed, although the <italic>CycB</italic> mRNA 3´ UTR contains no perfect PRE, it does contain 7 sequence elements with an NBS upstream of a partial PRE with the 5´ UGU sequence. Together, these results define multiple parameters that contribute to biologically relevant levels of regulatory activity.</p><p>Other RBPs collaborate with Pum to regulate mRNAs. For example, the Brain Tumor (Brat) protein contributes to repression of <italic>hb</italic> expression in the embryo by recognizing an element located upstream of the NBS and PRE in each NRE (i.e. the so-called Box A motif) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loedige et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sonoda and Wharton, 2001</xref>). Moreover, additional partner proteins can modulate RNA binding of PUF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menichelli et al., 2013</xref>) and the Nos-Pum-RNA ternary complex suggests common mechanisms of co-regulation. For instance, RNA-binding affinity and specificity of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> PUF protein, FBF-2, is modulated by interactions with CPB-1 (Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation element Binding protein 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menichelli et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, CPB-1 and other partners bind to a region of FBF-2 that corresponds to the R7-R8 loop of Pum that binds Nos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menichelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the Nos-Pum-RNA complex exemplifies a protein-protein interaction hotspot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2012b</xref>). Our results indicate that formation of PUF protein-partner complexes can alter the PUF protein conformation to create additional protein-RNA contacts that strengthen RNA binding while modulating target specificity and regulation.</p><p>In conclusion, the partnership of Nos and Pum illustrates the profound influence combinatorial control can have on gene expression, demonstrating how location-specific regulation is achieved through the action of RBPs with different spatial distributions, how the addition of a second RBP shifts the RNA recognition motif of the first RBP to modulate target selection, and how regulatory sensitivity can be adjusted by the number and quality of binding sites within a target mRNA and by RBP expression levels. This paradigm emphasizes the importance of understanding how the multitude of RNA-binding factors collaborate to control mRNA stability, translation, processing, and localization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Reporter plasmids pAc5.1 FFluc, pAc5.1 RnLuc <italic>hb</italic> 3´UTR were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weidmann and Goldstrohm, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weidmann et al., 2014</xref>), as was the control plasmid pIZ Halo-tag. The pIZ Halo-Nos expression vector (NZC) was created by inserting the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Nanos cDNA (NP_001262723.1) into the XbaI site of pIZ Halo-tag, which contains an N-terminal Halo-tag with a TEV protease cleavage site and a C-terminal V5 epitope. The Nos sequence was amplified from whole fly cDNA and corresponds to isoform Nos-PB, which lacks an alternatively spliced exon encoding a 19 amino acid sequence aa14-VGVANPPSLAQSGKIFQLQ-32 present in the N-terminus of Nos-PA (NP_476658.1). For consistency with the originally identified domain boundaries and mutants, the reported amino acid positions correspond to Nos-PA (e.g. C319Y and C354Y correspond to C300Y and C335Y of Nos-BP). Using the Nos plasmid as a template, the C319Y, C354Y, I376A, M378A, and I382A mutations were generated via QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (QC-SDM, Agilent).

Pattern matching to the Pum and Nos-Pum motifs reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> were preformed using the grep Perl function from command line. Significance values compared to all 3'UTR sequences was determined using chi-squares test using GraphPad Prism (reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>). Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2008</xref>) and Venn diagrams were generated using Venn Diagram Plotter (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank L Pedersen and the staff of the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team beamlines for assistance with X-ray data collection and Drs.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Drosophila</italic> Nanos acts as a molecular clamp that modulates the RNA- binding and repression activities of Pumilio&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The article by Weidman and colleagues addresses a long-lasting question regarding how the RNA binding proteins Pumilio and Nanos regulate their targets. While the structures of Pumilio bound to RNA targets had been identified a while ago, it remained unclear how Nanos may regulate target specificity for a Pumilio-Nanos-NRE tertiary complex. In a beautiful set of experiments connecting in vitro binding and translational repression studies with structural analysis these questions are addressed in the present paper. The analysis is thorough and the data are well controlled and illustrated. The authors are able to identify a new sequence upstream of the Pumilio binding sites important for Nanos contact with RNA in the presence of Pumilio. It also represents one of the few examples of how two RBP cooperate to achieve sequence specificity and how one RBP (nanos) can modulate the sequence-specificity of the other one Pumilio. While this study does not include<italic>in vivo</italic> tests of the predicted interactions, several predictions have already been born out by previously published results. For example, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies had implicated sequences upstream of the canonical Pumilio binding sites in hb RNA regulation. Similarly, the new data illustrate the importance of the Nanos C-terminus in 'clamping' Pumilio to RNA, which was so far mostly implicated by genetics, for Nanos function in hb regulation and less so in germ line development.</p><p>Though the structures and binding studies nicely illustrate how cooperativity works in this context, it would have been really worthwhile for authors to use this term early on and would not wait till the middle of their discussion.</p><p>In addition, the paper would be improved if the interactions found</p><p>were discussed in terms of an evolutionary comparison. How conserved are these contacts? Can one use the structures to predict cooperativity of two RBPs in other organisms? This is not touched upon and would be very valuable.</p><p>Several issues should be clarified:</p><p>Much of the analysis is a comparison between the binary Pum-RNA complex and the ternary Nos-Pum-RNA complex. The structure of Pum changes in the region where Nos binds to it and to the RNA element. However, in the binary complex, the RNA doesn't really reach that area. It is shorter and contains only the PRE. Therefore, would Pum assume this altered conformation in the presence of a longer RNA without Nos? Or might it be closer to the conformation it assumes with Nos? This is an important point and bears on the conclusions of this paper.</p><p>It is very hard to see from the various figures, what is moving in Pum between the binary and ternary complexes. Perhaps a side by side of that area would be easier to follow.</p><p>The deletions that are discussed on Results section, subsection “Nanos increases the binding affinity of Pumilio for hunchback RNA”, that affect repression involve cutting out a few residues sometimes in the middle of a helix and it's not clear how well the structure would retain its integrity. The extent of repression might correlate with what percentage of folded protein they have in this region. Does this correlate with Pum-RNA binding?</p><p>The authors show a difference in the RNA structure between the hb and CycB complexes. However, the resolution is fairly low. How confident are they? What do the electron density maps look like in this region?</p><p>In the discussion the authors mention that the ZFs in Nos are unique compared to other RNA-binding ZFs.

How conserved are these contacts? Can one use the structures to predict cooperativity of two RBPs in other organisms?

Nos and Pum homologs may also interact indirectly, mediated by a bridging partner(s), as was suggested for C. elegans (Kraemer et al., 1999) and mouse (Suzuki et al. 2016).”</p><p> <italic>Several issues should be clarified:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Much of the analysis is a comparison between the binary Pum-RNA complex and the ternary Nos-Pum-RNA complex. The structure of Pum changes in the region where Nos binds to it and to the RNA element. However, in the binary complex, the RNA doesn't really reach that area. It is shorter and contains only the PRE. Therefore, would Pum assume this altered conformation in the presence of a longer RNA without Nos? Or might it be closer to the conformation it assumes with Nos? This is an important point and bears on the conclusions of this paper.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for their insightful questions about the structure of the C-terminal region of Pum in the binary complex. We conducted crystallization screens, but did not obtain crystals of Pum in complex with a <italic>hb</italic> RNA containing 4 additional upstream nucleotides. We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that the unfolding of the C-terminal α helix of Pum observed in the ternary complexes could be induced by a longer RNA as well as by Nos. Indeed the C-terminal region of Pum is involved in crystal packing in the binary complex that could stabilize the terminal α helix. We have edited the Results to clarify this point:</p><p>“Comparison of the ternary and binary complexes reveals that the addition of Nos and the upstream nucleotides induces localized conformational changes in Pum that promote Nos-Pum interaction and binding of Pum to RNA upstream of the core PRE site.”</p><p>And</p><p>“Since the upstream nucleotides were not present in the binary complex, the change in the structure of the C-terminal region of Pum may be induced by the presence of the upstream RNA and/or Nos. With these conformational changes, Pum and Nos interact with one another and together recognize RNA immediately 5´ of the core PRE motif.”</p><p>Although we feel it is not strong enough evidence to include in the manuscript, our previous structural studies of human Pum1, whose RNA-binding domain shares 80% sequence identity with <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pum, provide some indication that the C-terminal α helix remains formed in binary complexes with longer RNAs. We determined crystal structures of human Pum1 in complex with <italic>hb</italic> RNAs bearing five additional 5´ nucleotides. In one of the two Pum1:RNA complexes in the asymmetric unit, crystal packing influences the ordering of one additional upstream nucleotide. In the second complex, the upstream nucleotides were disordered and the C-terminal helix was formed as in the binary complex of Pum. The crystal packing in the area does not appear to restrict unfolding of the terminal helix or binding of the upstream RNA in the binary complex. The sequence of the C-terminal region that undergoes rearrangement bears only one substitution in Pum1 (N1421 is a leucine in human Pum1), making our observations in human Pum1 a reasonable model for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pum.</p><p> <italic>It is very hard to see from the various figures, what is moving in Pum between the binary and ternary complexes. Perhaps a side by side of that area would be easier to follow.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this feedback on the figures illustrating the differences in Pum between the binary and ternary complexes. We now include revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> where we show side-by-side views of the two complexes. We changed the coloring to clarify the positions of changes we discuss, and present Nanos as a surface representation to focus on the R7/R8 loop and C-terminus of Pum. We also include an additional view of the Pum-Nos-<italic>hb</italic> RNA ternary structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, which highlights some of the new contacts in the ternary complex. These revised figures make it easier to see the differences and strengthen the clarity of our findings.</p><p> <italic>The deletions that are discussed on Results section, subsection “Nanos increases the binding affinity of Pumilio for hunchback RNA”, that affect repression involve cutting out a few residues sometimes in the middle of a helix and it's not clear how well the structure would retain its integrity. The extent of repression might correlate with what percentage of folded protein they have in this region. Does this correlate with Pum-RNA binding?</italic> </p><p>We chose the specific deletions because the Nos Δ376-382 is important in terms of history, biology, and function. This deletion corresponds to the lesion in the <italic>nos<sup>L7</sup></italic> allele, which disrupts embryonic development. Together, these data and our functional and structural data reveal how that deletion causes loss of function. Unfortunately we were unable to produce recombinant purified Nos Δ376-382 protein to confirm this result but, as noted in the Discussion, Sonoda and Wharton reported the Nos Δ376-382 was unable to form a ternary complex with <italic>hb</italic> NRE, as assessed by yeast three hybrid assay. We have now clarified these points in the Results:</p><p>“Since deletion of the C-terminal region severely limited Nos repression of the hb 3´UTR reporter in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we probed this interaction more precisely. […] Since our crystal structure indicates that the deleted region includes part of the Cterminal helix that interacts with Pum, it is possible that the protein, although expressed, could be incorrectly folded.”</p><p>We have now performed additional analyses of the role of the observed Nos-Pum contacts by introducing single amino acid substitutions into the C-terminal region of Nos. As reported in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, Nos mediated repression was reduced by I376A and M378A substitutions, consistent with the contacts of these residues with Pum observed in the crystal structure. These results are now described on Line 195 of the Results section:</p><p>“We further examined this region by introducing single amino acid substitutions,</p><p>including the I376 and M378 residues that contact Pum in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Repression activity of Nos I376A was diminished to 46%, and more so for Nos M378A (29%), whereas Nos I382A caused a modest decrease to 60%, relative to 70% repression by wild type Nos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).”</p><p>We also tested mutants in the Nos binding interface of Pum to confirm the importance of the observed Nos-Pum interaction for ternary complex formation. These substitutions blocked incorporation of Nos into the complex, but did not prevent RNA binding by Pum, demonstrating that they did not cause an overall disruption of Pum structure.:</p><p>“We also found that single amino acid substitutions in Pum disrupt formation of the repression complex. […]Thus, Nos must interact with both repeat R7 and the R7-R8 loop of Pum to form a stable ternary complex.”</p><p> <italic>The authors show a difference in the RNA structure between the hb and CycB complexes. However, the resolution is fairly low. How confident are they? What do the electron density maps look like in this region?</italic> </p><p>We now include comparisons of the electron density maps for the <italic>hb</italic> and <italic>CycB</italic> ternary complexes, provided as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>, which is cited in the Results. The electron density for the RNA in the <italic>hb</italic> and <italic>CycB</italic> complexes clearly indicates differences in the backbone conformations. The backbone conformation for the <italic>CycB</italic> RNA appears to change to accommodate the +6U nucleotide that interacts non-canonically with repeat R3 that bears an A-recognition motif. The map-model swaps demonstrate the differences in the two models.</p><p> <italic>In the discussion the authors mention that the ZFs in Nos are unique compared to other RNA-binding ZFs. In what way?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that we should describe what we did to evaluate the Nos ZFs relative to other RNA-binding ZFs. We elaborate now in the text that no structural homologues were detected using the program DALI (other than the zebrafish Nos). We also considered a manual alignment with the HIV nucleocapsid protein Zn knuckles (ZK), which are also CCHC RNA-binding ZFs. We were pleased to discover that the topology and structures of Nos ZF2 and the HIV ZKs were strikingly similar. We have added a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) to show this comparison. The following text was added to the manuscript.</p><p> <italic>Also in the discussion, the authors compare this cooperative interaction to that between Sxl and Unr.

We were pleased to discover that the topology and structures of Nos ZF2 and the HIV ZKs were strikingly similar. We have added a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) to show this comparison. The following text was added to the Discussion:</p><p>“Nos uses its three functional regions: N, Z, and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) to elicit repression of target mRNAs, each of which illustrate principles of combinatorial control. […]However, we manually compared the Nos ZFs with CCHC Zn knuckles (ZKs) from HIV nucleocapsid protein (HIVnc) (De Guzman et al., 1998) and found that Nos ZF2 is strikingly similar to the HIVnc ZKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).”</p><p><italic>Also in the discussion, the authors compare this cooperative interaction to that between Sxl and Unr. They say that this is also a cooperative interaction and two lines later they say it is additive. Which is it? If Sxl and Unr interaction is additive, then they are distinctly different.</italic></p><p> <italic>These concepts make the whole story here, so it's very important that this is written clearly.</italic></p><p>We are sorry for the confusion our abbreviated comparison caused. To clarify, we have now added a paragraph to the Discussion that compares and contrasts cooperative RNA recognition by Sxl and Unr with Nos and Pum, which is quite interesting and instructive of mechanisms of cooperativity:</p><p>“Cooperative RNA recognition by Nos and Pum is reminiscent of cooperative binding of msl2 RNA by Sex lethal (Sxl) and Upstream of N-Ras (Unr) (Hennig et al., 2014), yet the mechanisms and effects of cooperative recognition by Nos and Pum display novel distinguishing characteristics. […] As a consequence,</p><p>Nos and Pum cooperatively bind to RNAs that neither protein stably binds on its own.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
