proteins which can form a 4-helical bundle, and the SNARE disassembly chaperones Sec17p and Sec18p. In addition to these proteins, specific vacuole lipids are required for efficient fusion in vivo and with the purified organelle. Reconstitution of vacuole fusion with all purified components reveals that high SNARE levels can mask the requirement for a complex mixture of vacuole lipids. At lower, more physiological SNARE levels, neutral lipids with small headgroups that tend to form non-bilayer structures (phosphatidylethanolamine, diacylglycerol, and ergosterol) are essential. Membranes without these three lipids can dock and complete <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE pairing but cannot rearrange their lipids for fusion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01879.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01879.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01879.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All cells are enclosed with a membrane that is made of phospholipid molecules, and many of the structures found inside cells—such as the vacuoles in plant and fungal cells—are also enclosed with a phospholipid membrane. To form a membrane, the phospholipid molecules—which have a phosphate head and two fatty acid tails—arrange themselves in two layers, with the fatty acid tails pointing into the membrane, and the phosphate heads pointing outwards. This structure is known as a phospholipid bilayer.</p><p>Vacuoles are filled with water that contains various proteins and molecules in solution, and adjust their volume to keep the concentrations of substances in the cell in balance. To do this, the vacuoles fuse with each other. This fusion process requires dramatic spatial rearrangements of the phospholipid molecules.</p><p>The SNARE family of proteins plays a key role in membrane fusion. As the two membranes come together, SNARE proteins located on each membrane form a complex known as a <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complex. This docks the vacuole in place beside another vacuole while the phospholipid molecules in the two membranes rearrange. However, much less is known about the phospholipid molecules that are involved in the fusion process.</p><p>Now, Zick et al. have shown that three types of phospholipid molecules must be present for membrane fusion to be completed. These have in common that their phosphate ‘headgroups’ are small and they do not tend to form bilayers. The vacuoles can dock beside each other if these small headgroup phospholipid molecules are not present, but the bilayer lipids in the vacuole membranes cannot rearrange themselves in the absence of these particular lipids.</p><p>The importance of these nonbilayer lipid molecules had not previously been established, as the majority of experiments investigating membrane fusion used concentrations of SNARE proteins that were much higher than those found physiologically. At such high concentrations, fusion can go ahead without the nonbilayer lipid molecules being present.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01879.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01879.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>SNARE</kwd><kwd>ergosterol</kwd><kwd>diacylglycerol</kwd><kwd>phosphatidylethanolamine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM23377-38</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wickner</surname><given-names>William T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZI 1339/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zick</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lipids with a propensity to form nonbilayer structures must be present for the last step of membrane fusion to take place.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane fusion on the exocytic and endocytic pathways underlies cell growth, hormone secretion, neurotransmission, and certain nutrient and pathogen uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wickner and Schekman, 2008</xref>). Fusion is guided and catalyzed by families of proteins which are conserved from yeast to humans: Rab family GTPases serve as membrane-identity master switches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grosshans et al., 2006</xref>), binding large multisubunit effector complexes which catalyze tethering, the first step of specific membrane association. Membranes bear SNARE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>), with characteristic heptad repeats with a central arginyl (R-SNARE) or glutamyl (Q-SNARE) residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fasshauer et al., 1998</xref>) and membrane anchor domains. SNAREs can bind (snare) each other, either as <italic>cis</italic>-SNARE complexes in which each SNARE is anchored to the same membrane or as <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complexes in which SNAREs are anchored to two different apposed membranes. When the SNAREs of each membrane have been liberated from <italic>cis</italic>-SNARE complexes by the SNARE complex disassembly system of Sec18p (NSF), Sec17p (α-SNAP), and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mayer et al., 1996</xref>), and the membranes have been tightly apposed through tethering, SNAREs can assemble into <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complexes. <italic>Trans</italic>-SNARE complex assembly is a prerequisite for the bilayer rearrangements of fusion.</p><p>Despite increasingly detailed knowledge of these protein catalysts, far less is known of the lipid requirements for fusion. Fusion can be reconstituted with a few recombinant SNARE proteins in liposomes of simple lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukuda et al., 2000</xref>) such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) plus phosphatidylserine (PS). Nevertheless, genetic screens for in vivo fusion defects and fusion assays of isolated organelles emphasize the importance of a more complex lipid composition under physiological conditions.</p><p>We study membrane fusion with the vacuoles (lysosomes) of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45a">Wickner, 2010</xref>). An initial screen for altered vacuole morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wada et al., 1992</xref>), the <italic>vam</italic> phenotype, identified the vacuole-specific Rab (now termed Ypt7p), the vacuole-specific SNAREs, and subunits of the Rab effector complex (termed HOPS, for homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Seals et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wurmser et al., 2000</xref>). However, later genomic screens for fragmented vacuole morphology in strains with defined nonessential gene deletions suggested that sterol and phosphoinositides were also required for fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seeley et al., 2002</xref>). With a quantitative, colorimetric assay of the fusion of purified vacuoles, biochemical studies confirmed vital roles for phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mayer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheever et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seeley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fratti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mima and Wickner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu and Wickner, 2010</xref>), diacylglycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jun et al., 2004</xref>), and ergosterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kato and Wickner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seeley et al., 2002</xref>). It was found that each of these lipids co-localized with the Rab, Rab-effector, and SNAREs in the fusion microdomain of docked vacuoles, and that the localization of these lipids to this microdomain is interdependent with localization of the fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fratti et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Exploiting an assay of fusion of proteoliposomes consisting of vacuolar lipids, the purified prenylated Rab Ypt7p, 4 recombinant vacuolar SNAREs (Vam3p, Vti1p, Vam7p, and Nyv1p), HOPS, Sec17p, Sec18p, and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zucchi and Zick, 2011</xref>), we have reexamined the roles of lipids in the fusion reaction. We find that small head-group neutral lipids that tend to form nonbilayer structures are essential for fusion at physiological SNARE concentrations. Small head-group neutral lipids are not needed for <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE pairing, but are required for the ensuing lipid rearrangements that constitute membrane fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Membrane fusion was measured as protected lumenal compartment mixing and concurrent lipid mixing by a modified version of our published assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zucchi and Zick, 2011</xref>). Reconstituted proteoliposomes (RPLs) were prepared with a recombinant prenylated Rab (Ypt7p) and with the four vacuolar SNAREs (Nyv1p, Vam3p, Vti1p, and Vam7p, which are the vacuolar R, Qa, Qb, and Qc SNAREs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fasshauer et al., 1998</xref>). RPLs were formed from an octylglucoside mixed-micellar solution of these proteins and vacuolar lipids during lengthy dialysis in the cold, then isolated by flotation. One set of proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) bears Marina Blue-linked phosphatidylethanolamine as a lipidic marker and entrapped Cy5-derivatized streptavidin as a lumenal marker, while a complementary set of RPLs bears the lipidic marker NBD-PE and lumenally entrapped biotinylated phycoerythrin. Fusion reactions are performed in the presence of a large excess of external, nonfluorescent streptavidin to bind any biotinylated R-phycoerythrin that may be released from the proteoliposomes by lysis. Upon addition of purified HOPS, Sec17p, Sec18p, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>:ATP, fusion allows the biotin-R-phycoerythrin to bind to the Cy5-streptavidin within the lumen of fused vesicles while remaining inaccessible to the external, nonfluorescent streptavidin. This is readily assayed by the ensuing Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Cy5 and R-phycoerythrin. Fusion is also reflected in the quenching of the fluorescence of Marina Blue-PE as it is mixed in the same bilayer with NBD-PE. The rate and extent of fusion are governed by the proteoliposomal lipid composition and by the molar ratio of SNARE proteins to lipid. Proteoliposomes of a vacuolar mixed lipid (VML) composition, based on the established composition of the isolated organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schneiter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zinser et al., 1991</xref>), bearing SNAREs at a 1:1000 molar ratio to lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left, filled circles) or at a 1:3000 ratio (filled squares) undergo rapid fusion. At a 1:9000 SNARE:lipid ratio, the fusion of VML proteoliposomes (filled triangles) slows to the rate seen for PC/PS proteoliposomes at a 1:1000 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right, open circles). Fusion is hardly detectable for PC/PS proteoliposomes with SNAREs at a 1:9000 molar ratio to lipids (open triangles).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01879.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lipid composition and SNARE concentration regulate the rate of proteoliposome membrane fusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Membrane fusion was assayed as protected (from external non-fluorescent streptavidin) lumenal compartment mixing. This was measured as the FRET between biotin-phycoerythrin and Cy5-streptavidin, which had been entrapped within separate proteoliposome populations. Paired sets of proteoliposomes were prepared with either the complete vacuolar mixed lipids (VML) or with 70% PC/30% PS. Proteoliposomes bore Ypt7p and the 4 SNAREs, each at a 1:1000, 1:3000, or 1:9000 molar ratio to lipid phosphate, as described in the ‘Materials and methods’. For each pair, half the proteoliposomes had 0.3% of its lipid as Marina Blue-PE and bore lumenal Cy5-streptavidin, while the complementary proteoliposomes had 1.5% NBD-PE and bore lumenal biotinylated-phycoerythrin.

It remained possible that some other parameter of reconstitution which we could not measure, such as the <italic>trans</italic>-membrane disposition of each lipid species, might regulate fusion and be influenced by the SNARE levels.

After ATP-dependent priming, vacuoles undergo tethering. The Rab Ypt7p directly binds the oligomeric tethering complex HOPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Seals et al., 2000</xref>). This interaction is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stroupe et al., 2006</xref>) for tethering of vacuolar membranes, and is sufficient for tethering of proteoliposomes of a simple lipid composition such as PC/PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hickey and Wickner, 2010</xref>). It was therefore not surprising that comparable levels of trans-SNARE complex formed in the presence or absence of small headgroup lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), but the need for these particular lipids for the ensuing fusion was unexpected. It has been suggested that fusion occurs immediately and inexorably upon <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complex formation. However, several studies have suggested that fusion is more complex. Brunger and colleagues. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diao et al., 2012</xref>) have shown long kinetic separation between formation of some trans-SNARE complexes and complete membrane fusion for certain spontaneous fusion events (for example, in the absence of calcium) and in the presence of both synaptotagmin and complexin; upon calcium triggering, a burst of fast fusion events were then observed. During yeast vacuole fusion, lumenal compartment mixing occurs many minutes after docking is complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mayer et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, when a single SNARE (Vam7p) is withheld from tethered vacuole clusters, the addition of this SNARE triggers rapid and synchronized completion of docking, as assayed by the acquisition of resistance to added antibody to Ypt7p or to Vam3p, but lumenal compartment mixing only occurs far more slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Merz and Wickner, 2004</xref>). Lipid ligands have been reported to block fusion after docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collins and Wickner, 2007</xref>). We now exploit the fully reconstituted vacuole fusion reaction to show that small-headgroup lipids that are prone to non-bilayer structures play a critical role in the progression of docked, <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE paired proteoliposomes to fusion.</p><p>The essence of membrane fusion is the rearrangement of lipids from closely apposed bilayers. Models of this rearrangement, such as through hemifusion, posit intermediate states with locally crowded lipid headgroups. This headgroup crowding may constitute a substantial portion of the activation energy of the fusion process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chernomordik et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaudin, 2000</xref>). Lipids such as PE, ergosterol, and diacylglycerol would fit into these otherwise crowded regions far better than a cylindrical lipid such as phosphatidylcholine.</p><p>Upon vacuole docking, the proteins and lipids that are required for fusion become highly enriched at a ring-shaped microdomain surrounding the apposed regions of the docked membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fratti et al., 2004</xref>). Although the surface concentrations of proteins required for proteoliposome fusion are higher than those on the vacuole (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), they may be comparable to those in this ring-shaped, fusion-competent vacuole microdomain. Additional studies will be required to precisely determine the physiological concentrations of these proteins and lipids in this microdomain.</p><p>Previous studies of fusion, whether of vacuoles or of other model systems, have indicated a role for the three vacuolar, non-bilayer-prone lipids. Though the effects of disrupting PE biosynthesis in yeast are likely too pleiotropic to allow examination of its effects on vacuole fusion in vivo, PE is required for the fusion of mitotic Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pécheur et al., 2002</xref>). In model studies with recombinant neuronal SNAREs, PE increased the probability of docking but reduced fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Domanska et al., 2010</xref>). These studies differed from those reported here in several crucial aspects: (i) The use of planar lipid bilayers vs highly curved proteoliposomes, (ii) neuronal vs vacuolar SNAREs, (iii) the absence of a Rab and Rab-effector docking system or of an SM protein in the neuronal reconstitution, and (iv) the composition and complexity of lipids in these reconstitutions. Yeast mutants defective in sterol biosynthesis have multiple small vacuoles, indicative of deficient organelle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kato and Wickner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seeley et al., 2002</xref>). The fusion of vacuoles purified from wild-type yeast is blocked by extraction of ergosterol by β-methylcyclodestrin, and fusion can be restored by incubation with cholesterol-loaded β-methylcyclodestrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kato and Wickner, 2001</xref>). Cholesterol has also been shown to be required for Semliki Forest virus fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">White and Helenius, 1980</xref>). Diacylglycerol is also directly implicated in vacuole fusion. Whereas a wild-type yeast strain has one or a few vacuoles, deletion of <italic>PLC1</italic>, encoding a phospholipase C which generates diacylglycerol, causes striking vacuole fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jun et al., 2004</xref>), a hallmark of defective fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wada et al., 1992</xref>). The cell-free fusion of purified vacuoles is blocked by recombinant C1b domain, a DAG ligand, and is stimulated by added Plc1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jun et al., 2004</xref>). Both ergosterol and diacylglycerol become enriched at the fusion microdomain of docked vacuoles, and this enrichment is sensitive to fusion-protein ligands such as Sec17p and an Fab fragment of affinity-purified antibody to Vam3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fratti et al., 2004</xref>). Our current studies with proteoliposomes bearing pure vacuolar proteins and lipids is thus well-grounded in in vivo genetics and morphology as well as cell-free studies of the fusion of the purified organelle.</p><p>It is revealing that high concentrations of SNAREs can at least partially bypass the need for non-bilayer-prone lipids. It is currently unclear whether the sole function of <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE pairs is a close and stable tethering of apposed lipid bilayers, or whether they exert a deforming force on each bilayer to provide the energy for lipid spatial rearrangement into non-bilayer intermediates. Prenyl-anchored SNAREs can support the fusion of vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jun et al., 2007</xref>) and of chemically-defined proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), and this has recently been extended to synaptic fusion in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). These findings suggest that fusion does not depend on force exerted through the formation of continuous α-helices, extending from the SNARE bundle across two <italic>trans</italic>-membrane anchor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McNew et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2007</xref>). How might high levels of <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE pairs be able to bypass the need for the three small headgroup lipids? A single <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE pair may bring flat or spherical membrane bilayers into close apposition without distorting their bilayer structure, while multiple <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE pairs may draw membranes together over a wider region, creating a bend in the bilayer at the edge of the zone of apposition, as seen for docked vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fratti et al., 2004</xref>). Such a bend may substitute for nonbilayer lipids in initiating the lipid rearrangements of fusion.</p><p>Our current working model of fusion is that even single <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE pairs bring membranes into close apposition. The lipid rearrangements for fusion can be driven by the membrane bend induced by multiple <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE pairs, or can occur by the accretion of fusogenic, noncylindrical lipids when the SNARE concentrations are at low, physiological levels. The Vam7p SNARE N-domain has a Phox-homology motif, and has been shown to associate with the <italic>trans</italic>-apposed bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu and Wickner, 2010</xref>) by its affinity for PI(3)P and acidic lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22a">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20a">Karunakaran and Wickner, 2013</xref>) and to bear apolar residues which may insert into the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22a">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, neuronal SNARE-associated synaptotagmin is triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to insert into the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chapman and Davis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>) and may function to bridge bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araç et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). These may also cause bilayer distortions that facilitate fusion; there has not been a direct test of whether nonbilayer-forming lipids contribute to the extraordinary rates of calcium-triggered neuronal fusion. Further tests of this model may rely on the development of assays to measure the physical strain within bilayers, and of reconstituted reactions fusing large proteoliposomes where lipid- and protein-enriched microdomains can be visualized as readily as with vacuoles.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Proteins and reagents</title><p>Lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, except ergosterol was from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), PI(3)P was from Echelon Biosciences (Salt Lake City, UT), and the fluorescent lipids were from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA).

The final assay component concentrations are: 19.5 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 142 mM NaCl, 11 mM KCl, 1.1 mM imidazole, 9.8% glycerol, 3.3 mM sorbitol, 1.44 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.13 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1.1 mM potassium phosphate, 0.17 mM glutathione, 10.7 µM streptavidin, 1.36 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 1.84% bovine serum albumin (defatted), 0.000066% Triton X-100, 0.37 mM lipid from each of the 2 proteoliposome populations, 108 nM Sec17p, 0.55 µM Sec18p, and 0.12 µM HOPS.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Axel Brunger and Jose Rizo.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this work the effect of lipid composition on vacuolar fusion at various SNARE concentrations is studied. It is found that at physiological concentration (for vacuolar SNAREs), there is a very large effect in the presence of small neutral lipids that are thought to disrupt the lipid bilayer (such as PE, DAG, ERG). Upon higher SNARE concentration, the effect is partially compensated. The starting point for these experiments is the vacuolar lipid mix, and then the individual lipid components are varied. Most importantly, a true content mixing assay was used.</p><p>This work shows the critical importance of the nature of particular types of lipids for membrane fusion. Much of the literature on SNARE-dependent membrane fusion has focused on understanding the roles of proteins in inducing and/or regulating fusion, but much less attention has been paid to the lipids and it is clear from studies of other systems that some lipids can be critical for the mechanism of fusion because of their geometry. The authors now have taken advantage of their very extensive characterization of yeast vacuolar fusion and show that fusion requires lipids with small head groups (which favor stalk formation) when using low protein-to-lipid ratios (on the order of 1:5000 or 1:9000). Actually the term low here refers to comparison to what has been commonly used in the literature for reconstitutions, but the authors report in this paper that these protein densities are still comparable or higher than the physiological densities present in vacuoles. The fact that higher SNAREs densities can bypass at least partially the need for the lipids with small head groups is in itself an important finding. It could also suggest different fusion mechanisms or pathways under the different conditions.</p><p>Issues to address:</p><p>1) The Introduction stresses the requirement in vivo for PI3P in addition to DAG and ergosterol, while the experiments concern the role of PE, DAG and ergosterol in liposome fusion. The role of PI3P is not tested, although the authors allude to a role in recruitment of Vam7 protein. This needs to be clarified since it seems like the authors are switching the lipids under consideration between the Introduction and the Results. Is there a need for PE in vivo? Is the role of PI3P only in Vam7 recruitment? It would be desirable to study a mutant Vam7 protein specifically deficient in PI3P binding in order to address this question.</p><p>2) While the authors show that the liposomes made with or without PE, DAG and ergosterol have similar levels of incorporated SNARE proteins, the authors should provide more evidence that these two populations of liposomes are really comparable. Are both populations similar in size? Are the same fractions of SNARE proteins facing out into the media rather than into the lumen?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, a comparison is made for reactions with and without PE, DAG and ergosterol with respect to SNARE complex assembly. What about HOPs and Ypt7p recruitment? What about liposome aggregation, which the authors have shown to be a precursor of fusion? A more complete analysis of these two reactions would be desirable.</p><p>4) The effect of lipid composition has been studied previously with a simple lipid mixing system and neuronal SNAREs (Domanska, Kiessling, Tamm, Biophys J. 99, 2936, 2010). However, these experiments only considered the effect on docking and lipid mixing at a fixed SNARE concentration. Interestingly, in these experiments, PE had a reducing role of docking/lipid mixing. Clearly, the use of a lipid-mixing assay may have masked the effects on true fusion, so that could be one explanation of the difference. A discussion of the Domanska reference would be appropriate.</p><p>5) The results apply to the vacuolar fusion system – for neuronal fusion, the observed SNARE-protein concentration in synaptic vesicles and in active zones is much higher. Nevertheless, the implications of a critical role of PE, DAG, ERG could also apply to the neuronal system since in that case much faster fusion (msec as opposed to min) is required and it is precisely Ca2+ regulated. Some speculations along these lines might be useful.</p><p>6) Although the lipid compositions of vacuoles may have already been well documented elsewhere, it would be helpful to the reader to specifically describe the lipid content of yeast vacuoles so that it can be compared with the standard lipid mixture used in the reconstitutions since the composition of the proteoliposomes is the central theme of this paper. If this standard lipid mixture is an accurate reflection of that found in vacuoles, it would be informative to explicitly make that statement.</p><p>7) The first sentence of the Discussion suggests the possibility that trans SNARE complex formation induces fusion inexorably. While this view is widely held by many people in the field, I think it would worth mentioning alternate views, in particular because work in Axel Brunger's lab has provided very strong evidence for formation of (partial) trans neuronal SNARE complexes between vesicles without fusion (vesicles can be docked through the SNAREs for 30 minutes without complete fusion!).</p><p>8) In the Results section, the text describes a protein-to-lipid ratio of 1:2000, citing <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, but <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> describes 1:1000. I realize that this apparent discrepancy comes from the fact that only about half of the SNAREs are oriented toward the outside of the vesicles, but readers may still be confused about what the 1:2000 ratio described in the text really means.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01879.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The Introduction stresses the requirement</italic> in vivo <italic>for PI3P in addition to DAG and ergosterol, while the experiments concern the role of PE, DAG and ergosterol in liposome fusion.

It would be desirable to study a mutant Vam7 protein specifically deficient in PI3P binding in order to address this question</italic>.</p><p>Since PI(3)P is not a small headgroup lipid, it is not the topic of this paper. Every RPL in this study has PI(3)P; as noted in the Materials &amp; Methods, certain RPLs had small-headgroup lipids omitted, and the amount of PC adjusted accordingly, but PI3P remained constant. We had given too much emphasis to PI3P in the Introduction, causing this confusion; therefore, we've now de-emphasized the recognition between the Vam7p PX domain and PI(3)P in the Introduction, as we and others have published extensively about this.</p><p><italic>2) While the authors show that the liposomes made with or without PE, DAG and ergosterol have similar levels of incorporated SNARE proteins, the authors should provide more evidence that these two populations of liposomes are really comparable. Are both populations similar in size? Are the same fractions of SNARE proteins facing out into the media rather than into the lumen</italic>?</p><p>We have addressed this with 2 new pieces of data, dynamic light scattering (which shows that the presence or absence of small-headgroup lipids only causes a small change in proteoliposome size) and assay of proteinase K inaccessibility (which shows that the similar proportions of Vam3p, Nyv1p, and Ypt7p are accessible to proteinase K in the proteoliposomes whether or not they have the 3 small headgroup lipids).</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>, a comparison is made for reactions with and without PE, DAG and ergosterol with respect to SNARE complex assembly. What about HOPs and Ypt7p recruitment? What about liposome aggregation, which the authors have shown to be a precursor of fusion? A more complete analysis of these two reactions would be desirable</italic>.</p><p>Ypt7p, which is prenylated, is incorporated throughout this paper into every RPL as an integrally bound protein during RPL preparation, rather than being recruited. The presence or absence of small headgroup lipids is shown directly to have no effect on Ypt7 incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As we've shown previously, and now cite again in the presentation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in the Results for added clarity, Ypt7p alone binds HOPS with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Seals et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hickey and Wickner, 2010</xref>). Ypt7p is sufficient on RPLs of any lipid composition, even PC/PS, to allow vigorous clustering by HOPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hickey and Wickner, 2010</xref>). The finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) that the RPLs give comparable trans-SNARE pairing is of course in full accord with them having undergone comparable tethering. Proteoliposomes that are trans-SNARE paired have gone past the Ypt7/HOPS-dependent tethering step.</p><p><italic>4) The effect of lipid composition has been studied previously with a simple lipid mixing system and neuronal SNAREs (Domanska, Kiessling, Tamm, Biophys J. 99, 2936, 2010). However, these experiments only considered the effect on docking and lipid mixing at a fixed SNARE concentration. Interestingly, in these experiments, PE had a reducing role of docking/lipid mixing. Clearly, the use of a lipid-mixing assay may have masked the effects on true fusion, so that could be one explanation of the difference. A discussion of the Domanska reference would be appropriate</italic>.</p><p>This has now been added in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>5) The results apply to the vacuolar fusion system – for neuronal fusion, the observed SNARE-protein concentration in synaptic vesicles and in active zones is much higher. Nevertheless, the implications of a critical role of PE, DAG, ERG could also apply to the neuronal system since in that case much faster fusion (msec as opposed to min) is required and it is precisely Ca2+ regulated. Some speculations along these lines might be useful</italic>.</p><p>This possibility has now been added in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>6) Although the lipid compositions of vacuoles may have already been well documented elsewhere, it would be helpful to the reader to specifically describe the lipid content of yeast vacuoles so that it can be compared with the standard lipid mixture used in the reconstitutions since the composition of the proteoliposomes is the central theme of this paper. If this standard lipid mixture is an accurate reflection of that found in vacuoles, it would be informative to explicitly make that statement</italic>.</p><p>This is now explicitly stated in the 1st paragraph of the Results.</p><p><italic>7) The first sentence of the Discussion suggests the possibility that trans SNARE complex formation induces fusion inexorably. While this view is widely held by many people in the field, I think it would worth mentioning alternate views, in particular because work in Axel Brunger's lab has provided very strong evidence for formation of (partial) trans neuronal SNARE complexes between vesicles without fusion (vesicles can be docked through the SNAREs for 30 minutes without complete fusion!)</italic>.</p><p>Done, as suggested.</p><p><italic>8) In the Results section, the text describes a protein-to-lipid ratio of 1:2000, citing</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>, but</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref> <italic>describes 1:1000. I realize that this apparent discrepancy comes from the fact that only about half of the SNAREs are oriented toward the outside of the vesicles, but readers may still be confused about what the 1:2000 ratio described in the text really means</italic>.</p><p>We've now clarified this in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
