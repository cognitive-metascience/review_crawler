periods of time, during which the high concentration of the p53 family member TAp63α sensitizes them to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. TAp63α is kept in an inactive and exclusively dimeric state but undergoes rapid phosphorylation-induced tetramerization and concomitant activation upon detection of DNA damage. Here we show that the TAp63α dimer is a kinetically trapped state. Activation follows a spring-loaded mechanism not requiring further translation of other cellular factors in oocytes and is associated with unfolding of the inhibitory structure that blocks the tetramerization interface. Using a combination of biophysical methods as well as cell and ovary culture experiments we explain how TAp63α is kept inactive in the absence of DNA damage but causes rapid oocyte elimination in response to a few DNA double strand breaks thereby acting as the key quality control factor in maternal reproduction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13909.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13909.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13909.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The irradiation and chemotherapy drugs that are used to destroy cancer cells also damage healthy cells. Germ cells – from which egg cells and sperm cells develop – are particularly vulnerable as they contain sensitive quality control mechanisms that kill any cell that contain damaged DNA. Consequently, after surviving cancer many patients are confronted with infertility.</p><p>A protein called p63, which is closely related to another protein that suppresses the formation of tumors, plays an essential role in detecting and responding to DNA damage. In immature egg cells (also known as oocytes), p63 mostly exists in an inactive form. The protein then switches to an active form when DNA damage is detected to trigger the process of cell self-destruction.</p><p>Now, Coutandin, Osterburg et al. have performed a range of biochemical, biophysical and cell culture experiments to study how p63 is kept in its inactive form in the oocytes of mice. The experiments showed that in the inactive form, the two ends of the protein form a sheet that closes a key site on the protein and prevents it from changing into its active form. However, this closed form can be thought of as being like a spring-loaded trap – it doesn’t take much energy to spring the trap and open the protein into its active form. Once this change has occurred, it is irreversible.</p><p>Coutandin, Osterburg et al. also found that the oocytes of mice already contain all the proteins necessary to activate p63. This means that once the switch to the active form is triggered there is no delay waiting for other proteins to be made, which makes oocytes extremely sensitive to DNA damage. Further work is now needed to investigate the exact molecular mechanisms behind the activation of p63.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13909.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13909.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>kinetically trapped state</kwd><kwd>p63</kwd><kwd>quality control</kwd><kwd>oocytes</kwd><kwd>spring-loaded activation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coutandin</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Osterburg</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name><name><surname>Srivastav</surname><given-names>Ratnesh Kumar</given-names></name><name><surname>Sumyk</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name><name><surname>Kehrloesser</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name><name><surname>Gebel</surname><given-names>Jakob</given-names></name><name><surname>Tuppi</surname><given-names>Marcel</given-names></name><name><surname>Schäfer</surname><given-names>Birgit</given-names></name><name><surname>Müller-Kuller</surname><given-names>Uta</given-names></name><name><surname>Grez</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Dötsch</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salah</surname><given-names>Eidarus</given-names></name><name><surname>Mathea</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name><name><surname>Knapp</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>p63 uses an intricate network of domain-domain interactions to control its function in long-term quality maintenance of resting oocytes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The p53 protein family with its three members p53, p63 and p73 plays very important roles in the surveillance of genetic and cellular stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levine et al., 2011</xref>). Probably the most ancient function of this family is the maintenance of genetic quality in germ cells since even short lived eukaryotic animals express a p63-like protein in their germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ollmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derry et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ou et al., 2007</xref>). In mammals, up to 10 diverse p63 isoforms exist with the longest one, TAp63α, being highly expressed in primary oocytes that are arrested in prophase of meiosis I. After homologous recombination, oocytes are kept in this dictyate arrest phase until they are recruited for ovulation, a period that can take decades in humans. Once oocytes reenter the cell cycle, expression of TAp63α is lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suh et al., 2006</xref>). Since p63 can initiate apoptosis the high expression level of TAp63α in oocytes requires that its activity is tightly regulated. Recently we could show that TAp63α assembles into a closed and only dimeric conformation in which the protein is inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deutsch et al., 2011</xref>). Detection of DNA damage leads to activation of p63 triggered by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolcun-Filas et al., 2014</xref>) that results in the formation of open tetramers with a twentyfold higher DNA binding affinity and the induction of apoptosis.</p><p>This p63-based quality control is unique to oocytes, making them very sensitive to DNA damage. Irradiation with 0.45 Gy is sufficient to eliminate all p63-expressing oocytes in mice while all surrounding cells of the ovaries survive. To understand the mechanism of inhibition and activation we have started to characterize the structural requirements for the formation of the closed and dimeric state of TAp63α. In previous experiments we have shown that the very C-terminus contains a transactivation inhibitory domain (TID) that is of central importance for creating the closed dimeric state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Straub et al., 2010</xref>). We have suggested a model in which both the C-terminal TID and the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) interact with the central tetramerization domain (TD) thereby preventing the formation of tetramers. This central TD is a dimer of dimers suggesting that blocking the interface by which two dimers form a tetramer is the most likely mechanism of inhibition. In the past we have identified mutations in all three domains – TAD, TD and TID – that break the inhibitory mechanism, establishing that at least these three domains are involved in this process. In the absence of a high resolution structure we have now used systematic alanine scanning and charge swap mutagenesis in combination with SAXS (small angle X-ray scattering) experiments to build a model of the closed and dimeric complex. In addition, we show that the inhibited conformation is a kinetically trapped state and that the oocyte contains all factors necessary to activate p63 without requirement of further protein expression. Together our data show that activation of TAp63α follows a spring-loaded mechanism and explains why oocytes are far more sensitive to DNA damage than the surrounding follicular cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Defining the minimal sequence required for formation of the closed dimeric conformation</title><p>TAp63α contains three folded domains, the DNA binding domain (DBD), the tetramerization domain (TD) and the SAM domain that are linked by unstructured regions. NMR experiments with a tetrameric construct containing all three folded domains showed that these domains behave independently as pearls on a string (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). All sequences outside of these folded domains are not structured in isolation but may be folded when interacting with other segments of the protein as part of the inhibitory mechanism. To identify the exact sequence elements required to form the closed state, we systematically deleted sequences in these linker regions. Deletion of sequences crucial for the formation of the closed state results in the formation of an open conformation. Previously we have shown that the open state can be detected by a conformation sensitive pull-down experiment: tetrameric mutants with an intact TAD can be pulled down with a GST-TID construct (569–616) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Straub et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, mutants that cannot be pulled down are assumed to adopt the closed dimeric state. After several rounds of deletion mutagenesis, a minimal dimeric construct was obtained. Size exclusion chromatography combined with multi angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) confirmed that this minimal construct (TAp63α<sub>min</sub>) comprising deletions Δ(1–9; 64–119; 417–453; 460–505; 571–593; 615–641) is a stable dimer in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition, deletion of amino acids 322–342 between DBD and TD does not disrupt the dimeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), but results in quite low expression levels in E. coli. For the experiments described below we have, therefore, used either TAp63α<sub>min</sub>, wild type TAp63α or a slightly shortened version TAp63α<sub>(10–614)</sub> lacking unstructured sequences in the N- and C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13909.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mapping of structurally important regions within dimeric TAp63α.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain organization of TAp63α: transactivation domain (TAD), DNA binding domain (DBD), tetramerization domain (TD), sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, transactivation inhibitory domain (TID).

To investigate whether these domains participate in the stabilization of the closed conformation we deleted each domain separately in TAp63α<sub>(10–614)</sub> and performed pull-down experiments with GST-TID. Interestingly, deletion of the SAM domain did not show any significant pull-down and size exclusion chromatography confirmed the formation of closed dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). On the contrary, deletion of the DBD resulted in a strong pull-down signal suggesting an open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Initially we expected the DBD to participate in essential domain-domain contacts that stabilize the closed conformation and therefore conducted an extensive mutagenesis screen of surface residues of the DBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, none of the mutants formed tetramers making this hypothesis unlikely. Alternatively, the DBD may be important for geometric reasons, acting as a spacer between TAD and TD. To test this hypothesis, we replaced the DBD by superfolder GFP (sfGFP) which is very stable and of similar size as the DBD. SEC analysis of this chimeric protein expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) suggested that it adopts a closed dimeric conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, mutations F16A W20A L23A within the TAD and F605A T606A L608A within the TID resulted in the formation of a tetrameric state similar to experiments with wild type TAp63α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Straub et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C and E</xref>). Similarly, replacement of the DBD by MBP enables the formation of a closed dimeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4F</xref>). These results suggest that the DBD does not participate in essential domain-domain interactions necessary to form the dimeric state and that the closed dimeric state of TAp63α is formed by interaction of the N-terminal TAD, the central TD and the C-terminal TID. Nonetheless, constructs that only contain these three domains did not form dimers but aggregated, suggesting that the DBD or a domain of similar size is necessary for structural reasons or for the folding process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mapping of the TAD-TD-TID interaction</title><p>To build a first model of the closed state we used secondary structure prediction programs to identify potential secondary structure elements within the TAD and TID and alanine scanning in combination with SEC analysis to experimentally verify these predictions. The theoretical analysis predicted the existence of an α-helix in the TA1 region, two β-strands in the TA2A and TA2B regions of the TAD and a β-strand in the TID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Alanine scanning of the TA1 confirmed that only mutations of F16, W20 and L23 that have previously been identified as crucial for binding of the TA1 to the TD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deutsch et al., 2011</xref>), disrupted the closed conformation while mutations on the three remaining faces of the hypothetical helix had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>To test the existence of the various β-sheets we mutated all amino acids on one side of each predicted β-strand to alanine (i, i+2, i+4). While mutations on both faces of the presumed first beta-strand (TA2A) did not affect the oligomeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6B</xref>), the mutations I50A I52A M54A located on one face of the predicted TA2B β-strand disrupted the dimeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Alanine scanning of the TID showed that mutations on both sides of the presumed β-strand disrupt the dimeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7B</xref>).</p><p>Stabilizing the dimeric state is most likely achieved by blocking the tetramerization interface of the TD and we also used alanine scanning of the TD to identify essential residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). Since mutations in the tetramerization interface that destabilize the dimeric state most likely also inhibit the formation of the tetramer, we did not use SEC analysis. Previously, we have shown that an open dimeric state is transcriptionally more active than the closed dimeric state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deutsch et al., 2011</xref>). Mutating the hydrophobic amino acids I378, L382 and M385 alongside the second half of the α-helix of the TD led to high transcriptional activity as expected for an open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8).</xref></p><p>We also used the measurement of the transcriptional activity as well as pull-down experiments with GST-TID to validate the results of our SEC analysis with the different alanine mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). As expected, all mutants that behaved like open and tetrameric conformations showed high transcriptional activity. The only exception was the F16A W20A L23A mutant since these mutations compromise the function of the TAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TA2B and TID form a β-sheet</title><p>The experiments described above support the prediction that TA2B and TID form regular secondary structure elements, most likely β-strands. In the closed dimer, two TID and two TA2B sequences must be involved in the stabilization of the closed state. For symmetry reasons, the β-strands probably adopt an antiparallel orientation. Based on the results of the alanine scanning experiments we speculated that the two TID strands form the inner pair since mutations on both faces of the predicted β-sheet show strong effects. Further, we propose that the two TA2B strands form the two outer strands of a four stranded anti-parallel β-sheet which might be further extended by β-strands contributed by the TA2A segment. Such an arrangement would create one hydrophobic surface formed by I50/I52/M54 of TA2B and V603/F605/L607 of TID and a hydrophilic surface with residues E51/D55 of TA2B and R604/R608 of TID. The arrangement shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> brings charged amino acids on neighboring strands in close proximity, making it possible to test this hypothetical model by charge change and charge swap mutagenesis. Exchanging R604 and R608 in the TID to glutamic acids disrupted the dimeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In our model these mutants created in combination with the negative charges on the TA2B strands a cluster of negatively charged amino acids that destabilized the dimer. Additional charge reversal of E51R and D55R in TA2B resulted in the formation of a stable dimer. Similarly, the R595E and R598E mutants are open tetramers and the additional charge reversal of D61R, D63R in TA2B rescued the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To refine our model and to identify the register of the proposed β-strands we used further pairwise charge swap mutations. The results of these experiments that all support our structural model are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. Since the predicted β-sheet has one hydrophobic face and the interface used by the TD to form tetramers is also hydrophobic, we propose that the β-sheet covers the tetramerization interface of the TD, thus inhibiting the formation of tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In addition, the TA1 helix binds to the TD as well, further stabilizing the closed and compact conformation.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13909.014</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TA2B and TID form an anti-parallel β-sheet with a polar and a hydrophobic face.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain organization of TAp63α and secondary structure elements of TAD and TID. (<bold>B</bold>) Proposed interaction of TA2 and TID through β-sheet formation.

In oocytes this transition is triggered by phosphorylation. In principle phosphorylation could provide a new interface contributing interactions that stabilize the tetrameric state, making it thermodynamically more stable while the dimeric state would be thermodynamically favored in the absence of phosphorylation. However, the observation that dephosphorylation of the open tetrameric state using λ-phosphatase does not result in converting TAp63α back to a dimer argues against this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deutsch et al., 2011</xref>). An alternative explanation would be that the tetrameric state is always the thermodynamically most stable one and the dimeric state is a kinetically trapped conformation. Phosphorylation would then function as a trigger to overcome a kinetic barrier and convert p63 into the thermodynamically preferred tetramer. Such spring-loaded mechanisms have been observed for example in the activation of influenza hemagglutinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carr and Kim, 1993</xref>). Characteristic for this type of activation mechanism is that perturbing the kinetically trapped conformation by moderate amounts of denaturants, changes in pH or an increase in temperature initiates the transition to the thermodynamically more stable conformation even without the natural trigger. Since the stability towards chemical denaturants of the three folded domains of TAp63α is quite high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sathyamurthy et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) we hypothesized that using low to moderate amounts of urea might disrupt the inhibitory structure, thus triggering the formation of the tetramer without affecting the folding of the DBD, the SAM or the TD. To investigate if activation of TAp63α follows a spring-loaded mechanism we equilibrated a SEC column with different concentrations of urea, incubated TAp63α<sub>min</sub> in buffer containing the same urea concentration and analyzed the percentage of dimer and tetramer. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows that a concentration of 1.75 M urea leads to an approximately 1:1 ratio of dimer and tetramer and at concentrations above 3 M no dimer was detected.

To test this hypothesis, we separated the dimer and the tetramer fraction at a urea concentration of 1.75 M on the SEC column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and dialyzed both fractions against buffer without urea. Re-analysis of these samples by SEC revealed that the dimeric fraction remained dimeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and the tetrameric fraction tetrameric with a tendency to aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These experiments strongly suggest that the dimeric state of TAp63α is a kinetically trapped conformation that is activated by a spring-loaded mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Formation of the TAp63α dimer can only be prevented co-translationally</title><p>A spring-loaded activation requires that the protein is trapped in a high energy state during protein synthesis. From p53 it is known that this protein forms dimers co-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nicholls et al., 2002</xref>), which in the case of TAp63α would enable the protein to fold into its closed conformation. To probe this hypothesis, we expressed TAp63α in RRL in the presence or absence of a high concentration (20 µM) of the isolated TD of p73. The rationale behind this experiment was that a high concentration of a domain that can interact with the TD of TAp63α during the translation would result in the formation of open tetramers. The TD of p73 was used since the isolated p63 and p73 TDs form hetero-tetramers that are thermodynamically even more stable than homo-tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coutandin et al., 2009</xref>). As a control we stopped the translation of TAp63α in RRL by adding cycloheximide (CHX) and then added the p73 TD to the same concentration as before and incubated for the same amount of time. Interaction between TAp63α and the p73 TD was monitored by pull-down experiments via the His-tag of the p73 TD. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, expression in the presence of the p73 TD resulted in a strong pull-down while incubation post-translationally showed virtually no interaction with the p73 TD, even at elevated temperatures of 37<sup>o</sup>C. Replacing TAp63α in these experiments with open and tetrameric ΔNp63α or a tetrameric mutant TAp63α R604E R608E resulted in strong pull-downs both in the co-translational as well as in the post-translational setup. Performing the same experiments with a mutated TD that is not capable of forming hetero-tetramers showed no interaction. These results suggested that the kinetically trapped state of TAp63α is formed during or immediately after protein synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The TAD defines the height of the kinetic barrier of trapped TAp63α</title><p>Oocytes survive the high concentration of TAp63α only when the inactivation mechanism is very effective. However, thermodynamics predicts that the closed conformation is always in equilibrium with more open conformations in which the inhibitory network of the TAD, TD and TID is at least partially broken. If during this partial unfolding no thermodynamically more stable tetramer is formed the dimer might be able to refold in its closed conformation. To obtain an estimation of the rate of unfolding of the TID and of the TAD we introduced TEV protease cleavage sites either C-terminal to the TAD or N-terminal to the TID. The rationale of this experiment was that after proteolytic cleavage the cleaved peptides (either the TAD or the TID) would diffuse away as soon as the p63 adopts an open conformation, therefore not allowing the protein to refold into its compact dimeric state and forcing it to form open tetramers. From this experiment the off rate of the corresponding domain can be estimated and thus the overall stability of the inhibitory lock mechanism. We incubated RRL expressed TAp63α with TEV protease for 15 min at 37°C which was sufficient to obtain close to 100% cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The cleaved protein was then analyzed either immediately via SEC or further incubated for up to 12 hr at 37<sup>o</sup>C. Interestingly, cleavage near the TAD leads to the immediate formation of tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Unlike the TAD, the TID was bound with remarkable stability and cleaved p63 showed no tendency to assemble into tetramers even after long incubation times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). These results demonstrated that the N-terminus is the least stable part involved in keeping TAp63α dimeric and that its off rate determines the overall stability of the inhibited conformation. In addition, this interpretation further supports our model assuming that the TID forms the core of the central β-sheet.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13909.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Unlike TID, secession of TAD induces the transformation of dimeric TAp63α to tetramers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cleavage site is introduced C-terminal to the TAD (between residues 66 and 67) allowing its secession by TEV protease cleavage.

Such a mechanism allows the cell to build an apoptotic switch with a sharp transition between survival and cell death. Indeed, measurements of the dose dependence of oocyte death have shown such a sharp transition with fewer than 10 double strand breaks per cell leading to oocyte death. To make such a system efficient the cell would need to be able to activate TAp63α fast which is best achieved when the activation machinery, i.e. the kinases required are already present and do not have to be expressed first. To investigate if oocytes have established such a pre-existing machinery, we harvested ovaries from eight day old mice and γ-irradiated them with or without prior incubation with cycloheximide.

To test whether the treatment with cycloheximide affects the transcriptional activity of TAp63α we used qPCR to detect mRNA levels of the three p63 targets p21, Puma and Mdm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). As a control we used the oocyte specific marker Msy2. The data showed that both with and without cycloheximide treatment significant induction of the target genes occurred while the level of Msy2 was unaffected. We could not detect the presence of p53 before or eight hours after irradiation by immunohistochemistry, suggesting that p53 is not involved in the apoptosis of oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This interpretation is also consistent with the observation that oocytes only from the TAp63 but not the p53 knock out mouse are protected from irradiation induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suh et al., 2006</xref>). For p73 we could detect a weak, diffuse staining consistent with earlier reports of low levels of cytoplasmic p73 in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Livera et al., 2008</xref>). The very low level compared to p63 and the strong induction of target genes such as PUMA or p21 in the presence of the translational inhibitor cycloheximide, however, argue against a significant role of p73 for the irradiation induced cell death of oocytes.</p><p>Our results suggest that oocytes contain all kinases necessary to initiate tetramerization of TAp63α and all factors essential for p63’s transcriptional function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). One of the kinases that has been identified in the activation process is Chk2 that phosphorylates TAp63α on Ser 582 (numbering according to the TA-isoform of p63) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolcun-Filas et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate if phosphorylation by Chk2 is required for tetramerization we treated mouse ovaries with increasing amounts of the Chk2 inhibitor II BML-277 and irradiated them with a dose of 1.5 Gy two hours after adding the inhibitor. At a concentration of 25 µM phosphorylation of TAp63α was almost completely suppressed and almost no tetramer was formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These data confirm the essential role of Chk2 in the activation process and demonstrate that phosphorylation by Chk2 is also a prerequisite for the formation of tetramers. Interestingly, these data also show that activation of TAp63α leads to a very significant drop of the intracellular concentration and inhibition of the activation by the Chk2 inhibitor to a preservation of the original level. This effect is due to fast proteasomal degradation of activated TAp63α and is consistent with other observations showing that the cellular concentration of active isoforms of p63 is low while inactive isoforms can accumulate to high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serber et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, it has been shown that the N-terminal TAD is involved in this degradation process and that degradation is linked to DNA-binding competent and transactivating p63 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ying et al., 2005</xref>). This observation is also consistent with our model in which the TAD is involved in the formation of the inhibitory lock structure that covers the tetramerizatoin interface and is therefore protected from ubiquitination. After the formation of the open and active state, however, the TAD is accessible, leading to fast degradation. This competition between activation and degradation probably constitutes an intracellular threshold that protect oocytes from apoptosis by low levels of activated TAp63α.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13909.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Spring-loaded activation mechanism of TAp63α on the molecular and cellular level.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic energy landscape of TAp63α.

In humans the approximately seven million oocytes that are created during embryogenesis are diminished to one to two million at the time of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tilly, 2001</xref>). A large drop in numbers is also seen for mouse oocytes. Of the original roughly 25,000 cells only 10,000 remain at the time of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Giacomo et al., 2005</xref>). During the late embryonic stage, the sensitivity of oocytes to DNA double strand breaks changes dramatically. While oocytes in the leptotene stage of prophase I (around E14) tolerate hundreds of Spo11 induced double strand breaks as part of the process of homologous recombination, postnatal oocytes are killed by fewer than 10 DNA double strand breaks per cell. This dramatic shift in sensitivity is correlated with the expression of TAp63α which starts to get expressed in the diplotene stage beginning around E18.5 when chromosomes have been repaired after homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Livera et al., 2008</xref>). Most likely, the p63 system developed as a safeguard to ensure that cells that still contain chromosome damage do not survive. The finding that the p63 expression level is kept high during the long dictyate arrest in mammals, however, shows that p63 is not only used as a short term quality control check point but also as a factor that guarantees the long term genetic stability of germ cells. In particular, this long term quality control function requires a tightly controlled activity of p63. A basal activity that is too high would lead to premature loss of the oocyte pool and ovary failure while a low activity bears the risk that oocytes acquire a high level of chromosomal defects. Our extensive mutagenesis study and biophysical characterization now provides a first model how interaction of N-terminal and C-terminal sequences blocks the tetramerization interface of the TD and therefore prevents tetramerization.</p><p>Our biochemical analysis has also revealed that neither the SAM domain nor the DBD are essential for formation of the closed state. However, unlike the SAM domain the DBD cannot be completely removed but must be replaced with a domain of similar size. At the same time, the ASPP2 binding assays in combination with the SAXS analysis predicts that the DBD has a defined orientation within the dimeric structure which makes the DNA binding interface inaccessible. This orientation, however, seems to be stabilized by interactions that are not essential for the formation of the core inhibitory structure consisting of the TAD, TD and TID. At the same time, this finding explains why both in cells as well as in in vitro fluorescence anisotropy measurements the DNA binding affinity of TAp63α is roughly 20-fold lower than the affinity of open and tetrameric isoforms or mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deutsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suh et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in the SAM domain as well as in the TID cause the Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome (AEC) syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McGrath et al., 2001</xref>). Two mutations identified in human patients, R598L and D601V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rinne et al., 2009</xref>), are located in a region of the TID that is responsible for stabilizing the dimeric state. According to our model both R598 and D601 are involved in charge-charge interactions with the TA2B β-strand and their mutation likely destabilizes the closed dimeric state which might cause in addition to the severe skin phenotype of the patients further ovary related problems. Mutations found in other domains of p63 such as the DBD that cause ectrodactyly–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft (EEC) syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Celli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kouwenhoven et al., 2015</xref>) might also affect the stability of the closed dimer in oocytes.</p><p>While effective inhibition is a prerequisite for a stable long term quality control with a minimal protein turnover rate, an effective activation mechanism is also of paramount importance. Our results show that the closed conformation of TAp63α is a metastable state and that activation follows a spring-loaded mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In oocytes, phosphorylation is used as the natural trigger to initiate the transition from the closed dimeric state to the thermodynamically more stable tetrameric state. Once the active tetramer is formed, the phosphate groups can be removed without affecting the oligomeric state of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deutsch et al., 2011</xref>). Spring loaded activation mechanisms are known from other proteins as well. One prominent example is the Influenza virus hemagglutinin A (HA). This membrane protein is trapped in a metastable native pre-fusion state in which the fusion peptide is buried inside the trimeric structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carr and Kim, 1993</xref>). Following endocytosis of the virus and a pH drop in the endosome, the protein changes its conformation resulting in the exposure of the fusion peptides that are subsequently inserted into the host membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). While the drop in pH is the natural trigger, activation can also be initiated by high temperatures or urea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carr et al., 1997</xref>). Another example is α-lytic protease, a secreted serine protease that is expressed with an N-terminal pro-region that catalyzes folding from a stable molten globule-like intermediate. Proteolytic degradation of the pro-region results in release of the native and active protease, which is thermodynamically less stable than the partially unfolded state but remains folded due to a large barrier to unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sohl et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker, 1998</xref>).</p><p>The kinetically trapped state of dimeric TAp63α raises the question how and when this state is formed during protein synthesis. Interestingly, it was shown that p53 forms dimers co-translationally and tetramers post-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nicholls et al., 2002</xref>). Our expression experiments in the presence of high concentrations of the p73 TD in principle support a co-translational folding of TAp63α. However, our deletion mutagenesis also implicates that the last amino acid of TAp63α<sub>min</sub>, P614, has to emerge from the ribosomal exit tunnel before the closed dimeric state can be formed. As a model we propose that open dimers form co-translationally via the TD that acts as the interaction platform for the TAD and the TID to fold into the trapped conformation after completion of translation. The exact mechanism of folding and a potential role for chaperones remains to be investigated.</p><p>Not only the metastable state of TAp63α sensitizes oocytes for DNA damage induced cell death, the entire machinery that detects DNA damage and activates TAp63α is present in resting oocytes without the need for further protein expression. So far, ATM/ATR as upstream kinases and Chk2 as a direct phosphorylating kinase have been shown to be involved in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolcun-Filas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Other factors might contribute as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gonfloni et al., 2009</xref>) in stabilizing the tetrameric state and forming active transcriptional complexes on promotor sites. The special metabolic state that oocytes reside in during dictyate arrest requires them to express a limited number of genes, essential for keeping the cells stable. Proteins involved in the surveillance of DNA damage as well as transmitting the signal to the central integrator, p63, are part of this cellular repertoire. Quality control in oocytes by TAp63α is therefore based on a spring-loaded activation mechanism on the molecular and the cellular level.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification in E. coli</title><p>TAp63α was codon-optimized for expression in E. coli and ordered from Genscript (Piscataway, NJ, USA).

The output from an Agilent HPLC was connected to an in-vacuum quartz flow cell. The SAXS detector was triggered by the 280 nm UV sensor in the Agilent HPLC, and allowed the collection of data in 1 s time bins across the peak of interest. A Shodex KW404 column was utilised for these experiments. At the end of each experimental run, SAXS data were integrated using beamline software and the background subtracted using running buffer. The integration procedure ensured that only SAXS data from the peak of interest were abstracted and subjected to further analysis. Data were inspected for radiation damage and aggregation by inspection of Guinier plots. This method ensured that SAXS data were unperturbed by any other oligomers which may have formed or been present in the analysis solution.</p><p>The beamline was also used to collect data in batch mode, whereby protein and corresponding buffer solutions were exposed to the beam using an Arinax (Grenoble, France) BioSAXS automated sample changer robot, consisting of temperature controlled storage and exposure units. The exposure unit contained a 1.6 mm diameter quartz capillary in which the samples were illuminated with the x-ray beam; the exposure unit temperature was set to 15°C. The sample capillary was held in vacuum and subjected to a cleaning cycle between each measurement. Samples were stored in 96 well plates at 5°C. A Pilatus 2M two-dimensional detector was used to collect 10 frame exposures of 10 s from each sample and the corresponding buffer. The detector was placed at 3.9 m from the sample, giving a useful q-range of 0.008 Å<sup>-1</sup> &lt; 0.4 Å<sup>-1</sup>, where q = 4π sin θ / λ, 2θ is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength, which was set to 1 Å. Two dimensional data reduction consisted of normalization for beam current and sample transmission, radial sector integration, background buffer subtraction and averaging. Each frame was inspected for the presence of radiation induced protein damage; if this was found to be the case, the frames were not reduced and processed. Further data analysis, such as scaling, merging and Guinier analysis were performed in Scatter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forster et al., 2010</xref>). Three concentrations were measured of each mutant with each experimental data frame being inspected for signs of radiation damage. Frames which appeared to demonstrate radiation damage were excluded from averaging.</p><p>Ab-initio shape reconstruction of the wild type was performed by averaging and filtering 13 runs of DAMMIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franke and Svergun, 2009</xref>), with a final refinement in DAMMIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Svergun, 1999</xref>), utilizing slow mode. The wild type was found to have R<sub>g</sub> of 38.6 Å, with D<sub>max</sub> of 132 Å. λ-cro-TAp63α<sub>min</sub> was analyzed using MONSA, allowing a simultaneous bead modelling from the wild type and the N-terminal fusion. A relative volume difference for MONSA was derived from Porod analysis of the wild type and derivative scattering curves.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Secondary structure prediction</title><p>Secondary structure and disorder were predicted with Phyre2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>) and the Protein Crystal Structure Propensity Prediction Server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Price II et al., 2009</xref>) which uses PredictProtein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rost et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>ASPP2 was a gift from Xin Lu, Oxford.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors report, using a nice experimental model, that activation of the TAp63 transcription factor leads to tetramerization that follows a spring-loaded mechanism in the absence of any translation of other cellular factors in oocytes and is associated with unfolding of the inhibitory structure that blocks the tetramerization interface. This is highly important, as the mechanism of activation of its more famous family member p53 is totally different. The consequences of this mechanism are extremely important to elucidate how quality control of oocytes is achieved. The data presented are of excellent quality and expand the area of TAp63 in the quality control of oocytes. Indeed, the detailed analysis of TAp63 structural analysis at the molecular level represents relevant new insight on reproductive biology as well as in understanding the mechanism of p63 regulation, as compared for example to p53. Consequently, this is a very important, highly interesting and solid study investigating the consequences of loss of p63, or its genetic mutations at the structural level.</p><p>However, the reviewers have a number of concerns about some of the data and its interpretation. Overall, the reviewers agreed to encourage resubmission of a revised manuscript addressing these concerns.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> the argument that p63 activation is post translationally regulated by phosphorylation is not substantiated by the data. The authors present an attractive model for activation of TAp63α upon DNA damage in oocytes. This is supported by demonstration of TAp63 tetramer formation and induction of p63 target gene expression (p21, Puma, Mdm2) in irradiated murine oocytes. However, this model is incomplete without data showing that TAp63 phosphorylation indeed triggers tetramerization and activation. The reviewers propose a number of experiments to address this issue. First, treatment of sample lysates with a phosphatase to show that the migration differences post-irradiation is indeed due to phosphorylation. It is possible that the differences in mobility are due to some other post-translational modification. Second, if, as they propose in their discussion, ATM or CHECK2 are putative culprits in activating TAp63, this needs to be demonstrated in some fashion, either via genetic or pharmacological inactivation of these kinases. This could also be tested in vitro by adding relevant kinases, i.e. ATM and/or CHEK2. In addition, specific phosphorylation sites in TAp63α could be mutated and the effect on tetramerization could be examined in vitro and in oocytes. This type of data would strengthen the manuscript considerably.</p><p>2) In the subsection “Defining the minimal sequence required for formation of the closed dimeric conformation”, the authors refer to three different constructs: TAp63α<sub>min</sub>, wild type TAp63α, and a slightly shortened version TAp63α<sub>(10-614)</sub>.

This is apparent both on the native gel (B) and the denaturing SDS gel (C). Thus, it seems like the formation of tetramers is associated with a dramatic reduction in TAp63 protein levels. This is not discussed. What is the reason for the much lower levels of TAp63 tetramers? p63 target genes are induced in irradiated oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

We had provided such evidence already in the Cell paper (Deutsch et al., 2011). There we have treated oocyte lysates after irradiation showing both tetramerization as well as a shift on an SDS gel with λ-phosphatase. Despite the complete removal of the shift on the SDS gel the gel filtration profile of the now non-phosphorylated TAp63α remains virtually the same, indicating that 1) the shift is indeed due to phosphorylation and 2) that phosphorylation is only the trigger to induce the change from a dimeric to a tetrameric state, supporting our analysis that the dimeric state is a high energy kinetically trapped one. To make this more clear we have added the citation of our Cell paper to the section in which we have mentioned these experiments in the original version of the manuscript (“The dimeric conformation of TAp63α constitutes a kinetically trapped state”) and have added a few sentences in the Discussion part.</p><p>In addition, the reviewers asked us to prove that phosphorylation triggers activation and tetramerization. Activation through phosphorylation by Chk2 has been shown in the paper by Bolcun-Filas et al. (Science 2014) that we cite several times. They had, however, not linked activation to tetramerization. To make this link we have added experimental results to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> that show that addition of 25 µM of a Chk2 inhibitor results in the suppression of phosphorylation and tetramerization. Furthermore, these experiments demonstrate that inhibiting the activation of TAp63α also results in stabilization of the protein. This is consistent with earlier investigations that had shown a link between proteasomal degradation and active DNA binding and transactivation. The observation that inhibition of activation results in higher cellular protein levels of TAp63α also supports our model that in the inhibited state the TAD is not accessible and only the open state can be degraded fast. We discuss all of this in a new paragraph at the end of the Results section.</p><p> <italic>2) In the subsection “Defining the minimal sequence required for formation of the closed dimeric conformation”, the authors refer to three different constructs: TAp63α<sub>min</sub>, wild type TAp63α, and a slightly shortened version TAp63α<sub>(10-614)</sub>.

Are p53 and/or p73 expressed in these cells upon DNA damage? Did the authors exclude the possibility that the observed induction of target genes is due to activation of p53 or p73?</italic> The reviewers asked about the reduced cellular levels of TAp63α following activation. As explained above this is due to fast proteasomal degradation of active p63 (see response to question #1). We have also investigated if p53 or p73 can be detected before or after irradiation in oocytes. Using immunohistochemistry, we have not been able to detect p53 and only a weak and diffuse staining for p73. The much higher concentration of p63 together with the fact that significant induction of target genes is achieved in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (preventing an increase of the cellular content of p73 through transcription by p63) strongly argues that the transcriptional effects seen are due to p63. We describe these results in the last paragraph of the Results section and provide the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) It would be important to measure caspase activation in response to ectopic p63 expression in SAOS cells using the p63 mutants.</italic></p><p>We have tried to show caspase activation in response to ectopic expression of activated p63 mutants in different cell lines (SAOS, H1299, SUM159) but were unable to detect apoptosis in these cell lines (no cleaved PARP or activated caspase-3). This might be due to effective mechanisms of these cancer cell lines to suppress apoptosis or that additionally DNA damage is necessary to activate the apoptotic program.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13909.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Caspase assay.</title><p>H1299 (<bold>A</bold>), SUM159 (<bold>B</bold>) and SAOS2 (<bold>C</bold>) cells were transfected with TAp63α mutants.
