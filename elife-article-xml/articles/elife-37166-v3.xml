hand is arduous and error-prone. Organism-handling robots could revolutionize large-scale experiments in the way that liquid-handling robots accelerated molecular biology. We developed a modular automated platform for large-scale experiments (MAPLE), an organism-handling robot capable of conducting lab tasks and experiments, and then deployed it to conduct common experiments in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Physarum polycephalum</italic>, <italic>Bombus impatiens</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Focusing on fruit flies, we developed a suite of experimental modules that permitted the automated collection of virgin females and execution of an intricate and laborious social behavior experiment. We discovered that (1) pairs of flies exhibit persistent idiosyncrasies in social behavior, which (2) require olfaction and vision, and (3) social interaction network structure is stable over days. These diverse examples demonstrate MAPLE’s versatility for automating experimental biology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37166.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Biological research can, at times, be mind-numbingly tedious: scientists often have to do the same experiment over and over on many different samples. When working with animals such as fruit flies, this means researchers have to physically handle large numbers of specimens, selecting certain individuals or moving them from one container to another to perform the study. This represents a serious bottleneck that slows down discovery.</p><p>Automation represents an obvious solution to this issue. In fact, it has already revolutionized fields like molecular biology, where robots can handle the liquids required for the experiments. Yet, it is not so easy to automate tasks that involve animals larger than a millimeter. To fill that gap, Alisch et al. have developed a robotic system called Modular Automated Platform for Large-scale Experiments (MAPLE) that can manipulate fruit flies and other small organisms.</p><p>Using gentle vacuum, MAPLE can pick up individual flies to move them from one compartment to another. These areas could be places where the insects grow or where experimental measurements are automatically gathered. Putting the robot to work, Alisch et al. used MAPLE to collect virgin female flies for genetic experiments, a common task in fruit flies laboratories. The system was also configured to load flies into arenas where their behavior could be measured. Finally, MAPLE assisted with an experiment that involved tracking the interactions of known individuals to examine if the flies exhibited social networks, and if those networks were stable. This logistically complicated experiment would have been difficult to run without the help of an automated system. Alisch et al. also show that the robot can be adjusted to work with various species often used for research, such as nematode worms, yeast, slime mould and even bumblebees. This allows the system to be useful in a range of research fields.</p><p>As MAPLE fits on a table top and is fairly affordable, the hope is that it could help many scientists do their experiments faster and with greater consistency, freeing up time for creative thinking and new ideas. Ultimately, this tool could help to speed up scientific progress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bombus impatiens</kwd><kwd>physarum polycephalum</kwd><kwd>experimental robot</kwd><kwd>automation</kwd><kwd>culturing</kwd><kwd>high throughput phenotyping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Species like <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> are desirable lab model organisms due to their rapid reproduction, ease of rearing, and especially their deep genetic toolkits comprising strains with varying genotypes and transgenic alterations that permit rapid, mechanistic inquiries. To take advantage of these toolkits, screen experiments quantify the phenotypes of hundreds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vitaterna et al., 1994</xref>), thousands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kain et al., 2012</xref>), tens of thousands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayroles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churgin et al., 2017</xref>) or even hundreds of thousands of individual animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robie et al., 2017</xref>). With the ongoing improvement and widespread adoption of high-performance machine vision phenotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Branson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dankert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kimura et al., 2014</xref>), the time needed to manually handle experimental animals remains the bottleneck limiting data collection.</p><p>The advent of liquid-handling robots has radically changed the face of molecular biology, enabling techniques and experiments that had long been imagined, but were too complex, lengthy, or tedious to have been previously realized. But there are no comparable systems for handling of experimental organisms that are larger than ~1 mm or cannot be suspended in liquid. There are large-scale systems that handle adult flies in vials, in the form of ‘fly flipping’ robots. However, these take up a whole room, generally in a core facility, and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to purchase and maintain, and are therefore inaccessible to most labs. And while there are many examples of high-throughput phenotypic assays in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Branson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geissmann et al., 2017</xref>), the systems that are not single-purpose still require human intervention to load and unload individual flies. Some researchers have used flies' natural tendency to climb up (negative gravitaxis) to isolate individuals for behavioral analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">von Reyn et al., 2014</xref>), imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Medici et al., 2015</xref>), or microsurgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Savall et al., 2015</xref>). But dependence on this particular behavior fundamentally caps throughput, inadvertently selects for a subset of a population, and limits eligible genotypes. An alternative approach, actively conveying flies with airflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MacMillan and Hughson, 2014</xref>) permits moving animals on demand, and opens the door for increased throughput. The dearth of instruments for automating <italic>Drosophila</italic> experiments is representative of the situation for many other lab organisms, such as yeast and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where there is no standard platform for automated handling of the organisms themselves.</p><p>Here, we present an automated platform that is high-throughput and flexible enough to assist in conducting diverse experimental protocols in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other species. Due to its modular design, the system can automate diverse assays in a wide variety of organisms (including yeast, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the slime mold <italic>Physarum polycephalum</italic>, and the bumblebee <italic>Bombus impatiens</italic>, an assortment chosen to demonstrate the platform’s versatility). For fruit flies, where we developed significant capabilities, this instrument can conduct numerous protocols, including loading of individual fruit flies for circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pfeiffenberger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geissmann et al., 2017</xref>) experiments, or aiding with lab chores like collecting virgin female flies for genetic crosses or passaging individual flies in controlled culture conditions for longevity assays. The physical platform of this instrument integrates animal husbandry and phenotyping, permitting end-to-end experimental protocols. Its low cost (~$3,500), programmability, and scalability permit large-scale experiments that take advantage of the many benefits lab model organisms offer, such as huge fly genetic libraries containing thousands of lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thibault et al., 2004</xref>). After demonstrating MAPLE’s breadth of utility across species, we highlight the depth of its capabilities with two particularly time- and manual labor-intensive fruit fly tasks: rapidly collecting virgin females, and large-scale longitudinal measurement of fly social networks and behavior. The latter experiment reveals previously unknown stability of <italic>Drosophila</italic> social interactions, and confirms that both olfaction and vision are required for dyad-specific social interactions in this context.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MAPLE physical implementation</title><p>With the high level goals of modularity, scalability, and automatability in mind, we designed the MAPLE system with the following design constraints: (1) It features a large, flat experimental workspace with room for multiple flexibly-configurable experimental modules. (2) This workspace is physically open for user convenience, and transparent on the top and bottom for in situ optical phenotyping. (3) Multiple end-effectors can move throughout the workspace to handle organisms, capture images, and manipulate experimental modules. (4) It features failsafe mechanisms so that users can leave it unattended without worrying that it would damage itself or experimental modules. (5) It is relatively inexpensive and scalable.</p><p>MAPLE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) was built using extruded aluminum rails to support x-, y-, and z-carriages mounted on linear rails in a Cartesian configuration. We employed the CoreXY system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moyer, 2012</xref>), which reduces the mass of the moving part of the X/Y gantry by fixing the stepper motors on the frame. (However, for the speeds at which we run MAPLE, which are roughly 80% as fast as human hands conducting experiments (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), mounting the y-axis stepper motor on the x-axis carriage would likely not reduce performance.)</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37166.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MAPLE, a robotic platform for conducting experiments with many species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of MAPLE with workspace dimensions indicated and an expanded schematic of the end effectors. Colors indicate different robotic systems.

Its floor is clear acrylic with cable/tubing pass-throughs. Locating brackets (laser cut out of 6 mm acrylic) were affixed to an interchangeable acrylic surface with the same footprint as the floor (a ‘workspace plate’), allowing experimental modules to be precisely and repeatably positioned within and removed from the workspace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interchanging workspace plates allows rapid reconfiguration of the workspace for different experimental procedures. (2) The sides, top, and bottom of MAPLE are open or made of clear acrylic, permitting the optical phenotyping of flies in experimental modules at all time points other than when the end-effector carriages are above the modules. (3) The end-effector assembly comprises three independent z-axes, each featuring a single tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>): an object manipulator for picking up experimental module components like plastic lids using vacuum; a USB digital camera with LED illumination for acquiring high-resolution images for machine-vision; and an organism manipulator for handling small individual animals using vacuum, or, in the case of our yeast experiments, wooden applicators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). (4) All motion axes have physical limit switches and/or software limits preventing overtravel. The organism manipulator end effector, which is rigid and must align precisely with experimental modules at different heights, is equipped with a collision-detection switch to halt z-motion before the robot is damaged. This sensor can also be used to detect the height of rigid module components. It is safe to leave MAPLE unattended (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).

To do this, we focused on fruit flies, and set out to confirm that handling by MAPLE did not damage flies or introduce discrepancies compared to experiments conducted manually. Specifically, we examined the locomotor performance of flies handled by MAPLE and unhandled flies. First, we manually aspirated 96 anesthetized flies into a FlyPlate (a modified 96-well plate for single fly storage. Detailed description below). After 2 hr of rest, half the flies (48) were subjected to repeated manual removal and replacement back into their well using the MAPLE organism manipulator, while the remaining flies (48) were left unhandled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). After this handling procedure, the entire plate was imaged in a backlit motion tracking rig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>). Handling and imaging were then repeated an additional four times to test for cumulative effects.

We fabricated and deployed a number of modules, which fall into three categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>): fly source, fly sink, and phenotyping modules. Fly source modules are repositories from which flies can be removed in a controlled fashion and transferred into downstream modules. These include the Fly Dispenser (FlySorter LLC), a small device that outputs single flies, on demand, from a standard plastic vial pre-loaded with many flies. It can be triggered to dispense a fly via a serial command sent over USB. A standard CO<sub>2</sub> pad with a porous polyethylene surface, used to anesthetize flies manually at the start of a MAPLE session, serves as a source of flies. Using machine vision, MAPLE is capable of recognizing flies’ positions on the pad. FlyPlates (FlySorter LLC) are modified 96-well plates in which the floor has been replaced with a metal mesh, allowing flies stored in the wells to feed on fly media below the plate. The lid features a nylon mesh with X-shaped slits cut above each well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which allow an aspirator tip or the organism manipulator end-effector to enter the well, retrieve or deposit a fly, and leave the well without permitting the fly to escape. Because flies can be deposited in this module, it also falls in the category of fly sink modules.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37166.018</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>An ecosystem of MAPLE hardware modules for flexible experimental automation in fruit flies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustrations and brief descriptions of experimental MAPLE modules.

In the case of the FlyPlate, deposited flies can be later removed. Other fly sink modules are one-way, including a morgue, a dish of slightly soapy water or 70% ethanol covered with a nylon mesh lid in the style of the FlyPlate. Standard fly culture media vials with nylon mesh loading adapters can be used to collect many flies after MAPLE handling for long-term storage.</p><p>The last category of modules is phenotyping modules, which produce experimental data. We have created a number of behavior phenotyping modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), including arrays of circular open field arenas, arrays of Y-shaped mazes for measuring locomotor handedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>), and social arena arrays, in which pairwise social interactions can be monitored. Phenotyping modules are not limited to collecting behavioral data. For example, flies can be loaded into standard 96-well plates outfitted with nylon mesh lids. From there, they are ready for molecular protocols, including use by liquid-handling robots. Flies in FlyPlates, which have access to food, can be used for circadian assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tataroglu and Emery, 2014</xref>), longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stearns et al., 2000</xref>), or pharmacological experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gasque et al., 2013</xref>). Modules such as the Fly Dispenser can be situated outside MAPLE’s frame, receiving and delivering flies via air-flow tubing. 3D-printed adapter blocks connect these tubes into the MAPLE workspace and are situated with locating brackets.</p><p>The modularity of MAPLE’s hardware is reflected in its software as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Each experimental procedure is associated with a Python experimental script file. These files call functions that (1) implement common multi-step robot actions (like retrieving a fly from a behavioral arena), (2) implement low-level elemental robot actions, (3) are specifically associated with the modules used in a particular experiment, and (4) mediate the remote control of MAPLE over the internet. This software architecture permits the rapid scripting of new experimental protocols at a high level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To demonstrate the experimental flexibility of this ecosystem of modules and software, we implemented a number of experimental procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These include: (1) collecting virgin flies for genetic crosses by dispensing flies as they eclose and then distributing them into individual wells of FlyPlates where their isolation preserves their virgin status indefinitely; (2) loading flies into Y-shaped arenas to measure their locomotor biases, the time-consuming step of a routine assay in our lab; (3) loading flies from the Fly Dispenser into the FlyPlate wells for long-term culturing and circadian phenotyping; and (4) loading flies into social arenas to measure their pairwise interactions. Below we describe results from procedures (1) and (4) in detail, as well as the scientific findings obtained using the latter procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>MAPLE-assisted virgin picking is more efficient than manual methods</title><p>We tasked MAPLE with performing a tedious task that consumes great amounts of time in essentially all <italic>Drosophila</italic> labs: collecting virgin females for genetic crosses. Female <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> will not mate with males for approximately 6 hr after they eclose from the pupal case. In the first portion of this interval, they have morphological characteristics (puffy abdomens, translucent cuticle, and visible meconium in the gut) that correlate with their young age and are reliable, but conservative, indicators of virginity. In traditional manual virgin-picking, only females with these morphological correlates are collected. This means that many virgin females lacking morphological correlates in the latter portions of the 6 hr no-mating window are discarded, unless practitioners collect virgins from a stock vial or bottle at regular intervals at least three or four times a day.</p><p>MAPLE has the potential to recover 100% of females as virgins by isolating them quickly after they eclose, and storing them individually to preclude mating. To implement this procedure, we devised a simple custom fly media vial in which the lower portion containing fly food is detachable. Parental generation flies lay eggs in this food, or food from another vial containing larval flies can be transferred into the custom vial. When flies in this experimental generation climb onto the walls of the vial and pupate, the food-containing portion is manually detached, and replaced with an empty vial-bottom (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">Video 10</xref>). This pupae-containing, foodless vial is then placed in the Fly Dispenser.

To recover only the virgin females, fully loaded FlyPlates were removed from their media base, brought to traditional CO<sub>2</sub> fly-pushing pads at dissecting microscopes, the flies were anesthetized through the wire mesh floor, and then the plate and pad assembly was inverted, leaving the flies on the CO<sub>2</sub> pad in their respective positions from the wells. The sex of each fly was determined by eye, and females that had been stored either alone, or with no males were collected. In a head-to-head comparison of typical manual virgin-collecting (picking at the beginning and end of the work day from five vials) versus MAPLE virgin-collecting, virgin females were procured at a rate of 1.5/min (including the time needed to bring vials from the incubator, anesthetization, etc.) and 4.9/min using MAPLE (including the time to set up the pupa vial, load the dispenser, manually sex and sort the flies, etc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

It is known from group behavioral experiments that individuals spend more time interacting with specific other individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Simon et al., 2012</xref>), and such interaction-based SINs remain stable over tens of minutes in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). In other species, such as the forked fungus beetle <italic>Bolitotherus cornutus</italic>, these dyadic interactions are stable for days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Formica et al., 2017</xref>). Because it is challenging to perfectly maintain individual identity through experiments in which multiple individuals are in the same compartment and subsequently retrieved, stored and retested, it is unknown if dyad-specific affiliative measures are stable over longer periods of time in flies. To assess this we devised a new high-throughput assay to measure affiliative behavior between pairs of flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). This consisted of a 9 × 9 array of adjacent, approximately semi-circular arenas separated by an interchangeable barrier. MAPLE can load individual flies into each arena-half using a multi-position loading port (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>). We made four versions of the interchangeable barrier: an open-clear barrier was made of clear acrylic with grooves to connect the half-arenas, permitting flies to see and smell each other (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video12">Video 12</xref>); a solid-clear barrier permits flies to see each other but impedes airflow; an open-black barrier permits airflow but blocks visual cues; and a solid-black barrier blocks both airflow and visual cues. Flies in this assay are thus presented with the choice of interacting with a designated partner across the barrier, or not.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37166.025</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Persistent fly social networks measured using MAPLE.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of MAPLE-assisted social interaction behavior phenotyping procedure. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of one of 81 social arenas including interchangeable interaction barrier types (shown in side-on view to illustrate the channels along the bottom of some barriers that permit airflow).

These compartments are separated by open-clear barriers which are made of clear acrylic with horizontal channels allowing flies to both see and smell each other.</p></caption></media><p>As a measure of social affiliation, we determined an ‘interactivity index,’ defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the distances of each fly to the barrier over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Either significantly positive or negative values of this index indicate social interaction. We found that male-female and female-female, although not male-male, dyads produced the same distribution of interactivity indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Most social experiments were performed with virgin female-female dyads, although for some control groups we also included male-female dyads.</p><p>We programmed MAPLE to load pairs of flies from the FlyPlate into social arenas according to three different dyad schemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These varied from high-throughput (testing 162 flies at a time), with each fly tested in just a single dyad, to low-throughput (10 flies total) but saturated with respect to all possible dyadic pairings. Using the high-throughput scheme, we first measured the interactivity indices of wild type (Canton-S) flies separated by open-clear barriers. The observed distribution was significantly different compared to shuffled controls that scramble dyadic pairings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>; p&lt;0.0001 by KS-test), indicating that interactions are dyad-specific.</p><p>Dyads separated by barriers that limit sensory cues exhibited significantly lower mean absolute interactivity indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), indicating that both olfactory and especially visual cues drive differences in dyadic interactions. This is consistent with reports that visual cues can mediate social modulation of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Consistently, anosmic <italic>Orco</italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vosshall and Hansson, 2011</xref>) showed a significant 65% reduced mean absolute interactivity index, even with open-clear barriers (p=0.00048 by t-test). Blind <italic>NorpA</italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 1995</xref>) did not differ significantly from wild type flies in mean absolute interactivity index (p=0.26 by t-test). Flies with mutations in the <italic>white</italic> gene (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>) have reduced visual acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Markow and Scavarda, 1977</xref>) but showed a 50% increase in absolute interactivity index which was statistically significant (p=0.013 by <italic>t</italic>-test), suggesting that social partner visual recognition does not require fine acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Justice et al., 2012</xref>). The increased inter-dyad variability seen in <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> animals may be consistent with increased inter-individual variability in phototactic preference exhibited by this genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kain et al., 2012</xref>). In a control experiment, <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> flies separated by solid-black barriers had interactivity indices indistinguishable from Canton-S flies separated by solid-black barriers (p=0.48 by <italic>t</italic>-test).</p><p>Lastly, we set out to determine if social behavior is stable over long periods of time by measuring dyadic interactivity indices across days. Using our high-throughput dyad scheme, we measured interactivity indices from 91 dyads on each of 6 consecutive days. Interactivity indices across Canton-S dyads were statistically significantly correlated (0.31 &lt; <italic>r</italic> &lt; 0.38, 0.0001 &lt; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.04) between day one vs. day 2, day 2 vs. day 3 and day 3 vs. day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), but not days 4 vs. 5 or 5 vs. 6. Thus, dyad-specific affiliative behavior appears to be stable over days-long timescales, though only for the first days of experiments. In control experiments, Canton-S flies with solid-black barriers and <italic>NorpA</italic> and <italic>Orco</italic> mutant flies exhibited no significant correlation in dyad interactivity indices across days. Significant correlation in interactivity index across dyads was observed in our two SIN dyad schemes as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–J</xref>) suggesting that SIN persistence can be measured in a variety of experimental formats. Other metrics of social interaction yielded qualitatively similar results to the interactivity index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; Supplementary methods).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We developed MAPLE, a modular, automated platform for large-scale experiments, to expand automated experimental capabilities for lab model organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). By design, MAPLE is versatile, scalable, and relatively inexpensive, with all components of the core fly-handling robot costing roughly $3500. We displayed the versatility of this system by adapting the MAPLE platform to detect, place, and streak out individual <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), autonomously record <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), as well as automatically monitor the behavior of multiple bumblebee colonies over long periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). We have made the design and code for MAPLE open access in the hope that it, or descendant approaches, will be adopted by our field.</p><p>After demonstrating that MAPLE did not discernibly alter the baseline behavior of animals compared to manual handling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we developed a procedure by which MAPLE could help conduct a repetitive lab chore that nearly all <italic>Drosophila</italic> biologists are familiar with — collecting virgin females for genetic crosses. Using a Fly Dispenser, MAPLE collected individual animals as they eclosed from the pupal case and kept them in isolation, ensuring their virginity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To arrive at a final collection of virgin females, these singly-housed individuals were sexed by hand. Even with this manual step, virgins were procured at a much higher (~3 x) rate with MAPLE’s assistance than without it (measured in terms of human labor time per virgin female).</p><p>MAPLE’s capacity to handle individual flies in combinatorially complex experimental designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), allowed us to demonstrate that dyadic fly social behavior relies on both visual and olfactory cues. Dependence of social behavior on visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Simon et al., 2012</xref>) and olfactory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billeter and Levine, 2015</xref>) is known from experiments observing many flies simultaneously. We further found that individual differences in dyadic social behavior — as well as derived social interaction network topography — remain stable over days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Stability of social networks on short timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) is known, but long-term stability of social networks is a novel finding. This illustrates that MAPLE can (1) replicate known results without introducing significant behavioral confounds and (2) extend our knowledge by conducting complex, long-term experiments that are challenging for human experimentalists.</p><p>Technologies that automate experiments will particularly facilitate the phenotyping of individual animals, an approach that reveals underappreciated intragenotypic variability. Our group has shown that individual flies generally exhibit very different behaviors from one another even if they are reared in the same environment and have the same genotype, and that these differences persist across days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayroles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Todd et al., 2017</xref>). MAPLE allowed us to show that this extends to dyad-specific social interactions in flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–J</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that dyad-specific social interactions are persistent on days-long timescales in flies.</p><p>As the behavioral assay used here relies on physically separating individual flies, it is limited to examining visual and olfactory aspects of social interactions. To describe persistence of dyad-specific social interactions in flies more completely, further investigation including somatosensory and gustatory information exchange is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krstic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ramdya et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, this assay presents flies with a choice to interact with a particular partner, or not. Assays with groups of flies, where the alternative to interacting with a particular fly includes interacting with potentially many other flies, may produce different results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramdya et al., 2017</xref>), although interaction networks in a group context are at least partially stable over the course of experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>MAPLE is designed to be a general purpose instrument, therefore it has some disadvantages compared to purpose-built devices that perform a single task. For example, while MAPLE’s camera can be used to acquire time-lapse movies of yeast colony growth, <italic>Physarum</italic> plasmodium movement, or <italic>C. elegans</italic> locomotion, purpose-built worm imaging systems can provide comparable data with higher throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churgin et al., 2017</xref>) or higher resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, purpose-built yeast colony picking robots (e.g. BioMatrix, S and P Robotics) achieve higher performance on specific tasks like transferring colonies, although typically at a higher price. MAPLE’s open, modular design is meant to facilitate customization and prototyping, so it may be a good platform for the development of new organism-handling hardware, for example, for the dissection and transfer of <italic>Physarum</italic> syncytium or individual worms. These and other experimental applications might rely on liquid-handling. MAPLE currently has no liquid-handling capabilities, but there are open source liquid-handling robotic systems such as Opentrons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opentrons.com">http://opentrons.com</ext-link>) which could be integrated with MAPLE. Specifically, liquid-handling effectors could be installed on MAPLE z-axes, replacing some or all of the current effectors.</p><p>In its current configuration, MAPLE has some drawbacks. Its effectors move slightly slower than the hands of a trained experimentalist, so its advantages derive from it not growing tired or losing focus. MAPLE does not execute every action with 100% success. For example, attempts to remove an awake fly from a behavioral arena, using vacuum through a loading port, succeed approximately 90% of the time. Given this error rate, the experimental procedures that include removing flies from arenas use the camera to inspect the arena after each attempt to confirm if the fly has been successfully removed. Similarly, our procedure to transfer yeast colonies used the collision-detector to confirm that the object manipulator had successfully removed petri dish lids. These checks reduce the efficiency of MAPLE-conducted experiments (particularly compared to manual experiments), but mean that the operator can walk away from the device confident that MAPLE will eventually get it right. Given its redundancies and fail-safes, MAPLE can work autonomously for long periods (e.g. 12 hr for the <italic>Physarum</italic> experiment) without getting stuck.</p><p>A potential advantage of using MAPLE for fly experiments specifically is the option to avoid anaesthesia. The Fly Dispenser releases awake animals into the MAPLE system, and these can then be moved between the FlyPlate and behavioral arenas using the multi-position loading ports we developed. Avoiding anesthesia has multiple benefits, including reducing the distortion of behavioral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartholomew et al., 2015</xref>) and physiological measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colinet and Renault, 2012</xref>), which, depending on the form of anaesthesia, can last for hours or days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">MacMillan et al., 2017</xref>). Even seemingly benign manual aspiration can disrupt the expression of sensitive phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trannoy et al., 2015</xref>). Automated, anesthesia-free animal-handling thus has the potential to standardize handling effects.</p><p>MAPLE’s modularity means that the platform's versatility and capabilities can be expanded in the future. As examples, we are developing fly sink modules for culturing thousands of animals in the style of population cages, facilitating selection experiments and experimental evolution. We are developing a high-resolution imaging source/sink module into which flies could be deposited, imaged in dorsal and ventral views, and released back into experimental workflows. This device is inspired by the Fly Catwalk system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Medici et al., 2015</xref>) but can be loaded with a fly on demand, rather than relying on flies to enter the imaging chamber on their own. The images from this module will allow machine-learning-based classification of morphological phenotypes, like sex and eye color, as well as quantification of fluorescent proteins; key genetic markers in flies.</p><p>In addition to conducting tedious or complex experiments, MAPLE’s integrated format affords the opportunity to feed back the results of phenotypic assays into fly handling tasks. For example, MAPLE could be used to perform artificial selection, identifying individuals with a specific behavior or phenotype, and placing males and females together in wells of a FlyPlate, vials, or population cage. Likewise, multigeneration genetic crosses will be possible with our high resolution imaging module. Our current behavioral phenotyping relies on simple motion tracking, but behavioral assays employing thermogenetic or optogenetic stimulation, or sophisticated stimulus control could be implemented through custom modules. Unsupervised learning algorithms have been used to automatically phenotype flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Todd et al., 2017</xref>), and with the capacity to store and access large numbers of flies individually, MAPLE could identify and isolate outliers within a population. MAPLE is compatible with such modern, automated approaches to fly experimentation, and brings automated animal-handling one step closer to the potential achieved by liquid-handling robots for molecular research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>CAD files for MAPLE can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/FlySorterLLC/MAPLEHardware">https://github.com/FlySorterLLC/MAPLEHardware </ext-link>(copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/MAPLEHardware">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/MAPLEHardware</ext-link>). Control software for MAPLE including scripts for the experiments described here can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/FlySorterLLC/MAPLEControlSoftware">https://github.com/FlySorterLLC/MAPLEControlSoftware</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/MAPLEControlSoftware">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/MAPLEControlSoftware</ext-link>). Raw data and analysis scripts can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1119131">http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1119131</ext-link>. These materials are also available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lab.debivort.org/MAPLE">http://lab.debivort.org/MAPLE</ext-link>.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>MAPLE technical specifications</title><p>MAPLE’s frame is a rectangular prism constructed from extruded aluminum struts (Misumi HFS-5 series in various sizes and lengths) and brackets (Misumi five series). The principal axes of the robot are Cartesian, that is to say linear and mutually orthogonal. The longest axis - designated the X axis - comprises two supported linear rails (IGUS Drylin AWUM-12), each with two housed bearings (IGUS drylin OJUM-6–12). The total of four housed bearings support a single, wide linear rail (IGUS WS-10–120) that is the Y axis. A carriage made of two aluminum plates sandwiching four more bearing blocks (WJ200UM-01–10) slides along the Y axis. Suspended from this carriage is an assembly that houses the three independent Z axis slides (IGUS SLN-D740679-2).

Beyond the module class files, there is a master MAPLE class file (<italic>robotutil.py</italic>), which 1) establishes the communications connections between the experiment-coordinating computer and the motion control card and camera in MAPLE and 2) contains functions for all low-level robot operations, like returning to the 0,0,0 home position, moving to an arbitrary position, opening or closing the solenoid valves that control the vacuum flow in the end effectors, or acquiring a photo from the end-effector camera. There is also a file (<italic>commonFlyTasks.py</italic>) that contains subroutines for common usage tasks, like the combination of end effector movements, vacuum and air valve engagement, and Fly Dispenser serial commands required to retrieve a fly from the Fly Dispenser adapter on the workspace. Files of an additional type, experimental scripts, implement the actual experimental procedures (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Each of these scripts load the class files for the modules used in their respective experiments, and procedurally calls the low- and mid-level functions of robotutil.py to implement each procedure. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> for a schematic of the software architecture. Lastly, to increase the convenience of using MAPLE, we implemented a remote control system in which representations of the current status of experiments (e.g. text reports and digital images) are posted to a dedicated email account. This account can also receive MAPLE commands by email to remotely trigger experimental procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Workspace</title><p>The workspace refers to a 100 cm x 28.2 cm x 7.5 cm volume that can be accessed by all end-effectors. As specified, the workspace is attached to the same frame as the axis carriages, but could be mounted separately to isolate experimental modules from the vibrations of MAPLE’s motors. The bottom of this volume is a clear acrylic floor with 5 mm holes organized in a grid (10 cm apart) and cable pass-throughs for easy organization of individual modules. The 5 mm holes can be used to affix an interchangeable acrylic plate (a ‘workplate’) to the acrylic workspace floor using nylon thumb screws. Workplates have locating brackets which define the positions of modules in a particular experimental configuration. Thus, every experimental script is associated with a physical workplate that locates the modules used in its experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Modules</title><p>Modules were made by a variety of fabrication techniques, including laser-cutting of acrylic. Vector outlines of module components were made in Autodesk Inventor or Adobe Illustrator and laser cut by way of CorelDraw. Acrylic components were joined together using Plastruct plastic weld. Phenotyping modules used to investigate affiliative behavior and locomotor handedness, that is, social arena and y-maze arrays, measured 30 cm x 30 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and were fabricated from sheet acrylic using a laser cutter. Fly source modules were custom made (CO<sub>2</sub> pad) or purchased from FlySorter LLC. Fly Dispenser dimensions are 22 cm x 15 cm, CO<sub>2</sub> pad dimensions are 25 cm x 15 cm, and FlyPlate dimensions are 16 cm x 10 cm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fly dispenser</title><p>The Fly Dispenser isolates and outputs individual flies from an attached vial. Repeated knocking motion (which mimics the tapping gesture that people use to knock flies down in a vial) causes flies to fall from the vial into a funnel. At the bottom of the funnel, a pair of motorized, soft foam wheels acts as a valve, and a photo interrupter detects when one fly has passed by. The wheels are stopped, preventing other flies from passing through the valve, and an air pump transports the isolated fly out of a tube. The dispensing process can be remotely triggered and monitored by Python scripts via a USB serial interface.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Dispenser adaptor</title><p>MAPLE interfaces with the Fly Dispenser through the dispenser adaptor logistics module. The dispenser adaptor is a 4 cm x 1.5 cm 3D-printed ABS block with two 5 mm diameter plastic Luer lock tube sockets attached on opposite sides. The Dispenser handpiece connects to the bottom side of the dispenser adaptor, while the MAPLE fly manipulator end effector aligns to the opening on the top of the adapter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>FlyPlate</title><p>The FlyPlate is a modified 96-well plate positioned on a food tray. Each well in the FlyPlate follows the 96-well plate standard for bottomless wells (7 mm in diameter and 10.9 mm deep). Wells have a stainless steel mesh floor that allows feeding but prevents escape. The plate lid has x-shaped laser-cut openings over each well, cut into a flexible nylon mesh, that allow MAPLE’s individual fly manipulator (or a handheld aspirator) to penetrate to remove or deposit flies. The openings close back up once the aspirator/manipulator tip has been removed, keeping flies securely housed. Flies had free access to standard cornmeal diet on the food tray placed below. Food was replaced every 2 days to maintain adequate moisture and freshness and remove eggs and first instar larvae.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Morgue</title><p>The morgue fly sink module is a 10 cm diameter x 5 cm deep laser-cut acrylic cylinder covered by a detachable lid that allows quick disposal of its contents and is equipped with an nylon mesh adapter (in the style of the well coverings of the FlyPlate) that allows MAPLE to deposit flies into soapy water or ethanol that traps and euthanizes them.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Fly food vial</title><p>The fly food vial is a standard 2.6 cm x 10 cm vial equipped with a detachable lid that facilitates MAPLE fly depositing. A standard fly culture media vial can be placed into the fly food vial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Behavior arena arrays</title><p>Behavior phenotyping modules can receive flies in one of two different ways, depending on whether the flies are anesthetized or not. In a traditional experimental style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayroles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>), MAPLE can pick up anesthetized flies from the CO<sub>2</sub> pad module with the organism manipulator, pick up the plastic lid covering a behavioral arena with the object manipulator, drop the fly in the arena, and replace the lid. In a MAPLE-optimized experimental style, awake flies are retrieved from the Fly Dispenser or FlyPlate and then transferred directly into the behavioral arena by sliding a multi-position loading port, a slidable clear lid with a 3.5 mm diameter opening through which flies can be deposited and removed, into place above the arena, dropping the fly, and then sliding the port so it is inaccessible to the fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and examples below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Social arena array</title><p>Arenas used for affiliative behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and circling bias experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) are circular in shape with a 30 mm diameter and a height of 3 mm. Arenas are covered by a multi-position loading port. Two equal-sized semicircular compartments are formed by a 1.5-mm-thick interaction barrier. Interaction barriers refer to individually laser-cut blocks that can be placed into corresponding openings in the middle of the circular arena, allowing separation of flies into individual compartments. Barriers were laser-cut from either clear or black acrylic and were designed to be either solid or open. Solid barriers were flat on the bottom. Open barriers had 4 ~ 0.25 mm horizontal channels connecting the two compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video12">Video 12</xref>). Open barriers presumably facilitate the exchange of odor cues between compartments. Barriers could be made of clear acrylic, facilitating visual cues, or black acrylic. A social arena array comprises 81 circular arenas, with 162 semicircular arenas in total.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Y-maze array</title><p>Locomotor handedness was assessed using y-maze arenas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>). Individual arms of the symmetrical Y-shaped mazes are 15.5 mm long and 120° apart. Arm ends are circular (5.2 mm) in shape, making it easier for flies to turn around and permitting loading and unloading flies via multi-position loading ports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 1</xref>). Arenas are covered with identical lids as those in the social arena array. A y-maze array comprises 81 y-maze arenas arranged equidistantly in a nine-by-nine grid. All parts described were manufactured from either clear or black acrylic and cut into shape using a laser cutter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Yeast</title><p>Yeast expressing GFP in mitochondria (genotype can1-100 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ura3-1 BUD4-S288C RAD5 TRP, mdh1::KAN) were streaked from frozen stocks onto complete supplement mixture media lacking adenine (CME-Ade) and cultured at 30°C for 1–2 days. Cells of this genotype express GFP in mitochondria, and are thus fluorescent under the dissecting scope. MAPLE touched single colonies on the CME-Ade plate and streaked this material onto empty yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) plates. These target plates were allowed to incubate overnight at 30°C prior to imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Caenorhabditis elegans</title><p>We imaged N2 worms of mixed sexes and ages on standard growth media plates consisting of nematode growth medium in 1.7% agar with an OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic> lawn. Locomotion was recorded at 1 Hz at room temperature (21°C).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Physarum</title><p>We inoculated petri dishes containing 2% agar in water with ~3 mm diameter excised pieces of an oatmeal-fed, actively growing <italic>Physarum</italic> plasmodium. These were allowed to recover from excision and plating for ~12 hr at 21°C prior to the collection of the 12 hr 0.017 Hz time-lapse movie in MAPLE, which was also conducted at 21°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Fly lines</title><p>All experiments were performed using Canton-S (wild type), <italic>Orco</italic>, <italic>NorpA</italic>, or <italic>w</italic><sup>1118</sup> lines. Mutant lines were homozygous. We raised flies on CalTech formula cornmeal mediaunder 12 hr/12 hr light and dark cycle in an incubator at 25°C and 70% humidity. Flies were anesthetized using carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and housed in vials of 15 to 20 flies, unless otherwise specified. Five days post-eclosion, flies were aspirated into individual wells in the FlyPlate using CO<sub>2</sub> and used for experimentation after at least 2 hr of recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>General fly experimental procedures</title><p>All experiments were conducted between 9AM and 9PM (ZT0-ZT12). Flies were loaded into individual arenas by MAPLE; arenas that remained empty after two iterations were loaded manually using an aspirator. Flies were later removed from their arenas in an identical fashion. FlyPlates, social arenas, and y-maze arrays were filled with 96, 162, and 81 flies, respectively. Flies were assayed using diffused white LED backlighting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>) in a temperature (23°C) and humidity (41%) controlled behavioral observation room. Fly movement was tracked for 1 hr. Fly tracks were analyzed using a custom MATLAB script. For longitudinal assaying, flies were moved back into the FlyPlate after phenotyping and allowed to feed and rest overnight or for 1 hr at minimum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Behavior measurement</title><p>Fly movement was tracked at 29.9 fps using a custom real-time MATLAB script interfacing with a Firefly MV FMUV-13S2C USB-camera. Tracks were analyzed in MATLAB. In total, 3% of the data were discarded because flies were immobile as determined by mean speed thresholds.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistics</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, all confidence intervals were computed by bootstrapping the data associated with individual flies or individual fly dyads (in the case of social interaction measurements) 1000 times, using custom MATLAB scripts. One standard deviation of the bootstrap estimates was our estimate of the standard error of the estimate. P-values reported were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction where applicable, and asterisks reflect post-correction significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Specific experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-20-1"><title>Activity and speed MAPLE handling control experiments</title><p>Flies were loaded into a FlyPlate in accordance with general experimental procedures. MAPLE removed every second fly from its individual well and released it back after a 1 s delay 10 times in a row (48 flies total MAPLE-handled). This procedure was repeated three times so that every second fly was handled 30 times in total after 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). Flies were then monitored according to general experimental procedures. The preceding steps constituted one handling session. There were five handling sessions lasting 10 hr in total.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20-2"><title>Manual vs MAPLE-handling control experiments</title><p>Flies were loaded into the y-maze array according to general experimental procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>). MAPLE loaded a random arena compartment (81 flies total) of each arena in the social arena tray to prevent dyad-neighbors influencing circling behavior. Flies were observed as described in general experimental procedures. Flies were discarded into morgue fly sink module after phenotyping.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20-3"><title>Virgin-picking procedure</title><p>Ten male and 20 female CS between 5 and 7 days post-eclosion are placed in custom dispenser-type vials. These custom virgin-picking vials are 10 cm long x 4 cm in diameter open cylinders with a bottom that attaches by press-fit. Standard cornmeal diet was poured in the bottom portion and allowed to cool down prior to fly introduction. Flies were anaesthetized using CO<sub>2</sub> and placed in the vial. After 2 days of egg-laying in the incubator (25°C), parental flies were discarded and the vial was placed back in the incubator. After 9 days, the bottom portion of the vial containing the food was removed from the container. The food was discarded and the container washed and reattached to the vial. The vial now only contained animals that pupated on the sides of the open cylindrical portion of the vial (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">Video 10</xref>).</p><p>The vial was then placed into the Fly Dispenser and MAPLE’s virgin-picking subroutine was engaged. Every 30 min, the Fly Dispenser attempted to dispense any eclosed flies while MAPLE aligns its fly manipulator end effector to the fly dispenser adapter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). If a fly was successfully dispensed, MAPLE deposited it into a FlyPlate in the workspace. If at any point no fly is dispensed, MAPLE and the Fly Dispenser paused for a 30-min waiting period before a new dispensing attempt was made. Over 3 days, MAPLE continued to load newly eclosed flies into individual FlyPlate wells until pupa were exhausted (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">Video 10</xref>). FlyPlate wells containing multiple flies were manually emptied with an aspirator. The remaining flies were manually anesthetized using CO<sub>2</sub> and their sex assessed under a dissecting microscope. After sexing, flies were returned to their individual wells. The FlyPlate fly source module including food tray was removed from the workspace and placed inside a sealed plastic container. After 10 days, the food tray was examined for larvae, eggs, and newly hatched flies. When none were found, the single flies MAPLE placed into individual FlyPlate wells were considered virgins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20-4"><title>Virgin-picking MAPLE/manual comparison</title><p>To allow a fair head-to-head comparison between manual virgin collection and MAPLE-assisted virgin collection, our approach was to start and end both procedures in identical circumstances (bottles of parental flies, and vials containing virgin progeny females, respectively). Two standard bottles containing 10 male and 20 female CS flies 5–7 days post-eclosion were allowed to mate and lay eggs for 3 days. After 3 days, flies were removed and egg- and larvae-containing agar was transferred with a spatula among five standard vials and one custom dispenser-type vial. The amount of virgin females automatically picked by MAPLE was assessed according to the virgin-picking procedure described above. Total time required was computed as the total time required for every step of the process, including preparation, manual sexing, and cleanup. Virgin female count, virgin female ratio, and time required for manual virgining was assessed by twice daily (9AM and 9PM) manual virgin-picking from five virgin-producing standard culture vials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20-5"><title>Social interaction paradigm validation</title><p>Social arenas were prepared by manually inserting the appropriate interaction barrier type into the arena array prior to introducing flies. Flies were loaded into social arena arrays according to general experimental procedures. To minimize behavioral confounds caused by disparate loading times, one social arena compartment (i.e. all the left compartments) was filled first. This ensured that flies in social arenas loaded earlier were allowed minimal additional time to familiarize with or habituate to their dyad-neighbor. Phenotyping arrays were moved into behavior-recording boxes according to general experimental procedures. After assaying, flies were manually removed from trays and discarded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20-6"><title>Social behavior day-to-day persistence (Scheme 1)</title><p>Flies were loaded into social arena arrays, assayed, and deposited into FlyPlates after phenotyping according to general experimental procedures. Dyads were randomly determined on the first day. Flies were phenotyped once per day. Fly identity and dyad composition was maintained throughout 6 assaying days. Compartments and arenas were loaded in a randomized fashion each day. On the 7th day, Canton-S flies in the open-clear interaction barrier condition were randomly placed in social arena compartments to form physically shuffled dyads to complement computational shuffling for resampling statistics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20-7"><title>Social behavior persistence (Scheme 2)</title><p>Flies were loaded into social arena arrays, assayed, and deposited into FlyPlates after phenotyping according to general experimental procedures. Each fly was randomly assigned to be part of 10 dyads on the first day. Flies were assayed six times per day for 7 days. Fly identity was maintained throughout the experimental duration by storing flies individually. In total, each dyad was phenotyped four times. We averaged behavioral measures across the first and last two phenotyping sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20-8"><title>Social interaction network (SIN) persistence (Scheme 3)</title><p>Flies were born in the Fly Dispenser and deposited into FlyPlates according to the virgin-picking procedure. Two groups of 10 flies each were assayed and deposited back into FlyPlates after phenotyping according to general experimental procedures. Flies were assayed six times per day for 3 days to exhaust each possible dyad combination twice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Social interaction analyses</title><sec id="s4-21-1"><title>Interactivity index</title><p>A dyad’s interactivity index was defined as the correlation of dyad-neighbors’ distances to the interaction barrier over the entire experimental duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). Distance was defined as the euclidean distance between a fly’s centroid and the closest side of the interaction barrier.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-2"><title>Coincidental approaches</title><p>We defined a coincidental approach as an interval in which both flies in a dyad were located within one body-length (3 mm) of the interaction barrier on the same frame. This definition of social interaction yielded qualitatively similar results to the interactivity index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Distance to the barrier was defined as the euclidean distance between a fly’s centroid and the nearest side of the barrier. A coincidental approach was scored as a single event irrespective of its duration. For each subsequent coincidental approach to be valid, at least one fly was required to leave and re-enter the 3 mm zone. Coincidental approaches were normalized for dyad mean speed over the experimental duration. Dyad mean speed was the grand mean of both dyad-neighbors’ mean speed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-3"><title>SIN connection threshold</title><p>In the graph representation of social interactions, edges between flies in the network were retained if the absolute value of their interactivity index was greater than the mean of the first and third quartiles of all dyads’ absolute interactivity indices. The same threshold was applied to both repetitions of the SIN measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Jim Morris for assistance developing the Smoothieware firmware, Matt Zucker for ongoing software and hardware advice, Chris Stokes for assistance with early prototypes, Yong-Li Dich for help with hardware development, and Kyobi Kakaria for consultations, fabrication assistance, and manuscript feedback.

the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;MAPLE (Modular Automated Platform for Large-scale Experiments), a robot for integrated animal-handling and phenotyping&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ronald L Calabrese as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Giorgio F. Gilestro (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this Tools and Resources manuscript, the authors report on developing a multifunctional robot system for handling model organisms. Specifically, they developed a Modular Automated Platform for Largescale Experiments (MAPLE), an organism handling robot capable of conducting lab tasks and experiments, and then adapted it with different organism specific modules and used it to conduct common experimental procedures in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Physarum polycephalum, Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and <italic>Bombus impatiens</italic>. They focused on its applicability to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. They show in detail how it can be used to reduce the time commitment to virgin collection with high fidelity. They also use it to study dyadic social interactions. They replicate previous experimental results on the role of visual and olfactory cues and specificity of dyadic interaction and produce the novel result that dyadic interactions persist over multiple days. Thus, they demonstrate it's potential in the laboratory. They provide detailed methods and open source plans for producing a MAPLE, and they convincingly argue that the modular design will allow innovation and adaption to new organisms and experimental procedures. This should be a useful tool for many research labs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The discussion requested by reviewer #2 of potential liquid handling is important and should be directly addressed.</p><p>There is a specific concern about the social network biology raised by reviewer #2 that should be addressed.</p><p>There is a specific concern raised by reviewer #2 for comparisons to manual processes for animals other than flies that should be addressed.</p><p>Both reviewer #2 and #3 want a more thorough discussion of the limitations of MAPLE and provide clear indications of how to proceed in their comments.</p><p>All reviewers agree that the manuscript could be made more concise, especially given the extensive supplementary material.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>- There is no comparison of MAPLE's capability to manual experimenters for any other organism making it difficult to determine if the initial feasibility demonstrations represent true advances in throughput with automation or automation alone. For example, measuring videos of multiple plates of <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a rather trivial advance, as switching plates on any standard behavior tracking system takes only a few seconds. A real advance for <italic>C. elegans</italic> would be the ability to pick (or liquid-transfer) or chunk populations of automatically maintained worms to new plates without damaging them for phenotypic analysis.</p><p>- Does MAPLE have liquid-handling capabilities? If not, can it be adapted to? It would be ideal if a drug treatment and/or the same robot that handles animals could apply liquid or gaseous stimuli. For example, MAPLE could administer repeated doses of chemicals to a single fly at precise times over long time scales to see how this alters dyad behavioral structure. While it is likely beyond the scope of the present work to build in liquid-handling capabilities to MAPLE it would be beneficial to discuss this limitation and potential ways this important capacity might be incorporated into the system.</p><p>- The authors present their social arena arrays as a solution to the problem of maintaining object ID during population-based social interaction assays. While it does solve the problem of maintaining object IDs, this experiment now gives the flies a choice between a partner and a wall, not a partner or another fly. While novel data presented here are convincing that individual flies prefer certain other flies consistently, it is still not clear whether this individual preference would be consistent if in a population of other interacting flies/potential partners. This limitation and implications for understanding <italic>Drosophila</italic> social architecture should be discussed.</p><p>- There should be a succinct cross-species discussion and comparison of the extensive number of microfluidic devices designed for the same purpose as MAPLE. These systems allow for easy animal handling, automation and high-throughput phenotyping and are available for many of the organisms studied in this work. MAPLE offers several advantages of these systems that should be discussed. In addition, there should be a mention of caveats- of areas in which the system has limitations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The only weakness of this work is that it is not clearly stated what the limitations of the system are at this stage and how easily (if at all) they could be solved. The manuscript has a very general &quot;optimistic&quot; outlook and it is not clear for me as a reader whether MAPLE could work out of the box for my purposes, which may be quite different from the ones of the authors. The only reported weakness in the provided examples is the one shown in Figure 3. Perhaps the discussion could feature a more comprehensive analysis of strengths vs. weaknesses of the current system. Example of current weaknesses could be: can MAPLE set up crosses automatically beside collecting virgins? does it ever get stuck? what is the longest autonomous experiment in self-drive you performed? can multiple &quot;phenotyping modules&quot; operate at the same time?</p><p>Finally: I usually do not comment on writing style because I do enjoy reading manuscripts with different, personal touches. However, in this particular case, I think the manuscript would benefit quite a bit from being shortened. The Introduction, for instance, is quite repetitive and uses too many words to stress an important but relatively easy concept. Some of the results could probably be moved to supplementary or not being shown at all (for instance, Figure 3B does not really add much – it's enough to know what the error rate is. Knowing the position of the wrong vials in that particular trial is too much information).</p><p>This is ultimately a joint author/editorial decision, but my recommendation would be to shorten the manuscript quite a bit.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37166.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In this Tools and Resources manuscript, the authors report on developing a multifunctional robot system for handling model organisms.

MAPLE wins on long, tedious procedures when human attention can flag (or complicated procedures where manual errors become likely). E.g., for the virgin-collecting, human labor time/virgin is much lower using MAPLE than traditional techniques, but robot time/virgin is higher, because MAPLE is slow on each step despite being autonomous. So, the reviewer is right that MAPLE isn’t faster than people at moving a camera between <italic>C. elegans</italic> plates (compared to manually loading plates into a traditional imaging rig). The benefit of MAPLE is in longitudinal imaging of those worms, e.g., MAPLE would not be challenged by imaging those plates through the night to collect circadian data. With modification, MAPLE could be adapted to provide any number of stimuli throughout the course of the (long duration) experiment, such as mechanical agitation, light or dark periods, repositioning of the dishes, the addition of chemicals, etc.</p><p>We recognize that picking worms would be a significant advance, and we have certainly not provided a tool to do this in MAPLE’s current configuration, which is most developed for fly work. However, MAPLE is meant to be flexible and modular and we think it represents as good a platform as any for the prototyping of a worm-picking technology. We now address this in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Does MAPLE have liquid-handling capabilities? If not, can it be adapted to?

While it is likely beyond the scope of the present work to build in liquid-handling capabilities to MAPLE it would be beneficial to discuss this limitation and potential ways this important capacity might be incorporated into the system.</p></disp-quote><p>In its baseline configuration, MAPLE has no liquid-handling capabilities. However, we chose to publish MAPLE’s parts list and assembly guide in a fully open format so that modifications and upgrades like the addition of liquid-handling would be relatively easy. The z-carriages are basically flexible platforms on which any number of effectors, including liquid-handling units, could be attached. The tubing and wiring needed to operate liquid-handling effectors could be easily incorporated into MAPLE’s cable management system. Opentrons is an open-access automated liquid-handling system with hardware designs that could very likely be added to the MAPLE platform (or vice versa).</p><p>We now discuss liquid-handling in the Discussion section, and Opentrons specifically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors present their social arena arrays as a solution to the problem of maintaining object ID during population-based social interaction assays. While it does solve the problem of maintaining object IDs, this experiment now gives the flies a choice between a partner and a wall, not a partner or another fly. While novel data presented here are convincing that individual flies prefer certain other flies consistently, it is still not clear whether this individual preference would be consistent if in a population of other interacting flies/potential partners. This limitation and implications for understanding Drosophila social architecture should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that our social paradigm as a choice between interaction with a specific fly or no fly at all, rather than one or more flies among a number of alternative partners. We have edited the description of the assay in the Results section to make this distinction clear, and we have edited the Discussion section to acknowledge this limitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- There should be a succinct cross-species discussion and comparison of the extensive number of microfluidic devices designed for the same purpose as MAPLE. These systems allow for easy animal handling, automation and high-throughput phenotyping and are available for many of the organisms studied in this work. MAPLE offers several advantages of these systems that should be discussed. In addition, there should be a mention of caveats- of areas in which the system has limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a succinct paragraph to the Discussion section that considers MAPLE’s capabilities with respect to other purpose-built model-system automation devices. In brief:</p><p>MAPLE is capable of basic operations involving yeast culture plates and the macroscopic transfer of yeast colonies. MAPLE can perform these operations in coordination with long-term imaging of the colonies. But MAPLE is not (in this incarnation) as fast as a human and is surely not as effective at conducting molecular biology protocols as purpose-built robots.</p><p>MAPLE’s <italic>C. elegans</italic> capabilities are comparable to its yeast capabilities. We are not currently aware of any automation technology that can pick and transfer individual worms.</p><p>MAPLE’s <italic>Physarum</italic> capabilities are again comparable. It is likely capable of transferring bulk pieces of <italic>Physarum</italic>syncytium. As there are no purpose-built devices for handling <italic>Physarum</italic>, this demonstrates potential uses of MAPLE for non-model species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The only weakness of this work is that it is not clearly stated what the limitations of the system are at this stage and how easily (if at all) they could be solved. The manuscript has a very general &quot;optimistic&quot; outlook and it is not clear for me as a reader whether MAPLE could work out of the box for my purposes, which may be quite different from the ones of the authors. The only reported weakness in the provided examples is the one shown in Figure 3. Perhaps the discussion could feature a more comprehensive analysis of strengths vs. weaknesses of the current system. Example of current weaknesses could be: can MAPLE set up crosses automatically beside collecting virgins? does it ever get stuck? what is the longest autonomous experiment in self-drive you performed? can multiple &quot;phenotyping modules&quot; operate at the same time?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valuable observation. We did not intend to present only the rosy picture of MAPLE. The new Discussion section paragraph suggested by reviewer #2, which compares MAPLE to purpose built devices for other model systems, goes some way to presenting the limitations of the system. In addition, we have answered the specific questions suggested by the reviewer in two new paragraphs of the Discussion section that focus on limitations. Here we also emphasize some of the limitations we had to overcome to make MAPLE perform the assays described. As an example, the vacuum to remove flies from behavioral arenas is not 100% effective on every attempt, so the experimental algorithm includes repetition and steps to use the camera to detect whether flies have been removed. This of course, reduces the efficiency of the automation, and we now make this explicit.</p><p>As to the reviewer’s last question, for the phenotyping modules we used here, we generally used MAPLE to load the device before transferring it to traditional imaging rigs for phenotype measurement. However, we left the space above and below MAPLE’s workspace largely open so that optical phenotyping could happen within the workspace itself. Or non-optical methods like capacitive or voltage-based sensing of fly position could be used to phenotype flies in the workspace without even relying on its open optical axes. The capability of running multiple phenotyping modules simultaneously within MAPLE’s workspace comes down to setting up the phenotyping in that setting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally: I usually do not comment on writing style because I do enjoy reading manuscripts with different, personal touches. However, in this particular case, I think the manuscript would benefit quite a bit from being shortened. The introduction, for instance, is quite repetitive and uses too many words to stress an important but relatively easy concept.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the Introduction, Results section and Discussion section down so that they are more streamlined and hopefully more to the reviewer’s liking. We only trimmed the Introduction a bit, since it was already only three paragraphs. Unfortunately, given the other valid requests from the reviewers, the current version is slightly longer than the previous version. If the reviewers and editors are of a consensus that more should be trimmed we will look for ways to do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the results could probably be moved to supplementary or not being shown at all (for instance, Figure 3B does not really add much – it's enough to know what the error rate is. Knowing the position of the wrong vials in that particular trial is too much information).</p></disp-quote><p>We think the reviewer is referring to Figure 4B, where we illustrated the results of a virgining procedure and the number of flies in each well? Under that assumption, we have moved this panel into a new supplementary figure. This may also help with the reviewer’s suggestion to trim the length of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is ultimately a joint author/editorial decision, but my recommendation would be to shorten the manuscript quite a bit.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
