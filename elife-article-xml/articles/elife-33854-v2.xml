to be crucial for localizing high-frequency sounds by coding interaural sound level differences (ILD). Its neurons weigh contralateral inhibition against ipsilateral excitation, making their firing rate a function of the azimuthal position of a sound source. Since the very first in vivo recordings, LSO principal neurons have been reported to give sustained and temporally integrating ‘chopper’ responses to sustained sounds. Neurons with transient responses were observed but largely ignored and even considered a sign of pathology. Using the Mongolian gerbil as a model system, we have obtained the first in vivo patch clamp recordings from labeled LSO neurons and find that principal LSO neurons, the most numerous projection neurons of this nucleus, only respond at sound onset and show fast membrane features suggesting an importance for timing. These results provide a new framework to interpret previously puzzling features of this circuit.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Meriones unguiculates</kwd><kwd>patch clamp</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>binaural</kwd><kwd>temporal</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ph.D. fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franken</surname><given-names>Tom P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 grant DC006212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joris</surname><given-names>Philip X</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Philip H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007229</institution-id><institution>Bijzonder Onderzoeksfonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OT-14-118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joris</surname><given-names>Philip X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0961.11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joris</surname><given-names>Philip X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0A11.13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joris</surname><given-names>Philip X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.091214N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joris</surname><given-names>Philip X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Principal neurons of the brainstem nucleus comparing sound level at the two ears do not have the slow response properties previously attributed to them, but are instead specialized for fast weighing of excitation and inhibition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lateral superior olive (LSO) in the superior olivary complex is a major component of the brainstem high-frequency sound localization circuitry. Its neurons are sensitive to sound level differences between the ears (interaural level differences or ILD; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tollin, 2003</xref>, for review). Neurons in the LSO accomplish this by weighing the sound input to the ipsilateral ear, conveyed via an excitatory (glutamatergic) projection from the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cant, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doucet and Ryugo, 2003</xref>), against the sound input to the contralateral ear, conveyed via an inhibitory (glycinergic) afferent from the homolateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glendenning et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banks and Smith, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sommer et al., 1993</xref>). This process results in firing rates that vary monotonically with ILD, and this tuning is conveyed to targets in the midbrain: the ipsilateral and contralateral inferior colliculi (IC) and the contralateral dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glendenning and Masterton, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moore, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saint Marie et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glendenning et al., 1992</xref>). Reports based on extracellular recordings have consistently indicated that the majority of LSO neurons generate sustained ‘chopper’ responses to ipsilateral tones and thus temporally integrate auditory input (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guinan et al., 1972a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">1972b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsuchitani, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greene and Davis, 2012</xref>). Typically, this feature is used as a physiological criterion to define LSO units (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finlayson and Caspary, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joris and Yin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tollin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsai et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33854.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>LSO circuit and basic properties.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Outline of the major nuclei/cells involved in the LSO circuit.

It is unclear whether the chopper response pattern generalizes across these morphological cell types. Seventy to eighty percent of LSO cells have a bipolar dendritic configuration but this group can be further subdivided at the electron microscopic level based on the synaptic coverage of the cell body. The majority can be classified as principal cells with cell bodies displaying an extensive synaptic coverage, but the cell bodies of a smaller percentage of bipolar cells are sparsely innervated and termed class 5 cells. Around 13% of the LSO cell population are classified as multiplanar cells, with multipolar dendritic trees and an extensive synaptic coverage of the cell body, or marginal cells, with multipolar or unipolar dendritic trees and sparsely innervated cell bodies that are situated along the margins of the body of the LSO neuropil. The remaining LSO cells are classified as small, have very sparsely innervated cell bodies, and are thought to belong to the olivocochlear system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Radtke-Schuller et al., 2015</xref>). Presently there is no evidence as to whether any auditory response features differ for these subtypes. A retrograde labeling study indicated that most LSO neurons that project to the inferior colliculus are principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saint Marie et al., 1989</xref>). Implicitly, it has been assumed that the most frequently observed response pattern, that is a sustained response with a chopping pattern, is associated with principal cells.</p><p>Intracellular evaluation of the synaptic and intrinsic membrane features of LSO cells has been the subject of a number of in vitro slice studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanes, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu and Kelly, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnes-Davies et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sterenborg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walcher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jurkovičová-Tarabová et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alamilla and Gillespie, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kotak and Sanes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remme et al., 2014</xref>). In these studies as well, there is evidence for multiple response patterns in response to current injection, and debate regarding the meaning of these patterns and reasons for discrepancies between studies. Non-olivocochlear LSO neurons were associated with both onset and sustained firing to depolarizing current, where the onset response seems to depend on the higher concentration of a low voltage-activated potassium channel (Kv1). In almost all of these studies, cells with these onset and sustained firing properties were classified as ‘principal’ typically based on visualization of the cell body size and shape, and the presence of I<sub>h</sub> current. Only rarely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnes-Davies et al., 2004</xref>) was labeling done to verify the dendritic tree configuration, and the synaptic coverage of the cell body was never evaluated.</p><p>Only one previously published report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finlayson and Caspary, 1989</xref>) describes in vivo intracellular responses of cells localized to the LSO, in chinchilla. As with many of the extracellular reports, this paper only describes cells with chopper responses to ipsilateral tones. Two cells were labeled with Lucifer Yellow and classified as principal cells based on dendritic configuration but no electron microscopy was done. In almost all of the intracellular recordings reported in that study, ipsilateral acoustic stimuli at the cell’s characteristic frequency (CF: frequency of lowest threshold) generated ‘robust’ suprathreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) while contralateral stimuli generated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). In the few cases studied with binaural stimulation, the inhibitory input was capable of suppressing the spike output generated by the ipsilaterally-evoked EPSPs.</p><p>Using patch electrodes we have intracellularly recorded from cells in the gerbil LSO in vivo and have biocytin-labeled examples of the four anatomical non-olivocochlear cell types in this species. We find that the temporal integrative type of ‘chopper’ response classically associated with this nucleus is not the response generated by its principal cells. Rather, both the response to current injection and to sound indicate that these cells temporally differentiate rather than integrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We have obtained in vivo whole-cell recordings from 25 neurons in the gerbil LSO, of which 16 were labeled with biocytin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; example cell camera lucida reconstruction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For all cells, ipsilateral tones generated EPSPs and often action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, blue trace). In response to contralateral tones, IPSPs were elicited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, green trace) in all cases tested (including all unlabeled neurons). When sound was presented binaurally, the ipsilateral depolarization and ensuing spiking could be suppressed by the contralateral inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, black trace), generating sensitivity to ILD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) in all cases tested (including all unlabeled neurons).

We identified one class 5 cell, which can only be distinguished from principal cells at the E.M. level by low cell body synaptic coverage. Five other cells could be classified as marginal cells - these cell bodies were located in the LSO marginal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom row). The dendritic trees of two of these (second and fourth from left, cells 12 and 13) were not bipolar in contrast to LSO principal/class 5 cells. One (leftmost, cell 11) had a bipolar dendritic configuration but the orientation of this tree was not tilted at the angle seen for principal/class 5 cells at this location. The remaining cell (third from left, cell 14) had a bipolar morphology similar to principal/class 5 cells but the dendrites heading ventrally projected outside the boundaries of the LSO. E.M. analysis of 4 marginal cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) confirmed that they had synaptic coverage levels that fell well below those for gerbil principal cells. Finally, we identified one multiplanar cell, whose cell body was located in the body of the LSO and had a multipolar dendritic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, near figure center, cell 15). This cell had an extensive synaptic coverage of 75.3% that was consistent with the range of coverages reported by Helfert and Schwartz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Helfert and Schwartz, 1987</xref>) for this cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). None of our labeled cells had light and electron microscopic features corresponding to ‘small’ cells in gerbil LSO, most or all of which are thought to be part of the olivocochlear system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Radtke-Schuller et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We were able to determine the frequency tuning to ipsilateral stimuli for the labeled cells and measured CF or best frequency (BF, frequency eliciting the largest number of spikes or EPSPs). CF or BF shows a clear increase to higher values towards the medial pole of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A/B</xref>), consistent with earlier extracellular recordings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guinan et al., 1972b</xref>). All four identified cell types conform to this tonotopic gradient.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Principal cells are fast cells with small action potentials</title><p>Next, we asked if principal cells also differ physiologically from non-principal cells. The intracellular recordings allowed us to analyze subthreshold spontaneous activity. In all cell types, spontaneous synaptic activity consisted of excitatory (EPSPs: green dots) and inhibitory (IPSPs: red dots) postsynaptic potentials. The EPSPs were typically subthreshold. We observed that principal cells were characterized by strikingly fast, narrow EPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left column). Indeed, for principal cells EPSPs often had sub-millisecond half widths that are reminiscent of principal MSO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; compare with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franken et al., 2015</xref>]). In contrast, EPSPs of non-principal cells were slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right column). Compare, for example, the train of EPSPs occurring in principal cell 1 (green dots) with the repetitive EPSPs occurring in non-principal cell 15 (green dots). In the latter, there is clear summing of the EPSPs. The number of spontaneous IPSPs (red dots) seemed to be lower than that of EPSPs, although they sometimes may have been obscured due to the high levels of EPSPs (e.g. principal cell 1, red dots show an IPSP with an intervening EPSP). In some cells IPSPs were more prominent, as seen in principal cell five and non-principal cell 16. Again, these may be visible here because the number of events was lower. We quantified the temporal properties of subthreshold postsynaptic waveforms by computing amplitude spectra and determining the upper cut-off frequency at 50% (i.e. −6 dB) of the maximal amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, intersection with horizontal dashed line). Samples (2–6 s) of spontaneous activity were high-pass filtered and wavelet de-noised (Materials and methods). Spontaneous activity of LSO principal cells contained a significantly larger proportion of high frequencies than that of LSO non-principal cells (upper cut-off frequency was respectively 528.7 ± 66.5 and 131.4 ± 15.5 Hz; two-sample t test <italic>t<sub>10</sub></italic> = 6.83, p=4.6×10<sup>−5</sup>, Hedges’ g = 4.00), and was similar to spectra of MSO principal cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33854.005</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Principal cells have fast kinetics and small action potentials.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fifty milliseconds of spontaneous activity is shown for four principal cells (left column) and four non-principal cells (right column).

These differences extend to effects of contralateral sound. In all labeled LSO neurons, ipsilateral tones evoked mainly EPSPs and contralateral sounds evoked mainly IPSPs. The top panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> zoom in on depolarization and the bottom panels on hyperpolarization, evoked by ipsi- and contralateral tones, respectively. As was the case for responses to ipsilateral stimulation, the response of principal cells to contralateral stimulation also showed a pronounced peak (but in the hyperpolarization direction) at sound onset, and a much smaller hyperpolarization during the sustained part of the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The latency of the inhibitory onset response decreases by several ms with increasing sound level (see next section). By comparison non-principal cells typically show postsynaptic potentials with larger amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), often with a more sluggish onset. These differences resulted in significantly smaller peak-to-sustained postsynaptic amplitude ratios for non-principal cells than for principal cells, during monaural ipsilateral as well as monaural contralateral stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>; resp. two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>t</italic><sub>10</sub> = 2.24; p=0.049 and <italic>t</italic><sub>10</sub> = 3.02; p=0.013).

The sound level at which the non-monotonicity occurred, as well as the observation that the non-monotonicity is mirror-symmetric for ipsi- and contralateral stimulation, suggest that it may reflect acoustic crosstalk. Using a similar experimental approach in gerbil to study monaural neurons that are part of the LSO-circuit, interaural attenuation was found to usually be 50 dB or more, but occasionally it was as low as 30 dB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, in neurons with non-monotonic responses, IPSPs could be observed to high-level ipsilateral tones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) and EPSPs to high level contralateral tones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Another possible mechanism for the non-monotonic response to ipsilateral stimulation is ipsilateral inhibition, which has been reported in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu and Kelly, 1994</xref>) and was also inferred from in vivo observations of inhibitory sidebands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brownell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caird and Klinke, 1983</xref>). For a few neurons, we obtained responses to ipsilateral tones at various frequencies, and observed occasional hyperpolarizations suggestive of ipsilateral inhibition. In any case, the intracellular responses show that the non-monotonicity reflects neural interaction at the site of LSO neurons, and is not simply a reflection of the (more modest) non-monotonicity that can be found in the monaural inputs to LSO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuenzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Typlt et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ILD sensitivity</title><p>The different response patterns that we identified for principal and non-principal cells are reflected in functional differences in terms of ILD coding.

The binaural responses to these tones at the same respective sound levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, left panel) suggest that the decrease in latency is an important contributor to generate ILD tuning. The latency of the EPSP evoked by the ipsilateral tone at 50 dB is similar to that of the IPSP evoked by a contralateral tone of the same SPL, and when combined (ILD = 0 dB), they interact to a response that fails to elicit a spike.

This difference may be due to higher ipsilateral sound levels in our data set compared to their data: we find that higher ipsilateral sound levels can move the slope of the ILD function towards more negative ILDs, as has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsuchitani and Boudreau, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsai et al., 2010</xref>).

LSO neurons are known to project both ipsi- and contralaterally, and the laterality of projection is biased in frequency and sign (excitatory vs. inhibitory). However, the relationship of laterality to other physiological properties is unknown. For 8 cells, we could follow the axon to the point where we were confident about whether they projected to the ipsilateral or contralateral inferior colliculus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The three traceable principal cell axons all headed ipsilaterally as did three non-principal cells. One other non-principal cell headed contralaterally and another one projected bilaterally, bifurcating just after exiting the LSO dorsally. In addition, two labeled principal and one non-principal neuron, all of which projected to the ipsilateral inferior colliculus and are thus probably glycinergic, sent an axon collateral to the ipsilateral lateral nucleus of the trapezoid body (LNTB; one of these cells has been reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franken et al., 2016</xref>]). Three non-principal neurons had local axon collaterals in the LSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and Supplementary Text).

Our findings confirm the morphological classes discerned in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Helfert and Schwartz, 1987</xref>) and allow us to link these to physiology. We present the first evidence that all these cell types are excited by sounds to the ipsilateral ear and inhibited by sounds to the contralateral ear, and that they conform to the tonotopic LSO map. Unexpectedly and most importantly, our data reveal that principal LSO cells do not show the prototypical integrative chopper responses that have been attributed to these cells since the earliest single-cell studies: rather, they display fast kinetics and onset responses, which necessitates a revision of the prevailing notion of LSO as a high-frequency nucleus integrating auditory information over time to send ILD cues to higher centers in the brain. Axons of several principal and non-principal cells could be followed into the ipsilateral or contralateral lateral lemniscus (LL) indicating that these different cell types are olivocollicular. In addition, local axon collaterals were occasionally seen, as well as collaterals heading into the LNTB, and we suggest that the latter projection is glycinergic (Supplementary Text). LSO principal cells provide a computational nexus in parallel to MSO principal cells. Traditionally, these two circuits are thought to mainly provide high-frequency ILD and low-frequency ITD information, respectively, to higher centers. MSO cells sense microsecond differences in arrival time using I<sub>LVK</sub> and I<sub>h</sub> currents that lead to low input resistance, fast postsynaptic potentials and onset spikes to depolarizing current injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mathews et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khurana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franken et al., 2015</xref>). LSO neurons are biased to high frequencies, where ongoing temporal cues are less dominant. We show that LSO principal cells have several properties reminiscent of MSO principal cells. They display smaller spikes than non-principal cells, and consistently fire onset spikes to positive current injection. Firing patterns evoked by sustained auditory stimuli mirror responses evoked by current injection: principal cells generate an onset spike to sustained tones, unlike non-principal cells which typically fire throughout the stimulus duration. This difference in spiking activity was accompanied by contrasting postsynaptic potential profiles with mainly onset responses in principal cells and more sustained activity in non-principal cells. These are unexpected properties that are inconsistent with the prevailing view that LSO principal cells integrate auditory stimulation over time by generating sustained, chopping responses to tones.</p><p>The traditional association of ILD-sensitive neurons in LSO with chopper responses, which has stood for 50 years, emerged from pioneering studies in the cat reporting the first single-cell recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsuchitani and Boudreau, 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boudreau and Tsuchitani, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guinan et al., 1972a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">1972b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsuchitani, 1977</xref>). Not only did these early studies find chopper responses to be the most frequently observed; phasic and transient responses were considered outright pathological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsuchitani and Johnson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boudreau and Tsuchitani, 1970</xref>). This point of view biased the ensuing literature. For example, in an early review these authors commented: “We have frequently found that some electrodes will only record phasic units. The smaller the active area of the electrode tip the greater the likelihood that phasic units will be encountered’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boudreau and Tsuchitani, 1970</xref>), and they undertook technical steps to decrease the proportion of phasic cells recorded from in their experiments. In later studies, the presence of ILD-sensitive choppers in LSO was confirmed, not only in cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caird and Klinke, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joris and Yin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tollin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greene and Davis, 2012</xref>) but also in other species, for example in chinchilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finlayson and Caspary, 1989</xref>), rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Irvine et al., 2001</xref>), bat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harnischfeger et al., 1985</xref>), and gerbil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanes and Rubel, 1988</xref>). The chopper response came to be seen as a signature property, even though a minority of other response types was also reported, including transient responses. Because the principal cells are the most numerous cells in LSO, it was reasonable to assume that these cells produce the most frequently encountered response type, that is chopping. In none of these studies, however, was single-cell labeling attempted, except in one study in chinchilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finlayson and Caspary, 1989</xref>). Again, in this study the initial assumption was that ‘… LSO principal cells … displayed chopper responses to ipsilateral stimuli’. Two cells with chopping responses were labeled with Lucifer yellow-filled electrodes and were described as ‘principal’ because of the bipolar nature of their dendrites (e.g. their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This cell was 90–100 µm from the edge of the LSO making it likely that it is instead a marginal cell with a dendritic tree similar to two of our marginal cells illustrated in our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (D. Caspary, personal communication, October 2017).</p><p>In the MSO, small somatic spikes are (along with a very large field response) a contributing factor to the well-known difficulty in recording from these cells with extracellular techniques. Our finding that LSO principal cells have fast membranes and small action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggests that these cells are also less easily isolated with extracellular techniques, compared to non-principal cells with larger overshooting spikes. This may explain the relative paucity of onset responses and preponderance of other response types reported in LSO. Also, the small action potentials of principal cells may necessitate close physical proximity for single-cell isolation with metal electrodes, and perhaps explains the previously reported association with injury potentials and pathology leading to underrepresented reporting of these responses in the literature.</p><p>Our finding has far-reaching functional implications and provides a simplifying view not only on discrepancies in the literature but also on well-documented but previously puzzling features of the LSO-circuit. ‘Chopping’ refers to regular firing where the time of occurrence of output spikes is not determined by the time of occurrence of input spikes. This behavior has been particularly well-studied in the cochlear nucleus, where it is associated with cells that have slow membrane time constants and show poor coding of the temporal fine-structure of sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Young and Oertel, 2004</xref>). Because sound intensity is not an instantaneous property and its measurement inherently requires some temporal integration, the finding of neurons with chopper responses in a nucleus computing ILD makes computational sense. However, the striking morphological and physiological specializations that are found in this circuit, most dramatically in its inhibitory limb in the form of the calyx of Held in the MNTB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), do not fit the role of ILD computation but suggest a need for temporal precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joris and Yin, 1995</xref>). Spherical bushy and MNTB principal cells primarily receive very large individual suprathreshold somatic synapses and at high frequencies they respond very similar to sound as their inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLaughlin et al., 2008</xref>). Globular bushy cells receive many smaller subthreshold somatic and/or dendritic inputs and, as expected from their ‘fast’ membranes, respond reliably when the subthreshold inputs arrive at the same time, as for example at sound onset. The importance of timing in the LSO is also supported by modeling work, showing that precise temporal processing is necessary to reproduce realistic responses to amplitude-modulated sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashida et al., 2016</xref>). Our finding that principal cells are not the temporal integrators they were thought to be, but are actually more akin to the MSO and the afferents to LSO and are triggered by fast changes in membrane potential, suggests that this nucleus has a dual role: it is involved in both ILD and temporal processing.</p><p>The exact nature of this temporal role requires further work, but one promising observation is the steep sensitivity to ITDs of sound transients found in LSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caird and Klinke, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joris and Yin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Irvine et al., 2001</xref>). Our data also suggests that the temporal precision of LSO neurons can contribute to their ILD tuning, because the latency of postsynaptic potentials decreases when stimulus intensity increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Such time-intensity trading has been described in in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanes, 1990</xref>) and in vivo studies from the LSO and other binaural nuclei, especially for transient stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pollak, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Irvine et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Our finding of fast membrane features in LSO principal cells suggests that discrepancies in the in vitro literature are based on the lack of cell identification. Two studies using mouse and/or gerbil slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hassfurth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walcher et al., 2011</xref>) indicated that, similar to our observations, virtually all LSO principal cells in both species responded to depolarizing current steps with an onset response. They suggested that other non-onset responses from LSO cells described in other reports (see below) were due to the young age of the animals used, varying ACSF/electrode solutions and unnatural bath temperatures. It is, however, also possible that some of the recordings in these reports were from non-principal cells because in most cases the cells were not identified anatomically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanes, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu and Kelly, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kandler and Friauf, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sterenborg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kotak and Sanes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remme et al., 2014</xref>) and many of the cells described had overshooting action potentials, a feature that in our data is confined to non-principal cells. Another factor that has been brought forward are spatial gradients, along the tonotopic axis of LSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koch and Sanes, 1998</xref>). For example, Remme et al. describe in vitro data showing faster membrane properties for cells in the lateral, low frequency, limb of the LSO than for cells in the medial, high frequency, limb of the LSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remme et al., 2014</xref>). Many of the slower cells were located near the nucleus edge (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that these are marginal cells. Labeled LSO neurons combined with firing properties to depolarizing current pulses have been reported in three papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kandler and Friauf, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnes-Davies et al., 2004</xref>). All of these reports used rats and all of the recordings associated with labeled cells were from 16 day or younger rats. In all three cases some cells fired repetitively and others at onset only. In only one case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnes-Davies et al., 2004</xref>) were responses from cells in older slices reported (n = 6) and three were onset, three fired repetitively but no anatomy was provided for any of these. Reports indicate that the onset of hearing in rats begins are around post-natal day 14 (P14) where early peaks in auditory brainstem evoked responses (ABRs) begin to appear but do not fully mature until P22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geal-Dor et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, these recordings were probably made from a system still undergoing considerable developmental change. Our in vivo finding of onset responses in confirmed principal cells necessitates a reappraisal of the in vitro studies. We hypothesize that the presence of multiple cell types combined with various (unavoidable) sampling biases has led to discrepancies in that literature, and that it can be resolved by identification of the cells recorded from.</p><p>Most of our labeled LSO neurons were localized in the most ventral part of the nucleus, which is a consequence of the experimental approach: the patch electrode entered the brainstem ventrolaterally, so the first neurons encountered would be the most ventral ones in the nucleus. After recording from a neuron, typically no further penetrations were made to avoid damaging the labeled neuron. This explains the paucity of very low and high-CF cells in our sample. This issue probably also led to the relatively large proportion of marginal cells and small proportion of principal cells in our sample compared to that of Helfert and Schwartz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>At a broader level, our results contribute to an emerging picture of the auditory brainstem composed of parallel circuits operating at different time scales. The presence of multiple types of projection neurons extracting different cues from the auditory nerve, including different temporal features (fine-structure, envelopes, transients), has been a longstanding theme in the cochlear nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Young and Oertel, 2004</xref>). Recent work, including the present results, suggests that even within the different circuits originating in the cochlear nucleus and ultimately feeding into the midbrain, subcircuits are embedded that repeat the theme of using the same afferent inputs towards different computations. Interestingly, psychophysics-based models also suggest several operational time scales that differ strikingly between perceptual tasks in both monaural and binaural hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Viemeister and Plack, 1993</xref>). Further probing of the binaural sensitivity of different cell groups within and across nuclei with regard to time scale of integration, and relating this to behavioral sensitivity promises a better understanding of their mutual relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Tollin, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The methods for surgery, in vivo patch clamp recording and light and electron microscopic histology have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franken et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2016</xref>) and are briefly reviewed here.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and surgery</title><p>We used adult and juvenile (P28–P36) Mongolian gerbils (<italic>Meriones unguiculates</italic>) of either sex.

In cresyl-violet coronal sections of the gerbil brainstem, the LSO can be distinguished as a lateral concentration of cells in the superior olive (SOC) with quite distinct boundaries due to the surrounding paucity of cells. In osmium-fixed plastic embedded sections the gerbil LSO is seen as a distinctly lighter, laterally situated SOC region surrounded by a darker neuropil, due to the higher concentration of myelinated axons there, again creating quite distinct boundaries. Using these features as boundaries a camera lucida drawing of the labeled cell body’s location within the boundaries of the LSO seen in that section was made. To determine the location of each labeled LSO cell (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) within the LSO boundaries and to make comparisons across animals the following steps were taken. A line was drawn, following the contour of the LSO, from the lateral-most extend to the medial-most extent down the LSO centerline (see inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The length of the typically U-shaped line was measured and the location of the labeled cell body was determined relative to its position along the line. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, all the labeled cells were place on a generic straightened LSO with the lateral most LSO point to the left and the medial most point on the right.</p><p>Another criterion for cell type classification in the LSO is the soma’s location relative to the LSO edge/border. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, cells varied in location relative to the curved dorsal and ventral edges, so for each cell a perpendicular line was drawn from the midline through the cell to the LSO edge and the relative distance of the cell along that line measured so it could be properly placed in a generic LSO. Any cells within the margin of the LSO were designated marginal using the criteria of Helfert and Schwartz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Helfert and Schwartz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1987</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data analysis and statistical tests were done using custom scripts written in MATLAB. Statistical analyses of population data were done using statistical tests as mentioned in Results. For parametric tests data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. Exact p values are given. Statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Supplementary text</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Axon collaterals</title><p>It should be emphasized that axon collaterals are often very difficult to distinguish so many of the other illustrated cells may have also displayed collaterals that were missed. No local collaterals in LSO were seen arising from principal cell axons, but the class 5, multiplanar and one of the marginal cells had a ‘local’ collateral which could be seen within the LSO in the immediate vicinity of the labeled cell body. The multiplanar cell local collateral is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> (cell 15): the upper camera lucida is the cell body, dendritic tree and initial part of the main axon (a) and the lower camera lucida is the cell body and the local axon collaterals. E.M. of one of the terminals of this collateral was seen synapsing on another cell body within the LSO with a location and synaptic coverage that indicated it was a marginal cell.</p><p>Perhaps most surprising was that 3 of the labeled cells gave off collaterals that headed to the ipsilateral lateral nucleus of the trapezoid body (LNTB; one of these cells has been reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franken et al., 2016</xref>). Two of these cells were principal cells (cells labeled 2 and 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) and one was the multiplanar cell. All 3 of these cells had main axons that gave off this collateral and then headed into the ipsilateral lateral lemniscus. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref> shows the LNTB collateral of one of the principal cells (1) within the LNTB and illustrates some of the fairly large swellings seen on such collaterals, presumed to be synaptic terminals (white arrow). One of the LNTB collaterals of another principal cell (labeled 5) was embedded in plastic so it was possible to verify this. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B/C</xref> illustrate two of these swellings on the LNTB collateral of the principal cell (2). One (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, white asterisk) synapsed on a large dendrite (d) while the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, white asterisk) synapsed on an LNTB cell body (c.b.) immediately adjacent to a large unlabeled terminal (red outline, black asterisk). That large unlabeled terminal is likely to arise from a globular bushy cell axon that we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franken et al., 2016</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tolbert et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spirou et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spirou and Berrebi, 1996</xref>) have shown to terminate on LNTB cell bodies. Most LSO cells projecting to the ipsilateral IC are glycinergic while most projecting contralaterally are glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saint Marie et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saint Marie and Baker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glendenning et al., 1992</xref>) so it is likely that at least one or more of these LSO to LNTB projections is inhibitory.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Anna Thiessen for her help in performing the electron microscopic analysis, Dr. Eric Verschooten for help with recording and analysis software and Dr. Mark Sayles for help with the regularity analysis.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Catherine Emily Carr as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal their identity: Dan H Sanes (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript approaches an old, once thought to be settled, problem in auditory neuroscience. Principal cells in the lateral superior olive in the auditory brainstem are believed to be the cells that encode the interaural level difference (ILD) cue for sound source localization. These cells had been described as &quot;chopping&quot;, or responding with very regular interspike timing in response to sound. This description of principle LSO cells stood for over 4 decades. The present manuscript upends this notion by using modern in vivo whole cell recording methods. The authors were able to thoroughly examine structure and function in populations of LSO neurons, and report that the principal neurons do not chop in response to sound, but rather respond only to sound onset. These findings necessitate consideration of new coding strategies.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main concern raised by reviewers is that the relationship between the key finding, that LSO principal cells have onset responses, and ILD processing, should be more carefully addressed. From the data, it seems that the principal neurons would be inhibited at most physiological ILDs. There are a number of suggestions about how to address this point in the appended reviews. To summarize, you could first determine whether the recorded phasic neurons represent biologically relevant ILDs. Since the sample size is not large, it seems reasonable to display the ILD function of every recorded neuron plotted as a function of absolute discharge rate, and color coded for phasic versus sustained responders. These functions could be quantified by plotting ILD dynamic range and midpoint (ILD at which discharge rate is 50% of max). Once you have these results, you could decide whether the original argument could be supported. If the analysis justifies a model in which phasic LSO neurons encode ILD, then you could integrate previous evidence for an ILD temporal coding mechanism at stimulus onset. Pollak's in vivo study in bat IC (1988) quantified the transformation of intensity to latency in bats and demonstrated how this could produce ILD functions for brief stimuli. The latency results in the current study (Figure 7) are consistent with a synaptic mechanism explored in gerbil LSO brain slices (Sanes, 1990; Figures 11-12; discussed on p. 3504).</p><p>The consequences of the strong inhibition would be that LSO principal neurons would not be modulated by the ILDs that gerbils would naturally experience for most frequencies, except the very highest portion of their audibility range, which was not sampled here. From Maki and Furukawa (2005; JASA) &quot;…the maximum ILDs for animal No. 521M across all directions were about 5 dB at 5 kHz, 10 dB at 10 kHz, 20-25 dB at 20 kHz, 30-40 dB at 30 kHz and 25-30 dB above 35 kHz.&quot; Based on HRTF measurements in gerbils, the neurons shown in the manuscript would not be modulated by source location except for frequencies greater than 20 kHz. Thus, the suggestion by one reviewer that these 'principal' neurons might be involved in tasks other than localization might need to be discussed more in the manuscript. For example, they could be involved in onset ITD detection and/or envelope ITD detection.</p><p>If the current dataset does not support a role for phasic neurons in ILD coding, there are two general alternatives. It is possible that phasic cells do encode biologically relevant ILDs, but something about the experimental design prevented the authors from observing it. For example, the stimulus paradigm used to assess ILD coding (constant ipsilateral level while varying contralateral level) may not have been ideal since average level was uncontrolled. Another possibility is that there might be something about the experimental preparation (e.g., anesthesia, opening the bullae, etc.) that might cause the phasic-type response?</p><p>Title: You may wish to make your title more broadly accessible, but this could wait until there is a decision on your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper has used in vivo whole cell patch recording and labeling to show that previous studies of the brainstem lateral superior olivary nucleus (LSO) have largely omitted responses from the principal cells. In retrospect this is understandable; in adults these &quot;fast&quot; neurons do not have overshooting action potentials, and thus their spikes are hard to isolate.</p><p>This significant finding shows that LSO neuron fire at stimulus onset, and do not &quot;chop&quot; to the stimulus. This changes how we think about the LSO and how it encodes the interaural loudness differences used for sound localization. These new results move the field forward significantly. They also depend on significant technical expertise.</p><p>It would be useful if the authors could enlarge on Figure 1B, which shows ILD functions, with the trace in red being the highest frequency recorded. These ILD functions show sensitivity steeply distributed around -20dB; please discuss where these ILDs fall within the gerbil's range.</p><p>The distribution of recorded LSO neurons only extends to 10kHz, while gerbil are assumed to have sensitivity to a much wider frequency range. Thus, the author's sample is not comprehensive. Its' likely that the higher frequency arm of the LSO is similar, but the nature of the dataset could be emphasized.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript approaches an old, once thought to be settled, problem in auditory neuroscience. Principal cells comprising the lateral superior olive (LSO) in the auditory brainstem are believed to be the cells that encode the interuaral level difference (ILD) cue to horizontal sound source location. Based on decades-old work, LSO principle cells have been described in terms of their extracellular physiological response characteristics to monaural and binaural sounds. First, in response to monaural sounds at the characteristic frequency (the frequency the cell is 'tuned' to) LSO principle cells respond with a systematic 'chopping' response whereby action potentials are elicited with very regular interspike timing. Second, sound presented to the ear contralateral to the LSO cell are inhibitory, thus giving LSO principle cells their characteristic sensitivity to the ILD cue. This description of principle LSO cells has stood the test of time for over 4 decades. The present manuscript upends this notion. Using modern in vivo whole cell recording methods, the authors were able to more thoroughly examine structure and function in populations of LSO neurons. Here they report that the principle neurons are not in fact the cells that have chopping responses but rather respond only to the onsets of sounds. These results are transformative not only for auditory neuroscience, but by shining a spotlight on possible sources of bias in such studies, there is likely wider appeal to all of systems neuroscience.</p><p>The study appears to be carefully conducted and builds on methods that the groups has developed, used and published before. The results support the stated hypotheses. Amazingly I have little to comment on. The paper is well written. I have just a few questions.</p><p>First, was there any observation of ipsilateral inhibition? I am thinking of the classic study of Brownell, Manis and Ritz (1979) in unanesthetized cat that showed clear ipsilateral inhibition in vivo. Moreover, the in vitro work of Banks and also Wu.</p><p>The notion that the primary neurons in the LSO might act more akin to medial superior olive (MSO) neurons in terms of temporal processing is interesting. There are some recent modeling reports from Go Ashida (PLoS Computational Biology) that are entirely consistent with the type of LSO neurons describe here. An interesting aspect of the Ashida LSO model is that ILD sensitivity is essentially an emergent property of the exquisite temporal sensitivity, which is consistent with the observation in the manuscript where the timing of excitation and inhibition seems to be the reason for ILD sensitivity in the principal cells. Very neat.</p><p>That LSO principle cells act as temporal differentiators also fits with several observations regarding the temporal processing of sound by neurons comprising the LSO afferents. In particular the globular bushy cells and the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), the limb of the circuit that provides inhibition to LSO, exhibit exquisite temporal precision to not only low-frequency sounds (Tollin and Yin, 2005; J Neuroscience) but also the low frequency envelopes of high frequency amplitude modulated sounds (Joris LSO AM epapers). These well-timed inputs are more consistent functionally with the temporal differentiator principle neurons describe here rather than the 'classic' temporal integrators of old.</p><p>Finally, I think that it would be of value to the field to quantify the rate-ILD functions (eg Figure 1B) so that these characteristics can be compared to the classic literature. For example, for each neuron what was the dynamic ILD range, half maximum rate ILD, and rate-ILD slope. The examples plotted in Figure 1B look much steeper and located a more negative half maximal ILDs than neurons in the literature. Inhibition appears to be much stronger here than in prior papers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The data and analyses from this study demonstrate that a population of lateral superior olivary neurons display transient responses to tones. This type of study is extremely demanding, and is rarely encountered for any region of the nervous system. In this case, the quality of the data is particularly high, and I have only praise for the data collected and the sophisticated, thorough analyses. The authors conclude that the most common type of LSO neuron (principal cell morphology with onset responses) has been markedly under-sampled in all previous in vivo electrophysiology studies, leading to a misunderstanding about the role of this nucleus in binaural processing. The paper makes a good case for this conclusion by arguing that the small action potential amplitude of onset cells likely caused investigators to miss or dismiss this type of LSO neuron. As discussed below, my primary reservations are: (1) whether the percentage of onset cells can be established by the current findings, and (2) whether onset cells encode azimuthal position or some other sound attribute (which would tend to sustain the role of LSO discharge rate in ILD encoding).</p><p>Some characteristics of the data set raise concerns about the degree of support for the authors' major interpretation. First, the sample draws from a relatively narrow range of the mediolateral axis. Most of the low frequency lateral limb (&lt;2kHz) and the high frequency medial limb (&gt;10kHz) are unsampled. A second issue relates to the anatomical criteria and how much emphasis should be placed on structure-function relationships. LSO dendritic morphology varies with tonotopic position (J Comp Neurol 294:443), including the hilus where axon bundles appear to orient dendritic branches and the lateral limb where dendrites are more spread out. While the Helfert and Schwartz (1987) paper is strong on many grounds, it must be acknowledged that their study did not present adequate reconstructions of any cell type (their Figure 2). Put another way, it is impossible to know what the variance was for cells characterized as principal or type 5 in the Helfert study. Therefore, I am less confident about using the Helfert paper as a critical basis for the current set of interpretations. A related issue is that the present study has a lower percentage of principal plus class 5 cells (the latter are apparently only distinguishable at the EM level as having fewer somatic synapses), as compared to Helfert. This could be due either to the necessary limits in sample size for this type of study, but there could also be discrepancies in categorization. For neurons categorized as principal and/or class 5, four of ten apparently have no PSTH, one has a large action potential, and one has sustained activity. What are the authors thoughts on these issues?</p><p>Another issue arises in regard to the ILD functions which appear to be markedly shifted towards the ipsilateral side (Figure 1B), in comparison to many of the previous reports cited by the authors. The dynamic range of all but one neuron is devoted to level differences more negative than -20 dB which would be largely outside of the natural range. What is the difference between ILD processing by onset versus sustained neurons in terms of azimuthal range? What is the cell type associated with each of the plotted ILD functions (perhaps a color could be used to identify cells with onset responses)? What do these functions look like when plotted against firing rate instead of normalized firing rate? This might clarify the difference between neurons with onset spikes, onset followed by low level sustained firing, and primary or chopper responses. If very few of the recorded LSO neurons can represent biologically relevant azimuthal sound locations based on level difference, then the implication of these findings for the role of LSO in sound localization (or other percepts) is unclear. Sound localization appears to require an intact superior olive (J Neurophysiol 47:987; J Neurophysiol 67:1643; Behav Neurosci 112:432) even though IC neuron ILD functions are robust to superior olivary lesions and can be created de novo (Hear Res 61:73; Brain Res 572:5; J Neurosci 13:2050). Whether or not LSO onset cells form the major LSO cell type, do they have a plausible role in ILD perception?</p><p>The above issues illustrate uncertainties about the relationship between the current data set and the many previous reports on LSO physiology, especially whether the findings support the proposed revision to LSO function. The unambiguous, new finding is that LSO contains a significant number of neurons that respond phasically, and these cells project to the inferior colliculus. Less certain is the assertion that onset neurons are the major LSO cell type that represents ILD, and the inference that all previous studies characterized a minor fraction of LSO cells and reached the errant conclusion that ILD processing (in LSO) is primarily encoded by firing rate. It would seem appropriate to test the authors' prediction with a sufficiently powered extracellular study that samples from the full tonotopic axis, and that makes a point of assessing the percentage of onset responses and their relationship to the representation of ILD or some other stimulus feature.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Principal cells of the brainstem's interaural sound level detector are temporal differentiators rather than integrators&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Their remarks and suggestions were very valuable to us and have helped us to improve the analysis of the data and discussion of the results in the manuscript.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that more extensive analysis of ILD functions is warranted. We have added a new Figure 9, with the population data of ILD functions (more data than in the former Figure 1B where only ILD functions of 11 labeled cells where shown), and show these as absolute spike rates, separately for the onset and post-onset part of the response. These data confirm that ILD-sensitivity of principal cells is limited to sound onset. In Figure 9C we show the ILD at 50% spike rate and ILD range, as suggested by the reviewers. The data shows that there is no significant difference for these metrics between principal and non-principal cells.</p><p>Indeed our sample includes a large portion of functions with slopes at rather negative ILDs. We compare this to published gerbil data from Sanes and Rubel, 1988. We think that the most likely explanation for the bias of ILD-functions towards rather negative ILDs is in our choice of a high ipsilateral level to obtain the ILD function. This observation, that the position of ILD functions is not constant as a function of ipsilateral level but “marches leftward” with increases in the ipsilateral level, is an observation that has been repeatedly made. For example, a classical study by Tsuchitani and Boudreau, 1969 shows that most LSO neurons show a decrease in firing rate if the ILD is kept constant but both ipsi- and contralateral level are increased. Similar observations were made by Park et al., 2004 and Tsai et al., 2010 (full references in manuscript). We have limited data that support this finding that higher ipsilateral sound levels can shift the slope towards more negative ILDs: these are now provided as a supplementary figure (see Figure 9—figure supplement 1). Another possibility that we see has to do, as suggested by the reviewers, with the technique to approach the SOC, which requires opening of the middle ear space (see Materials and methods). We were careful to symmetrize the exposure of the bullas and to keep the middle ears clear, but we cannot exclude asymmetries caused by recording on only one side (e.g. seepage of CSF into the ipsilateral hidden dorsal middle ear cavity) causing an attenuation of the ipsilateral sound level, which would cause a shift of ILD curves towards negative ILDs. Note however that systematic threshold differences were not observed in a study of monaural fibers in the trapezoid body which used a similar recording approach (Wei et al., 2017). We added these statements (re. effect of ipsilateral level, and possibility of acoustic asymmetry due to recording) to the manuscript.</p><p>At a more general level, while agreeing that there are many questions left to be answered in the LSO circuit, we are not too concerned about the bias of ILD-functions towards negative ILDs. First, there is no such thing as an absolute physiological range of ILDs. For example, ILDs increase at closer distances of the sound source. The data reported by Maki and Furakawa do not allow to infer any level-dependent changes to the physiological range for ILD. Second, the specific technical restrictions of the experimental technique used, in particular the opening of the bullas, do not make this the best preparation to study the issues raised by the reviewers. A more functionally (rather than mechanistically) oriented study would explore the binaural interaction with stimuli that are more natural in spectrum, timing, and binaural levels (e.g. where the average binaural level is constant, as suggested by one of the reviewers). This is probably best done using a virtual space approach in a preparation with intact middle ears.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the latency results are consistent with in vitro and in vivo data in the literature, and have added to the Discussion to point this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Title: You may wish to make your title more broadly accessible, but this could wait until there is a decision on your ms.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the title really captures the main message with a minimal number of words, and is broadly accessible for a scientific audience, but we are open for suggestions for changes.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>This paper has used</italic> in vivo <italic>whole cell patch recording and labeling to show that previous studies of the brainstem lateral superior olivary nucleus (LSO) have largely omitted responses from the principal cells.

Thus, the author's sample is not comprehensive. Its' likely that the higher frequency arm of the LSO is similar, but the nature of the dataset could be emphasized.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for the restricted range of CFs is due to our approach to the nucleus. In brain slice experiments it is possible to insert the electrode anywhere in the body of a nucleus and to select cells based on their location relative to the boundaries of the LSO. In our in vivo experiments we made a ventral-to- dorsal approach to the LSO with the patch electrodes. This approach allows only a limited range of angles of electrode penetration, because there are several vital structures that cannot be breached (eardrum, venous sinus in medial wall of bulla). This means that our initial contact was always with the ventral margin of the nucleus and increases the chances that our first encounter will be with a non-principal marginal cell. After recording from and potentially labeling a cell the electrode is typically withdrawn and the rest of the nucleus not penetrated. As can be seen from our Figure 2 showing labeled cells, roughly 1 out of 4 of our cells were marginal (because that’s what we hit first) compared to Helfert and Schwartz who reported that roughly 1 out of 16 LSO cells were marginal cells.</p><p>We have added a paragraph to Discussion to highlight this issue. As reviewer 3 suggests, additional work is necessary to more fully sample along the tonotopic axis, but one has to keep in mind that extracellular recording techniques appear to undersample principal cells. As of today, we do not see a workable technique to obtain an unbiased characterization of the different response types in this nucleus: it will likely require an (as yet unavailable) imaging technique with very high spatial and temporal resolution.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>This manuscript approaches an old, once thought to be settled, problem in auditory neuroscience. Principal cells comprising the lateral superior olive (LSO) in the auditory brainstem are believed to be the cells that encode the interuaral level difference (ILD) cue to horizontal sound source location. Based on decades-old work, LSO principle cells have been described in terms of their extracellular physiological response characteristics to monaural and binaural sounds. First, in response to monaural sounds at the characteristic frequency (the frequency the cell is 'tuned' to) LSO principle cells respond with a systematic 'chopping' response whereby action potentials are elicited with very regular interspike timing. Second, sound presented to the ear contralateral to the LSO cell are inhibitory, thus giving LSO principle cells their characteristic sensitivity to the ILD cue. This description of principle LSO cells has stood the test of time for over 4 decades. The present manuscript upends this notion. Using modern</italic> in vivo whole cell recording methods, the authors were able to more thoroughly examine structure and function in populations of LSO neurons. Here they report that the principle neurons are not in fact the cells that have chopping responses but rather respond only to the onsets of sounds. These results are transformative not only for auditory neuroscience, but by shining a spotlight on possible sources of bias in such studies, there is likely wider appeal to all of systems neuroscience.</p><p>The study appears to be carefully conducted and builds on methods that the groups has developed, used and published before. The results support the stated hypotheses. Amazingly I have little to comment on. The paper is well written. I have just a few questions.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>First, was there any observation of ipsilateral inhibition?

LSO cell dendritic trees were reconstructed from Golgi-stained cells in 120 micron sections and as a result much of the tree was often not available. In addition, the Helfert and Schwartz electron microscopic evaluation of different cell types was not done on their Golgi labeled cells, where at least some of the features of the dendritic tree could be used. Instead, they looked at unlabeled cells and based their cell-type classification on the orientation of the dendrites as they came off the cell body and on the shape and location of the cell body. In addition, because the class 5 cells were not distinguishable from principal cells at the light microscopic level and because they did not do an unbiased sampling of principal vs. class 5 cells at the E.M. level it is impossible to know the relative percentages of the 2 cell classes. Qualitatively they simply indicated that the class 5 class constituted a much lower percentage. Unfortunately, our sample is too small to add anything to help resolve this question. Despite these indications that this is not an “ideal” study for comparison with our data, we do feel it is the best available choice. First the data is collected from the same species and second this is the only paper that we are aware of where electron microscopic features are used as criteria for cell subtypes. There is a nice LSO development paper that also evaluates cell types in the rat by Rietzel and Friauf (1998) where they used electrode-labeled LSO cells with more of the dendritic tree intact and did a more quantitative evaluation of LSO cell classes but unfortunately it was from a different species and no electron microscopic evaluation of the cells was made. There is also a nice paper (Sanes et al., 1990) that does a careful quantitative evaluation of dendritic configurations of gerbil LSO cells and their differences at different LSO locations but this paper focused on the principal cell class and no electron microscopy was done.

We added a phrase to results to emphasize this. This would affect especially the measurement of large action potentials (thus non-principal cells) and therefore would make the measured difference between principal and non-principal cells’ action potential amplitudes smaller than it actually is.

For example, &quot;Level difference is processed by parallel circuits that temporally resolve or integrate synaptic inputs.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We find that our title &quot;Principal cells of the brainstem's interaural sound level detector are temporal differentiators rather than integrators&quot; better captures the essence of our study. The title suggested by the reviewer has a somewhat different conceptual emphasis but we believe the processes of differentiation and integration are conceptually equally important and appealing to draw reader attention.</p></body></sub-article></article>
