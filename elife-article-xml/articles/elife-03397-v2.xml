genome is punctuated by CpG islands (CGIs), which differ sharply from the bulk genome by being rich in G + C and the dinucleotide CpG. CGIs often include transcription initiation sites and display ‘active’ histone marks, notably histone H3 lysine 4 methylation. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs) some CGIs adopt a ‘bivalent’ chromatin state bearing simultaneous ‘active’ and ‘inactive’ chromatin marks. To determine whether CGI chromatin is developmentally programmed at specific genes or is imposed by shared features of CGI DNA, we integrated artificial CGI-like DNA sequences into the ESC genome. We found that bivalency is the default chromatin structure for CpG-rich, G + C-rich DNA. A high CpG density alone is not sufficient for this effect, as A + T-rich sequence settings invariably provoke de novo DNA methylation leading to loss of CGI signature chromatin. We conclude that both CpG-richness and G + C-richness are required for induction of signature chromatin structures at CGIs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03397.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03397.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03397.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The building blocks of DNA are four molecules commonly named ‘A’, ‘T’, ‘C’ and ‘G’. The order of these DNA letters in a gene contains the instructions to make specific proteins or other molecules. Other stretches of DNA contain codes that direct the cell's machinery to genes that need to be switched on or switched off. The start of a gene, for example, has a stretch of DNA called a promoter, which is where the molecular machinery that switches on the gene is assembled.</p><p>A human cell can contain over two and half metres of DNA. To get this length to fit inside the cell, the DNA is wrapped tightly around proteins to form a structure called chromatin. However, this packing can make it difficult to access the right gene at the right time. As such, chromatin is often marked with small chemical tags that earmark which genes should be either activated or inactivated, and/or that cause the DNA to unpack.</p><p>Most gene promoters contain a sequence of DNA with many Cs and Gs found one after the other, called a CpG island. Researchers have previously shown that the chromatin of CpG islands has two types of chemical markings—one that normally marks active genes, and another that often marks inactive genes. It was suggested that having both kinds of markings allows CpG islands to prime nearby genes, so that they are ready to be quickly switched on or off as the cell develops. However, the features of the DNA sequence in these CpG islands that are important for this process had not been directly tested.</p><p>Wachter et al. have now inserted an artificial DNA sequence that included a CpG island into mouse stem cells. The chromatin around these CpG islands was readily marked with both activating and inactivating chemical marks. Furthermore, by changing the sequence of the artificial DNA, Wachter et al. revealed that these chemical marks were only added when the DNA sequences contained a lot of Cs followed by Gs. Other artificial sequences with lots of Cs and Gs, but where Gs were rarely found immediately after the Cs, had neither of the two chemical marks on the chromatin. This suggests that nearby genes would be harder to locate and activate as the cell grows and develops. On the other hand, when the DNA contained a lot of As and Ts, the chemical marks were added directly to the DNA (rather than to the chromatin)—and this prevented both the activating and the inactivating chemical marks being added to the chromatin.</p><p>Now that the common features of CpG islands that influence chromatin are known, the next step is to find out how this is achieved. Further work will be needed to uncover which proteins in a cell interpret these DNA sequence such that nearby genes can be switched on or off.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03397.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03397.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>CpG island</kwd><kwd>histone modification</kwd><kwd>bivalent chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT091580</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wachter</surname><given-names>Elisabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Quante</surname><given-names>Timo</given-names></name><name><surname>Merusi</surname><given-names>Cara</given-names></name><name><surname>Arczewska</surname><given-names>Aleksandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Webb</surname><given-names>Shaun</given-names></name><name><surname>Bird</surname><given-names>Adrian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Curie Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>627442 ATRUN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quante</surname><given-names>Timo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT086659</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wachter</surname><given-names>Elisabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT092076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wachter</surname><given-names>Elisabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Quante</surname><given-names>Timo</given-names></name><name><surname>Merusi</surname><given-names>Cara</given-names></name><name><surname>Arczewska</surname><given-names>Aleksandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Webb</surname><given-names>Shaun</given-names></name><name><surname>Bird</surname><given-names>Adrian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT84637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wachter</surname><given-names>Elisabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Quante</surname><given-names>Timo</given-names></name><name><surname>Merusi</surname><given-names>Cara</given-names></name><name><surname>Arczewska</surname><given-names>Aleksandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genomic landmarks, known generically as ‘CpG islands’, program chromatin structure via their richness in the dinucleotide CG and their skewed composition of DNA bases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CpG islands (CGIs) are stretches of atypical genomic DNA sequences that mark most gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bird, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deaton and Bird, 2011</xref>). Though individually unique in nucleotide sequence, mammalian CGIs share two features that often correlate but can vary independently: a G + C-rich base composition (65% vs 40% for the bulk genome) and high density of the dinucleotide CpG (5–10-fold higher than the bulk genome). Whereas bulk genomic DNA is globally methylated, CGIs associated with promoters invariably lack DNA methylation. It has been proposed that CGIs function as generic platforms for gene regulation, probably via proteins that bind to CpG and influence chromatin modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackledge and Klose, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deaton and Bird, 2011</xref>). This hypothesis has gained credence due to accumulating evidence that enrichment or depletion of specific chromatin marks at CGIs is linked to proteins that bind to unmethylated CpG. So far, all such proteins possess CXXC zinc finger domains that bind specifically to the CpG dyad in duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). Cfp1, for example, is a CXXC domain-containing component of the Set1/COMPASS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee and Skalnik, 2005</xref>), which generates H3K4 methylation, a signature chromatin mark at non-methylated CGIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guenther et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, Cfp1 is concentrated at CGIs as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and its absence is associated with reduced H3K4 methylation at many CGIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clouaire et al., 2012</xref>). The H3K4 methyltransferases Mll1 and Mll2 are also CXXC proteins and each is found at CGIs in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as determined by ChIP-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denissov et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly the CXXC domain-containing proteins Kdm2a and Kdm2b are enriched at CGIs. Kdm2a is an H3K36 demethylase that contributes to depletion of H3K36me at CGI promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>), whereas Kdm2b facilitates recruitment of the PRC1 complex to transcriptionally silent CGIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that CGI-like DNA sequences can impose an altered chromatin state in ESCs. Promoter-less CGI-like DNA sequences of invertebrate origin in mouse ES cells were initially shown to cause local enrichment of trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) and to recruit the CpG binding protein Cfp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>). Similar experiments using G + C-rich DNA derived from bacteria created chromatin marked by both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mendenhall et al., 2010</xref>). Whereas H3K4me3 is characteristic of active promoters, H3K27me3 is associated with transcriptional repression via the polycomb complex. The coincidence of these two marks in so-called ‘bivalent’ chromatin is thought to be a feature of genes that are poised to become either active or silent during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azuara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Voigt et al., 2013</xref>). Many native CGIs in ESCs adopt a ‘bivalent’ chromatin structure when transcriptionally silent.</p><p>Despite evidence that CXXC proteins play a role at CGIs, the hypothesis that CpG density is the critical determinant of CGI function has not been directly tested. Here we vary the DNA sequence composition of artificial promoter-less CGIs to assess the relative importance of G + C-richness and high CpG density. Our assay relies upon chromosomal integration of artificial CGI-like sequences into the genome of ESCs. We show that a bivalent chromatin configuration and absence of DNA methylation represent the default state of biologically inert CGI-like DNA sequences. While a high CpG density is essential, it is not sufficient to guarantee the bivalent chromatin structure, as CpG-rich DNA sequences with a G + C-poor average base composition do not acquire this chromatin signature. In fact A + T-rich, G + C poor insertions with a CpG frequency matching that of CGIs consistently become DNA methylated in ESCs, although the bivalent configuration can be restored if the dominant DNA methylation is removed. Our findings demonstrate that CpG-richness is essential for the formation of bivalent chromatin, whereas G + C-richness is required to exclude DNA methylation, which when present is dominant over the other chromatin marks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formation of a novel bivalent domain at artificial CGI-like sequences</title><p>Comparison between CGIs and an equivalent number of sequences from the bulk genome shows that both CpG frequency and G + C richness are distinct in CGIs compared with bulk genomic DNA of mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A previous study showed that bacterial DNA with CGI-like features organised bivalent chromatin in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mendenhall et al., 2010</xref>). In order to verify and extend this result we introduced CGI-like DNA sequences of ∼1000 nucleotide pairs (the average length of native CGIs) into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing a human ‘gene desert’ using recombineering (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A computer-generated CGI-like sequence (Artificial CGI 1) was designed with a CpG frequency of one per ∼10 base pairs and a base composition of 65% G + C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

All constructs lack a promoter, allowing us to focus on the interaction between DNA sequence and chromatin modification without the complicating involvement of transcription.

It is possible that some cells in the population harbour an integrant marked by only one of these marks whereas other cells possess only the other mark. This configuration has not been detected at the few ESC bivalent domains tested so far. More likely is that the two marks are interspersed at a given bivalent sequence domain, though we did not test this experimentally (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Voigt et al., 2013</xref>). The levels of H3K4me3 at the artificial CGI were similar to those at the endogenous bivalent gene <italic>Hoxc8</italic>, whereas H3K4me3 levels in the DNA sequences flanking the CGI were unaffected by the insertion. H3K27me3 was less discrete, spreading variably into flanking regions of the human BAC, but Suz12, a component of the PRC2 complex that deposits the H3K27me3 mark, was tightly localised to the CGI-like sequence in each case. We tested an unrelated artificial CGI-like sequence with similar overall sequence properties (Artificial CGI 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), this time integrated at a recombination cassette within the beta globin locus of mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lienert et al., 2011</xref>). Independent replicate stable transformant cell lines again showed consistent presence of a bivalent chromatin structure (data not shown). The DNA methylation status of the integrated artificial CGIs was investigated by bisulfite sequencing. This showed that all the insertions reproducibly maintained a low level of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). DNA methylation levels at CGI-like sequences inserted into the gene desert (∼10%) were consistently somewhat higher than in the cassette exchange system (0.5%) and were somewhat higher than an endogenous control CGI in the same DNA samples (<italic>Dlx5</italic>; ∼4–5%, data not shown). Despite this variability, it is evident that all of these artificial DNA sequences maintain a largely non-methylated status.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>H3K4me3 at an artificial CGI is independent of Cfp1 and RNA polymerase II</title><p>To test whether these promoter-less artificial DNA sequences were transcriptionally inert, we performed ChIP with antibodies recognising three differentially phosphorylated forms of RNA polymerase II in replicate cell lines.

Having verified that a bivalent domain was formed at the artificial CGI in these cells (data not shown), ChIP was performed on three independent cell lines using an anti-GFP antibody. We consistently observed discrete enrichment of Cfp1 at the CGI-like insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

To ensure that histone modifying enzyme activities are not disrupted in the <italic>Dnmt 3a/3b</italic> double knock out cells, we generated stable cell lines with the artificial CGI-containing BAC and confirmed that a bivalent domain was observed over the insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). When the High CpG /High A + T construct was introduced into Dnmt 3a/3b knock out cells it now remained unmethylated, and importantly, bivalent chromatin was detected at the inserted sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We noticed that H3K4me3 was reproducibly weaker than controls in <italic>Dnmt 3a/Dnmt 3b</italic> double mutant cells, whereas a robust H3K27me3 signal was obtained. This may indicate that A + T-rich DNA is less able to recruit H3K4me3 despite its high CpG density. The dominance of the polycomb-associated H3K27me3 mark at A + T-rich CGIs was also seen when DNA methylation was partially reduced by growing cells for 10 days in 2i medium, which enhances the pluripotent state. In line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ficz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Habibi et al., 2013</xref>), we found that the average level of genomic CpG methylation was reduced from ∼95% to ∼55% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Whereas cells grown in serum-containing medium lacked both the tested histone marks, 2i-grown cells displayed a strong increase in H3K27me3 without the appearance of noticeable H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We conclude that while CpG frequency is a key feature of CGIs that determines the signature chromatin marks at CGIs, A + T-richness confers an intrinsic susceptibility to de novo methylation that is dominant over these chromatin modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Status of endogenous DNA domains with atypical CpG or G + C composition</title><p>Our study assessed the role of G + C-richness vs CpG-richness on chromatin structure by experimentally varying these sequence parameters individually in synthetic DNA domains. The question arises: do equivalent atypical sequences exist naturally in the mouse genome and if so what is their chromatin modification status? We searched first for G + C-rich (≥61%), CpG deficient (≤1/100 bp) sequences of ≥500 bp in length and identified 1954 examples. None of these coincided with bivalent chromatin in ESCs, in agreement with our results using synthetic DNA. To determine if A + T-rich, CpG-rich sequences also exist naturally in mice, we divided the genome into windows of 100 bp and calculated the G + C content and CpG density of each. To ensure that we selected regions with profiles consistently above the thresholds (as is the case for our artificial constructs) rather than short CpG dense regions flanked by AT rich DNA, we subtracted windows with ≥50% GC content or &lt;5 CpGs and searched for blocks of adjoining windows. Uniformly A + T-rich and CpG-rich DNA sequences of this kind were absent in the mouse genome. Even when the criteria were relaxed to include sequences of only 500 base pairs in length (the approximate minimum size of CGIs), we found no examples. As A + T-rich regions are consistently DNA methylated, it seems likely that, in the absence of strong selection, the high mutation rate of 5-methylcytosine effectively resists CpG accumulation at these domains over evolutionary time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Epigenetic marks are often considered to be sensitive to both developmental and environmental signals. Our data reinforce the complementary view that the underlying genetic information, independent of nurture or developmental history, plays an important role in setting up CGI chromatin structures. In ESCs at least, each of the major CGI chromatin configurations is informed by DNA sequence. We find that the non-methylated state of CGIs depends on G + C-rich base composition and that both the signature histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 depend on a high density of the non-methylated CpG dyad. The importance of primary DNA sequence in determining bulk features of the epigenome have been suggested elsewhere. For example, DNA sequence motifs that are recognised by transcription factors strongly influence DNA methylation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lienert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>) and inter-individual variation in other epigenomic features maps to sites of human DNA sequence heterogeneity that are probably causal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kilpinen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McVicker et al., 2013</xref>). Our data show that even gross features of genomic DNA, such as base composition and the frequency of the 2-base pair sequence CpG, influence the epigenome.</p><p>Do our findings reflect the relationship between naturally occurring DNA sequences and chromatin modification? Almost all native CGIs in mouse ESCs are non-methylated at the DNA level and coincide with peaks of H3K4me3, which is often seen as the signature histone mark of CGIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>). About one third of the H3K4me3-marked CGIs in mouse ES cells also carry H3K27me3 and are therefore defined as bivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ku et al., 2008</xref>). H3K27me3 is usually relatively dispersed compared with the discrete localisation of components of the PRC2 complex, which deposit this mark. It is estimated that at least 97% of peaks corresponding to the PRC2 component Ezh2 coincide with CGIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ku et al., 2008</xref>). This has led to the suggestion that polycomb is targeted to G + C-rich or CpG-rich DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mendenhall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Long et al., 2013</xref>). It was shown previously that CpG density within the non-methylated CGI fraction as a whole is proportional to the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq signal in both mouse and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Illingworth et al., 2010</xref>). We asked whether the same relationship holds true for bivalent CGIs and whether it also applies to H3K27me3. Within a set of 2547 exclusively bivalent promoters from mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denissov et al., 2014</xref>), we found that 92% coincide with CGIs. Within this bivalent group, CGI length and CpG density both correlate positively with H3K4me3 and also H3K27me3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast to typical CGI-like sequences, endogenous G + C-rich, CpG-poor sequences do not display a bivalent chromatin structure. A + T-rich, CpG-rich domains of CGI-like dimensions, however, are effectively absent from the mouse genome. The sum of available data argues strongly that a high abundance of the dinucleotide CpG is a key precondition for the formation of bivalent chromatin.</p><p>A possible mechanism for recruitment of H3K4me3 involves DNA binding by H3K4 methyltransferases, each of which is associated with a CpG-binding CXXC domain. In Mll1 and Mll2 the DNA binding domains are within the SET-containing protein themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cierpicki et al., 2010</xref>), whereas in the case of Set1/COMPASS the CXXC domain resides in the Cfp1 protein component of the multi-subunit complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee and Skalnik, 2005</xref>). The H3K4me3 component of bivalent CGIs in ESCs depends on Mll2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denissov et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, we have found that bivalent CGIs form normally in <italic>Cfp1</italic>−/− ES cells. Since the binding of the CXXC domain to CpG is abolished by methylation of the cytosine moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2001</xref>), this may explain why DNA methylation prevents the formation of H3K4me3 even in the presence of high CpG densities. The mechanism responsible for recruiting PRC2, which is the complex responsible for the establishment of H3K27me3, remains uncertain, as no CpG binding component of PRC2 has yet been detected. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). A recent study, however, indicates that the CXXC-domain protein KDM2B can target the PRC1 complex to CGIs and recruit PRC2 secondarily, which would accord with our findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Bivalent chromatin has attracted attention due to the proposal that it represents a poised transcriptional state in pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Voigt et al., 2013</xref>). It is suggested that the poised state is resolved during differentiation as the affected gene becomes either transcriptionally activated or repressed. Recent evidence has clearly established that H3K27me and H3K4me can be present on the same nucleosome, albeit on different histone tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>). The biological significance of bivalent chromatin has recently become less certain, however. Whereas silent CGI promoters in ESCs grown in serum usually exhibit a bivalent chromatin structure, this chromatin configuration is significantly reduced in 2i medium, which discourages differentiation and is thought to induce a more pronounced pluripotent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marks et al., 2012</xref>). Also, cells in which the histone methyltransferase Mll2 is depleted lose H3K4me3 at hitherto bivalent CGIs, but this has no detectable effect on the induction kinetics of the associated genes upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). The evidence remains inconclusive, but it raises the possibility that bivalency is not an essential precondition for gene activation during differentiation. Here we find that bivalency is not confined to poised developmental genes but is a default response to any CpG-rich DNA sequences, even when these are completely artificial. It is apparent from this that the bivalent chromatin structure is not reserved for developmentally important genes, but is a response to general features of local DNA sequence.</p><p>Bulk mammalian DNA has a base composition of 40% G + C and is globally methylated at CpGs to an average level of ∼65%, whereas G + C-rich CGIs are usually DNA methylation-free. The transfection experiments reported here recapitulate this distinction as G + C-rich CGI-like DNA reproducibly resisted DNA methylation, whereas A + T-rich DNA reliably became densely methylated. Our findings raise the possibility that this broadly binary pattern of global DNA methylation may be determined by base composition. CpG density did not affect this susceptibility to methylation, which occurred even when CpG occurred at densities typical of endogenous CGIs. Two simple alternative explanations are possible: either A + T-rich DNA attracts de novo methylation, or G + C-richness excludes it, leaving the bulk genome to be methylated by default. Both Dnmt 3L and Dnmt 3A have the potential to be repelled by H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ooi et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that recruitment of H3K4 methyltransferases with CpG-binding CXXC domains protects CGIs against de novo methylation. We find, however, that A + T-rich CpG-rich sequences are reproducibly DNA methylated despite their ability to attract H3K4me3 when DNA methylation is absent. Since these sequences were initially non-methylated when transfected into cells, it may be that H3K4me3 alone is not sufficient to exclude CpG methylation from these regions. This would accord with our previous observation that a moderately G + C-rich artificial CGI when inserted into ES cells was extensively methylated despite the presence of H3K4me3 on non-methylated copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, A + T-rich CpG-rich sequences may attract H3K4me3 less robustly than G + C-rich CGIs, thereby allowing access to de novo DNA methyltransferases.</p><p>The CGI phenomenon is conserved throughout the vertebrate lineage, but interestingly the G + C-richness characteristic of mammalian and bird CGIs is not seen in some vertebrate groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Long et al., 2013</xref>). Fish for example have non-methylated CGI-like sequences at promoters, but these are not markedly G + C-rich compared with the bulk genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cross et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Long et al., 2013</xref>). Since A + T-rich sequences are susceptible to de novo DNA methylation in mammals, it follows that some vertebrate groups may rely on a different set of mechanisms to prevent methylation at G + C-poor CGIs. Identifying potential components that discriminate between mammalian CGIs and the bulk genome is a priority for future work.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse ES cell lines</title><p>ES cells were grown in gelatinized dishes in Glasgow MEM (Gibco, UK) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone; Fisher Scientific, UK), 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 100U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF).

We also added a new supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In the Results section we have now identified a set of G+C-rich/CpG-poor sequences and found that these never coincide with bivalent chromatin domains.</p><p>On the other hand uniformly A+T-rich, CpG rich sequences like those used in our experiments do not occur in the genome, even when we relaxed the criteria considerably. Therefore we cannot ask if DNA methylation deficiency at these regions leads to the appearance of bivalent chromatin. Overall we hope it is clear that our approach to understanding the parameters that mediate the effects of CGIs on chromatin structure required us to vary each parameter in a way that may not occur naturally. Importantly though, our assay was conducted in vivo in ESCs using stably integrated sequences. The setting for our analysis is therefore native, even though the sequences themselves are unusual.</p><p>In the Discussion paragraph we collate evidence that the great majority of bivalent regions in ESCs are CGIs, and we have performed a new analysis of published data to show that the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in bivalent CGIs correlate positively with CGI length and CpG density (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>). The available data align well with our results and previous evidence that CpGs are required to recruit both these chromatin marks to bivalent domains.</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref><italic>: Although generally unmethylated, the artificial CGI1 shows a high basal level of methylation (7-12%), which could reflect either real methylation or incomplete bisulfite conversion. This should be clarified, either by improving and repeating the bisulfite conversion/PCR/cloning or by measuring methylation at an endogenous control CGIs</italic>.</p><p>We repeated the bisulfite sequencing for these cell lines using as an internal control a region of the <italic>Dlx5</italic> CpG island, which we had previously shown to have a low level of DNA methylation (&lt;5%). The results closely reproduced the DNA methylation levels reported in this manuscript and they showed lower levels of methylation at the <italic>Dlx5</italic> CGI as expected (see data below). Therefore, the somewhat higher-than-expected level of methylation at these artificial CGIs is replicated and is not due to incomplete bisulfite conversion (conversion levels averaged 98%). We now point out in the Results section that methylation of these artificial CGI-like sequences in a gene desert setting is somewhat higher than at an endogenous CGI in the same cells. In our opinion 10% methylation nevertheless qualifies as hypomethylated compared with the genome-wide average of ∼70%. Therefore this modest level of DNA methylation does not affect the conclusion that these sequences are hypomethylated. We do not plan to add the new bisulfite data to the manuscript.<table-wrap id="tblu1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Percentage of CpG methylation in amplicons</th><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td/><td>Control CGI</td><td>ArtificialCGI (New data)</td><td>ArtificialCGI (previous data)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line 1</td><td>3.9</td><td>8.5</td><td>9.2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line 2</td><td>5.0</td><td>7.9</td><td>7.2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line 3</td><td>4.5</td><td>12.5</td><td>12.4</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>can the authors comment on the variability of ChIP enrichments (H3K4me3 ChIP and Suz12 ChIP) obtained in the 3 cell lines?</italic></p><p>We acknowledge that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the proportions of input DNA that are immunoprecipitated in different cell lines vary over a wide range. The reason is that these studies were not carried out in parallel, but over almost 12 months, using chromatin samples prepared at different times and assayed with different antibodies (often from different suppliers) with varying affinities. In particular, deletion of the neomycin cassette in cell line 3 initially failed and there was a delay while this step was repeated during which we had to switch H3K4me3 antibodies. In our opinion the interpretation of the results is not compromised by the observed variability, which in our hands is inherent to ChIP experiments on samples of diverse origin with changing reagents. The important point with respect to our conclusions is that the relative values of control and experimental data points are consistent between experiments even when absolute precipitation levels vary. We now draw attention to the variability in the Results section and offer a brief explanation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
