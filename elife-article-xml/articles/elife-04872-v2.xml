stress response (ISR). In animals, the ISR is antagonised by selective eIF2α phosphatases comprising a catalytic protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) subunit in complex with a PPP1R15-type regulatory subunit. An unbiased search for additional conserved components of the PPP1R15-PP1 phosphatase identified monomeric G-actin. Like PP1, G-actin associated with the functional core of PPP1R15 family members and G-actin depletion, by the marine toxin jasplakinolide, destabilised the endogenous PPP1R15A-PP1 complex. The abundance of the ternary PPP1R15-PP1-G-actin complex was responsive to global changes in the polymeric status of actin, as was its eIF2α-directed phosphatase activity, while localised G-actin depletion at sites enriched for PPP1R15 enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation and the downstream ISR. G-actin's role as a stabilizer of the PPP1R15-containing holophosphatase provides a mechanism for integrating signals regulating actin dynamics with stresses that trigger the ISR.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04872.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04872.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04872.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For a cell to build a protein, it must first copy the instructions contained within a gene. A complex molecular machine called a ribosome then reads these instructions and translates them into a protein. This translation process involves a number of steps. Proteins called eukaryotic translation initiation factors (or eIFs for short) coordinate the first step in the process, which is known as ‘initiation’.</p><p>The eIFs also provide the cell with ways to control how quickly it makes proteins. For example, when a cell is stressed, either by starvation or toxins, it adds a phosphate group onto part of an eIF protein, called eIF2α. This modification makes this eIF protein less able to initiate translation, and so the cell builds fewer proteins and conserves more of its resources during times of stress.</p><p>Once the stressful conditions are over, the phosphate group is removed from eIF2α by an enzyme called a phosphatase. This phosphatase contains two subunits: one that recognizes eIF2α and another that removes the phosphate group. However, experiments that attempted to recreate this phosphatase activity using just these two subunits in a test tube failed to generate a working enzyme that specifically targeted the phosphate group of eIF2α. This suggests that in cells this enzyme contains an additional unknown subunit. Now, Chambers, Dalton et al. (and Chen et al.) report the identity of a ‘missing’ third subunit as a protein known as globular-actin or G-actin.</p><p>Chambers, Dalton et al. engineered human and fruit fly cells to add ‘molecular handles’ on the two known subunits of the phosphatase enzyme. These handles could then be used to essentially pull these proteins out of the mixture of molecules within a cell and see what other proteins came along too. Both of the known subunits ‘pulled’ G-actin along with them; this suggested that it could be the missing part of the phosphatase enzyme.</p><p>Further experiments confirmed that G-actin works together with the other two subunits to specifically remove the phosphate group from eIF2α in mouse cells that had been stressed using a harmful chemical. Individual G-actin proteins can bind together to form long filaments, and signals that encourage a cell to divide or move also trigger the formation of actin filaments. This reduces the activity of the phosphatase enzyme by depriving it of a crucial component, i.e., free G-actin proteins. As such, the new mechanism described by Chambers, Dalton et al. suggests how growth and movement signals might also change a cell's sensitivity to stress. These findings may hopefully enable stressed cells to be targeted by drugs to treat disease; but future work is needed to clarify under what circumstances the integration of such signals into the stress response is beneficial to the cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04872.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04872.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>integrated stress response</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>PPP1R15A</kwd><kwd>GADD34</kwd><kwd>PPP1R15B</kwd><kwd>CReP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G1002610</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marciniak</surname><given-names>Stefan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>084812/Z/08/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000351</institution-id><institution>British Lung Foundation (BLF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APHD11-4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>Hanna J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>June Hancock Mesothelioma Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JH09-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dalton</surname><given-names>Lucy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000361</institution-id><institution>Diabetes UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12/0004595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Vruti</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIMR PhD programme</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dominicus</surname><given-names>Caia S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Monomeric actin forms a crucial component of the eIF2α holophosphatase linking the integrated stress response to actin polymeric status.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, regulation of protein biosynthesis defends against proteotoxic stress and balances anabolic growth with nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 complex recruits the initiator methionyl-tRNA to ribosomes in a GTP-dependent catalytic cycle, but phosphorylation of its alpha subunit (eIF2α) by a family of stress-sensing kinases inhibits guanine nucleotide exchange, attenuating translation initiation and with it, global protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clemens, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). During endoplasmic reticulum stress, the eIF2α kinase PERK triggers attenuation of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harding et al., 1999</xref>), while other members of the family respond variously to amino acid deprivation, viral infection or heme deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van 't Wout et al., 2014</xref>). This ability of eIF2α phosphorylation to integrate signals from multiple, apparently unrelated, stresses led this pathway to be named the ‘integrated stress response’ (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harding et al., 2003</xref>). Attenuated global protein synthesis is cytoprotective early in the stress response. The ISR also involves the translational induction of the transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP, which activate a transcriptional programme that has pro-survival effects in the short term, whilst prolonged activation leads to a switch to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zinszner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marciniak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In metazoans, inactivation of the ISR is mediated by a catalytic, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) subunit in complex with a regulatory subunit (PPP1R15) responsible for targeting eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jousse et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a single PPP1R15 has been described that is required for anabolic larval growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malzer et al., 2013</xref>), while in mammals, two PPP1R15 paralogues exist: a constitutively expressed isoform PPP1R15B (also known as CReP) and a stress-inducible isoform PPP1R15A (also GADD34) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jousse et al., 2003</xref>). PPP1R15 family members share significant homology in their C-terminal conserved PP1-interacting domain, constituting a core functional domain sufficient to dephosphorylate eIF2α when over expressed in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malzer et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the less well-conserved N-terminal portion of each PPP1R15 determines protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brush and Shenolikar, 2008</xref>) and subcellular localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>), although the importance of these functions in the regulation of eIF2α phosphatase activity within the cell remains to be worked out.</p><p>The importance of eIF2α dephosphorylation is highlighted by PPP1R15 loss-of-function phenotypes.

Deficiency of PPP1R15B in isolation permits survival to gestation but leads to defects of haematopoiesis and death in the early neonatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harding et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, PPP1R15A-deficient mice are overtly healthy when raised in standard laboratory conditions and show increased resistance to ER stress-induced tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marciniak et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>PPP1R15A is regulated transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>), but relatively little is known about post-transcriptional regulation of its activity or the regulation of the constitutively expressed PPP1R15B or <italic>Drosophila</italic> dPPP1R15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jousse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malzer et al., 2013</xref>).

To extend these observations, cells were treated with the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin, which depletes the ER of calcium and rapidly and transiently activates the ER stress-inducible kinase PERK. As expected, this led to a robust yet transient phosphorylation of eIF2α by PERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> lanes 1–6). The transient nature of this phosphorylation relates to the rectifying response of PERK on levels of ER stress, but also draws on the combined activities of constitutively expressed PPP1R15B and the induction of PPP1R15A that promote eIF2α dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jousse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Novoa et al., 2003</xref>).

As expected, enforced expression of PPP1R15A abrogated the phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to thapsigargin; however, jasplakinolide reversed the inhibitory effect of PPP1R15A over-expression restoring elevated levels of phosphorylated eIF2α to thapsigargin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>To examine more closely the effects of the actin cytoskeleton on dephosphorylation of eIF2α within living cells, we sought to gain temporal control over the phosphorylation phase of the cycle.

To direct mDia2 to the same membranous compartments as PPP1R15, we fused the membrane-targeting domain of PPP1R15B (residues 1–146, devoid of catalytic activity) to mDia2 and a GFP tag to facilitate visualisation of the fusion protein. Control cells were generated expressing a PPP1R15B (1–146)-GFP fusion protein lacking mDia2. Induction of eGFP-PPP1R15B (1–146)-mDia2 increased polymerisation of actin adjacent to the ER, as indicated by co-localisation of GFP fluorescence with phalloidin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

During ER stress, phosphorylation of eIF2α by PERK attenuates protein translation to offload the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harding et al., 1999</xref>). The degree of translational attenuation depends upon the intensity and the rapidity of ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>). Sudden and intense ER stress caused by depletion of ER calcium stores by thapsigargin induces marked inhibition of translation. In contrast, gradually escalating ER stress by the accumulation of unglycosylated proteins upon treatment with tunicamycin, attenuates translation less dramatically because induction of PPP1R15A limits the degree of eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>). In control cells (expressing the bland eGFP-PPP1R15B [1–146] targeting fragment), tunicamycin induced a transient and minor decrease in translation with a nadir at 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, lane 5). By contrast, in cells expressing ER-targeted mDia2, tunicamycin led to a sustained drop in protein synthesis associated with a sustained increase in eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, compare lanes 8 and 9). These experiments are consistent with a pool of G-actin localised in the vicinity of PPP1R15 in promoting eIF2α dephosphorylation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Over the years multiple proteins have been noted to interact with the PPP1R15-PP1 core holoenzyme, but none has proved generalizable across experimental systems or successfully implicated in the genetically well-characterised role of the complex to promote eIF2α dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hasegawa et al., 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hung et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shi et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, an unbiased approach identified actin as a conserved binding partner of PPP1R15. The affinities of actin for PPP1R15 lay within a physiologically relevant range such that fluctuations of the G:F actin ratio affected the amount of actin recovered in the complex. Alterations to the ratio of G:F actin at the site of PPP1R15 action were seen to modulate cellular sensitivity to ISR stimuli via changes in eIF2α phosphatase activity. Collectively, these findings establish G-actin as an important regulator of PPP1R15-mediated eIF2α dephosphorylation in vivo.</p><p>Our proteomics analysis also identified other potential binding partners of PPP1R15. In mammalian cells, tubulin and HSP70 were consistently recovered in complex with overexpressed PPP1R15 and PPP1R15-containing fusion proteins. These interactions are less conserved across phyla than the PPP1R15-actin interaction. Furthermore, in vitro experiments in the accompanying manuscript demonstrate that addition of actin is sufficient to endow the PPP1R15-PP1 complex with selectivity towards eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, while there is nothing in our observations to argue against tubulin or HSP70 joining the complex and modulating PPP1R15-directed phosphatase activity, the evidence at hand suggesting actin's relevance to the core activity of the eIF2α-directed phosphatase justifies the focus on actin.</p><p>With polymerisation and depolymerisation, the actin cytoskeleton is highly dynamic and levels of G-actin are subject to large fluctuations. Following polymerisation of actin to the barbed end of a filament, bound ATP is hydrolysed and eventually ADP-actin dissociates from the pointed end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</xref>). This dynamic is regulated by proteins that enhance depolymerisation, for example, ADF, or promote the recharging with ATP, which enhances the recycling of monomers, for example, profilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paavilainen et al., 2004</xref>). Capping proteins prevent the consumption of monomers and so increase free G-actin concentrations, while severing proteins can lead to filament disassembly or nucleate more filament formation depending upon the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wear and Cooper, 2004</xref>). In contrast, formins like mDia2 remain associated with the barbed end yet promote addition of actin monomers.</p><p>Other actin-binding proteins have functions unrelated to the cytoskeleton and it is now well recognised that free G-actin can function as a second messenger. For example, MAL, a cofactor of the transcription factor SRF, cycles dynamically between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a manner regulated by its binding to G-actin in quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miralles et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vartiainen et al., 2007</xref>). By depleting G-actin, growth signal-driven actin polymerisation releases MAL to enter the nucleus, bind SRF and activate target genes. Other examples include Phactr, a PP1 regulatory subunit whose cytoplasmic localisation depends upon G-actin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wiezlak et al., 2012</xref>) and RNA polymerases II and III for whom actin forms a scaffold for the assembly of enzyme complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kukalev et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Many actin-binding proteins including MAL interact with a hydrophobic target-binding cleft between subdomains I and III of the actin monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mouilleron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shoji et al., 2012</xref>). This site is blocked by cytochalasin D, which inhibits such interactions. Latrunculin B increases the level of actin monomers by binding to a different site on G-actin, the nucleotide-binding cleft, and does not interfere with binding at the hydrophobic cleft. Our observation that cytochalasin D diminishes the recovery of actin in complex with PPP1R15, is consistent with interaction via the hydrophobic target-binding cleft. While the precise details remain to be worked out, structural and biochemical studies presented in the accompanying manuscript support this idea and further suggest the C-terminal most residues of the functional core of the PPP1R15 family members play an important role in actin engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). A crystal structure obtained for the binary complex of PPP1R15B and PP1 demonstrated that the N-terminal half of PPP1R15's functional core extensively engages the surface of PP1 following an itinerary previously observed for the regulatory subunit PPP1R9/spinophilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ragusa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the C-terminal portion of PPP1R15's functional core, implicated here in actin binding, was not observed in a high-resolution crystal structure of the PPP1R15B-PP1 binary complex, suggesting that this portion of PPP1R15B remained unstructured in the absence of actin. The crystal structure obtained for the 1:1:1 ternary complex of PPP1R15B-PP1-actin was of too low a resolution to identify these C-terminal residues of PPP1R15's functional core, but unaccounted for density observed in the cleft between lobes I and III of actin suggests a mode of engagement of actin by this portion of PPP1R15B that would be sensitive to disruption by cytochalasin, which binds to the same region of G-actin.</p><p>Our in vivo findings reported here emphasize the importance of actin binding to the stability of the PPP1R15-PP1 complex and suggest that association of PP1 and actin with PPP1R15 may be cooperative. The accompanying manuscript provides further evidence for the direct binding of PPP1R15 and actin and reveals a role for actin in augmenting the specificity of the holophosphatase for eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). These two mechanisms are likely to work in concert and suggest a crucial role for G-actin in establishing a biologically relevant route to eIF2α dephosphorylation.</p><p>It would appear that under normal circumstances G-actin is not limiting to eIF2α dephosphorylation in cultured MEFs, as latrunculin B, which enhances the pool of PPP1R15 binding-competent G-actin in some cell types, has no measurable effect on phosphorylated eIF2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, regulation of eIF2α phosphatases via the binding of G-actin might plausibly play a role in biological processes that are accompanied by changes in the ratio of G:F actin in other differentiated cell types, for example, in circumstances of cell migration, axonal guidance, or synaptic plasticity. The latter are particularly attractive given the evidence for crosstalk between the ISR and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The role of eIF2α phosphorylation in regulating rates of protein synthesis and the coupling of this phosphorylation event to the activation of a gene expression programme are conserved in eukaryotes. However, the mechanism for dephosphorylating eIF2α has diverged considerably. Yeasts rely on direct recruitment of the catalytic phosphatase subunit (Glc7p) to the eIF2 substrate, with no PPP1R15 intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rojas et al., 2014</xref>), while PPP1R15 family proteins are apparent only in complex animals: insects and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jousse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malzer et al., 2013</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that this more complex mode of regulating eIF2α dephosphorylation co-evolved with mechanisms for regulating the actin cytoskeleton and G-actin availability.</p><p>Current models suggest that PPP1R15B, which is expressed constitutively, provides a constant background of eIF2α phosphatase activity that is augmented by transcriptional induction of PPP1R15A during later stages of the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jousse et al., 2003</xref>). This study reveals that both PPP1R15 isoforms are poised to undergo post-translational regulation through changes in the polymeric status of actin. The focus here has been on the conserved functional core of PPP1R15, but there remains room for further modulation of both isoforms by their large, poorly characterised N-terminal regions. Our protein discovery effort has identified other interactors that may be unique to each isoform. Thus future studies to explore the possibility of differential regulation of eIF2α phosphatase activity by the different paralogues and their unique interactors seem warranted.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials, plasmids, and primers</title><p>Jasplakinolide, thapsigargin, and tunicamycin were from Calbiochem (Millipore, Hertfordshire, UK), cytochalasin D was from Tocris (Bristol, UK), latrunculin B was from Enzo Life Sciences (Exeter, UK), Alexa Fluor 568 Phalliodin was from Life Technologies (Paisley, UK).

The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The work shows that G-actin interacts with various R15 isoforms, and the data in this paper together with the data in the accompanying paper (Chen et al., 2015, <italic>eLife</italic>) support a possible model where the inclusion of G-actin in a trimeric complex is important for substrate specificity. The work is based on a fairly straightforward workflow involving protein pull-down studies, protein identification by mass spectrometry, structure-function analysis to define regions and residues that interact, then a more functional set of studies where G to F-actin dynamics are manipulated in cells. Overall the study is technically solid and the results are of potential importance. </p><p>Substantive concerns:</p><p>1) The pull-down experiments identify the most abundant proteins in cells, and while a number of controls are included, there is a concern that the work relies on over-expression of proteins in model cell preparations. As the authors acknowledge in the Discussion, the artificial manipulations used to perturb G-actin, do not really inform upon any biological process where G- to F-actin dynamics are altered.</p><p>2) There is little information related to replication of experiments. Representative studies are presented but little cumulative data is analyzed and quantified.</p><p>3) A commercial GFP pull-down kit is used. It is important that the buffer conditions are included in the Methods section. In this regard, was G-actin binding sensitive to lysis or other buffer components including salt and detergent?</p><p>4) The mass spectrometry data is not presented.</p><p>5) Relative stability of trimeric complex: the authors’ assertion that the ternary complex is more stable than binary complexes (at the end of the subsection “Actin associates with the conserved C-terminal functional core of PPP1R15”) seems to be based on the analysis of the V<sup>556</sup>E mutant, but no evidence in this experiment that addresses this issue directly.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, tubulin also seems to be a conserved PPP15A/B interactor, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> the amount of tubulin associated w/ the PPP15A-GFP complex is also decreased when purified from jasplakinolide treated cells. It would be helpful to know (and potentially a great control) if eIF2α phosphorylation is altered in cells treated with drugs that alter levels of MT polymerization. In addition, some comment on the tubulin recovery in the experiments would be appropriate; what do the authors think is happening here?</p><p>7) Since jasplakinomide perturbs actin polymerization through a specific mechanism, it is important to use another method (for example phalloidin) to ensure that the effects are not specific to jasplakinomide.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: please indicate the time of treatment.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>: while a control experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, it is hard to make much of a conclusion since the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> appears to be fully explained by the level of induced expression of R15A. In addition, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> an important control is not shown: overall levels of eIF2α. Its absence is conspicuous as this control is shown for other analyses, including panel 4C.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>: the data for the R15A mutant cells seems non-informative since little R15A is expressed at baseline.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: this experiment is not explained clearly in the text (subsection headed “Association of G-actin with PPP1R15 regulates eIF2α phosphatase activity in vivo”).</p><p>12) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: do the constructs with the membrane-targeting domain of R15b displace the ER location of R15B or R15A? In addition, the cells in appear significantly different in morphology in this figure. Please show more examples, and provide some quantitation of the extent of colocalization of F-actin and GFP.</p><p>13) Referencing: the use of the Sotiropoulos reference for MAL and actin is wrong. 1) Initial finding should be Miralles et al., Cell 2003 vol. 113, 329; 2) Rather than being held in the cytoplasm by actin and released for nuclear entry, MAL is actually dynamic, with the protein continually circulating through the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vartiainen et al., 2007</xref> Science vol. 316, 1749. 3. Structural analysis of binding to actin was initially done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mouilleron et al., 2008</xref> EMBO 27, 3198).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled ”Actin dynamics tune the integrated stress response by regulating eukaryotic initiation factor 2α dephosphorylation“ for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Two of the original three reviewers examined the revised manuscript and one of them, self-identified as Richard Treisman, found the revisions appropriate and had only one small criticism that you need to address.</p><p>The other reviewer had more substantive criticisms, many of which he/she felt were raised in the first round of reviews, that we have listed below. Specifically, he/she remains concerned about the stoichiometry of the PP1/R15 complex and actin. He/she notes that this interaction is at the core of the work and conclusions, and is not convinced from the data that the interaction is physiologically significant. This issue, therefore, remains a significant problem that needs addressing directly. The reviewer suggests, as did on the original reviews, that purified proteins would be a better basis for this analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Richard Treisman):</italic></p><p>Point 6 in the rebuttal: “OK, but puzzled as to the effect on Tubulin recovery. The authors should add a comment as to what they think is going on here.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (verbatim):</italic></p><p>The authors have made a reasonable attempt to address the reviewers' points in the revised version of this manuscript. There were concerns that the approach used overexpression of proteins in model cell systems, that G-actin and the other proteins (tubulin, HSP70) were highly abundant and that the perturbations to G-actin/F-actin were non-physiological. While additional studies have been performed to examine endogenous PPP1R15 and PP1, the results raise some additional questions, and many of the original concerns remain.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) It is a concern that actin cannot be detected in the pulldown studies added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. There is a vague comment about the antibody not being effective enough, but this does not make a lot of sense, given that there is a supposedly ”stoichiometric“ amount of actin coming down with the PP1/R15 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and Results). If this is the case, then it should be feasible through the use of internal standards to work out how much endogenous PP1 and R15 are isolated relative to the amounts of PP1 and R15 isolated following over-expression, then to set up an assay to measure comparable amounts of actin. Is there still tubulin and HSP70 pulled down with endogenous PP1 and R15? If so, and no actin can be detected, then how does one interpret the physiological significance of the proposed G-actin interaction.</p><p>2) Related to this point of stoichiometry, if there is a stoichiometric amount of G-actin bound to PP1/R15 then what does this say about how tubulin or HSP70 might also be binding to the complex?</p><p>3) The questions related to the binding between the different proteins really needs evidence using purified components, which is the topic of the accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>, <italic>eLife</italic>). In isolation it is not easy to judge the potential physiological significance of the data presented in this paper, and the Discussion really needs to make it more clear how the structural data in the other paper help interpret the data in this paper.</p><p>4) Abstract: the data presented here are more supportive of G-actin being able to stabilize the PP1/R15 complex rather than being an ”activator”.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04872.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The pull-down experiments identify the most abundant proteins in cells, and while a number of controls are included, there is a concern that the work relies on over-expression of proteins in model cell preparations.

Due to poor sensitivity of the available antisera to actin we were unable to resolve associated actin from background, and so we depleted input lysate of F-actin by centrifugation in order to report G-actin in the input samples. It is clearly seen, that in samples depleted of soluble G-actin, less PP1 is recovered in complex with endogenous PPP1R15A (compare lanes 2 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As a complementary approach, we used microcystin-agarose matrix to purify endogenous PP1-containing complexes from cell lysates and observed that depletion of G-actin reduced the quantity of endogenous PPP1R15A associated with the catalytic subunit (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>The following has been added to the main text of the manuscript:</p><p>“To examine the relevance of G-actin to the endogenous PPP1R15 complex, wild type Ppp1r15a<sup>+/+</sup> and mutant Ppp1r15a<sup>mut/mut</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) […] These findings are consistent with a role for G-actin in promoting association between endogenous PPP1R15A and PP1.”</p><p>And to the Abstract:</p><p>“Like PP1, G-actin associated with the functional core of PPP1R15 family members and G-actin depletion, by the marine toxin jasplakinolide destabilised the endogenous PPP1R15A-PP1 complex.”</p><p><italic>2) There is little information related to replication of experiments.

Briefly, cells were lysed in GFP-Trap lysis buffer [150mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris/Cl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)] and post-nuclear supernatants were incubated with GFP-Trap beads at 4°C for two hours then washed four times in the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer.”</p><p>The lysis buffers routinely contained physiological levels of salt, but as suggested we have now analysed the interactions between PPP1R15A and either actin or PP1 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). Lysis buffers routinely contained no more than 1% v/v Triton X-100 and beads wash buffers were detergent-free. In new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>, we demonstrate that the interaction between PPP1R15A and both actin and PP1 were sensitive to detergent. When lysates were subjected to anti-GFP immunoprecipitation and then washed either without detergent, with Triton X-100, RIPA (1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) or with digitonin-containing buffers, all except RIPA preserved the R15A-actin and R15A-PP1 associations. This suggests that while the complex is stable in a number of non-denaturing detergents, denaturing detergents may not be compatible with it. The following has been added to the Results section:</p><p>“The quantities of actin and PP1 recovered in complex with PPP1R15A were sensitive to the salt concentration of the buffers used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>).

It can also be seen that PPP1R15A isolated from jasplakinolide-treated cells binds far less PP1 and so is significantly less effective at dephosphorylating eIF2α in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Furthermore the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> confirms that the V<sup>556</sup>E mutant of PPP1R15A, which is unable to engage PP1 stably, also interacts poorly with actin across a broad range of salt concentrations, in marked contrast to wild type PPP1R15A. We have therefore amended the text as follows:</p><p>“Mutational analysis thus indicates that, while independent association of PP1 or actin with PPP1R15 may exist, the ternary complex of wild type PPP1R15, actin and PP1 is more readily recoverable.”</p><p><italic>6) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>, tubulin also seems to be a conserved PPP15A/B interactor, and in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref> <italic>the amount of tubulin associated w/ the PPP15A-GFP complex is also decreased when purified from jasplakinolide treated cells. It would be helpful to know (and potentially a great control) if eIF2α phosphorylation is altered in cells treated with drugs that alter levels of MT polymerization. In addition, some comment on the tubulin recovery in the experiments would be appropriate; what do the authors think is happening here?</italic></p><p>We agree that the potential for involvement of tubulin in mammalian PPP1R15-containing phosphatases is potentially interesting. However, in the current manuscript, we decided to focus on the phylogenetically conserved interaction of the R15s with actin, rather than on tubulin, which has a far less strong interaction with dPPP1R15.</p><p>In reference to the reviewers’ logical suggestions for further experimentation, we note that manipulation of microtubules to increase their polymerization (e.g. with taxanes) leads to increased eIF2α phosphorylation through effects on the kinase PERK (Swanton et al., 2007 Cancer Cell 11: 498-512). This imposes further challenges on isolation of effects of manipulating the microtubule network on the eIF2⍺ phosphatases and is an issue that may need to be addresses by future studies.</p><p><italic>7) Since jasplakinomide perturbs actin polymerization through a specific mechanism, it is important to use another method (for example phalloidin) to ensure that the effects are not specific to jasplakinomide</italic>.</p><p>To avoid confounding off-pathways effects of small molecules, we generated stable cells conditionally expressing a construct comprising constitutively active mDia2 fused to the membrane-associating portion of PPP1R15B (residues 1-146). mDia2 is a formin that both nucleates and processively elongates actin filaments. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref> it can be seen that expression of this construct led to a marked increase in F-actin within the cell in a central distribution rather than the cortical arrangement observed in control cells. This increase in F-actin, which showed significant co-localisation with GFP-R15B 1-146_mDia2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>), was associated with induction of the integrated stress response effector ATF4. The complete abrogation of this by ISRIB confirmed that induction of ATF4 by expression of the mDia2 construct was mediated by phosphorylation of eIF2α (compare lanes 15 and 16 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Moreover, induction of the mDia2 construct was sufficient to cause phosphorylation of eIF2α (compare lanes 8 and 9 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).</p><p>The reviewers’ suggestion that we exploit phalloidin to alter actin polymerization status is sensible. However, while this toxin indeed stabilizes filaments of F-actin, it is poorly membrane permeant and difficult to use in the bulk-based endpoint assays available to monitor the ISR, eIF2⍺ phosphorylation and PPP1R15 complex composition. Membrane disruption by scraping (“scrape loading”) has been described as a means to allow it to gain access to the cell (Serpinskaya et al., 1990, FEBBS Lett 17: 11-14). In our hands, when applied to the culture media, phalloidin failed to induce any morphological features of actin polymerization, while scrape loading alone induced significant confounding cellular stress. Phalloidin has also been introduced into cells by microinjection (Wehland and Weber, 1981<bold>,</bold> Eur J Cell Biol 24, 176–183), but this does not permit the analysis of sufficient numbers of cells for immunoblot. The cell permeant semi-synthetic derivative, phalloidin-oleate, is no longer commercially available.</p><p><italic>8)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref><italic>: please indicate the time of treatment</italic>.</p><p>The incubation was for 1 hour and the legend has been amended as follows, and this figure is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>:</p><p>“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.

Differences in R15A induction are likely to reflect differences in cap-dependent translation between the two conditions and so in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> (previously 4D) we over-expressed PPP1R15A from the outset of the experiment thus equalizing its levels between control and jasplakinolide-treated cells. In vehicle-treated cells, a substantial reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation was observed owing to increased eIF2α phosphatase activity, while in jasplakinolide-treated cells eIF2α phosphorylation was dramatically increased consistent with reduction of eIF2α phosphatase activity. We address and exclude the possibility of these effects resulting from altered eIF2α kinase activity elsewhere in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

This requires the R15 binding site to be saturable, but we have no evidence for the latter. Indeed, overexpression of GFP-tagged N-terminal domain fails to affect mCherry-R15 localization (not shown). However, the hypothesis we set out to test in the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> was that depletion of a local pool of actin adjacent to the ER would enfeeble R15 activity. If the control construct were to deplete R15 from its normal location and if this were to impair its enzymatic activity, the observed effect of mDia2 induction would be minimized since eIF2α phosphatase activity would have been impaired similarly by the GFP-R15B 1-146 control construct (expressed at similar levels to the mDia2 construct on western blots). In this regard, our observation that GFP-R15B 1-146_mDia2 leads to activation of ATF4 is strengthened.

This issue, therefore, remains a significant problem that needs addressing directly. The reviewer suggests, as did on the original reviews, that purified proteins would be a better basis for this analysis</italic>.</p><p>The strongest functional evidence for the role of G-actin in regulating the phosphatase activity of PPP1R15 comes from the various experiments in which manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton in living cells is shown to modulate eIF2α dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6 fig7 fig9">Figures 5, 6, 7 and 9</xref>).These correlate with powerful negative effects of depletion of G-actin on the stability of the endogenous PPP1R15-PP1 complex recovered from cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig8">Figures 4 and 8</xref>). As the editor and reviewer 2 noted, the issue of stoichiometry is best addressed in vitro using purified components. This indeed has been done in the accompanying manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>, <italic>eLife</italic>), revealing a 1:1:1 complex of PPP1R15-PP1-actin that co-purifies and crystalizes. This point and its significance are now discussed in detail in the revised version of manuscript (in the Discussion).</p><p>Because of its importance to this paper we have further probed the actin content of the endogenous complex of PPP1R15-PP1. We faced three challenges: (1) poor recovery of endogenous PPP1R15 by immunoprecipitation, (2) poor reactivity of the available anti-actin sera, and (3) actin contamination of reference immunoprecipitations (the controls). Problem 3 proved especially prominent in mouse fibroblasts (MEFs), but could be circumvented partially by using HEK293T cells. Therefore, we first confirmed the crucial role of the actin cytoskeleton on the stability of the PPP1R15-PP1 complex in HEK293T cells by comparing the recovery on microcystin beads of endogenous PPP1R15A from untreated and jasplakinolide-treated cells (an assay for the stability of the PPP1R15-PP1 complex, which associates with the microcystin via its PP1 component) (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Then, following the reviewers’ suggestion, we scaled up the input material for the immunoprecipitation to recover endogenous PPP1R15A at a quantity comparable to that of the over-expressed PPP1R15A and assayed for the associated actin. As shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, comparable levels of actin were found, supporting the conclusion that actin is a functionally relevant constituent of the endogenous PPP1R15-containing complex.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Richard Treisman):</p><p><italic>Point 6 in the rebuttal: ”OK, but puzzled as to the effect on Tubulin recovery.

If this is the case, then it should be feasible through the use of internal standards to work out how much endogenous PP1 and R15 are isolated relative to the amounts of PP1 and R15 isolated following over-expression, then to set up an assay to measure comparable amounts of actin</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. As noted previously, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> presents an analysis of the recovery of endogenous actin in complex with endogenous PPP1R15A-PP1 and a side-by-side comparison to the recovery of actin in complex with over-expressed PPP1R15A. For this, it proved necessary to use HEK293T cells (rather than MEFs which had prohibitive non-specific binding of actin in the control immunopurification samples).</p><p>The new experiment reveals comparable association of actin with endogenous and over-expressed PPP1R15A and thus supports the extensive functional experiments documenting the dependence of eIF2α dephosphorylation on the availability of G-actin.</p><p>Two further points are worth making in regards to this experiment: (1) The exposure of cells to jasplakinolide markedly increased the non-specific recovery of actin in control immunoprecipitation samples therefore it was not possible to measure the effect of jasplakinolide on the recovery of actin in complex with PPP1R15A. (2) Similar considerations apply to the recovery of actin on microcystin beads, the latter may be due to the known existence of other PP1-actin complexes in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliver et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The following new text has been added to the Results section under the subsection headed “Association of G-actin with PPP1R15 regulates eIF2α phosphatase activity in vivo”:</p><p>“Whilst the presence of other known PP1-actin complexes precludes meaningful interpretation of actin purified by microcystin affinity […] This supports a role for the interaction in cell physiology.”</p><p><italic>Is there still tubulin and HSP70 pulled down with endogenous PP1 and R15?

While this does not exclude an ancillary role for tubulin or HSP70, parsimony justifies the focus on actin here. It is noteworthy however, that PPP1R15 proteins have extensive portions outside their functional core (which engages PP1 and actin and constitutes the specific eIF2α<sup>P</sup>-directed phosphatase).
