engagement of myeloid cells through factors presented by inflamed vessels. However, endothelial-dependent mechanisms of myeloid cell recruitment are not fully understood. Here we show using an autoperfused flow chamber assay of whole blood neutrophils and intravital microscopy of the inflamed cremaster muscle that CD95 mediates leukocyte slow rolling, adhesion and transmigration upon binding of CD95-ligand (CD95L) that is presented by endothelial cells. In myeloid cells, CD95 triggers activation of Syk-Btk/PLCγ2/Rap1 signaling that ultimately leads to integrin activation. Excitingly, CD95-deficient myeloid cells exhibit impaired bacterial clearance in an animal model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Our data identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the chemoattractant effect of endothelial cell-derived CD95L in induction of neutrophil recruitment and support the use of therapeutic inhibition of CD95’s activity in inflammatory diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18542.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18542.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18542.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When tissues are damaged or infected, the body produces an inflammatory response. Neutrophils – a type of white blood cell – play an important part in this response. These cells normally circulate through the bloodstream, and are recruited to the inflamed site by chemical signals sent out by immune cells in the damaged tissue. This causes passing neutrophils to migrate through the wall of the blood vessel to gain access to the inflamed tissue.</p><p>The neutrophils go through a sequence of steps before they can pass through the blood vessel wall. After initially tethering to the cells that line the blood vessel, the neutrophils experience a period of “slow rolling” across the vessel lining, before tightly adhering to one of the cells.</p><p>In 2010, researchers determined that a protein on the neutrophil’s surface, known as CD95, helps the cell migrate through blood vessel walls. This protein interacts with a “ligand” molecule on the surface of the cells that line the blood vessel. However, it remains unclear whether CD95 and its ligand play a role in the steps that lead up to the neutrophils migrating through the blood vessel wall.</p><p>Gao et al. – who include researchers involved in the 2010 study – now show that activating CD95 in neutrophils also triggers the cell’s slow rolling and adhesion. Experiments performed on mouse cells and tissues showed that the cells that line the blood vessels present the CD95 ligand on their surfaces in order to activate CD95 in the neutrophils circulating in the bloodstream. This ultimately leads to neutrophil slow rolling and adhesion. Further experiments in mice showed that this ability of CD95 to recruit neutrophils to inflamed sites was crucial for clearing bacteria in cases of sepsis, where infection causes the immune system to damage the body’s own tissues.</p><p>Future studies could address whether inhibiting CD95's activity could help to treat diseases that feature uncontrolled white blood cell recruitment, including various cancers and autoimmune diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18542.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18542.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>CD95/CD95 ligand</kwd><kwd>neutrophil</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>slow rolling and adhesion</kwd><kwd>integrin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008658</institution-id><institution>Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin-Villalba</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cell surface protein CD95 mediates neutrophil slow rolling and adhesion during inflammation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Leukocyte recruitment comprises of a cascade with four major steps: slow rolling, firm adhesion, intraluminal crawling and trans-vessel migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ley et al., 2007</xref>). Slow rolling and firm adhesion are mediated by selectin- and chemokine-induced integrin signaling. Selectin is expressed and presented to the vessel lumen by inflamed endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zarbock et al., 2011</xref>). E-selectin engagement with PSGL-1 and CD44 ligands induces activation of the Src family kinases (SFKs) Hck, Fgr and Lyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yago et al., 2010</xref>) which then phosphorylate and activate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing adaptor protein Fc receptor common γ signaling chain (FcRγ) and DNAX activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zarbock et al., 2008</xref>). These activated adaptor proteins recruit and phosphorylate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which in turn activates Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yago et al., 2010</xref>). Btk further activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C γ2 (PLCγ2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways that mediate the integrin signaling to induce slow rolling.</p><p>E-selectin- and integrin-mediated rolling crucially depend on Syk activation via binding to phosphorylated ITAM-domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yago et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zarbock et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, an ITAM-like motif was identified as a docking site for Src homology domain 2 (SH2)-containing proteins in CD95 of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daigle et al., 2002</xref>). In CD95L-stimulated myeloid cells, we identified Lyn as the major SFK that phosphorylates CD95’s tyrosine, thereby allowing recruitment of Syk, which via the PI3K/MMP9 pathway results in myeloid cell migration to the inflammatory site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Letellier et al., 2010</xref>). However, the roles of CD95 in the initial cellular processes of myeloid cell recruitment, such as rolling and adhesion, remain unknown.</p><p>CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) was initially described as a death receptor mediating apoptosis via formation of the death-inducing signal complex (DISC) which further leads to activation of downstream caspases and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peter et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, in T cells the apoptotic cascade is prevented via formation of CD44-ezrin-actin-CD95 signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mielgo et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2007</xref>). Likewise, in B cells the CD95-FADD interaction is prevented by binding of Btk to CD95 via its kinase and Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uckun, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vassilev et al., 1999</xref>). Taken together, we reasoned that upon stimulation with CD95L, CD95 might assemble a signaling complex to induce integrin activation for myeloid cell rolling and adhesion.</p><p>Here, we report that CD95 mediates slow rolling and adhesion of myeloid cells via activation of integrin through stimulation of Syk-Btk-PLCγ2 or Btk-PLCγ2 signaling pathways. CD95 in myeloid cells or CD95L in endothelial cells is required for myeloid cell recruitment in in vivo animal models of inflammation. Further, deletion of CD95 in myeloid cells impairs bacterial clearance in systemic inflammation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that endothelial cell-derived CD95L serves as a chemokine in induction of neutrophil slow rolling and adhesion via integrin activation during inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CD95L stimulation induces neutrophil slow rolling</title><p>In order to study the role of CD95 in leukocyte slow rolling we used a mouse autoperfused flow chamber assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chesnutt et al., 2006</xref>). This assay has the advantage of allowing examination of rolling and adhesion of neutrophils from whole blood, thereby preventing isolation-induced activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forsyth and Levinsky, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glasser and Fiederlein, 1990</xref>). In addition, using the <italic>Lyz2<sup>&lt;CreGFP&gt;</sup> </italic>reporter mice, 89 ± 2% of the rolling cells in the flow chamber have been identified as neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chesnutt et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, the rolling velocity of neutrophils is significantly reduced on E-selectin+ICAM1-coated chamber as compared to the E-selectin-coated chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jung and Ley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chesnutt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zarbock et al., 2007</xref>). Additional intravenous tail (i.v.) injection of CD95L one hour prior to flow chamber assay significantly reduced the rolling velocity as compared to control counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; 1.55 ± 0.07 µm/s vs. 1.16 ± 0.03 µm/s). In order to exclude the possibility that CD95 mediates neutrophil slow rolling via the CD95-induced chemokine production, which has been reported in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altemeier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miwa et al., 1998</xref>), mouse blood was perfused through the flow chambers coated with E-selectin, ICAM1 and CD95L. The rolling velocity of neutrophils in 50 μg/ml CD95L-coated chamber was significantly lower than in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; 1.55 ± 0.07 µm/s vs. 0.84 ± 0.09 µm/s). Flow chamber coated with 50 μg/ml CD95L showed the strongest effect on slow rolling as compared to other coating concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Rolling cells in CD95L alone-coated or CD95L/ICAM1-coated chamber were not detectable which indicated that CD95L-induced slow rolling was E-selectin-dependent (data not shown). In addition, CD95L i.v. injection or CD95L-coating increased the number of rolling cells in the flow chamber as compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To further confirm that the CD95L-induced neutrophil slow rolling was specific to CD95, we specifically deleted CD95 in myeloid cells (<italic>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;Cre&gt;</sup></italic>). Although CD95-deficient neutrophils rolled at a similar velocity as <italic>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup></italic>neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), CD95L i.v.-injection or CD95L coating failed to reduce neutrophils’ rolling velocity in <italic>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;Cre&gt;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;Cre&gt;</sup></italic> mice showed significantly less rolling cells in CD95L-coated flow chamber or upon CD95L injection as compared to the <italic>WT</italic> mice under the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Neutrophil extravasation into the inflamed peritoneal cavity was assessed in endothelial-CD95L deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). The number of peritoneal neutrophils at 6 hr after thioglycollate injection was significantly reduced in endothelial-CD95L deficient mice as compared to control counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Nonetheless, deletion of CD95 in the endothelial compartment (<italic>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Cdh5<sup>&lt;CreERT2&gt;</sup></italic>) did not affect thioglycolate-induced neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed peritoneum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Notably, the cell surface expression of adhesion molecules, E-selectin, ICAM1 and ICAM2 was similar in CD95L-deleted and non-deleted endothelial cells, with the exception of cell surface expression of P-selectin that was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). Similarly, deletion of CD95 in myeloid cells had no impact on ICAM1 and selectin levels in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H–J</xref>). Additionally, the ratio of different leukocyte populations in the blood and the absolute number of blood neutrophils were not significantly changed in <italic>Fasl<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Cdh5<sup>&lt;CreERT2&gt;</sup></italic> mice before or after tamoxifen induction as compared to the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B,C</xref>). These data demonstrate that the involvement of endothelial cell-derived CD95L in leukocyte slow rolling and transmigration is not related to the change of adhesion molecule expression level on the luminal surface of blood vessels or the homeostasis of leukocytes in the blood stream.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Phosphorylation of Syk, Btk and PLCγ2 upon CD95L engagement</title><p>E-selectin engagement triggers a signaling cascade which cooperates with chemokine signals to facilitate neutrophil rolling and adhesion during inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zarbock et al., 2007</xref>).

Upon ligand engagement, it has been reported that E-selectin activates SFKs which in turn initiate a signaling pathway involving the activation of ITAM bearing adaptors, Syk, Btk, PLCγ2, P38 and PI3Kγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yago et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>). We have previously shown that CD95L triggers the recruitment of myeloid cells to inflammatory sites via SFK-Syk-PI3K pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Letellier et al., 2010</xref>). To validate whether CD95 signaling can also activate Btk and PLCγ2 via Syk, we studied Btk and PLCγ2 activation upon CD95L stimulation. As <italic>Syk</italic> deficiency (<italic>Syk-/-</italic>) is perinatal-lethal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turner et al., 1995</xref>), we cultured primary embryonic liver-derived macrophages. Activation of CD95 increased phosphorylation of Syk, Btk and PLCγ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and quantified analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). CD95-mediated phosphorylation of PLCγ2 greatly decreased in macrophages isolated from <italic>Syk-/-</italic> mice as compared to wild type (<italic>WT</italic>) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). The reduced basal level of p-PLCγ2 in <italic>Syk-/-</italic> cells indicates that Syk is not only involved in CD95L-mediated phosphorylation of PLCγ2 but also acts as a hub for other ligands. However, the upregulated phosphorylation of Btk was still present in <italic>Syk-/-</italic> as compared to <italic>WT</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Activation of Btk could be explained by the previously observed interaction of the PH domain of Btk with CD95 in B-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vassilev et al., 1999</xref>). To examine this interaction we pulled down Btk from the lysates of CD95L-treated macrophages by immunoprecipitation. Binding of CD95 to Btk was detected following CD95L stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In order to validate the functional involvement of Btk in CD95L-induced PLCγ2 phosphorylation, we used the Btk inhibitor PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) 1 hr prior to CD95L stimulation of macrophages. PCI-32765 fully blocked the basal and CD95-induced phosphorylation of Btk and PLCγ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F,G</xref>), but not the phosphorylation of Syk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), which indicates that the phosphorylation of PLCγ2 is Btk-dependent and that Btk is an essential mediator for CD95-induced PLCγ2 activation. Taken together, these data demonstrate the presence of two signaling branches downstream of CD95: CD95/SFK/Syk/Btk/PLCγ2 and CD95/SFK/Btk/PLCγ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

KIM127 recognizes an epitope of β<sub>2</sub> subunit of human LFA-1 when it is extended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beglova et al., 2002</xref>), whereas mab24 binds to the epitope of I-like domain in β<sub>2</sub> subunit of human LFA-1 only if this is accessible as in the high-affinity state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2001</xref>).

In these studies, transplantation of CD95L-overexpressing/CD95-negative tumor cells induced a dramatic neutrophil infiltration into the tumor xenografts. Other studies using Boyden chamber assays demonstrated that soluble CD95L induces the transmigration of human neutrophils in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seino et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ottonello et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dupont and Warrens, 2007</xref>). Although these findings are interesting, they did not address whether CD95-induced neutrophil recruitment was through direct CD95 activation on neutrophils or secondary to CD95-induced production of inflammatory mediators. The present study shows that CD95 is involved in induction of slow rolling and adhesion of neutrophils, and that these steps are blocked in CD95-deficient neutrophils, indicating that CD95 induces slow rolling via a direct effect on neutrophils and not via induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.</p><p>In this study, soluble or coated CD95L induce neutrophil slow rolling in the autoperfused flow chamber assay. However, coating of the flow chamber with CD95L alone was not sufficient to induce leukocyte tethering (capturing), indicating that E-selectin is required for CD95-mediated slow rolling. It has been shown that selectin ligands PSGL-1 and CD44 are enriched in lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neame et al., 1995</xref>). In addition, the three SFKs of neutrophils, Fgr, Hck, Lyn, which are activated upon the engagement of selectin to its ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yago et al., 2010</xref>), also associate with cholesterol-dependent membrane rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lowell, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, neutrophil slow rolling has been reported to be dependent on intact lipid microdomains to signal slow rolling on E-selectin and P-selectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yago et al., 2010</xref>). The clustering of lipid microdomains is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chichili and Rodgers, 2007</xref>). Ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins, which link the cytoskeleton to integral membrane proteins via their FERM domains, associate with PSGL-1 and CD44 through their cytoplasmic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yonemura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Urzainqui et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, ligation of PSGL-1 to selectin recruits Syk to an atypical ITAM on ERM proteins bound to the cytoplasmic domain of PSGL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Urzainqui et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, leukocyte rolling requires the formation of multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane.</p><p>CD95 clustering is accompanied by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and aggregation of lipid microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Söderström et al., 2005</xref>). Accordingly, CD95 clustering in sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains is necessary for the induction of CD95 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grassme et al., 2001</xref>). CD95 indirectly associates with actin via direct and specific binding to ezrin FERM domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lozupone et al., 2004</xref>), and the organization of the microfilaments affects the outcome of CD95 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parlato et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, CD44 has been reported to bind to CD95 via ezrin to block the apoptotic signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mielgo et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2007</xref>). These findings suggest that CD95 may also be a part of a multiprotein complex encompassing selectin ligands, SFKs and cytoskeletal proteins that orchestrate leukocyte rolling.</p><p>Ligand binding to external domains causes conformational changes that increase ligand affinity, and formation of integrin clustering, which in turn results in SFK autophosphorylation and Syk kinase activation in the outside-in integrin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abram and Lowell, 2009</xref>). SFK and Syk kinases can directly interact with the cytoplasmic domain of β<sub>2</sub>, and β<sub>3</sub> integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arias-Salgado et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, ITAM containing adaptor proteins DAP12 and FcRγ couples Syk to integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mócsai et al., 2006</xref>). The ITAM-like YXXL motif of CD95 is involved in the CD95-Lyn-Syk signaling cascade leading to myeloid cell transmigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Letellier et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, the current study identifies an association of CD95 with integrin α<sub>L</sub>β<sub>2</sub> in neutrophils, as assessed by PLA, and macrophages, as confirmed by direct co-immunoprecipitation. Moreover, integrin activation reporter assay and the soluble ICAM1 binding assay demonstrate that CD95-induced integrin activation is a mechanism present in both macrophages and neutrophils. Altogether, these findings strongly indicate that CD95 modulates rolling and adhesion via its participation in a multiprotein signaling complex containing selectin ligands, SFKs, integrins and cytoskeletal proteins in both neutrophils and macrophages.</p><p>Alternatively, CD95 might indirectly impact myeloid cell recruitment by promoting secretion of inflammatory cytokines, as already reported in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altemeier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dupont and Warrens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2010a</xref>). In line with this, a recent study showed that CD95 in apoptotic cells induced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which in turn attracted myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cullen et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the autoperfused flow chamber assay in this study shows that CD95-induced slow rolling is independent of chemokine production.</p><p>The upregulation of selectins and ICAMs in endothelial cells and selectin- and ICAM-ligands in leukocytes play important roles in rolling and adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pober and Sessa, 2007</xref>). Unlike the effect of TNF-α on endothelial cells, CD95L stimulation or CD95/CD95L deletion in endothelial cells have no impact on the expression level of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells. A previous study has reported that crosslinking of CD95 with antibody rapidly triggers down-modulation of L-selectin, CD44, LFAα and LFAβ in CD95-sensitive T cell blasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kabelitz et al., 1996</xref>). In our study, in vitro or in vivo treatment with CD95L, or CD95 deletion in myeloid cells did not change cell surface expression levels of most integrins, which shows a cell type dependent effect of CD95 on the expression of adhesion molecules. These results demonstrate that CD95-induced neutrophil slow rolling is independent of regulation of adhesion molecules.</p><p>Endothelial cells play a pivotal role in leukocyte recruitment by synthesizing and presenting chemokines and leukocyte adhesion molecules during inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pober and Sessa, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, CD95L has also shown to be expressed by endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sata and Walsh, 1998</xref>). Overexpression of CD95L by adenovirus transduction in endothelial cells markedly attenuated TNF-α-induced T cell and macrophage infiltration, and adherent mononuclear cells underwent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sata and Walsh, 1998</xref>). Along this line, tumor endothelial cells selectively and highly express CD95L, which serves as a barrier to prevent the infiltration of CD8 cells via induction of apoptosis in the establishment of immune tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Motz et al., 2014</xref>). Contrary to the apoptotic effect of endothelial cell-derived CD95L, the present study shows that deletion of CD95L in endothelial cells impairs neutrophil recruitment in inflamed cremaster muscle and thioglycolate-induced peritonitis. Together, these data indicate that endothelial cell-derived CD95L may serve as a chemokine to induce myeloid cell recruitment during inflammation. Endothelial cells are known to basally express CD95L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sata and Walsh, 1998</xref>), however, as shown by our study on CD95L-induced slow rolling in the autoperfused flow chamber assay, CD95L might only induce slow rolling in an inflammatory setting, as this function requires additional presentation of E-selectin by endothelial cells. In addition, inflammatory cytokines might increase CD95L levels in endothelial cells. Along this line, IFNγ activates CD95L promoter activity in T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirchhoff et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Integrin signaling plays important roles in regulating cancer 'stemness', metastasis and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seguin et al., 2015</xref>).

Western blots were quantified with ImageJ software and normalized to the respective loading controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Rap1 activation assay</title><p>Active Rap1 Pull-Down assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fisher Scientific, Germany). Bone marrow-derived neutrophils were stimulated with CD95L (40 µg/ml) and the cell lysates were prepared. 100 µl Glutathione Resin and 20 μg of GST-RalGDS-RBD peptide were added to 500 μg lysate. GTPγS and GDP incubated lysates were used as positive and negative control respectively. After one-hour incubation at 4°C, resin beads were washed 4 times and then followed by incubation in 40 µl of 2x laemmli buffer at 95°C for 5 min. Precipitates were electrophoresed and blotted for anti-Rap1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Soluble ICAM1 binding assay</title><p>Soluble ICAM1 binding assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lefort et al., 2012</xref>). Mouse bone marrow-derived neutrophils were suspended in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution containing 1 mM CaCl2 and MgCl2, and then the cell suspension was planted in CD95L-precoated chamber in the presence of ICAM1/FC (20 µg/ml, R&amp;D systems, USA) and PE-conjugated anti-human IgG1 (Fc-specific; Southern Biotechnology, USA) for 5min at 37°C. Anti-CD11b (10 µg/ml) antibody was used to block the Mac-1-dependent ICAM1 binding. The binding of ICAM1 was determined by flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Integrin activation reporter assay</title><p>Integrin conformational change upon CD95L treatment was tested by staining with reporter antibodies recognizing specific epitopes of integrin at different statuses. To test the binding, U937 cells (10 million/ml) were premixed with anti-Human CD11/CD18 (mab24) or anti-Human CD11/CD18 (KIM127) and perfused through the human E-selectin coated flow chamber with a syringe pump (New Era Pump Systems, USA) at the flow rate of 3 μl/min upon the stimulation with soluble CD95L (60 ng/ml) or immobilized CD95L (10 μg/ml for coating). The assembly and coating of the flow chamber was the same as described for the autoperfused mouse flow chamber assay. Cells flowed through the chamber were collected and fixed in 2% PFA. Then the fixed cells were stained with PE anti-mouse IgG and analyzed with flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Proximity ligation assay and image analysis</title><p>Colocalization of integrin α<sub>L</sub> to CD95 was determined by proximity ligation assay. dHL60 cells were planted in CD95L-precoated chamber for 10 min at 37°C. Following stimulation, cells were fixed with 2% PFA and stained with anti-CD11a (EP1285Y, abcam, UK) and anti-CD95 (APO-1-1, Enzo Life Science, Germany) antibodies. After washing, the proximity ligation assay was performed by using duolink kit following the manufacturer's instruction (Duolink In Situ Red Starter Kit Mouse/Rabbit, Sigma-Aldrich). Then the cells were stained with DAPI and Alexa 647-conjugated Phalloidin. Immunofluorescent signals were recorded with a TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica, Germany).

Age matched littermates of <italic>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup></italic> and <italic>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;Cre&gt;</sup></italic> mice were used. Briefly, mice were anesthetized and cecum was exposed and ligated. To induce serve sepsis, the cecum was punctured twice with an 18-gauge needle, after which a small drop of feces was extruded from each puncture site to ensure patency. Mice were sacrificed 6 hr after CLP, at which time the peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 3 ml sterile phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM EDTA, and blood and spleen were collected. Aliquots of peritoneal lavage, blood and spleen homogenate were serially diluted, overnight cultured on sheep blood agar plates under 37˚C, and then the number of CFUs was determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical evaluation</title><p>Statistical significance between groups were evaluated by one-way ANOVA using Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc test for multiple groups comparison or Student's <italic>t</italic> test for two groups comparison.

However, all found major problems including 1) the need to address the state of CD95L in their system. Whether their soluble and surface-bound CD95L is monomeric or trimeric is not known and consequently, how it activates CD95 is not clear. While the full mechanism behind activation of integrins by CD95L2 need not be worked out in this paper, the details of their reagents must be provided in order to allow these experiments to be reproduced by others. 2) There are internal inconsistencies in the data, identified in the individual comments. These must be addressed. 3) The authors do not rule out other important modifiers or explanations such as the role of E-selectin. 4) It is not clear which (other) leukocyte integrins may be involved. After an online discussion, the reviewers thought that addressing these issues was necessary to validate their conclusions and therefore for acceptance of the manuscript. However, they thought that depending on the answers, additional experimentation to address these questions could be completed in a reasonable time frame if the authors chose to do so, and therefore, that they be given the opportunity to resubmit.</p><p>The full reviews are appended below for your consideration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors present evidence both in vitro and in vivo to show that interactions between CD95L on endothelial cells and CD95 on myeloid cells promotes slow rolling and adhesion by activation of β2 integrins through a pathway involving CD95, a src family kinase, Syk and/or Btk and PLCγ2.

The authors show that presentation with CD95L results in phosphorylation of Syk/Btk/PLCy2/Rap1, an activation pathway that leads to integrin activation which in turn mediates slow rolling. Additionally, the authors show that CD95 in myeloid cells is required for bacterial clearance in a CLP-induced animal model of sepsis. The authors show a great deal of data collected through a thorough analysis of the effects of CD95L in vitro and in vivo. They determine that CD95L interaction results in activation of B2 integrin and subsequent decrease in rolling velocity and an increase in transendothelial migration that results in better bacterial clearance than in CD95-/- cells. However, the difference between CD95L signaling has not been decoupled from outside-in signaling induced by E-selectin engagement as the effect seems somewhat cooperative based on the data. Additionally, CD95L has often been associated with the induction of apoptosis and the authors must show that the cells are not moving towards an apoptotic phenotype when CD95 is engaged. All in all, the authors present a novel interaction between leukocytes and endothelial cells that results in increased recruitment via outside-in signaling. With some additional experiments and verifications of cell lifetime the paper would make a strong addition to the literature.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the authors show a decrease in rolling velocity when presented with CD95L on the substrate or (to a lesser degree) with circulating CD95L. Using CD95 KO mouse cells, the decrease is abolished. However, the authors only show this on CD95L i.v. injected cells. What about with CD95L coating? That response shows a much larger decrease either implying additional receptor interactions that require shear force.</p><p>A) I believe it is important to include rolling velocity on E-selectin alone substrates to ensure that CD95L causes slow rolling through integrin activation.</p><p>B) An anti-Mac-1 mAB blocking should be compared with the anti-CD11a intervention in 1D.</p><p>C) An important parameter to confirm normalized PMN numbers would be circulating count for the various mouse lines, which are not discussed.</p><p>2) It is stated that tethering via E-selectin in the flow chamber is necessary for ligation and signaling via CD95L. However, is it possible to mediate this signaling via P-selectin or L-selectin and still observe CD95-signaled slow rolling? This would indicate that E-selectin specifically associates in the membrane at sites of rolling to arrest with CD95 and LFA-1 and should be addressed.</p><p>3) Increased extended and high affinity B2 integrin occur when cells are perfused with soluble CD95L but not with immobilized CD95L in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. This is contrary to what is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> where coated CD95L induces slower rolling. The authors claim this is due to activation of B2 integrin, how is this dichotomy addressed?</p><p>A) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> also shows that soluble CD95L without E-selectin present shows no effect on KIM127 or mAb24 binding. The authors then make the claim that &quot;CD95L treatment induces integrin conformational changes&quot;. This conclusion is not supported solely based on the data, it seems more likely that CD95L alone does not affect LFA-1 but rather enhances outside-in signaling via E-selectin, since without it no change is observed.</p><p>) Additionally in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> the cells stained with DAPI do not seem to exhibit a multi-lobed nucleus. Have these HL-60 cells truly been differentiated into PMN like cells? Additionally, the authors do not quantify F-actin concentration per cell. Based on the images provided I would say cells presented with CD95L have more phalloidin binding. This would imply a greater amount of actin polymerization and could help further the authors' claims.</p><p>4) The manuscript is very well put together but I am concerned that the CD95L is generally associated with induction of apoptosis. Is it possible these cells are being signaled toward apoptosis and that results in a cell membrane restructuring (increased activation, potential activation of integrin). It would be useful to show live/dead cell staining on your flow cytometry panels. It also may be important to observe long term cells survival to show that CD95L does not hasten programmed cell death of populations of PMN under study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript summarizes a series of reasonably novel and interesting results implicating CD95/CD95L on myeloid and endothelial cells, respectively, in the process of myeloid cell adhesion and transmigration into the sites of inflammation. The authors take an advantage of LysM-Cre and Cdh5-cre for myeloid and endothelial cells, respectively. These approaches provide comprehensive and conclusive results regarding the role of CD95/CD95L in slow rolling of myeloid cells. The authors also show the main signaling events involved in integrin activation by CD95, such as a complex formation between integrin, CD95, E-selectin etc. Overall, this is a solid and comprehensive study of substantial novelty.</p><p>I have several concerns which require clarification and additional experimentation.</p><p>The authors often refer to the analysis of neutrophils while using LysM-specific Cre as well as LysM-GFP. However, LysM is commonly known to be a general myeloid cell marker (myeloblasts, macrophages, and neutrophils) rather than strictly neutrophil marker. Caution is needed while dealing with this particular Cre. Another neutrophil relevant and, possibly more appropriate driver for Cre is Ly6G.</p><p>While considering the main integrin involved in rolling and adhesion for LysM-expressing cells, alphambeta2 appears to be more prominent. In fact, there is a discrepancy in the manuscript regarding the main integrin (alphalbeta2 on 5; alphambeta 2 (CD11b) was used as a marker for gaiting in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> takes an advantage of two best markers for neutrophils gating. For analysis of integrin expression and activation I suggest similar gating of GFP-positive cells and analysis of neutrophils separately from monocytes, using activation reporter abs to both integrins.</p><p>Since the authors claim that CD95 signaling leads to integrin activation, they need to demonstrate this directly by a combination of methods, not merely binding of KIM and mAb24. For these two abs, please show FACs profiles and both,% of positive cells as well as MFI. Why the authors use anti-CD11b abs? Both integrins (alphaL and alpham beta2) are expected to be activated by CD95 pathway. In fact, other integrin (i.e. beta3) are likely to be activated as well. Do the authors claim this to be CD11a specific? If this is the case, the authors have to analyze all integrins separately. It will help to show impaired β 2 integrin activation on CD95 KO cells in the presence and absence of CD95L. Second, perhaps more difficult aspect is to show impaired integrin activation on CD95L KO endothelium.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18542.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors present evidence both</italic> in vitro <italic>and</italic> in vivo <italic>to show that interactions between CD95L on endothelial cells and CD95 on myeloid cells promotes slow rolling and adhesion by activation of β2 integrins through a pathway involving CD95, a src family kinase, Syk and/or Btk and PLCγ2.

I worry that the results may depend on the cell type and not be universal.</italic> </p><p>We applied TNFa-induced inflammation model of cremaster muscle to study the parameters of CD95-induced neutrophil slow rolling, adhesion and trans-endothelial migration under sterile inflammation conditions. Thioglycollate-induced peritonitis is also a sterile inflammation model, while it is more related to pathological conditions. In accordance with our previous study (Letellier et al., 2010), our data from these two models show that CD95 signaling mediates neutrophil recruitment in sterile inflammation. In order to examine whether CD95-mediated recruitment is a general mechanism during inflammation, we applied CLP model which is a pathogen-induced systemic inflammation model and our data shows that CD95 is also involved in mediating neutrophil recruitment in pathogenic inflammation (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, also see subsection “CD95 in myeloid cells is required for bacterial clearance”). We cultured macrophages from fetal liver cells in order to get enough cells for the signaling study as <italic>Syk</italic> deficiency (<italic>Syk-/-</italic>) is perinatal-lethal in mice. Human-derived U937 cell line was used in the integrin activation assay as the antibodies used in these assays were only human antigen specific.</p><p><italic>I could not find a description of the CD95L (FasL) that the authors use.

It is commercially available from IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany. Also see the subsection “Autoperfused mouse flow chamber assay”.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.

If the decreased adhesion and TEM of PMN is due to the role of CD95 in slow rolling, how do they explain the decreased adhesion and TEM under conditions in which slow rolling is not affected? This would imply some additional role for CD95 in adhesion and transmigration.</italic> </p><p>We agree that CD95 is also involved in modulating adhesion and transmigration. And actually we have previously reported that CD95 induces myeloid cells transmigration via activating the Syk-PI3K-MMP9 pathway (Letellier et al., 2010). These findings are already cited in the Introduction (second paragraph).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In the cremaster muscle in response to TNFα, PMN in endothelial cell-specific CD95L KO mice have and increased rolling velocity, while in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> myeloid-specific CD95 KO neutrophils have the same rolling velocity as wild-type in the same model. If these are ligands for each other, the same effect should be seen. Why is this not so?</italic> </p><p>We speculated in the previous version of the manuscript that this effect might be due to the redundant function of TNF-α and CD95 in regulating slow rolling. Interestingly, two studies showed that TNF is involved in neutrophil and T-cell adhesion via TNF-induced integrin inside-out signaling (Lauterbach et al., 2008; Li et al., 2016). In the revised version, we demonstrate that neutrophils from naïve <italic>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;cre&gt;</sup></italic>mice express higher level of TNFR2 but similar levels of TNFR1. However, at 6h after CLP, neutrophils from <italic>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;cre&gt;</sup></italic>mice express higher TNFR1 but similar level TNFR2 (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). As TNF-a was applied to induce the inflammation in the cremaster muscle, the compensated effect of CD95 deficiency on slow rolling might be due to the up-regulated TNFR in neutrophils from <italic>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;cre&gt;</sup></italic>mice. Also see the fourth paragraph of the subsection “CD95L stimulation induces neutrophil slow rolling”.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The effects on integrin activation and ICAM-1 binding seem rather modest. There is no explanation of what the x-axis is in 4G.</italic> </p><p>Similar ‘modest’ binding of integrin activation reporter antibodies or ICAM1 has also been shown in other publication, such as (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref> of Pruenster et al., 2015,) and (Figure 6C of Germena et al., 2015,). We assume it might be due to the basal activation of the cells we used or simply because the effect of CD95L is not as robust as chemokines/cytokines, such as CXCL1 in activating integrin.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> demonstrates the number of PLA signal in a violin plot in control or CD95L-treated dHL60 cells. X-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> shows control or CD95L treatment.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The effect on bacterial clearance seems small. Mice were sacrificed at 6 hours, which seems to be a relatively short time point. What would happen if this were extended to 24 hours? What would be the effect on mortality? Other very important questions: How many PMN enter the peritoneal cavity under these conditions? One cannot extrapolate from the thioglycollate peritonitis experiments. The authors must measure PMN infiltration as well as determine whether the increased CFUs in the CD95 KO mice is due to defective PMN transmigration, defective PMN apoptosis, or defective bacterial phagocytosis and killing.</italic> </p><p>In our preliminary experiment of peritonitis we observed that neutrophils peaked in peritoneal cavity 6h after thioglycollate injection (data not shown). Another study also showed that in the CLP model neutrophils peaked in peritoneal cavity at 6h after CLP (Deng et al., 2013). Therefore, we chose 6h post CLP as the time point to study the effect of CD95 on neutrophil’s recruitment, which could be reflected by the difference of CFUs numbers between wt and CD95 KO mice.</p><p>In the revised version we have added the data of PMN infiltration 6h after CLP. <italic>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;cre&gt;</sup></italic> mice shows significantly less PMN infiltration compared to the control mice (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, altogether these data indicate that the impaired bacterial clearance in <italic>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;cre&gt;</sup></italic>mice is at least partially due to the reduced infiltration of neutrophils. The additional impact of CD95 deficiency on neutrophil activity should be clarified in future studies.</p><p>Also see the subsection “CD95 in myeloid cells is required for bacterial clearance” and the last paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>Summary</italic> </p><p><italic>The manuscript of Martin-Villalba et al. aims to show that CD95 mediates leukocyte slow rolling upon engagement with CD95L presented by endothelial cells.

That response shows a much larger decrease either implying additional receptor interactions that require shear force.</italic> </p><p>Immobilized CD95L-induced slow rolling was also abolished in <italic>Fas<sup>&lt;f/f&gt;</sup>::Lyz2<sup>&lt;cre&gt;</sup></italic>mice (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and also subsection “CD95L stimulation induces neutrophil slow rolling”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>A) I believe it is important to include rolling velocity on E-selectin alone substrates to ensure that CD95L causes slow rolling through integrin activation.</italic> </p><p><italic>B) An anti-Mac-1 mAB blocking should be compared with the anti-CD11a intervention in 1D.</italic> </p><p>We have added this piece of data to the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Anti-MAC-1 (CD11b) mab didn’t block the effect of CD95L on slow rolling (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and also subsection “CD95L stimulation induces neutrophil slow rolling”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>C) An important parameter to confirm normalized PMN numbers would be circulating count for the various mouse lines, which are not discussed.</italic> </p><p>Absolute numbers of circulating PMN were added to the revised version. See revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref> and also subsection “CD95L stimulation induces neutrophil slow rolling”, last paragraph and subsection “Endothelial cells-derived CD95L mediates neutrophil recruitment”, last paragraph.</p><p><italic>2) It is stated that tethering via E-selectin in the flow chamber is necessary for ligation and signaling via CD95L. However, is it possible to mediate this signaling via P-selectin or L-selectin and still observe CD95-signaled slow rolling? This would indicate that E-selectin specifically associates in the membrane at sites of rolling to arrest with CD95 and LFA-1 and should be addressed.</italic> </p><p>CD95L shows no effect on rolling velocity of neutrophil on L-selectin/P-selectin and ICAM1 coated chamber (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref> and also subsection “CD95L stimulation induces neutrophil slow rolling”, third paragraph). It suggests that the CD95 specifically modulates E-selectin-associated slow rolling.</p><p><italic>3) Increased extended and high affinity B2 integrin occur when cells are perfused with soluble CD95L but not with immobilized CD95L in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. This is contrary to what is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> where coated CD95L induces slower rolling. The authors claim this is due to activation of B2 integrin, how is this dichotomy addressed?</italic> </p><p>Immobilized CD95L also increased the binding of reporter antibodies of extended and high affinity integrin, but just not as effective as the soluble CD95L treated one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). It might due to the coating concentration of CD95L, which did not meet the optimized concentration for human cell lines as compared to the concentration used for mouse cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>A) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> also shows that soluble CD95L without E-selectin present shows no effect on KIM127 or mAb24 binding. The authors then make the claim that &quot;CD95L treatment induces integrin conformational changes&quot;. This conclusion is not supported solely based on the data, it seems more likely that CD95L alone does not affect LFA-1 but rather enhances outside-in signaling via E-selectin, since without it no change is observed.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the CD95-induced conformational changes are E-selectin-dependent. See the second paragraph of the subsection “CD95L stimulation activates integrin”.</p><p><italic>B) Additionally in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> the cells stained with DAPI do not seem to exhibit a multi-lobed nucleus. Have these HL-60 cells truly been differentiated into PMN like cells? Additionally, the authors do not quantify F-actin concentration per cell. Based on the images provided I would say cells presented with CD95L have more phalloidin binding. This would imply a greater amount of actin polymerization and could help further the authors' claims.</italic> </p><p>In this study, HL-60 cells were allowed to differentiate in presence of 1.3% DMSO for 6 days before used. The DAPI staining pictures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> were derived from maximal projections of multi stacks pictures, therefore they lost some information of the nucleus morphology. The following pictures show the selected stacks of DAPI staining for cells showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. The nucleuses are non-spherical and exhibit as lobed structure.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18542.014</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18542.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18542.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-18542-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>It is a great idea to quantify the F-actin polymerization in control and CD95L-treated cells, since it further supports the data showing activation of integrin upon CD95L treatment. There was more phalloidin binding in CD95L-treated cells as compared to control cells, however it is not significantly different with the limited number of cells we examined (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref> and also subsection “CD95 recruits and associates with integrin”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) The manuscript is very well put together but I am concerned that the CD95L is generally associated with induction of apoptosis. Is it possible these cells are being signaled toward apoptosis and that results in a cell membrane restructuring (increased activation, potential activation of integrin). It would be useful to show live/dead cell staining on your flow cytometry panels. It also may be important to observe long term cells survival to show that CD95L does not hasten programmed cell death of populations of PMN under study.</italic> </p><p>In our previous study we have shown that CD95L stimulation had no effect on inducing apoptosis at the concentration we applied to the myeloid cells (Letellier et al., 2010). Neutrophils and macrophages stimulated with CD95L also showed no recruitment of Fas-Associated Death Domain (FADD) to the Death Domain (DD) of CD95.</p><p>Accumulating evidence demonstrates that CD95 also has important non-apoptotic functions, such as mediating cell survival, proliferation and migration, mostly through the activation of three major MAPKs, c-JUN N-terminal kinase (<italic>JNK</italic>), p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), NF- κB and PI3K pathways (reviewed by Wajant et al., 2003; Peter et al., 2007; Martin-Villalba et al., 2013). Interestingly, a recent paper (Poissonnier et al., 2016) reported that CD95 signaling promoted Th17 cell transmigration, instead of inducing apoptosis, which shows a similar function in myeloid cells as we previously observed (Letellier et al., 2010). These data are cited in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>I have several concerns which require clarification and additional experimentation.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors often refer to the analysis of neutrophils while using LysM-specific Cre as well as LysM-GFP. However, LysM is commonly known to be a general myeloid cell marker (myeloblasts, macrophages, and neutrophils) rather than strictly neutrophil marker. Caution is needed while dealing with this particular Cre. Another neutrophil relevant and, possibly more appropriate driver for Cre is Ly6G.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the Ly6Gcre would be a better mouse line for this study. And we are also aware that <italic>lysozyme M</italic> gene is expressed by myeloid lineage cells and didn’t claim that we use <italic>Lyz2<sup>&lt;Cre&gt;</sup></italic> for neutrophil-specific KO. In the autoperfused flow chamber assay, using the <italic>Lyz2<sup>&lt;CreGFP&gt;</sup></italic> reporter mice, 89 ± 2% of the rolling cells were brightly fluorescent (Chesnutt et al., 2006). The purity of neutrophils among the rolling cells had also been identified by staining of myeloperoxidase of fixed cells in the flow chambers (Zarbock et al., 2007). For the model of inflamed cremaster muscles, it’s been reported that &gt;95% of all adherent and rolling leukocytes are neutrophils (Jung et al., 1998, also see subsection &quot;CD95L stimulation induces neutrophil slow rolling&quot;, fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>While considering the main integrin involved in rolling and adhesion for LysM-expressing cells, alphambeta2 appears to be more prominent. In fact, there is a discrepancy in the manuscript regarding the main integrin (alphalbeta2 on 5; alphambeta 2 (CD11b) was used as a marker for gaiting in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> takes an advantage of two best markers for neutrophils gating. For analysis of integrin expression and activation I suggest similar gating of GFP-positive cells and analysis of neutrophils separately from monocytes, using activation reporter abs to both integrins.</italic> </p><p>A previous study showed that antibody against LFA-1 (CD11a, integrin αL) could block the E-selectin/ICAM1-induced slow rolling, while antibody against MAC-1 (CD11b, integrin αM) could not (Zarbock et al., 2007). And our data show that CD11a antibody, but not CD11b antibody, also block CD95L-induced slow rolling (see revised version <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and also see the subsection “CD95L stimulation induces neutrophil slow rolling”, second paragraph), which indicates that CD95 signaling induces slow rolling via activating integrin alphaL.</p><p>For the studies of integrin expression level, all the analysis was based on the gating of Ly6G high and CD11b positive neutrophils of which monocytes were excluded. We didn’t use GFP-reporter mouse here. Available integrin activation reporter abs are only specific for human antigens, thus we used only human cell lines for this study.</p><p><italic>Since the authors claim that CD95 signaling leads to integrin activation, they need to demonstrate this directly by a combination of methods, not merely binding of KIM and mAb24. For these two abs, please show FACs profiles and both,% of positive cells as well as MFI. Why the authors use anti-CD11b abs? Both integrins (alphaL and alpham beta2) are expected to be activated by CD95 pathway. In fact, other integrin (i.e. beta3) are likely to be activated as well. Do the authors claim this to be CD11a specific? If this is the case, the authors have to analyze all integrins separately. It will help to show impaired β 2 integrin activation on CD95 KO cells in the presence and absence of CD95L. Second, perhaps more difficult aspect is to show impaired integrin activation on CD95L KO endothelium.</italic> </p><p>We used the integrin activation reporter antibody binding assay and soluble ICAM1 binding assay to directly prove that CD95 signaling activates integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). And we show that the intermediate factor for integrin activation- the Rap1GTPase was also activated upon CD95L stimulation.</p><p>FACS profiles for KIM127 and mAb24 staining are added, see revised version <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and also see the second paragraph of the subsection “CD95L stimulation activates integrin”. MFI was measured by gating on the whole population. Anti-CD11b abs here was used to block the binding of reporter antibodies, which could be induced by CD11b activation.</p><p>According to our data, CD95-induced slow rolling is CD11a specific as it can be blocked by CD11a (integrin αL) antibody but not CD11b (integrin αM) antibody (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and also the subsection “CD95L stimulation induces neutrophil slow rolling”, second paragraph). The rest known integrin α subunits binding to integrin β2 are integrin αX which is not expressed by neutrophils, and integrin αD which ligates to ICAM3/VCAM1. Thus, we don’t think that further blocking integrin β2 (CD18) or block integrin activation on CD95L KO endothelial cells is critical for this study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
