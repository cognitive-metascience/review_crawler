apparatus. Recent studies have revealed significant downregulation of TFIID subunits in terminally differentiated myocytes, hepatocytes and adipocytes. Here, we report that TBP protein levels are tightly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Using an in vitro ubiquitination assay coupled with biochemical fractionation, we identified Huwe1 as an E3 ligase targeting TBP for K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Upregulation of Huwe1 expression during myogenesis induces TBP degradation and myotube differentiation. We found that Huwe1 activity on TBP is antagonized by the deubiquitinase USP10, which protects TBP from degradation. Thus, modulating the levels of both Huwe1 and USP10 appears to fine-tune the requisite degradation of TBP during myogenesis. Together, our study unmasks a previously unknown interplay between an E3 ligase and a deubiquitinating enzyme regulating TBP levels during cellular differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08536.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08536.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08536.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most animal cells specialize to perform particular roles that contribute to the survival of the animal in different ways. For example, the cells that form our muscles are able to contract, while other cells in the body are efficient at storing fat.

Recent studies have revealed that TBP is deliberately destroyed by a group of proteins called the proteasome in muscle cells, in a type of liver cell, and in fat cells. Here, Li et al. used biochemical techniques to study the regulation of TBP during the formation of muscle cells from less specialist mouse cells called myoblasts.</p><p>The experiments show that an enzyme called Huwe1 selectively adds a tag to TBP that marks TBP for destruction by the proteasome. Another protein called USP10 acts to remove the tags to prevent TBP from being destroyed. Therefore, it appears that changes in the levels of Huwe1 and USP10 fine-tune the amount of TBP that is degraded during the formation of muscle cells.</p><p>Li et al.'s findings suggest that other proteins that are also involved in activating gene expression may also be destroyed as muscle cells form.

TBP serves as a key subunit to facilitate transcription initiation by all three RNA polymerases in eukaryotic cells. As a part of the SL1 complex, TBP plays a role in recognizing Pol I-transcribed promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comai et al., 1994</xref>). Similarly, TBP and its associated factors (TAFs) that make up the TFIID complex are specific for Pol II-mediated mRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dynlacht et al., 1991</xref>). Likewise, the TBP/B/BRF complex TFIIIB drives the transcription of small nuclear RNAs by Pol III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Taggart et al., 1992</xref>). Given this pivotal role in transcription, TBP-mediated transcriptional regulation has been extensively studied by biochemical and genetic approaches in past decades(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernandez, 1993</xref>). However, only limited studies have interrogated the regulation of TBP during cell-type specification. The main reason is that cell-type specific transcription programs have generally been considered to be dictated by classic sequence-specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farnham, 2009</xref>), while the components of the core promoter recognition machinery such as TBP were thought to be largely invariant across different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Thomas and Chiang, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Recently, studies demonstrated that during a number of terminal differentiation processes, TBP protein levels become dramatically downregulated. Specifically, in terminally differentiated myocytes, hepatocytes and adipocytes, normally high concentrations of TBP protein as well as the canonical components of the TFIID complex become severely reduced while other core pre-initiation complex components such as RNA Pol II remain largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Alessio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). In conjunction with TBP downregulation, various cell-type specific ‘orphan’ TAFs are switched on to help direct developmental gene expression and terminal differentiation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Alessio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goodrich and Tjian, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, it was found that reductions in TBP protein levels are much more pronounced than decreases in its mRNA levels, suggesting that an important level of TBP regulation occurs post-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Alessio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herrera et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore set out to decipher the mechanisms by which TBP protein levels are regulated during differentiation.</p><p>Here, we show that TBP is a substrate for ubiquitination by a specific E3 ligase in vivo and in vitro. By using a combination of in vitro assays and biochemical fractionation, we identified the 480 kDa Huwe1 protein as a major E3 ligase targeting TBP. We confirmed in vitro that purified recombinant Huwe1 targets TBP for ubiquitination, while loss-of-function experiments allowed us to probe TBP regulation by the E3 ligase in vivo. We also identified USP10 as a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) that modulates Huwe1-mediated TBP ubiquitination and protects TBP from proteasome-mediated degradation. Importantly, we were able to show that the E3 ligase becomes significantly upregulated during myotube differentiation, while its paired USP becomes dramatically downregulated. Together, our results support a model in which coordinated ubiquitination and deubiquitination activities finely balance TBP protein levels during terminal differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Regulation of TBP protein levels by UPS during myogenesis</title><p>Consistent with several earlier observations from our lab and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perletti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>), we found that upon myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells TBP protein levels become significantly downregulated, while its mRNA levels remained largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that TBP downregulation mainly occurs via modulation of its protein levels. Since the major protein degradation pathway in eukaryotic cells is mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hochstrasser, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998</xref>), we treated post-mitotic myotubes with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and checked whether TBP downregulation was affected. Strikingly, TBP protein levels were partially restored within 4 hr after MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that the UPS likely plays a dominant role in regulating TBP levels during terminal differentiation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08536.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates TBP protein levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Treatment of differentiated C2C12 myotubes with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 rescues TBP protein levels.

Subsequently, all ubiquitinated protein species in the cells were pulled down under denaturing conditions by using Nickel resin (See details in the ‘Materials and methods’). Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of slower-migrating poly-ubiquitinated species of the TBP protein in the pull-downs, suggesting TBP is indeed ubiquitinated in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Biochemical fractionation and identification of Huwe1 as a TBP E3 ligase</title><p>Ubiquitination is catalyzed by a cascade of three different enzymes, E1 activation enzyme, E2 conjugation enzymes and E3 ligases. The target specificity of the system is largely determined by E3 ligases, that recognize specific substrates for ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nakayama and Nakayama, 2006</xref>). To identify potential E3 ligases that specifically target TBP for ubiquitination, we used biochemical fractionation followed by an in vitro ubiquitination assay.</p><p>As a first step towards establishing an in vitro biochemical assay for TBP ubiquitination, we incubated in vitro translated HA-tagged TBP protein with either myoblast or myotube lysates supplemented with proteasome inhibitor MG132, a general deubiquitinase inhibitor (ubiquitin aldehyde), ubiquitin and an energy regenerating mix (See details in the ‘Materials and methods’). After 90 min of reaction at 37°C, we purified the substrate protein by anti-HA antibody affinity chromatography and analyzed TBP ubiquitination by anti-ubiquitin western blots. Higher molecular weight ubiquitinated TBP species were detected in reactions with both myoblast and myotube lysates, suggesting TBP ubiquitination activities are present in both proliferating muscle progenitors and terminally differentiated muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Since it is impractical to scale up myoblast and myotube cultures to obtain sufficient materials for bulk biochemical fractionation, we then tested whether TBP can be ubiquitinated by lysates of Hela cells. We detected significant TBP ubiquitination activities in Hela whole cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then separated the whole cell extract into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, and found that most of the TBP ubiquitination activities were present in the cytoplasmic fraction (S100) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Using S100 as starting material, we designed a purification scheme for isolating putative TBP E3 ligases based on the in vitro ubiquitination assay. To simplify the ubiquitination assay, we used recombinant GST-tagged TBP as the substrate, which allows efficient isolation of the ubiquitinated TBP species with GST resin. It is worth noting that while GST-TBP can be efficiently ubiquitinated in the reaction, we did not detect any ubiquitination of the GST protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that these ubiquitination activities are specific to TBP. We could also detect ubiquitinated TBP species as slower-migrating bands by anti-TBP western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08536.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Purification of TBP E3 ligase from HeLa cytoplasmic fraction (S100).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vitro ubiquitination of TBP by HeLa cell lysates.

None of the fractions alone was sufficient to mediate TBP ubiquitination. Reasoning that E1, E2 and E3 activities might be eluted at different salt concentrations, we then supplemented each fraction with recombinant E1 and a panel of E2s, and found that the 300 mM elution supplemented with several E2s (UbcH5 family E2s and UbcH7) robustly catalyzed TBP ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>We then precipitated the 300 mM D52 eluate with ammonium sulfate and further fractionate it by Butyl Sepharose, Superose 6 gel filtration, Heparin and finally MonoQ columns to enrich for E3 ligases responsible for TBP ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (See details in the ‘Materials and methods’). Ubiquitination assays on the activities eluted from the Superose 6 sizing column suggest the molecular weight of the E3 ligase(s) to be about 440–660 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

As expected, the TBP ubiquitination activity of the purified recombinant Huwe1 protein was much more robust than that of partially purified fractions, presumably due to higher Huwe1 concentrations and/or the absence of potential inhibitors of ubiquitin polymerization. When using a methyl ubiquitin that only supports monoubiquitination together with purified recombinant Huwe1 in our assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hershko and Heller, 1985</xref>), we detected a ladder of shifted bands separated by around 8 kDa similar to the TBP ubiquitination patterns generated by the partially purified Mono Q fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Indeed, purified His-Huwe1 bound to full-length TBP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, this interaction is dependent on the C-terminal DNA binding domain of TBP, which is a highly conserved and highly structured region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies showed that Huwe1 contains a HECT (Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) domain, which accepts ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of a thioester, and then directly transfers the ubiquitin to targeted substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rotin and Kumar, 2009</xref>). To confirm that the HECT domain of Huwe1 is required for its TBP ubiquitination activity, we generated two mutants of Huwe1: one with the HECT domain truncated (Δ4341–4374), the other with the active site cysteine residue mutated to serine. Both mutant proteins were purified through the same procedures as the wild type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Neither of the mutants was able to mediate TBP ubiquitination in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Apparently, the N-terminal region of Huwe1 outside the catalytic domain is also required for efficient TBP ubiquitination, as the homologous HECT domain from E3 ligase E6AP was unable to carry out TBP ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Having established that Huwe1 mediates TBP ubiquitination in vitro, we then asked which E2 conjugating enzymes work best with Huwe1 in this reaction. Many recent studies have revealed the importance of E2 conjugating enzymes in determining the length and topology of ubiquitin chains and hence the cellular consequences of ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ye and Rape, 2009</xref>). We therefore tested the ability of a panel of E2s to collaborate with Huwe1 in mediating TBP ubiquitination, and found that both the UbcH5 family E2s and UbcH7 are active in the in vitro ubiquitination assay with recombinant purified Huwe1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), consistent with the E2 enzymes that worked with the crude 0.3 M KCl fraction from the D52 column.</p><p>We also asked whether TBP ubiquitination has specific poly-ubiquitin chain topologies. It was shown that poly-ubiquitin chains on a substrate can be formed using any of the seven lysines in ubiquitin, and specific ubiquitin chain topologies are linked to distinct biological pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). To map the topology, we performed in vitro TBP ubiquitination assays using ubiquitin mutants with individual lysines mutated to arginines. Strikingly, when K48R ubiquitin was used, poly-ubiquitinated TBP species were significantly diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, lane 4), suggesting that Huwe1 likely mediates K48-linked ubiquitin chain formation on TBP. Ubiquitin chains of this topology usually lead to proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Huwe1 regulates TBP protein levels in proliferating cells</title><p>Having established that Huwe1 supports TBP K48 linkage ubiquitination in vitro, we next tested whether Huwe1 regulates TBP protein levels in vivo. Knocking-down Huwe1 in 293T cells with two different shRNAs resulted in increased levels of endogenous TBP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To determine relative TBP protein stability more quantitatively in cells, we developed an in vivo TBP half-life measurement system based on a fluorescence timer assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khmelinskii et al., 2012</xref>). In this assay, TBP is fused to both a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mCherry), which takes hours to complete its maturation, and a monomeric superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), which becomes fluorescent within minutes after synthesis. Due to the slow maturation rate of mCherry relative to sfGFP, the mCherry/sfGFP intensity ratio at steady state correlates with the half-life of the fusion protein, independent of the protein synthesis rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We co-transfected 293T cells with plasmids expressing Huwe1 shRNAs and TBP-mCherry-sfGFP fusion protein. Knockdown of Huwe1 by 2 independent shRNAs led to significant increases in mCherry/GFP intensity ratios, evident in both imaging and flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similarly, lentivirus-mediated Huwe1 shRNA knockdown in C2C12 myoblasts leads to elevated endogenous TBP protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We further tested how Huwe1 affects TBP protein half-life by cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiments. Consistent with results from fluorescent timer experiments, Huwe1 knockdown by two independent shRNAs both increased TBP protein half-life in myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Strikingly, in contrast to dramatic decreases in TBP protein levels, Huwe1 protein levels are significantly upregulated in myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

We further tested this notion by directly knocking down Huwe1 in differentiated myotubes. Loss of Huwe1 induced abnormal morphological changes of myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Consistent with these morphological changes, differential gene expression followed by gene ontology analysis revealed that many genes (<italic>e.g., Myog</italic>, <italic>Mef2a</italic>, <italic>Mef2c, Ckm</italic> and <italic>Myh3</italic>) important for muscle development are downregulated in Huwe1 depleted myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Deubiquitinase USP10 protects TBP from degradation, and downregulation of USP10 is important for myogenesis</title><p>In C2C12 myoblasts, TBP protein is present at substantial levels despite the presence of Huwe1 E3 ligase. We therefore reasoned that there must be activities in these cells that may be antagonizing the ubiquitination of TBP by Huwe1 and thereby protect it from degradation. Interestingly, a previous study reported that in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Ubp3 deubiquitinates Tbp1 both in vivo and in vitro and prevents Tbp1 from proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chew et al., 2010</xref>). A protein sequence homology comparison suggests that ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) is the likely mammalian homolog of Ubp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>). To test whether USP10 deubiquitinates and stabilizes TBP in mammalian cells, we overexpressed USP10 in 293T cells and monitored TBP ubiquitination levels in these cells. Strikingly, overexpression of USP10 significantly inhibited TBP ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). To test whether USP10 deubiquitinates TBP through direct protein–protein interactions, we used HA-TBP to co-IP with Flag-USP10 co-expressed in 293T cells. Our experiment revealed that TBP can co-immunoprecipitate with USP10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Importantly, both western blot and flow cytometry analysis confirmed modestly increased TBP protein levels in a C2C12 stable cell line overexpressing USP10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, cycloheximide chase experiments (CHX) revealed that USP10 overexpression increased TBP protein half-life in C2C12 myoblasts(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) . These results suggest that USP10-mediated TBP deubiquitination might also contribute to regulating TBP levels during myogenesis. To further test this possibility, we compared the protein levels of USP10 before and after myotube differentiation. Interestingly, similar to TBP, the protein levels of USP10 decrease during in vitro muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We then examined whether increasing USP10 protein levels in post mitotic myotubes can rescue TBP protein levels. To do this, we generated a stable cell line with an inducible USP10 transgene. Upon addition of the inducer (cumate), USP10 can be induced to higher levels in both myoblasts and myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). USP10 overexpression in myotubes resulted in higher levels of TBP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). To probe whether UPS10 downregulation during myogenesis is of functional significance, we evaluated the differentiation potential of the C2C12 cell line overexpressing USP10. These cells failed to differentiate into polynucleated myotubes in differentiation medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Consistent with this observation, transcriptome analysis revealed that several important myogenic markers (e.g., <italic>Myod1</italic>, <italic>Myog</italic>, <italic>Myh3</italic> and <italic>Ckm</italic>) failed to be induced in cells overexpressing USP10 even on differentiation Day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that a combination of Huwe1 upregulation and USP10 downregulation may be important for modulating TBP degradation during myogenesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08536.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) regulates TBP protein level during myogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) USP10 overexpression inhibits TBP ubiquitination in vivo. 293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids as well as a plasmid expressing HA-TBP.

However, recent studies have shown that the protein levels of TBP as well as other canonical components of the TFIID complex can become significantly down-regulated in terminally differentiated myocytes, hepatocytes and adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Alessio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herrera et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, decreases in TBP protein levels are much more pronounced than changes in its mRNA levels. However, the mechanism for regulating cellular TBP protein levels remained largely unknown. Here, we show that the ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a dominant role in mediating TBP protein levels in terminally differentiated myotubes. Interestingly, we found that an E3 ligase activity responsible for ubiquitinating TBP is also present in proliferating cell types such as myoblasts and Hela cells, where TBP is highly expressed. These results suggest that cellular TBP protein levels are under active surveillance by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that TBP protein levels may be tightly regulated in a cell-type specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Huwe1 and USP10 control TBP ubiquitination states</title><p>Using a combination of biochemical fractionation and in vitro ubiquitination assays, we identified the Hect domain containing Huwe1 as a key E3 ligase capable of mediating TBP ubiquitination in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These in vitro biochemical studies subsequently led us to a series of experiments confirming that Huwe1 indeed also regulates TBP levels during myogenesis of C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Huwe1 is essential for animal development. Specifically, deletion of <italic>Huwe1</italic> results in embryonic lethality, with knock-out embryos displaying hemorrhage in the abdominal region by embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), followed by growth impairment, necrosis, and eventual death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kon et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to TBP, Huwe1 has also been suggested to target several other proteins involved in cell-cycle check point and apoptosis, including p53, MCL-1, N-MYC, C-MYC and CDC6. Interestingly, although Huwe1 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, it is particularly enriched in skeletal muscle, which is the tissue where a dramatic decrease in TBP protein levels during terminal differentiation was first reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schwarz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>). Consistent with this observation, we found that Huwe1 is significantly upregulated during in vitro muscle differentiation of C2C12 cells and that up-regulation of this E3 ligase appears to be functionally important for myogenesis and maintenance of normal muscle morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>As part of the TBP surveillance system, we also found that a deubiquitinase, UPS10, contributes to the regulation of TBP ubiquitination and degradation by counteracting the Huwe1 E3 ligase activity. USP10 is a ubiquitously expressed deubiquitinase, whose substrates include tumor suppressor p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>). The exact role of USP10 during development remains unclear due to the absence of mouse models. However, we found that a stable cell line (C2C12) overexpressing USP10 is impaired in myotube formation, suggesting that down-regulation of USP10 may also be a prerequisite for efficient differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes in culture. Deubiquitinases achieve their target specificities through either direct recognition of their substrates or targeting specific ubiquitin chain topologies. Our immune-precipitation experiments suggest that USP10 can recognize ubiquitinated TBP through direct protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). It remains unclear at this point whether there are other deubiquitinases that can also recognize ubiquitinated TBP.</p><p>It is worth noting that due to the promiscuous ‘one-to-many’ relationship between E3 ligase, Deubiqutinase (DUBs) and their substrates, it is difficult to directly test whether the myogenic defects we observed after the loss of Huwe1 or USP10 over-expression are directly due to the failure of down-regulating TBP during differentiation or some other consequences of depleting an E3 ligase or over-expressing a deubiquitinase. However, given the seminal role of TFIID/TBP in promoting the transcription of cell cycle and DNA replication genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Um et al., 2001</xref>), it is reasonable to speculate that down-regulation of TBP should at least influence cell cycle exit of myoblasts, a key step during myotube differentiation. In the future, it may be interesting to study the functional role of Huwe1 and UPS10 during muscle development in vivo and how these two enzymes may regulate TBP protein levels in mouse models. Since TBP protein levels also become dramatically reduced in terminally differentiated hepatocytes and adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Alessio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), it will also be interesting to test whether Huwe1 and UPS10 contribute to TBP downregulation in these other cell types. It also remains unclear whether there are other E3s that would work together with Huwe1 to facilitate TBP protein degradation in terminally differentiated muscle cells. In addition to TBP, other components of the TFIID complex also become down-regulated during terminal differentiation, and in the future it will be worth investigating whether they are targeted by the same or different E3/deubiquitinase pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Fine-tuning of TBP protein levels during muscle differentiation</title><p>Our results suggest that significant up-regulation of Huwe1 and simultaneous down-regulation of UPS10 during myotube differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) may play an important role in regulating proper TBP protein levels during muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

In the case of myoblast to myotube formation, we also detected the presence of a TBP related factor, TRF3, that appeared to play some role in possibly either substituting for TBP, as seen by in vitro reactions, or otherwise remaining detectable during terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deato et al., 2008</xref>). This led us, initially, to propose that the loss of TBP might be accompanied by the assembly of different initiation complexes lacking TBP but containing TRFs and orphan TAFs. However, in several subsequent studies including ESC's, adipocytes and motor neurons, although we consistently observed the emergence and up-regulation of orphan TAFs (i.e. TAF3, TAF7l and TAF9b), we did not detect any up-regulation of TRFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herrera et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, in each of these cases, ChIP-seq experiments suggested that these orphan TAFs were associated both with core promoters (i.e. TSS) as well as either distal or proximal enhancers of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herrera et al., 2014</xref>). It was also reported that KO mice lacking TRF3 showed no obvious muscle development phenotypes casting doubt on the importance of TRF3 in muscle development in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gazdag et al., 2009</xref>). It is therefore possible that both the loss of TBP and TFIID components in certain cell-types is not necessarily accompanied by a change in the core promoter recognition complex as initially postulated (i.e. substituting various TBP/TAFs/TRFs) but a more elaborate and as yet unclear mechanism may come into play potentially involving new interactions between certain TAFs and cell-type specific transcription factors bound to enhancers. In any case, in all our studies of terminal differentiating cell types, we observed a significant, sometimes dramatic loss of TBP and TFIID components that is often accompanied by persistent or differential up-regulation of an orphan TAF.</p><p>An interesting possibility is that down-regulation of TBP protein levels could differentially affect genes with distinct TBP-promoter binding affinities. Recent single molecule studies suggest that transcription factor temporal occupancies at high affinity sites are less sensitive to changes in concentration than those at low-affinity sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is possible that, by fine-tuning TBP protein levels, genes with weak TBP/TFIID binding promoters become selectively turned down while genes with strong TBP/TFIID binding promoters remain largely unaffected thereby executing another mechanism for differential gene regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>C2C12 culture and differentiation</title><p>C2C12 myoblasts were obtained from ATCC (CRL-1772, Manassas, VA), and cultured in DMEM medium (11995-065, Life technologies, Frederick, MD) containing 10% FBS (26140-079, Life technologies) at sub-confluent densities (&lt;70%).

The full-length Huwe1 cDNA with C-terminal deletion was then cloned into pFastBac as a SalI-NotI fragment. pFastbac plasmid for Huwe1 catalytic site mutant was created in a similar way, except for that a different reverse primer (5′-CGGGGTCGGGCCCGCCTTAGGCCAGCCCAAAGCCTTCAGAGC ACTCCTGGATAGCCAACAGTAGCATGTGGCGGAGCTTCTCAAAGCTCTCATAGGCAGGCAGATCCAGCTGATTAAAACTTGTGTGAGCTGAA-3′) was used for ApaI-NotI fragment generation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Purification of WT and mutant recombinant mule protein</title><p>pFastBac plasmids were transfected into Sf9 using Cellfectin II reagent (10362-100, Life technologies) following manufacture's instructions. P3 viruses were used to infect Sf9 cells for protein production. The cells were harvested 48 hr post-infection. Cell pellets were re-suspended in Buffer A (50 ml Buffer A for cell pellets from 1 L culture), and homogenized with a glass douncer. Cytoplasmic fraction was collected by centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 30 min, added in imidazole to final concentration of 10 mM, and then loaded onto a Ni-NTA gravity column. The column was washed with 20 CV Buffer A containing 10 mM imidazole, and the bound His- Huwe1 was eluted using Buffer A containing 100 mM imidazole. A Superdex200 Gl gel filtration column was used to further purify the His-Mule elution. PageBlue staining was used to check Huwe1 protein in each fraction. Glycerol was added to the fractions containing Huwe1 to a final concentration of 5%, and the proteins were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>shRNA-mediated knockdown of Huwe1 in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes</title><p>Huwe1 knockdown in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes were performed using lentiviruses. Viruses were produced by transfecting pLKO.1 shRNA plasmids targeting Huwe1 (targeting sequences: #1: 5′-GCACTCTTCATAACTCACTTT-3′; #2: 5′-GCACTGCTCATCAAAGATGTT-3′)(CloneID:TRCN0000092553; TRCN0000092556; GE Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) with packaging vectors into 293T cells using FuGENE HD (E2311, Promega). Supernatants were concentrated using Fast-Trap Lentivirus Purification and Concentration Kit (FTLV00003, Millipore). Huwe1 knockdown in myoblasts were performed in the presence of 8 µg/ml polybrene at around 70% confluency followed puromycin (A11138-03, Life technologies) selection (1 µg/ml). Extensive passages of surviving cells were avoided in order to maintain knockdown efficiency. Huwe1 knockdown in myotubes was performed by incubating lentiviral concentrates in the presence of 8 µg/ml polybrene on differentiation day 4 for two days, followed by puromycin selection for another 2 days (1 µg/ml) to eliminate uninfected myotubes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of TBP protein half-lives using tandem fluorescent protein timers</title><p>The plasmid expressing wild type TBP-mCherry-sfGFP fusion protein under a CMV promoter were transfected into 293T cells by Fugene HD reagent following manufacturer's instructions. Cell imaging was done using Zeiss Axio Observer microscope. sfGFP signal was detected using excitation filter TBP 495/20, and mCherry signal was detected using excitation filter TBP 570/30. Same exposure time was used for different samples. Images were then further analyzed using ImageJ through the same processes. FACS analysis of TBP-mCherry-sfGFP signal was done in DB FACSAria III Cell Sorter. sfGFP was detected using 488 nm laser, and mCherry was detected using 561 nm laser. mCherry/sfGFP was set as a parameter and detected simultaneously with mCherry and sfGFP signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Gene expression analysis</title><p>Total RNA from wild type and Huwe1 knockdown myoblasts or myotubes was isolated using RNeasy kit (74106, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). mRNA was then purified using Dynabeads Oligo(dT)<sub>25</sub> (25-61002, Life technologies). RNA-seq library was prepared using ScriptSeq v2 RNA-seq Library Preparation Kit (SSV21106, illumina, San Diego, CA), and then sequenced using an Illumina Hiseq 2000 sequencing platform. Reads were mapped to the genome using Tophat, and differentiation expression analysis was done using Cuffdiff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2012</xref>).

I am happy to report that your manuscript has been reviewed by three experts in the field and by a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors, who are excited about the findings reported in this manuscript. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision for your reference as you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We look forward to receiving the revised paper addressing the following four comments from the three different reviews, which are appended below for your information.</p><p>1) Please measure the half-life of TBP via other methods (such as cycloheximide chase +/- RNAi against HUWE1 and USP10).</p><p>2) It will be very important to determine (if possible) the interaction interphase between TBP and Huwe1, and demonstrate that TBP that does not bind Huwe1, that it is not degraded during differentiation.</p><p>3) Please measure the dynamic changes of proteins involved in muscle differentiation (Pax7, <italic>pax5</italic>, MyoD, Myogenin) in control or Huwe1 targeted C2C12. This can be done at transcript levels or preferably at protein levels if antibodies are available.</p><p>4) In the Discussion section of the manuscript, please consider that the limits in the interpretation of the experiments need to be acknowledged.

In addition, their results indicate that a fine-tune regulation of both enzymes is required for a correct muscle differentiation and myogenic gene expression program. Overall, this paper is clearly written and technically remarkable, in particular the biochemical part. However, a few points need to be clarified or modified before I can fully support the publication of this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> could be moved to a supplement and replaced by a cycloheximide chase that is more informative in term of protein half-life.</p><p>2) As mentioned in the text, TBP is not the unique target of Huwe1 and USP10 enzymes. Can an overexpression of TBP in C2C12 cells phenocopy Huwe1 knockdown or USP10 overexpression, at least on differentiation and maintenance of myotube morphology? In the absence of such a control, there is only a correlation between TBP expression level and myotube differentiation.</p><p>3) A USP activity, different from USP10 should be used as a negative control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A-C</xref>. A catalytic-dead mutant of USP10 (<italic>cys</italic> mutant) should also be used at least in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and ideally in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, E, F</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Li at el. described that during C2C12 muscle differentiation the protein level of TBP are high in proliferating myoblasts and declines during their differentiation to myotubes. Using HeLa cell extract and elegant biochemical purification they identified that Hewe1 is the ligase that regulates the level of TBP in this context. They also identified UbC5Hb/c as the E2s involved in Hewe1-mediated ubiquitylation. Interestingly, based on homology from yeast they identified USP10 as the iso-peptidase for TBP, and suggested that USP10 disassemble poly-ubiquitylated-TBP preventing the degradation of TBP. Thus, supporting but not directly testing the idea that a balance between the expression of Hewe1 and USP10 determines the level of TBP. Furthermore, loss of Huwe1 or to a lesser extent expression of USP10 resulted in a failure of C2C12 differentiation, and inability to express muscle specific genes as evident by RNA-seq and GO analysis.</p><p>The observations that the ubiquitin pathway directly regulates TBP level by a specific balance between DUB and ligase is novel, very important, with high relevance for the areas of transcription, protein dynamics, and as well as developmental biology.</p><p>However, the following major points need to be addressed experimentally prior to acceptance:</p><p>1) Determine the interaction interphase between TBP and Hewe1 as well as TBP and USP10 (as the author claims it directly interacts with unmodified substrate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Show that TBP that does not bind Huwe1, that it is not degraded during differentiation. In addition, the antagonisms between TBP and USAP10 as suggested by the authors may be very indirect. The ability of USP10 to degrade Huwe1-dependent poly-ubiquitylated TBP in vitro should be tested.</p><p>2) Huwe1, TBP, USP10 and the impact on transcription during differentiation:</p><p>A) The impact of Huwe1-dependent decline in TBP on transcription should be determined (e.g. a change from TATA to DPE/Inr mode of Pol-II recruitment). For example, can the authors test the impact of loss Hewe1 on TBP occupancy and Pol-II recruitment by ChIP-Seq during differentiation?</p><p>B) If indeed the authors claim for antagonistic function on TBP between USP10 and Huwe1 this should be reflected by antagonistic impact on a large body of genes when comparing RNA-Seq experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figure 6 and 7B</xref>). Simple bioinformatic analysis should address this point.</p><p>3) As correctly stated by the authors, the inhibition of muscle cell differentiation may be due to impact of Hewe1 on several other proteins than TBP, and that are required for muscle differentiation. Thus, this should not preclude an effort to established causality. An effort to directly connect the phenotypes associated with loss of Hewe1 to its regulation of TBP should be preformed. For example, (and in a simple model), it is possible to test if expression of a TBP mutant that is not recognized by the ligase (characterized above) would partially restore differentiation, or at least the expression of myogenic genes.</p><p>4) To support the expression analysis, and to better characterize Hewe1 impact on differentiation, the authors need to trace the dynamic changes at protein level of several muscle markers (Pax7, <italic>pax5</italic>, MyoD, Myogenin in control or Huwe1 targeted C2C12. Specifically in this experiment the level of MyoD are of interest, as it was shown that Hewe1 is involved in the degradation of MyoD in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts (Noy T et al., BBRC, 418 408-413). It will also be nice to show the protein level of Huwe1 and USP10 during C2C12 differentiation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Tjian and colleagues extend their earlier work on the switch in general transcription factor usage during myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deato et al., 2008</xref>). In this work they used the C2C12 cell system for myoblast to myotube differentiation to observe a switch from canonical 14-subunit TFIID to a heterodimeric TAF3-TRF3 complex. In differentiated myocytes TAF3-TRF3 takes over TFIID function to support the transcriptional program.</p><p>The present study investigates the molecular basis for this transcription factor switch. Using their C2C12 system, the authors employ a variety of approaches to conclude that the E3-HECT enzyme HUWE1 collaborates with Ubc5 enzymes to ubiquitylate TATA-binding protein (TBP) for subsequent proteosomal degradation. In addition, USP10 is identified as a TBP-specific deubiquitinase and counters TBP degradation and myocyte differentiation.</p><p>These conclusions are based on the following results:</p><p>a) cytoplasmic extracts from C2C12 cells prior and after terminal differentiation and from HeLa cells contain ubiquitination activity towards recombinant TBP;</p><p>b) highly-purified HeLa S100 fraction active in TBP ubiquitination contains the HECT-domain protein HUWE1;</p><p>c) recombinant HUWE1 can act as an E3 enzyme in TBP ubiquitination assays;</p><p>d) E2 enzymes of the UbcH5 family and UbcH7 can support HUWE1-dependent K48-linked ubiquitin on TBP;</p><p>e) HUWE1 knockdown increases TBP expression in 293T and C2C12 cells;</p><p>f) HUWE1 knockdown inhibits C2C12 differentiation at the cellular and gene expression level;</p><p>g) the deubiquitinase USP10 decreases in expression upon C2C12 expression;</p><p>h) overexpression of USP10 in 293T or C2C12 results in a small increase in TBP levels;</p><p>i) overexpressed TBP and USP10 can be co-immunoprecipitated in 293T cells.</p><p>There are several issues crucial to the conclusion that HUWE1/UbcH5 and USP10 control the switch from TBP and TFIID to TAF3-TRF3 that have not been resolved by the current study. As it stands now, the presented study is rather preliminary, for example:</p><p>1) It remains unclear whether HUWE1 and USP10 are the unique E3 and DUB enzymes in C2C12 cells directly controlling TFIID/TBP degradation. As stated by the authors, HUWE1 was one of the three E3s identified in the chromatographic fraction from HeLa cells. What were the others? Relevant in this is that the pattern of ubiquitylated TBP species is quite different when comparing reactions with the starting C2C12 extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) versus purified recombinant Huwe1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). It is difficult to ascertain whether fractions 35 and 36 are really peaking in the number of HUWE1 peptides. How many HUWE1 peptides are contained in side fractions 33 and 34? Did the authors go back and test the fractions mono Q fractions by HUWE1 immunoblotting? It is also important to note that recombinant HUWE1 seems much more processive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) than observed in reactions with HeLa or C2C12 extracts.</p><p>An additional point of concern is that in order to monitor purification of the E3 from HeLa cells extracts the authors only used GST-TBP and TBP antibodies as detection. The authors should provide results form an in vitro ubiquitinylation experiment using HeLa fractions and the GST-TBP substrate probed with anti-Ubiquitin.</p><p>All these points raise significant doubt on the conclusion that HUWE1 is the relevant E3 activity.</p><p>2) The argument that a domain outside the HUWE1 HECT domain is required for TBP specificity, because the HECT-domain from another E3 E6AP does not support TBP ubiquitination, does not make sense. To make map TBP-specificity the authors should perform a structure-function study on HUWE1. In light of this, did the authors investigate whether TBP can interact directly with HUWE1?</p><p>3) To really verify that they isolated the C2C12-relevant E3 a control experiment using a C2C12 extract antibody-depleted for HUWE1 and/or USP10 should be provided to show that HUWE1 and USP10 are indeed the relevant enzymes as suggested by the RNAi experiments.</p><p>4) To assess whether TBP (and the TFIID TAFs) are indeed destabilized via proteosomal degradation in differentiated myocytes, the authors should determine the protein half-lives, preferably in a pulse-labelling setup. This should be combined with an RNAi against HUWE1 and against USP10 mRNA.</p><p>5) Are the TFIID TAFs also subjected to HUWE1/USP10-mediated control during myogenesis?</p><p>6) Are the TAF3 and TRF3 proteins resistant to HUWE1-mediated ubiquitylation? Or are they better substrates for USP10 deubiquitination, which leads to their protection from proteosomal degradation?</p><p>7) Relevant details about the part of HUWE1 expressed as a recombinant protein and the biochemical purity of the recombinant HUWE1 preparation should be provided.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> does not help to clarify the text and is rather speculative at this stage, as it remains unclear whether ubiquitination and deubiquitination occur in the cytoplasm. It should be removed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08536.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Please measure the half-life of TBP via other methods (such as cycloheximide chase +/- RNAi against HUWE1 and USP10)</italic>.</p><p>We have now measured the half-life of TBP protein using cycloheximide chase experiments and this data is included in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement1</xref> (Control vs Huwe1 knockdown C2C12 cells) and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref> (Control vs USP10 overexpressed C2C12 cells), showing that both Huwe1 knockdown and USP10 overexpression resulted in increased TBP protein half-life.</p><p><italic>2) It will be very important to determine (if possible) the interaction interphase between TBP and Huwe1, and demonstrate that TBP that does not bind Huwe1, that it is not degraded during differentiation</italic>.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have tried to characterize potential direct interactions between TBP and Huwe1. In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>, we have now provided evidence that purified recombinant Huwe1 protein directly interacts with TBP through its DNA binding domain in vitro. Based on this result, it will be quite challenging to address whether TBP mutants that fail to bind Huwe1 are not degraded during differentiation. Previous crystallographic studies have shown that the conserved C-terminal DNA binding domain is a highly structured region of TBP (Nikolov et al., 1996). TBP mutants with truncated C-termini are most likely misfolded and will be degraded by Huwe1-independent pathways (Goldberg, 2003). Indeed, previous studies in yeast have shown that even point mutants in the TBP DNA binding domain can alter its protein stability (Jackson-Fisher et al., 1999; Kou et al., 2003).
