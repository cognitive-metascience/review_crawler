Using TRE-EB1-GFP mice, we found that MT dynamics are strongly suppressed in differentiated keratinocytes in two distinct steps due to alterations in both growth rate and lifetime. To understand the functions of these MT populations, we developed TRE-spastin mice to disrupt MTs in specific cell types. MT perturbation in post-mitotic keratinocytes had profound consequences on epidermal morphogenesis. We uncoupled cell-autonomous roles in cell flattening from non-cell-autonomous requirements for MTs in regulating proliferation, differentiation, and tissue architecture.

The functions for microtubules in intact tissues, as well as their organization and dynamics, are less well understood. There are multiple reasons for this: (a) many cell types will not fully differentiate when cultured outside of the organism, (b) non-specific effects resulting from using drug-induced microtubule disassembly assays, including secondary effects due to mitotic arrest and apoptosis, (c) lack of information about which microtubule regulators are essential for microtubule organization in many differentiated cell types, and (d) few genetic tools to specifically perturb microtubules in differentiated cell types. While differentiation induces loss of centrosomal microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) activity in many cells, there are only a few examples where both the changes in microtubule organization and dynamics and the functions of the resulting networks have been assayed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Lacroix et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Le Droguen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Oddoux et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The mammalian epidermis develops from a single layer of proliferative basal cells that adheres to an underlying basement membrane. As stratification proceeds, cells transit outward and progressively differentiate, first into spinous cells, then into granular cells, and finally into corneocytes, which are required for epidermal barrier activity. While microtubules are organized in a centrosomal array in basal cells, differentiation results in loss of centrosomal MTOC activity, and MTs eventually organize into cortical arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Muroyama et al., 2016</xref>). The functions for MTs in the differentiated cells remain unknown, although they have been implicated in the formation and function of cell-cell adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Nekrasova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Simard-Bisson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sumigray et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we characterize both the dynamics and the functions of epidermal microtubules using novel transgenic mouse lines that reveal differentiation-induced alterations in MT dynamics as well as unexpected functional roles for non-centrosomal MT arrays in these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visualizing microtubule dynamics during differentiation in vivo with the TRE-EB1 mouse</title><p>To visualize and quantify microtubule dynamics in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse containing a cassette encoding a GFP-tagged copy of the microtubule plus-tip tracking protein EB1 under the tetracycline-responsive element (TRE) promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). With this line, EB1-GFP expression can be temporally controlled through doxycycline exposure and spatially controlled via cell- or tissue-specific tTA/rtTA lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Urlinger et al., 2000</xref>) or tissue-specific Cre lines paired with the Rosa-rtTA line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Hochedlinger et al., 2005</xref>). After screening founders by assaying EB1-GFP induction in primary keratinocytes, we chose a line with mosaic expression (hereafter referred to as TRE-EB1) to allow precise resolution of single cells in a complex tissue field.</p><p>We generated CMV-rtTA; TRE-EB1 embryos to visualize microtubule dynamics in keratinocytes during progressive differentiation transitions with sub-cellular resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, we did not observe any cell morphology or tissue architecture phenotypes associated with EB1-GFP expression using this system. Microtubules in basal keratinocytes grew from the cell center to the periphery in a roughly radial orientation, in agreement with previous data that the centrosome is the primary MTOC in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>). In spinous cells, clear radial organization was lost, and microtubules were observed growing in all directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Despite the reorientation of microtubule growth in spinous cells, EB1 density was unaffected by this initial differentiation transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similar to spinous cells, microtubules in granular cells grow throughout the cytoplasm in all directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). However, the density of EB1-GFP puncta was higher in granular cells, and projections over time revealed that microtubules in these cells exhibited greatly reduced dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Treatment of embryos with nocodazole eliminated the GFP puncta, strongly suggesting that these EB1-GFP comets mark plus-ends of very slowly growing and/or paused microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-29834-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29834.002</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>EB1-GFP dynamics in a proliferative, basal keratinocyte in a mouse embryo.</title></caption></media><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-29834-video2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29834.003</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>EB1-GFP dynamics in a differentiated, spinous keratinocyte in a mouse embryo.</title></caption></media><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-29834-video3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29834.004</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>EB1-GFP dynamics in a differentiated, granular keratinocyte in a mouse embryo.</title></caption></media><p>Quantification of microtubule growth distances revealed a gradual decrease in motility over keratinocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Surprisingly, this gradual decrease in microtubule growth distance was due to two changes in microtubule behavior that occurred at distinct differentiation transitions. At the basal to spinous cell transition, microtubule growth speed was relatively unaffected, although there was a minor increase in growth speed in spinous cells (basal mean growth speed 11.1 ± 3.1 µm/min versus spinous mean growth speed 12.2 ± 3.3 µm/min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These growth rates were similar to those observed in vivo in cells of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg-laying apparatus and in mouse muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Lacroix et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Oddoux et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, microtubule growth speeds were strongly suppressed as spinous cells differentiated into granular cells (granular mean growth speed 7.1 ± 3.7 µm/min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Examination of the persistence of a single EB1-GFP puncta revealed that growth duration was significantly shorter in spinous versus basal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The growth duration was unchanged between spinous and granular cells. The short growth periods likely reflect pause and/or catastrophe events that cannot be discriminated because EB1-GFP marks only growing microtubules. While there was no correlation between the growth speed and duration (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.002–0.19) or the growth speed and distance (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.004–0.2), there was a clear correlation between the length of time an EB1-GFP puncta moved and how far it traveled in basal (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.87) and spinous cells (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.85), as would be expected for microtubules polymerizing at a constant speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Primary keratinocytes begin to stratify when cultured, forming a proliferative basal layer and a single, post-mitotic, ‘suprabasal’ layer, which recapitulates some of the features of spinous cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Muroyama et al., 2016</xref>). Absolute polymerization rates were dramatically increased in isolated cells, suggesting that microtubule dynamics are altered as primary cells initiate a wound-healing response in culture, as has been noted for cell-cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Foote et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, although the absolute polymerization rate was greatly increased, the overall trends across all three measured parameters consistently mirrored the trends seen at the basal to spinous transition in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). These data highlight that while there is some utility in assessing microtubule dynamics in cultured cells, they do not fully recapitulate the physiological setting.</p><p>Taken together, we have established the TRE-EB1-GFP mouse line as a tool to visualize and quantify microtubule behavior in single cells in vivo in mice. We used this line to make qualitative observations about microtubule organization during differentiation that confirmed that microtubules reorganize into non-centrosomal arrays as basal cells differentiate. Interestingly, by following microtubule dynamics over distinct differentiation transitions, we demonstrate that pause/catastrophe events are initially increased as basal cells differentiate into spinous cells. As spinous cells mature into granular cells, microtubule polymerization rates are strongly suppressed and the occurrence of very slow growing microtubules increases significantly. To determine the functions of these distinct populations of microtubules, we next created a transgenic tool to disrupt their organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Development of TRE-spastin to genetically perturb MTs in vivo</title><p>Because loss-of-function approaches that specifically target differentiated cells are not always feasible in tissues that rapidly turn over, we pursued a gain-of-function strategy to disrupt microtubule organization via spastin overexpression (OE).

Importantly, spastin OE greatly reduced α-tubulin signal in all tissues assayed; often only small fragments of MTs remained following spastin induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). In addition to cytoplasmic microtubules, spastin OE also dramatically shortened cilia, although it is unclear if this treatment shortens existing cilia or perturbs new cilia growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

As we have not detected any mis-expression of the K14-rtTA transgene, this result suggests that spastin-expressing cells delaminated from the basement membrane. Indeed, we identified many mitotically arrested cells that appeared to be in the process of delaminating, suggesting that spastin-positive cells in the suprabasal layers were generated, at least partially, through delamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Thus, the epidermis eliminates mitotically arrested cells from the proliferative niche either through apoptosis or delamination. Areas with numerous suprabasal spastin-positive cells displayed local thickening, suggesting that disruption of microtubules in suprabasal keratinocytes may more severely disrupt epidermal architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).

These data demonstrate a non-cell-autonomous response of the progenitor cells to microtubule loss in their differentiated progeny. Hyperproliferation was not caused by elevated apoptosis, as apoptosis was not significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>).

Taken together, our data indicate that spastin OE in differentiated keratinocytes causes dramatic hyperproliferation within the basal layer, leading to a severe thickening of all of the differentiated layers of the tissue.

As keratinocytes transition from spinous to granular cells, they adopt a flattened shape that, when viewed in cross-section, is highly anisotropic (spinous mean aspect ratio (AR) = 1.88; granular mean AR = 5.08). Currently, little is known about how this cell-shape change is controlled. Strikingly, differentiating spastin-positive cells were incapable of properly flattening (spinous AR = 1.72 versus granular AR = 1.89) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). Cell-shape defects were cell-autonomous, as wild-type cells in K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin epidermis were still able to flatten, although were sometimes distorted by their spastin-positive neighbors. Identical cell-shape defects were also seen in granular cells expressing HA-spastin in K14-rtTA; TRE-spastin mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These cell-shape changes were not due to gross loss of adherens junctions, as we noted no obvious disruptions to cortical E-cadherin localization in mutant tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). This is consistent with E-cadherin loss-of-function mutants, which are still able to undergo squamous morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Tinkle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Tunggal et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, granular cell markers were still induced in the proper layers, indicating that inability to flatten is not due to a general block in differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These data reveal an unexpected role for microtubules in differentiation-induced cell flattening in the epidermis. Interestingly, these phenotypes were not observed upon deletion of type II myosins or core actin regulators such as the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sumigray et al., 2012</xref> ;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that changes in granular cell morphology are not driven by alterations in acto-myosin contractility and demonstrating a role for MTs in this process.</p><p>To address whether MTs are required for initial flattening and/or maintenance of flattening, we first performed short-term doxycycline treatment of K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin embryos (e18.5-P0) and measured the aspect ratio of granular cells, reasoning that many of the granular cells we observed in these back skins were flattened prior to spastin OE. Indeed, many flattened spastin-positive granular cells were observed in the upper granular layers in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>). Additionally, we treated isolated granular cells with nocodazole and noted no change in cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Therefore, microtubules are required for the cell flattening at the spinous to granular transition but are dispensable for maintaining the established flattened shape.</p><p>While adherens junctions appeared normal in the mutant epidermis, we were also interested in whether desmosomes, which are known upstream regulators of microtubule organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Sumigray et al., 2011</xref>), were perturbed and could underlie the cell-shape defects observed in K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin suprabasal cells. While some data in cultured cells suggests MTs are required for desmosome assembly, other studies have found little to no effect of MT disruption on desmosome formation in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Nekrasova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Pasdar et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Simard-Bisson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Sumigray et al., 2011</xref>).

Desmoplakin localization was normal between these single spastin OE pairs within otherwise wild-type cells, arguing that microtubule disruption does not autonomously alter desmosome assembly in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). However, in areas where a significant number of cells expressed HA-spastin, we saw the same desmosomal phenotypes as those observed in the K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Similarly, desmoglein-1 was also maintained at cell borders of single spastin expressing cells in the K14-rtTA; TRE-spastin line and was globally lost in areas where many suprabasal cells expressed spastin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Therefore, the observed desmosome defects are not a primary effect of microtubule disruption, but rather are a tissue-wide response to it. Examination of spastin-positive cell pairs also clearly demonstrated that the cell-shape changes are not secondary to desmosome dysfunction, as these spastin OE cells with normal cortical desmoplakin levels also fail to flatten (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Finally, because basal cell hyperproliferation is not seen in desmoplakin-mutant skin, the progenitor hyperproliferation we observe in K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin epidermis is not likely to be secondary to desmosome disruption.</p><p>Strikingly, microtubule disruption resulted in a remarkable number of entosis-like structures in both the spinous and granular layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K,L</xref>). Imaging whole-cell volumes provided further evidence that the cell-in-cell structures strongly resemble entotic events (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Canonical entosis is an active invasion of one cell into the cytoplasm of another as it loses substrate attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Overholtzer et al., 2007</xref>). We observed invading cells with elevated pMLC-2, consistent with an active actin-based entotic invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). Additionally, we observed F-actin based protrusions that appeared to be invading into neighboring cells, potentially reflecting the initial stages of entosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). Entotic events ranged from entosis of a single spastin+ cell to what appeared to be concentric rings of cells, suggesting multiple layers of entosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>). We did not observe any examples of a wild-type cell within a spastin+ cell. Taken together, our data demonstrate that microtubules prevent entosis in vivo, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown. One possibility is that without microtubules, differentiated keratinocytes cannot flatten and consequently invade one another, potentially due to imbalances in membrane tension. Other possibilities, such as a stress and/or transcriptional responses, may also underlie this phenomenon. This phenotype was not noted in desmoplakin-null epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Vasioukhin et al., 2001</xref>), again suggesting that this is not secondary phenotype associated with adhesion defects.</p><media id="video4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-29834-video4.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29834.019</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Z-stack of an example of entosis in K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin epidermis.</title><p>Phalloidin marks the cell outlines.</p></caption></media><p>The phenotypes described above – thickening of the epidermis and cell-shape defects – were also found upon disruption of microtubules in the adult epidermis, demonstrating that these phenotypes are not specific to embryonic development.

Surprisingly, despite the numerous morphological defects in corneocytes, K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin embryos formed a fully functional barrier by e18.5, consistent with the fact that these mice survive postnatally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We speculate that the thickening of the stratum corneum compensates for abnormal corneocyte formation. That said, our data reveal a previously unrecognized role for microtubules in the proper formation of the cornified envelope, which could either be a direct effect on corneocyte assembly or secondary to cell shape defects in granular cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Microtubule disruption causes premature epidermal differentiation and barrier formation</title><p>Having identified cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous functions for microtubules late in embryonic development, we turned to understand how microtubules influence the earlier stages of epidermal differentiation. We analyzed K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin embryos where spastin induction began at e14.5 as stratification commences. Surprisingly, the epidermis in mutant embryos was severely thickened even by e16.5, demonstrating that basal-cell hyperproliferation is a rapid response to suprabasal microtubule disruption, even before the barrier normally forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Concurrent with thickening, mutant epidermis exhibited signs of premature differentiation, including robust expression of the granular marker filaggrin, ZO-1, and the presence of cornified envelopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> and data not shown). Premature differentiation was not confined to spastin-positive cells; wild-type cells in e16.5 K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin epidermis also expressed filaggrin in the upper layers of the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). We performed the X-gal exclusion assay on e16.5 embryos to determine if premature differentiation in K10-rtTA; TRE-embryos resulted in premature barrier formation. Interestingly, while control embryos had no barrier function at this stage, the back skin of K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin embryos had already formed a functional barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Therefore, microtubule disruption in suprabasal cells during early epidermal stratification unexpectedly induces premature differentiation and barrier formation, potentially through dramatic tissue thickening.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We generated a TRE-EB1-GFP mouse line, which permits in vivo imaging of microtubule dynamics in various cell types. Using this mouse, we performed live imaging of EB1-GFP in the developing epidermis of intact mouse embryos and demonstrate that microtubule growth is suppressed as keratinocytes differentiate. To our knowledge, only one other quantification of MT dynamics over differentiation in an intact tissue—the <italic>C. elegans</italic> egg laying apparatus—has been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Lacroix et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, specific growth parameters were tuned at distinct transitions during keratinocyte differentiation. As basal cells differentiate into spinous cells, pause/catastrophe frequency was increased, as inferred by a decrease in EB1-GFP persistence. As spinous cells matured, polymerization rates were strongly suppressed. These data raise the intriguing possibility that specific subsets of MAPs that underlie these dynamic differences may be expressed at distinct stages of keratinocyte differentiation. Mining of published transcriptional databases reveals that epidermal differentiation induces extensive alterations to the expression of microtubule-related proteins, including tubulin isoforms (α,β,γ), MAPs, and microtubule-modifying enzymes. A clear area of future work will be to determine which MAPs are responsible for the observed changes in microtubule growth parameters, with a special focus on determining how specifically tuned microtubule dynamics influence epidermal development. Furthermore, we anticipate that the TRE-EB1 mouse will be useful for performing similar measurements in vivo across differentiation lineages in other tissues.</p><p>We developed the TRE-spastin mouse to understand the functions for microtubules in diverse and distinct cell populations in vivo. While care must be taken to validate that spastin overexpression disrupts microtubules in other tissues of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Sherwood et al., 2004</xref>), we have found robust loss of microtubules in epidermis, intestine, heart and liver upon spastin induction using this line. This provides both the first experimental examination of microtubule function in intact epidermis and provides a microtubule ‘null’ phenotype that is essential for future comparisons to perturbations that affect microtubule organization and/or dynamics. The dramatic consequences of microtubule disruption in the epidermis suggest that more subtle changes to dynamics/organization may have phenotypic consequences. Ablation of microtubules in different epidermal compartments revealed distinct requirements for microtubules in epidermal morphogenesis. We found that the epidermis eliminates mitotically arrested cells through both apoptosis and delamination but is quite robust in responding to microtubule defects in a substantial number of cells. The elimination of basal cells by delamination/differentiation allows the epidermis to make use of these defective progenitors.</p><p>By overexpressing spastin in suprabasal keratinocytes using a novel K10-rtTA mouse, we demonstrate that stable non-centrosomal microtubules regulate overall tissue architecture. While there are pleiotropic phenotypes downstream of microtubule loss in differentiated keratinocytes, defects in cell shape appear to be one clear cell-autonomous consequence of microtubule disruption. In the absence of MTs, epidermal cells do not undergo squamous morphogenesis, the mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. Differentiation-induced flattening occurs in the absence of E-cadherin, type II myosins and the Arp2/3 complex, which clearly impact cell shape in numerous other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sumigray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Tinkle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Tunggal et al., 2005</xref>). How could microtubules promote cell flattening? One possibility is that microtubules influence cell shape indirectly through effects on other cytoskeletal elements, such as actin filaments, or on cell adhesions, such as desmosomes. However, our data strongly argue against the latter as the flattening defects we observed were independent of any gross desmosome defects; single spastin-positive cells with normal cortical desmoplakin failed to flatten. An intriguing possibility is that kinesin-dependent microtubule sliding may provide a force to drive cell-shape changes, similar to what has been reported in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Winding et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, our data also indicate that, while microtubules are required for initiating flattening, they are dispensable for maintaining the flattened granular shape, which could be controlled by other cytoskeletal elements like keratins.</p><p>One of the clear strengths of the TRE-spastin mouse is the ability to distinguish between cell-autonomous and tissue-wide effects of microtubule disruption. Spastin OE in suprabasal keratinocytes uncovered numerous unexpected non-cell-autonomous defects associated with loss of microtubules in differentiated cells. These included desmosome perturbation, basal hyperproliferation, cornified envelope defects, and premature differentiation. The mechanisms underlying these effects are a clear area for future study. Particularly, it remains important to identify how cells sense microtubule loss, whether the signal is mechanical in nature or more directly involves sensing tubulin/microtubule levels or organization. The work presented here highlights the value of examining phenotypes associated with microtubule disruption in vivo, and these tools should be of broad utility to the study of microtubules during mammalian development and homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and tissues</title><p>All mice were maintained in accordance with Duke IACUC-approved protocols.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A transgenic toolkit for visualizing and perturbing microtubules reveals unexpected functions in the epidermis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Kathleen Janee Green (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The strength of this paper is the development and characterization of these new models for studying MTs role in the epidermis. The tools will be of great use to the community and the observations made here are provocative and should be of broad interest to the <italic>eLife</italic> readership. They develop a practical approach to disrupt microtubules with temporal and tissue-specific control in intact mice. The fact that they get some quite surprising results indicates just how important it is to actually look at how quite familiar things like microtubule polymerization work in tissues. However, there are also some caveats associated with the authors' interpretations that would benefit from additional experimental analysis and/or discussion. Because of the complexity of the outcomes and interrelatedness of cytoskeletal regulatory pathways, the authors should be cautious not to overstate their conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> should be moved to supplementary data (a supplement to a primary figure, per <italic>eLife</italic> policy).</p><p>2) The authors conclude in the Abstract and manuscript that the desmosome phenotype is non-cell autonomous based on data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. Further quantification and images are needed to fully support this conclusion.</p><p>3) The characterization of entosis is interesting but without 3D shapes of the epidermis, how can the authors be confident of entotic cell analysis?</p><p>Major Issues:</p><p>4) The authors describe a defect in cell flattening in spastin positive cells, and conclude that MT are important for this process. They suggest that it is unlikely actin plays a role, based on previous observations from Arp3 and myosin II deficient mice. However, disruption of microtubules could result in the release and activation of factors such as GEFs and mDia, possibly leading to alterations in actin. Is it possible that GEF activity and/or mDia (for instance) are altered and contribute to the observed phenotypes?</p><p>5) The authors also do not adequately consider the potential role of loss of Dsg1 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) to the observed phenotype of hyperproliferation and epidermal thickening. It is interesting that these phenotypes somewhat resemble SPPK, which is sometimes linked to Dsg1 deficiency causing increased MAPK signaling.</p><p>6) The authors state that cell flattening is independent of desmosomes because spastin positive cells with normal cortical DP are unable to flatten. Related to this conclusion, cell flattening defect was analyzed in the K10-rtTA model, while the normal cortical DP was shown using the K14-rtTA line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and DP was significantly disturbed in the K10-rtTA line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In addition, it has been shown that Dsg1 deficiency results in changes in cell shape.</p><p>7) Also, there are caveats associated with relying on DP as an indicator of normal desmosome assembly/function as DP does not require MTs for its incorporation into junctions, but there could be interference with MT-dependent trafficking of specific forms of the desmosomal cadherins that are not appreciated in the analysis. So just because DP is present, doesn't mean that desmosomes exhibit their normal stage-specific structure/composition. Also, while the authors show tissue wide effects on desmosomes in the K10-rtTA model, they do not show this for the K14-rtTA model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29834.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> should be moved to supplementary data (a supplement to a primary figure, per eLife policy).</p></disp-quote><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> has been moved to become a supplementary figure (it is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors conclude in the Abstract and manuscript that the desmosome phenotype is non-cell autonomous based on data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.

A quantification of the desmoplakin intensity between pairs of cells that express spastin and are surrounded by wild type cells is now included to accompany the images (new panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This analysis was from K14-rtTA;TRE-spastin mice in which few suprabasal cells expressed spastin. This demonstrates that the cortical intensity of desmoplakin is equivalent between these mutant cell pairs compared to wild-type cell pairs. We also included a quantification of desmoplakin intensity from regions of these same mice where a high number of cells were spastin positive. These data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>) show the same phenotype as the K10-rtTA;TRE-spastin mice, a loss of cortical desmoplakin staining. We also include new images of Dsg1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>) that show the same findings for this desmosomal cadherin. Together, these data are consistent with microtubules not having a cell-autonomous role in cortical localization of desmosomal proteins, but rather, that when enough cells have disrupted microtubules a non-cell autonomous response involves desmosome perturbation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The characterization of entosis is interesting but without 3D shapes of the epidermis, how can the authors be confident of entotic cell analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a supplemental video through an entotic event (Supplementary Video 4).

We did not address whether actin might play some role in this process. However, to make this clearer we have altered a sentence in the Discussion to read:</p><p>“One possibility is that microtubules influence cell shape indirectly through effects on other cytoskeletal elements, such as actin filaments, or on cell adhesions, such as desmosomes.”</p><p>While we cannot rule out a role for mDia, GEF activity would likely result in an increase in acto-myosin contractility, and we did not see any evidence for this in terms of either myosin II requirement or in levels of pMLC (a marker for active myosin II, data not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors also do not adequately consider the potential role of loss of Dsg1 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) to the observed phenotype of hyperproliferation and epidermal thickening.

As for the possibility that defects in desmosomes underlie the hyperproliferation – while SPPK is an excellent example in human skin disease, there is no data that desmosome mutants result in hyperproliferation in an embryonic context, and especially before barrier loss. While we cannot rule out this possibility, we think it is unlikely given that published work demonstrated that Dsg1 loss of function results in a differentiation defect, which we do not see in the spastin expressing mouse (rather, the basal cells are hyperproliferative, but differentiation occurs normally). Therefore, we aren’t convinced that the phenotypic similarity is sufficient to warrant this discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors state that cell flattening is independent of desmosomes because spastin positive cells with normal cortical DP are unable to flatten.

In addition, it has been shown that Dsg1 deficiency results in changes in cell shape.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include data on the flattening defects in both the K14-rtTA and the K10-rtTA lines. Both show a consistent defect in granular cell shape that is cell autonomous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We also include quantifications for DP cortical intensities in both K14-rtTA; TRE-spastin and K10-rtTA; TRE-spastin lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> includes images showing the Dsg1 remains cortical in cells that are clearly rounded, suggesting that the rounding is unlikely due to loss of Dsg1 localization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Also, there are caveats associated with relying on DP as an indicator of normal desmosome assembly/function as DP does not require MTs for its incorporation into junctions, but there could be interference with MT-dependent trafficking of specific forms of the desmosomal cadherins that are not appreciated in the analysis. So just because DP is present, doesn't mean that desmosomes exhibit their normal stage-specific structure/composition. Also, while the authors show tissue wide effects on desmosomes in the K10-rtTA model, they do not show this for the K14-rtTA model.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and we agree that looking solely at DP may not be ideal, given the data on microtubule dependent transport of some desmosomal cadherins. We thus included images of Dsg1 as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and find the same results as with desmoplakin. In addition, the revised manuscript includes the analysis of both K10-rtTA and K14-rtTA mice, as discussed above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
