Despite being central for its function, the molecular basis of SCRIB recruitment and stabilization at the cell cortex is poorly understood. Here we show that SCRIB binds directly to the CH1 domain of β spectrins, a molecular scaffold that contributes to the cortical actin cytoskeleton and connects it to the plasma membrane. We have identified a short evolutionary conserved peptide motif named SADH motif (SCRIB ABLIMs DMTN Homology) which is necessary and sufficient to mediate protein interaction with β spectrins. The SADH domains contribute to SCRIB dynamics at the cell cortex and SCRIB polarity function. Furthermore, mutations in SCRIB SADH domains associated with spina bifida and cancer impact the stability of SCRIB at the plasma membrane, suggesting that SADH domain alterations may participate in human pathology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04726.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04726.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04726.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins found in cells often have more than one role. Scribble is one such multi-tasking protein that is found in a diverse range of species, including fruit flies and humans. Although Scribble commonly helps to ensure that the components of a cell are in their correct locations, its exact roles vary between species. To perform its role well, Scribble itself must localize to the cell cortex—the inside surface of the cell membrane—at the regions where cells connect to one another. How this localization occurs is not fully understood; and defects in the human form of Scribble have been linked to diseases including spina bifida and cancer.</p><p>Much of the Scribble protein is very similar across different species, but the fruit fly and human version of the protein have large differences in their ‘C-terminal region’ that makes up one end of each protein. Boëda and Etienne-Manneville now show that in humans and other animals with backbones—but not in fruit flies—the C-terminal region of Scribble contains three repeats of a sequence called the SADH motif. These motifs can bind to proteins called beta spectrins, which connect the cell's outer membrane to the scaffolding-like structure inside the cell that provides support.</p><p>Mutations that alter the SADH motif interfere with Scribble's ability to bind to the scaffolding, and alters Scribble localization at cell–cell contacts or the cell cortex. Boëda and Etienne-Manneville also found that some mutations linked to spina bifida and cancer affect the SADH motif, suggesting that this motif has a wider role in disease.</p><p>While the abnormal localization of Scribble inside cells is frequently observed in particularly difficult to survive cancers, the molecular mechanism that causes Scribble to fail to localize to the cell periphery is still poorly understood. Boëda and Etienne-Manneville's work establishes the beta spectrin family of proteins as regulators that stabilize Scribble at the cell cortex and suggests that Scribble-associated diseases might depend on the integrity of the spectrin network.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04726.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04726.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>polarity</kwd><kwd>cortical cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>protein–protein interaction</kwd><kwd>spina bifida</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Etienne-Manneville</surname><given-names>Sandrine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institut National du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Etienne-Manneville</surname><given-names>Sandrine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Etienne-Manneville</surname><given-names>Sandrine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new protein–protein interaction motif identified in the polarity protein and tumor suppressor Scribble, and other cortical proteins, controls their interaction with spectrins and is crucial for the localization and function of Scribble.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The protein SCRIB has been implicated in a staggering array of cellular processes including polarity, migration, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, stemcell maintenance, and vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Humbert et al., 2008</xref>).

In contrast to the short GFP-C2 fragment (C2 − exon36) domain, the long GFP-C2 isoform (C2 + exon36) strongly interacted with spectrin Flag-CH1 (27–167aa), suggesting that the exon 36 encodes a putative β-spectrin binding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Sequence analysis of the C1 fragment revealed the presence of two 25aa sequences displaying strong similarity with exon 36 sequence. Single deletion of each repeated motif impaired GST-C1 binding to the GFP-tagged CH1 domain of spectrin. The deletion of both repeats totally abolished spectrin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). GST fusion protein including the 25aa peptide corresponding to the exon 36 as well as the two other similar repeat motifs identified in SCRIB C1, but not GST alone, interacted robustly with GFP tagged CH1 spectrin domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>We then performed co-localization experiments. In bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE) SCRIB and both β-spectrins colocalized to adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

In these cells, exogenously expressed RFP-CH1 domain of β2 spectrin localises into filamentous structures and induces the relocalisation of GFP-SCRIB to these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In these conditions the GFP-SCRIB lacking putative spectrin binding domains remained cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

We found that the DMTN and the ABLIMs motifs retained GFP tagged spectrin CH1 domain from cell extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly DMTN is a constituent of the spectrin-actin junctional complex and was known to bind directly to spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koshino et al., 2012</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses of the three ABLIMs showed that the spectrin CH1 binding motif was conserved in all vertebrate ABLIMs but could not be detected in invertebrate ABLIMs proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also observed that the noncanonical motifs identified in MyoX, MPP and Afadin did not bind to spectrin CH1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Altogether those results indicate that the consensus sequence Y-[KR]-X-[FL]-A-A-[ILV]-P is a spectrin binding motif specific of the vertebrate sub-phylum and present in at least five different genes in the human genome. We named this sequence the SADH motif (<underline>S</underline>CRIB <underline>A</underline>BLIMs <underline>D</underline>MTN <underline>H</underline>omology). No homology between the SADH motif sequences and the previously characterized 10 kDa spectrin-actin-binding domain of the band 4.1 family of proteins could be detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gimm et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SADH motifs are necessary for SCRIB membrane stability</title><p>We then investigated the effect of SADH motif mutations (P &gt; A mutant described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) on SCRIB cortical localization. We determined the Cortical Localisation Index (CLI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), defined as the ratio between the mean GFP fluorescence intensity in the cortical region and the mean fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm of the cell. A CLI superior to one indicates that GFP is enriched at the cell cortex while a CLI equal to one shows that the GFP is equally distributed between the cytoplasm and the cortex. GFP alone had a CLI around 1 (0.9) whereas a control GFP-CAAX construct which essentially localized at the cell membrane had a CLI of 1.75. Short and long WT SCRIB (−/+ exon36) constructs showed a strong cortical accumulation (CLI = 1.8 and 2 respectively). In contrast the P305L SCRIB mutant that carries a mutation in the N-terminal LRR region which impedes SCRIB plasma membrane localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Legouis et al., 2003</xref>) was mainly cytosolic (CLI = 1). SCRIB SADH1+2 mutant showed a statistically weaker cortical recruitment (CLI = 1.4) than the WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) suggesting that SADH mutations may influence SCRIB recruitment and/or stabilization at the membrane. We assessed SCRIB WT and SADH mutant protein dynamics at the membrane by monitoring FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) at cell–cell contact in confluent transiently transfected 16HBE cells. A membrane associated GFP-CAAX showed a fast recovery rate (<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>1/2</italic></sub> = 10 s) and the vast majority of the protein was available for exchange (mobile fraction of 97%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C,D</xref>).

This effect, likely underestimated because of the incomplete knock down or the compensatory role of other spectrins, indicates a role of spectrin in the control of centrosome positioning. Moreover, spectrin β2 depletion impaired SCRIB Cter ability to disrupt centrosome reorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

This tight junction phenotype could be partially rescued by the expression of a siRNA resistant WT SCRIB but not by SCRIB SADH12 mutant, suggesting that SCRIB interaction with spectrin plays a role in tight junction assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Altogether these results strongly suggest that SCRIB SADH motifs control SCRIB dynamics at the cell cortex and are important for polarity and tight junction assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SADH motif mutation in human pathology</title><p>61 missense mutations in the <italic>SCRIB</italic> gene coding sequence have been identified so far (COSMIC, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Forbes et al., 2015</xref>]). Almost 10% of these mutations (6/61) fall within the <italic>SCRIB</italic> SADH motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which account for less than 5% of <italic>SCRIB</italic> sequence (75/1657aa). One of the mutations (R1322W) identified in a lung cancer patient directly impacts the core SADH2 consensus motif. In contrast to GST-SADH2 WT sequence, GST-SADH2 R1322W mutant did not bind to the spectrin GFP-CH1 domain pointing to the R1322W mutation as a spectrin binding loss of function mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). <italic>SCRIB</italic> mutations have also been described in congenital diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lei et al., 2013</xref>). In particular, six SCRIB mutations have been recently described in <italic>spina bifida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lei et al., 2013</xref>) and two of those six fall within the SADH2 motif sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The A1315T mutation did not affect the ability of a GST-SADH2 to bind to GFP spectrin. In contrast the P1332L mutation noticeably increased GST-SADH2 affinity for GFP spectrin in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D,E</xref>). These mutations did not impact significantly SCRIB overall recruitment to the cellular cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, FRAP experiments showed that GFP R1322W and GFP P1332L SCRIB mutants exchanged more rapidly than the GFP WT SCRIB at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Surprisingly, P1332L mutation also increased SCRIB exchange at the plasma membrane, suggesting that, in the context of the SCRIB full length molecule, the P1332L mutation prevents rather than increases spectrin binding. We cannot however exclude the possibility that this mutation also affects other yet-unidentified function of the SADH domain. Altogether these observations indicate that mutations of the SADH motifs may participate in human pathology by impacting the stability of SCRIB at the cell cortex.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04726.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>SADH motifs mutations in human pathology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Table of identified somatic SCRIB SADH motifs mutations in human cancers.

After background subtraction the recovery of the GFP signal was measured using ImageJ and fitted using the Prism software and the equation Y<sub>(t)</sub> = (Y<sub>max</sub> − Y<sub>min</sub>) (1 − e<sup>2kt</sup>) − Y<sub>min</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weisswange et al., 2009</xref>), where Y(t) is the intensity of fluorescence at time t, Y<sub>max</sub> and Y<sub>min</sub> are respectively the maximum and minimum intensities of fluorescence post-bleaching and k is the rate constant of recovery. Mobile fraction was determined as Mf = (Y<sub>max</sub> − Y<sub>0</sub>)/(1 − Y<sub>0</sub>). All data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. One-way ANOVA analysis of the variance was followed by the Tukey's multiple comparison post-hoc test. A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to JP Borg, Norbert Frey and A El Amraoui for plasmids and thank Jean-Yves Tinevez from the Plate-Forme d'Imagerie Dynamique/Imagopole of Institut Pasteur for technical support.

A significant portion of mutations in Scribble associated human pathology are within the SADH motifs. So this manuscript is addressing an important issue-the function of previously-uncharacterized C-terminus of Scribble. The authors showed that SADH domain directly interacted with Spectrins and that SADH motifs are necessary for membrane stability and polarity function of Scribble. These are very novel and significant findings.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The data supporting the functional study of SADH motifs in cell polarity is somewhat confusing. Either overexpression or depletion of Scribble resulted in defects in centrosome orientation in the wound-healing assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Osmani et al., 2006</xref>). “Expression of GFP-SCRIB C-terminal and C1 constructs perturbed centrosome reorientation”. Was the purpose of this experiment to compare with the effect of wild-type Scribble overexpression? This result can be interpreted as: 1) they are sufficient to trigger centrosome reorientation as the WT full-length Scribble; or 2) they function as dominant-negative constructs, because PDZ domains of Scribble is known to be important for its polarity function. The results should be explained in a clearer way and information on the control such as overexpression of WT full-length Scribble should be cited. Besides, the phenotype caused by expression of C-terminus of Scrib in the same assay had already been previously described by the same group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Osmani et al., 2006</xref>). This data was not cited in the manuscript.</p><p>It's unclear how SADH motifs mediate cell polarity. In the wound-healing assay, Scribble is required for Cdc42 activity and localization for centrosome reorientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Osmani et al., 2006</xref>). Are SADH motifs required for CDC42 localization in this assay? If not, what is the new mechanism?</p><p>2) Are Spectrins important for centrosome reorientation in the wound-healing assay? Are Spectrins important for cell polarity function medicated by SADH motifs? Do spectrins have any effect caused by expression of Scrib C-terminus or the mutations in this region? The manuscript shows a novel interaction between spectrins and SADH motifs, but lacks functional studies of Spectrins with SADH.</p><p>3) The data that both R1322W and P1332L exchanges more rapidly at the plasma membrane in the FRAP experiments argues against the relevance of the SADH-Spectrins binding with Scrib stability, because P1332L binds to Spectrin with a higher affinity and should be more stabilized on the plasma membrane. Could the binding of SADH motifs with Spectrins contribute to a cellular function of Scrib other than cell polarity? <italic>Spina bifida</italic> does not seem to be caused by cell polarity defects/tissue overgrowth, but rather by defects in neural tube development.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript describes a new binding partner for vertebrate Scribble proteins, the cytoskeletal protein Spectrin, and identifies a new Spectrin-binding motif in Scribble and four other proteins. The authors also demonstrate a role for this motif stabilizing Scribble in the cortex of cultured cells, and investigate a few human binding motif mutants in similar assays.</p><p>One weakness is that the authors do not investigate the Scribble binding domain of Spectrin, beyond showing that it is present in Spectrin's actin-binding CH1 domain, or show whether this binding affects Spectrin function.</p><p>A second weakness is that the assays do not address the role of this binding in what is Scribble's main known function, the formation of cell junctions. This is largely a biochemical analysis with only a few in vitro assays added.</p><p>Nonetheless, while it would be nice to have a bit more on biological relevance, and on the binding motifs in Spectrin, the data presented looks solid, and the authors for the most part draw logical conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04726.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>As reviewer #1 suggested, we investigated Cdc42 recruitment in migrating astrocytes and showed that SCRIB C-terminal WT domain but not the SADH mutant affects Cdc42 leading edge localization. Moreover, we show that β2 spectrin depletion moderately but significantly perturbed scratch-induced centrosome reorientation. Interestingly, spectrin β2 depletion impaired SCRIB Cter ability to disrupt centrosome reorientation. Together, these new results suggest that SCRIB interaction with spectrin contributes to SCRIB function in cell polarization.</p><p>As reviewer #2 suggested, we now provide substantial new results concerning SCRIB binding domain in spectrins. These results are now presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We now show that SCRIB binds to the CH1 of the close homologues spectrin β, β2 and β3 and has a preferential affinity with actin-associated CH1 domain. Moreover, the SADH motifs bind specifically to the actin associated CH1 domain subfamily but not to the closely related non actin binding CH2 and CH3 domains.</p><p>We have also investigated the role of SCRIB-spectrin binding in the formation of epithelial junctions. Using the “calcium switch” model, we show that the wild type GFP SCRIB, but not the GFP SCRIB SADH mutant can partially rescue the delay of tight junction 2 formation observed in SCRIB-depleted caco-2 cells.

The purpose of the present study was thus to determine what is the exact implication of this region.

Most of these proteins have proven to be resistant to siRNA-induced depletion. Nevertheless, we obtained an almost complete knock down of SPTBN1, which is the spectrin displaying the more affinity with SCRIB in the two hybrid assay and found that SPTBN1 depletion significantly perturbs centrosome reorientation in migrating astrocytes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 G and H</xref>). Moreover, it is interesting to note that mouse knockout models of ubiquitously expressed Spectrin αII and βII die in utero due to incomplete neural tube closure and cardiac anomalies, a pleiotropic association of phenotypes reminiscent of the ones observed in <italic>Scrib</italic> mice mutants (Tang, Katuri et al., 2002; Stankewich, Cianci et al., 2011).</p><p><italic>Are Spectrins important for cell polarity function medicated by SADH motifs?

The manuscript shows a novel interaction between spectrins and SADH motifs, but lacks functional studies of Spectrins with SADH</italic>.</p><p>We now show that in SPTBN1-depleted cells the microinjection of SCRIB C- terminal does not induce a strong depolarization defect, suggesting that SCRIB C- terminal domain effect on polarity requires SPTBN1 integrity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 G and H</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The data that both R1322W and P1332L exchanges more rapidly at the plasma membrane in the FRAP experiments argues against the relevance of the SADH-Spectrins binding with Scrib stability, because P1332L binds to Spectrin with a higher affinity and should be more stabilized on the plasma membrane. Could the binding of SADH motifs with Spectrins contribute to a cellular function of Scrib other than cell polarity?</italic> Spina bifida <italic>does not seem to be caused by cell polarity defects/tissue overgrowth, but rather by defects in neural tube development</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the biochemical effect of the mutations and the FRAP experiment data obtained with the SCRIB mutant P1332L are somehow contradictory. We can only speculate that the P1332L mutation increases spectrin binding ability at the SADH2 25aa peptide level, as observed in our binding assay but has the opposite effect in the context of the full length SCRIB molecule. This hypothesis is difficult to test as we cannot produce full length SCRIB protein in vitro (180 kDa) to perform discriminating binding affinity measurement between WT and mutant SCRIB sequences. As the reviewer suggests, the SADH motifs may also contribute to a SCRIB function different than cell polarity, more connected to neural tube development. However SCRIB is not the only polarity gene found mutated in <italic>spina bifida</italic> (CELSR1, FZD6 and PRICKLE1 and 2; Juriloff and Harris, 2012), suggesting that this pathology is connected to polarity defect. The effects of the P1332L mutation are now further discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The manuscript describes a new binding partner for vertebrate Scribble proteins, the cytoskeletal protein Spectrin, and identifies a new Spectrin-binding motif in Scribble and four other proteins. The authors also demonstrate a role for this motif stabilizing Scribble in the cortex of cultured cells, and investigate a few human binding motif mutants in similar assays</italic>.</p><p><italic>One weakness is that the authors do not investigate the Scribble binding domain of Spectrin, beyond showing that it is present in Spectrin's actin-binding CH1 domain, or show whether this binding affects Spectrin function</italic>.</p><p>To address this important issue, we first show that SCRIB C1 fragment pulls down the β2 spectrin CH1 domain but not the CH2 or the CH1-CH2 tandem domain (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Structural studies have shown that the CH1-CH2 tandem domains can switch between an open conformation where the CH1 domain binds to F-actinrobustly and a close conformation in which the CH1 and CH2 domains are closely apposed and display a weak F-actin affinity (Sjoblom, Ylanne et al., 2008; Galkin, Orlova et al., 2010). The GFP tagged β2 spectrin CH1-CH2 domain in HeLa cells display poor F-actin colocalization compared to GFP CH1 domain alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), in agreement with the idea that the β2 spectrin CH1-CH2 tandem domain adopt a close conformation when expressed in cells. Furthermore we show that SCRIB C1 region pulls down the β2 spectrin CH1 domain together with actin, suggesting that SCRIB binds to the CH1 domain in an open conformation and does not compete with actin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we found that SADH3 motif does not bind to CH2 domain from β2- spectrin or CH3 domains from Vav3 or IQGAP proteins but that at physiological salt stringency it interacts with the CH1 domain of spectrins β, β2, β3, β5 and α-actinin 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). At high salt stringency (500 mM NaCl), only the spectrin β, β2 and β3 displayed binding with the GST-SADH3 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating that SADH domains have a preferential affinity with the CH1 domain from the close homologues spectrin β, β2 and β3.</p><p>In conclusion, this new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the SADH motifs bind specifically to the actin binding CH1 domain subfamily but not to the closely related CH2 and CH3 domains.</p><p><italic>A second weakness is that the assays do not address the role of this binding in what is Scribble's main known function, the formation of cell junctions. This is largely a biochemical analysis with only a few in vitro assays added</italic>.</p><p>In order to address the potential role of SCRIB-Spectrin function in cell junction formation we used a well-established “calcium switch” model that involves reversible disruption of epithelial junctions by extracellular calcium depletion followed by a rapid junctional reassembly triggered by calcium repletion (Gonzalez-Mariscal, Contreras, 1990). As previously described (Ivanov, Young, 2010) SCRIB-depleted cells show a significant delay in tight junction reassembly inCaco-2 cells. In these conditions, WT SCRIB partially rescues the phenotype while the SADH mutant does not (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>). This observation suggests that SADH domains are involved in cell junction formation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
