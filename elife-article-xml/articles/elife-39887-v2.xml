We identified a parasite dense granule protein as GRA18 that once released in the host cell cytoplasm forms versatile complexes with regulatory elements of the β-catenin destruction complex. By interacting with GSK3/PP2A-B56, GRA18 drives β-catenin up-regulation and the downstream effects on host cell gene expression. In the context of macrophages infection, GRA18 induces the expression of a specific set of genes commonly associated with an anti-inflammatory response that includes those encoding chemokines CCL17 and CCL22.

Severe to life-threatening Toxoplasmosis mainly occur in immunocompromised people, with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or under chemo- and graft rejection therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Montoya and Liesenfeld, 2004</xref>). In addition, outcomes of congenital toxoplasmosis significantly vary with the timing of infection from recurrent eye diseases to adverse motor or neurologic impairments that can cause stillbirth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halonen and Weiss, 2013</xref>). <italic>T. gondii</italic> belongs to the protozoan phylum Apicomplexa and as most Apicomplexa species, develops and proliferates inside a surrogate host cell. Remarkably, <italic>T. gondii’s</italic> host range is exceptionally broad since it can infect virtually all nucleated cells of mammals, marsupials and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubey, 2009</xref>).</p><p>To achieve intracellular lifestyle, the invasive tachyzoite stage of <italic>T. gondii</italic> triggers the formation of a unique membrane-bound compartment called the Parasitophorous Vacuole (PV). The PV is shaped as a niche kept hidden from harmful endocytic processing thereby enabling tachyzoite growth and multiplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mordue et al., 1999</xref>). In the last decade, several studies have highlighted the contribution of parasite effectors delivered in the host cell at the very onset of-or post-invasion to promote folding and maturation of a functional PV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delorme-Walker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hakimi et al., 2017</xref>). Effectors are released from two specialized sets of secretory organelles including the pear-shaped rhoptries that contain the ROP16 and ROP38 effectors and the spherical Dense Granules (DG) in which GRA15, GRA16, GRA24, TgIST, GRA6, and GRA25 proteins are stored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hakimi et al., 2017</xref>). Once delivered in the host cell, these effectors either remain exposed at the cytoplasmic side of the PV Membrane (PVM) or cross the PVM and travel in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, members of the second class (i.e. GRA16, GRA24, and TgIST) have all been assigned the host nucleus as final destination where they target distinct host regulators to modulate the expression of specific sets of genes.</p><p>The comprehensive analysis of how the cohort of effectors interplay during infection at cellular and host levels remains a major challenge which implies identifying and functionally characterizing the <italic>T. gondii</italic> effector repertoire in given cellular and host contexts. With this concern, we searched for new effectors and characterized GRA18 as the first DG protein that strictly remains in the host cell cytoplasm once delivered from the PV-enclosed tachyzoite. We provide evidence that the exported GRA18 is part of multi-partner - that is, versatile - complexes, specifically formed with components of the β-catenin destruction complex, which includes β-catenin, GSK3α/β, and the PR56/B’-containing PP2A holoenzyme and as such prevents the continual elimination of β-catenin. Accordingly, in presence of GRA18, cytoplasmic β-catenin travels to and accumulates in the host cell nucleus where it activates otherwise repressed target genes. Nuclear β-catenin is known as the main effector of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, acting as a coactivator of the Lymphoid Enhancer-binding Factor (LEF) or T Cell Factor (TCF) proteins to drive Wnt-specific transcriptional programs depending on cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cadigan and Waterman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schuijers et al., 2014</xref>). In murine macrophages, we showed that GRA18 induces in a β-catenin-dependent fashion the expression of a particular set of chemokines, that is, <italic>Ccl17</italic>, <italic>Ccl22</italic>, and <italic>Ccl24</italic>, notoriously known associated with anti-inflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas and Mantovani, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mantovani et al., 2004</xref>), but which have yet not been identified as β-catenin targets. In addition to discovering <italic>T. gondii</italic> GRA18, its partners and the down signaling pathway in the course of infection, this work also uncovers an unexpected involvement of β-catenin during the resolution of inflammatory processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GRA18 is secreted and exported to the cytoplasm of infected host cells</title><p>The gene <italic>TGGT1_288840,</italic> hereafter referred as <italic>GRA18,</italic> was originally found along with the previously characterized genes <italic>GRA16, GRA24, and TgIST</italic> in an in silico search for candidate genes encoding proteins delivered by tachyzoites into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bougdour et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gay et al., 2016</xref>). GRA18 protein accommodates both a signal peptide for targeting to the secretory pathway and a canonical TEXEL motif found on PV residing proteins (i.e. GRAs proteins), some of which traffic across the PVM to reach the host cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coffey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hakimi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hammoudi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsiao et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine the localization of GRA18, a three hemagglutinin (HA<sup>3</sup>) epitope tag or HAFlag (HF)-epitope tags were inserted either at the carboxyl-terminus of the endogenous <italic>GRA18</italic> locus in the type I strain (RH <italic>ku80</italic>) or as an extra copy in type II strain (Pru <italic>ku80</italic>), respectively. In extracellular tachyzoites, GRA18-HF partially co-localized with the DG resident protein GRA1 but not with the micronemal protein MIC2 or the toxofilin rhoptry protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When expressed in intracellular replicating tachyzoites, the GRA18-HA<sup>3</sup> protein accumulated in the cytoplasm of infected cells over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel), but was not detected in host cell nucleus in contrast to the yet identified effectors (i.e. PP2C-hn, ROP16, ROP47, GRA16, GRA24, GRA28, and TgIST; for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hakimi et al., 2017</xref>). In cells infected by type II tachyzoites (Pru <italic>ku80</italic>) expressing the chimeric GRA18-HF under the control of the promoter of <italic>GRA1,</italic> a similar GRA18-HF cytoplasmic distribution was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lower panel) however the chimeric construct significantly accumulated in the parasite cytoplasm and the PV space, suggesting that secretion and export are limiting steps for GRA18 trafficking. Moreover, in the absence of the parasite MYR1 protein, the export of GRA18 through the PVM no longer occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that GRA18 uses an export pathway shared with the other GRA effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franco et al., 2016</xref>). GRA18 is a 70 kDa protein predicted to be partially disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) with no apparent homolog counterpart outside of the Coccidia. While GRA18 shows little polymorphism among the three major strain types of <italic>T. gondii</italic> (99% identity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the protein is highly divergent in <italic>Neospora caninum</italic> (39% identity). Collectively, these data indicate that GRA18 is an additional member of the class of <italic>T. gondii</italic> DG proteins that are exported in the host cell during tachyzoite life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hakimi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nadipuram et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39887.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GRA18 is secreted and exported to the host cell cytoplasm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alignment of GRA18 alleles from <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains of types I (<italic>TGGT1_288840</italic>), II (<italic>TGME49_288840</italic>), and III (<italic>TGVEG_288840</italic>).

Initially, we used a genome-wide yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) screen and screened a human placenta complementary DNA (cDNA) library (referred as prey) using N-terminally fused GRA18 (aa 27 to 648) from type II strain as a bait (LexA-GRA18<sup>II</sup>). Of a total of 65.8 million cDNA fragments screened, 65 positive hits covering 11 different proteins were found. The binding proteins were given Global Predicted Biological Score (Global PBS) ranging from A to D (‘A' having the highest confidence of binding) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), if their coding sequences are in-frame and have no in-frame stop codons. Interestingly, multiple components of the β-catenin destruction complex were found among the interactants: β-catenin itself, the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3α/β), and the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulatory subunit B56α/β/γ/δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These interactions were subsequently validated by chromatography and mass spectrometry–based proteomics analysis on proteins extracted from human cells infected by the Pru P<sub>GRA1</sub>-GRA18<sup>II</sup>-HF <italic>T. gondii</italic> strain. Following Flag affinity chromatography, GRA18 co-eluted with β-catenin, GSK3α/β, and the PP2A-B56δ/ε within a quite stable complex that resisted to stringent salt and detergent conditions (0.5 M KCl and 0.1% NP-40) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the identification of the scaffolding subunit PP2A65 RA and the catalytic subunit PP2Ac along with the PP2A-B56, argues for a functional PP2A holoenzyme as part of the complex. The B56 regulatory subunit presumably mediates the recruitment of the PP2A holoenzyme as it was the only PP2A subunit found by Y2H to interact directly with GRA18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Conversely, GRA18<sup>Nt</sup> induced in T-Rex cells did not interact with PP2A-B56 and its binding property to GSK3β was significantly impaired when compared to the full-length or the C-terminal region of GRA18. Collectively, these results suggest that the GRA18 C-terminal region mediates the interaction with both the phosphatase and the kinase. It is noteworthy that both the N- and C-ter truncated fragments were unable to pull down β-catenin, which was unexpected based on the Y2H results. We cannot exclude however the possibility that the harsh washing conditions (0.5 M KCl and 0.1% NP-40) shattered the weak interactions between β-catenin and the GRA18 N-terminal fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the N-terminal region of GRA18 mediates labile interaction with β-catenin that can be captured by Y2H, whereas the C-terminal region contributes to a rather strong binding to GSK3β and the PP2A-B56 holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>GRA18 functions as a positive regulator of β-catenin</title><p>As demonstrated above, GRA18 interacts with well-known components of the β-catenin destruction complex, a multiprotein complex with a pivotal role in the Wnt signaling. Indeed, β-catenin regulates the transcription of the Wnt target genes. Central to the Wnt pathway is the regulation of β-catenin levels by a cytoplasmic destruction complex in which β-catenin is embedded. This complex is composed of a core scaffold protein, named the axis inhibition protein (Axin) that interacts with factors such as the adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC), the Ser/Thr kinases GSK3, the casein kinase 1 (CK1), and the PP2A-B56 phosphatase (Reviewed by Stamos and Weis, 2013). In the absence of Wnt signaling, the destruction complex efficiently captures cytoplasmic β-catenin, leading to its phosphorylation by GSK3 and recognition by the β-TrCP ubiquitin ligase for degradation by the 26S proteasome. Wnt ligands trigger functional inactivation of the destruction complex, with ensuing escape of β-catenin from degradation, resulting in β-catenin accumulation and nuclear internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clevers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taelman et al., 2010</xref>). Given the interactions between GRA18 and β-catenin, GSK3β, and PP2A-B56, we hypothesized that GRA18 could interfere with β-catenin regulation in the course of infection. To test this hypothesis, we generated parasites knockout for <italic>GRA18</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) in different strain types (Pru <italic>ku80</italic> Δ<italic>gra18</italic> and 76K Δ<italic>gra18</italic>) which did not show any obvious growth phenotype in cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and data not shown), and a somewhat reduced virulence phenotype in mice when challenged by intraperitoneal injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). While assessing β-catenin amounts and subcellular localization we showed that β-catenin signals remained unaffected upon <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection of both human (HFF) and murine (L929) cells regardless of the <italic>GRA18</italic> status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>, compare Pru <italic>ku80</italic> with Δ<italic>gra18</italic>). Intriguingly, when parasites expressed high levels of GRA18, referred to as GRA18<sup>+++</sup>, β-catenin signals drastically increased in cells infected by the GRA18<sup>+++</sup> strain compared to uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). β-Catenin upregulation is associated with a strong accumulation of β-catenin in the host nuclei suggesting that a transcriptionally active bulk of β-catenin was produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To determine whether additional parasite factors may contribute to the GRA18-mediated β-catenin induction, we used ectopic expression of GRA18 in HEK293 human cell line. As a positive control, cells were treated with exogenous Wnt3A ligand, a natural inducer of β-catenin, thus confirming that the T-Rex cells carry a functional and regulatable β-catenin-destruction complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzolin et al., 2014</xref>).

Consistent with β-catenin upregulation, similar data were obtained with <italic>Ifnb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), a known β-catenin target gene in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rathinam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2010</xref>).

Importantly, the moderate role played by GRA18 in the regulation of <italic>Ccl22</italic> in RAW264.7 cells when compared to BMDMs, suggests that a GRA18-independent pathway controls <italic>Ccl22</italic> expression, which is reminiscent of the aforementioned β-catenin independent mechanism (see discussion). Indeed, <italic>Ccl22</italic> was much less induced in RAW264.7 than in BMDM cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>), indicating differences in responsiveness to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. In addition, these data also argue that using the transformed RAW264.7 cell line to monitor GRA18 activity on <italic>Ccl22</italic> induction may be less relevant than relying on the primary BMDM cells. Altogether, these results indicate that basal levels of β-catenin are required for full activity of GRA18 towards <italic>Ccl17</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>GRA18 acts as an inhibitor of GSK3 to trigger β-catenin transcriptional activity</title><p>In order to better map the GRA18 active domains we assayed the different sub-domains of GRA18 (GRA18<sup>Nt</sup> and GRA18<sup>Ct</sup>) described above for their ability to upregulate β-catenin and to induce expression of the downstream target genes in macrophages. While expression of GRA18<sup>FL</sup> in RAW264.7 macrophages caused a significant increase in endogenous β-catenin protein levels, leading to the expression of the downstream chemokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>), expression of GRA18<sup>Nt</sup>, which no longer interacts with GSK3 and PP2A-B56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), failed to induce β-catenin and accordingly chemokine transcripts. Given that the N-terminal region of GRA18 has retained the ability to interact with β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), these data suggest that the interactions with β-catenin alone are not sufficient to promote its accumulation and transcriptional activity. In contrast, GRA18<sup>Ct</sup>, shown previously to interact with GSK3 and PP2A-B56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) has retained full activity on β-catenin and downstream transcriptional consequences, further confirming the pivotal role of β-catenin in driving the expression of the aforementioned chemokines. While the effect of GRA18 on β-catenin protein levels required interactions with GSK3 and/or PP2A-B56, direct interaction between GRA18 and β-catenin seems to be dispensable. Altogether these results support a scenario in which GRA18, through its interactions with GSK3 and PP2A-B56 inhibits the β-catenin-destruction complex, hence stabilizing β-catenin thereby acting as a positive regulator of β-catenin level to promote gene expression. Additional evidence for this model is the expression of <italic>Ccl22</italic> and <italic>Ccl24</italic> induced by GSK3 inhibitors in a manner that resembles the effect of GRA18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39887.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>GRA18 activity is dependent on its interactions with GSK3 and PP2A-B56.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with mCherry vector control or the FH-GRA18 expression vectors pcDNA-FH-GRA18<sup>FL</sup> (GRA18<sup>FL</sup>), pcDNA-FH-GRA18<sup>Nt</sup> (GRA18<sup>Nt</sup>), and pcDNA-FH-GRA18<sup>Ct</sup> (GRA18<sup>Ct</sup>).

The detection of GRA18 in the host cell cytoplasm together with GRA18 sequence features prompted us to search for host cell cytoplasmic partners.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>GRA18, a potential inhibitor of the β-catenin destruction complex</title><p>Using a genetic screen combined with affinity- and size-exclusion chromatography under stringent conditions, and mass spectrometry, we have characterized GRA18 as a strong interactor of host GSK3 and the PP2A-B56 holoenzyme, and to a lesser extent with β-catenin. The complex(es) promote β-catenin nuclear accumulation, raising the possibility that GRA18 could modulate β-catenin stability (see proposed model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, while GRA18 clearly regulated host cell gene expression, we did not detect significant changes in β-catenin levels upon infection with wild-type parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and D</xref>). As only a small fraction of the total β-catenin pool is destined to transcriptional regulation, possibly GRA18 induces subtle effects on the β-catenin levels that cannot be captured by IFA or immunoblot. Next, to figure out how GRA18 could interplay with β-catenin in cells, we engineered β-catenin mutant in RAW264.7 macrophages and provided definitive evidence for β-catenin acting epistatically to GRA18’s activity on host cell transcription for a restricted set of target genes (i.e. <italic>Ccl17, Ccl24,</italic> and <italic>Ifnb1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39887.012</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for GRA18 mechanism of action.</title><p>A model depicting how GRA18 interacts and interferes with the β-catenin destruction complex leading to host cell gene regulation.

See also discussion.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-39887-fig8-v2"/></fig><p>β-Catenin is a dual function co-activator protein with distinct pools serving cell-cell adhesion and gene transcription functions, respectively. β-Catenin was originally identified as an element of the adherent junction complex together with cadherin and α-catenin, the latter binding to actin filaments in a process that promotes cell–cell contacts. Further, a nonjunctional pool of cytoplasmic β-catenin was recognized as a transcriptional coactivator of Wnt canonical signaling pathway. The Wnt signaling represents a complex and essential pathway starting with a repertoire of Wnt ligands and acting at the heart of embryogenesis, but also throughout life by directing stem cell renewal and senescence. Centerpiece of Wnt signaling is the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway genetically dissected in both human and <italic>Drosophila.</italic> Briefly, in the absence of Wnt ligands, cytosolic β-catenin is maintained at low levels by the multiprotein complex composed of APC, Axin, GSK3 and PP2A-B56. Within this complex, also referred to as the β-catenin destruction complex, β-catenin is constantly phosphorylated for ubiquitylation that directs its degradation by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). Mutation in any of these components (APC, Axin, or β-catenin) leads to inappropriate stabilization of β-catenin, which results in cancer, most notably of the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stamos and Weis, 2013</xref>). Axin, a central scaffold protein of the complex, is typified by intrinsically disordered and flexible regions that mediate direct interactions with all other core components of the destruction complex (β-catenin, APC, and GSK3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stamos and Weis, 2013</xref>). Remarkably, the <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoite GRA18 also carries significant disordered regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) which could confer the potential of competing with Axin/APC for binding to β-catenin, GSK3, and PP2A-B56. Accordingly, by disrupting the β-catenin destruction complex GRA18 would likely promote the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin and ultimately β-catenin-dependent gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). RNA-Seq performed on BMDMs indicated that β-catenin transcripts remained unaffected by GRA18 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), which is consistent with a post-transcriptional regulation of β-catenin. Collectively our data argue for GRA18 acting as a direct regulator of β-catenin and although the exact <italic>modus operandi</italic> of GRA18 awaits clarification, some scenarios can be proposed. Interestingly, the Y2H interaction assay allowed defining the region of β-catenin that promotes the interaction with GRA18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Indeed, the SID analysis for interaction between GRA18 and β-catenin is mediated by a region encompassing amino acids 42 – 297 of the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which harbors conserved serine and threonine residues initially phosphorylated by CK1 (Ser45), and subsequently by GSK3 (Thr41, Ser33 and Ser37). Once phosphorylated, Ser33 and Ser37 mediate the interaction with the β-TrCP adaptor protein for β-catenin degradation. Therefore, the GRA18 binding features to the N-terminal domain of β-catenin appear quite peculiar and differ from the binding sites for Axin and APC mapped at central ARM domain. As such, the binding interface of GRA18 to the β-catenin N-terminal region would confer to GRA18 a unique ability to interfere with both the phosphorylation cascade catalyzed by CK1 and GSK3, but also at a later step with the binding to β-TrCP. Interestingly, phosphorylation of GSK3β Ser9 or GSK3α Ser21 is reported to decrease GSK3α/β enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cross et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peyrollier et al., 2000</xref>). Because GRA18 did not alter the phospho-Ser21/Ser9 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>), we conclude that the parasite protein, which we found to bind GSK3 and inhibit its pro-degradative activity on cytoplasmic β-catenin, acts independently of the phosphorylation status of Ser21/Ser9.</p><p>In the context of the Wnt signaling, the function of the PP2A-B56 when associated with the β-catenin destruction complex remains uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seeling et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamamoto et al., 2001</xref>).

Interestingly, GRA18 carries two LxxIxE motifs within an intrinsically disordered region of the C-terminal domain, which is in agreement with the B56 binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>). As we previously showed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hakimi et al., 2017</xref>), SLiMs is a prominent characteristic of the GRA effector family of proteins, probably reflecting a favorable evolutionary strategy to expand and diversify the binding interfaces between host and parasite proteins.</p><p>Our data suggested a simultaneous binding of GRA18 to GSK-3 and PP2A-B56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), but whether the binding of PP2A-B56 is essential for GRA18 activity is yet to determine. GSK3 activity can be regulated by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues (Tyr279/Tyr216 in α/β isoforms, respectively) exposed in the activation loop, which enhances its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dajani et al., 2003</xref>). An attractive hypothesis is that PP2A-B56 is recruited to the GRA18 complex in order to dephosphorylate GSK3, hence contributing to the inhibitory activity towards the β-catenin destruction complex. Alternatively, PP2A-B56 could be recruited to GRA18-GSK3 complex to dephosphorylate β-catenin, leading to the inhibition of β-catenin degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Su et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The GRA18-GSK3-β-catenin axis induces the expression of anti-inflammatory chemokines</title><p>Our transcriptomic data have revealed the magnitude by which GRA18 alters the expression of genes of cells infected by <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites, particularly the chemokines <italic>Ccl17</italic>, <italic>Ccl22</italic>, and <italic>Ccl24</italic>.

Whether this GRA18 property is also expressed in other intermediate hosts or in different cell types is not known, but given the conservation of the Wnt signaling in vertebrates, GRA18 activity in other hosts can be assumed. Interestingly, the human placental cells, which have the unique ability to resist to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, were shown to specifically respond to the invader by producing the CCL22 chemokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ander et al., 2018</xref>), whereas other cell types such as human fibroblasts did not ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ander et al., 2018</xref>) and data not shown). Whether the mechanism underlying CCL22 induction in human placental cells is driven by GRA18 or differ from murine macrophages should be addressed in the future. It is noteworthy that a quite substantial residual activation of <italic>Ccl17</italic>, and <italic>Ccl22</italic> was observed in the absence of GRA18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5E–F and</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>), which suggests that an alternative mechanism of activation by the parasites exists.</p><p>We provide here genetic evidence for GRA18 acting in a β-catenin-dependent manner on chemokine expression in macrophages. Although Wnt β-catenin signaling has originally been studied in the context of thymocyte development and stem cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Staal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verbeek et al., 1995</xref>), there is increasing evidence for its contribution in the regulation of innate immunity. For instance, activation of β-catenin promotes differentiation and activation of dendritic cells to stimulate regulatory T cells (Tregs) and suppresses the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manicassamy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), while β-catenin accumulation triggered by GSK3 inhibitors enables Treg cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, CCL17, CCL22 and CCL24 are expressed by alternatively activated M2-polarized macrophages or tolerant macrophages and the release of these chemokines results in the recruitment of Treg cells and amplification of a Th2 response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas and Mantovani, 2010</xref>). Thereby, an attractive hypothesis could be that once released in the cell cytoplasm, GRA18 contributes to the characteristic M2 macrophage polarization associated with the <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasitic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jensen et al., 2011</xref>) through the GSK3-β-catenin axis. It is well acknowledged that cytokines and chemokines act as a frontline defense against <italic>T. gondii</italic> since they promote rapid Th1 cell–mediated pro-inflammatory response typified by the recruitment of immune killer cells at play to control the bulk tachyzoite population. However, counterbalancing the Th1-induced inflammatory effects, Th2 chemokines are efficient at dampening the inflammatory response and are therefore crucial to avoid immunopathology and preserve host and parasite survival. Accordingly these Th2 chemokines likely favour parasite dissemination and colonization of deep organs such as the brain allowing <italic>T. gondii</italic> bradyzoite to subsequently establish a persistent parasitism within intracellular cysts. Consequently, we propose the following hypothesis in which the infection using Δ<italic>gra18</italic> strains, which may provide a weaker Th2 chemokine profile (<italic>Ccl17</italic>, <italic>Ccl22</italic>, and <italic>Ccl24</italic>) led to early control and lower chance for long-term persistence in mice than <italic>GRA18</italic> wild type parasites.</p><p>In conclusion, the discovery and characterization of GRA18 extends our view of how <italic>T. gondii</italic> has evolved a variety of strategies to interfere with host cells by unveiling the hijacking of the evolutionarily conserved β-catenin destruction complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Parasite and cell culture</title><p><italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites were maintained by serial passage on human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) monolayers.

Your article has been reviewed by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor and three peer reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report here an extensive characterization of a new dense granule protein from <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, GRA18, that traffics to the host cell cytosol where, remarkably, it binds to several proteins in the β-catenin destruction complex, including β-catenin. GRA18 affects β-catenin signaling via increased β-catenin activity and expression of many host genes including specific chemokines. The results are impressive in their scope and the multiple ways in which most of the conclusions are supported by independent experiments. Overall the model is supported by the data presented and the paper is clearly and rigorously written, especially given the complexity of the story being presented. It ends with a mystery in terms of why the genes that are classically considered to be downstream of β-catenin are not activated by GRA18's action on β-catenin. The authors are forced to invoke another, as yet unidentified, parasite protein as playing a role that intersects with GRA18 in an infected cell. Although the exact mechanism of interaction is not yet understood, the data shown is solid and in general support the interpretation of GRA18 as the driving force of a non-canonical β-catenin-dependent signaling pathway conserved over multiple host species.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While a great deal of data is provided, some of the conclusions reached do not always appear to be strongly supported by the data.</p><p>1). GRA18 binding- The authors state that GRA18 directly binds β-catenin though I think the data they provide is certainly less robust than the data they have for GSK and PPP2R5A/B (e.g. the original Y2H found 3 clones showing β-catenin interactions with &quot;B&quot; ratings as opposed to GSK and PPP2R5A/B- which had over 10 clones with &quot;A&quot; ratings; the Y2H with bits of GRA18 shows a direct β-catenin interaction but the infected macrophage data and T-rex with overexpression do not). The authors need to either provide stronger explanations/data about the direct binding to β-catenin or soften their conclusion (and possibly to change the model- Figure 8).</p><p>2) Subsection “GRA18 functions as a positive regulator of β-catenin” – The virulence data shown is from one experiment and there is no mention in the legend or text if this was repeated. Given the variability that can be seen in animal experiments, at least one repeat is needed.</p><p>3) Chemokine data- Between Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7 there are inconsistencies. Figure 5E and F show that <italic>Ccl17</italic> and <italic>Ccl22</italic> have a GRA18-dependent increase in expression and protein levels but <italic>Ccl24</italic> only changes at the level of transcript. Instead of exclusively focusing on <italic>Ccl17</italic> and <italic>Ccl22</italic>, all 3 are noted in Figure 6 (using only expression data) with Figure 6F suggesting that <italic>Ccl22</italic> changes in GRA18-β-catenin-independent mechanism. This idea seems to be contradicted in Figure 7 where the authors use <italic>Ccl22</italic> as a readout for GRA18 inhibiting GSK3 which leads to increased β-catenin activity which then drives over-expression of <italic>Ccl22</italic>. These discrepancies need to be addressed including in the model.</p><p>4) Subsection “Quantitative real-time PCR”: Was the RNA quality/integrity controlled and <italic>Tbp</italic> as the only control gene tested for its expression stability? Not doing so could potentially undermine the robustness and reliability of the qPCR data. Why is only 1 biological replicate shown in the qPCR data and not a combination of 2 or more?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39887.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers.

To clarify this issue, first, GRA18 protein complex was conducted using endogenously tagged GRA18 instead of a GRA18 overexpressor strain to validate the interactions with the β-catenin destruction complex in a more natural context. Interaction with both GSK3 and PP2A-B56 were confirmed, but the β-catenin was not detected in the eluate, as expected, given the loosen interaction observed with this substrate by FPLC analysis. In a second step, chemokine expression was assayed in RAW cells mutated or not for <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> as suggested by the reviewers. The results are now included in Figure 6.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>qRT-PCR analysis of MAF-DKO macrophages (low passages) infected by the indicated strains of <italic>T. gondii</italic> at a MOI of 1:6.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39887-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>While the results obtained for <italic>Ccl17</italic> mirror those obtained by ectopic overexpression, differences were observed for <italic>Ccl22</italic>. In contrast to BMDM cells setting, the induction of <italic>Ccl22</italic> by <italic>T. gondii</italic> is only partially dependent on GRA18, and as expected poorly- if not at all- dependent on β-catenin. Given the discrepancy in the magnitude of the expression of the chemokine when comparing RAW with BMDM cells, we searched for another murine macrophage more closely related to the BMDMs. We obtained the MAF-DKO cells derived from BMDMs (Aziz et al., 2009) from Michael Sieweke’s lab, and checked that they responded quite well to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection with regard to chemokine induction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Therefore, we undertook the construction of a <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> mutant in these cells using lentiviral systems (First lentivirus for the CAS9 and a second for introducing the specific gRNA). After a selection process over two months of the different lentiviral constructions (CAS9-Blast. and gRNA-Puro.), we observed that the cells expressing the CAS9 only (MAK-DKO wt) expressed <italic>Ccl17</italic> and <italic>Ccl22</italic> only at low levels upon infection. Only <italic>Ccl24</italic> gave relevant results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Given the possibility that the cells have derived over passages, we decided not to include these results in the manuscript. We dampened our conclusion about the function played by β-catenin in the regulation of these chemokines and emphasized the role of the GRA18/β-catenin pathway in the regulation of <italic>Ccl17</italic> and the discrepancy with the regulation of <italic>Ccl22</italic>. We also clarified in the text the GRA18independent regulation of <italic>Ccl22</italic> subsection “GRA18 alters host gene expression in a β-catenin-dependent fashion” and subsection “The GRA18-GSK3-β-catenin axis induces the expression of anti-inflammatory chemokines” (see response to the reviewer #1).

In our data set, two conditions were experienced, with or without LPS stimulation. The impact of GRA18 on host cell gene expression does not interfere with the LPS response (Supplementary file 3) and therefore the expression level of the genes regulated by GRA18 remained similar when comparing unstimulated or LPS treated samples, which are both shown in the Figure 5A (compare unstimulated Pru <italic>ku80</italic> with LSP treated Pru <italic>ku80</italic>, etc.). As a result, the genes that were found differentially regulated when comparing WT and <italic>gra18</italic> mutant parasites in the absence of LPS, were also found differentially regulated in the presence of LPS. We certainly agree that the number of biological replicates is a limitation, but we have been careful to perform independent assays using RNA-Seq comparative approach and different conditions (i.e. with and without LPS). The data were systematically verified not only by RT-qPCR assays from different biological replicates shown in Figure 5E, but also by ELISA in Figure 5F.

To strengthen our data, several new sets of data have been added:</p><p>1) We present now evidence that GRA18 forms a complex with GSK3 and PP2A-B56 subunit upon infection with parasites expressing GRA18 fusion protein encoded from the endogenous locus (new panel in Figure 2).</p><p>2) We present evidence that even though β-catenin is not up-regulated upon infection by WT parasites, β-catenin basal levels are yet necessary for GRA18 functionality towards <italic>Ccl17</italic> when comparing macrophages infected by WT or gra18 mutant parasites.

To exacerbate the detection of GRA18 in the cytoplasm of the infected host cells, we chose to use the strong and widely used GRA1 promoter to drive GRA18 expression in the parasites, which clearly leads to GRA18 overexpression at both the transcriptional (Figure 5D) and at the protein levels (Figure 1C). A direct consequence is an accumulation of GRA18 in the parasite cytoplasm and the PV space presumably due to overloading the export process across the PVM. To accurately visualize the accumulation of GRA18 within the PV space, cells were permeabilized with ethanol instead of Triton X-100 (used for GRA18HA3, upper panel), which allowed better visualization of the PV space between the PVM and the PV enclosed zoites. Although there are some differences in the GRA18 staining pattern, the Figure 1C clearly shows the presence of GRA18 in the host cytoplasm, which was the primary aim of this assay. The text of the result section (subsection “GRA18 is secreted and exported to the cytoplasm of infected host cells”) and Figure legend were modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3.

While the 2YH assay can detect interactions between N-ter fragment of GRA18 with β-catenin, the coIP did not. The coIP pulled down GSK3 with the C-ter domain of GRA18 while the small fragments used in the Y2H did not. Although these results differ, they are not contradictory or mutually exclusive and should be analyzed together to extract as much information as possible. Given that both assays agree with the binding of the PP2A subunit to the C-ter domain of GRA18, these results indicate that B56 binds to the extreme C-ter part of GRA18 which is fully consistent with the presence of putative B56 binding sites in this region (LxxIxE motifs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is an interesting report that describes the effects of a secreted parasite protein on host cell signaling.

Again, this experiment only seems to have been performed with ectopic over-expression.</p><p>I feel that if the pathway describe here is robust the authors should be able to do many of these experiments with infection of WT and mutant strains and examine gene induction by qRT-PCR or cytokine levels by luminex of similar technology. Absent this, there is some chance that the apparent modulation of β-catenin is only due to over-expression and the true role of GRA18 is chemokine modulation through another pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>See responses above.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report here an extensive characterization of a new dense granule protein from Toxoplasma gondii, GRA18, that traffics to the host cell cytosol where, remarkably, it binds to several proteins in the β-catenin destruction complex, including β-catenin. GRA18 affects β-catenin signaling via increased β-catenin activity and expression of many host genes including specific chemokines. The results are impressive in their scope and the multiple ways in which most of the conclusions are supported by independent experiments. Overall the model is supported by the data presented and the paper is clearly and rigorously written, especially given the complexity of the story being presented. It ends with a mystery in terms of why the genes that are classically considered to be downstream of β-catenin are not activated by GRA18's action on β-catenin. The authors are forced to invoke another, as yet unidentified, parasite protein as playing a role that intersects with GRA18 in an infected cell. Although the exact mechanism of interaction is not yet understood, the data shown is solid and in general support the interpretation of GRA18 as the driving force of a non-canonical β-catenin-dependent signaling pathway conserved over multiple host species.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While a great deal of data is provided, some of the conclusions reached do not always appear to be strongly supported by the data.</p><p>1) GRA18 binding- The authors state that GRA18 directly binds β-catenin though I think the data they provide is certainly less robust than the data they have for GSK and PPP2R5A/B (e.g. the original Y2H found 3 clones showing β-catenin interactions with &quot;B&quot; ratings as opposed to GSK and PPP2R5A/B- which had over 10 clones with &quot;A&quot; ratings; the Y2H with bits of GRA18 shows a direct β-catenin interaction but the infected macrophage data and T-rex with overexpression do not). The authors need to either provide stronger explanations/data about the direct binding to β-catenin or soften their conclusion (and possibly to change the model- Figure 8).</p></disp-quote><p>While we certainly agree with the reviewer that the data gathered with biochemical approaches support a relatively weaker interaction of GRA18 with β-catenin unlike with GSK3 or the PP2A regulatory subunit, we want to stress important findings that strongly argue for GRA18/β-catenin interaction. While this interaction was initially found by Y2H, it was indeed subsequently confirmed with two other assays: (i) in HFF cells infected by parasites overexpressing GRA18-HF (Figure 2B, 8 peptides) and (ii) in T-Rex cells ectopically expressing GRA18, therefore unambiguously establishing the partnership (Figure 2E). It is only when GRA18 was expressed under the control of its endogenous promoter that we could detect GRA18 binding to GSK3 and PP2A, but not to β-catenin. Our interpretation of these results is that overexpression of GRA18 led to substantial β-catenin stabilization and accumulation, thus rendering possible its detection by immunoprecipitation otherwise below the limit of detection. Note that this point was mentioned throughout the second version of the manuscript, subsection “GRA18 forms versatile complexes with host components of the β-catenin destruction</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>complex.” and subsection “GRA18 export mechanism”. To take into account the reviewer’s concerns, we have modified the model proposed in Figure 8 and the corresponding legend to make clear that β-catenin while strongly binding to GRA18 – this interaction resisting to stringent washing conditions (0.5 M KCl and 0.1% NP-40)- only binds in a dose-dependent and sub-stoichiometrical fashion in the context of infection.</p><p>2) Subsection “GRA18 functions as a positive regulator of β-catenin” – The virulence data shown is from one experiment and there is no mention in the legend or text if this was repeated. Given the variability that can be seen in animal experiments, at least one repeat is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The virulence data in mice presented in Figure 4D are actually the cumulative results of two independent experiments, each conducted at several month intervals. Therefore, the groups of mice under analysis as well as the parasite handling were independent. We now mention these important precisions in the figure legend. We totally agree with the precautions required prior to conclude when assays rely on animal, in particular taking into account the variability between assays. It is indeed why we chose to assay (and to confirm) our findings using two different type II background – i.e. Pru <italic>ku80</italic> and 76K strains – in which we have produced mutants of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Chemokine data- Between Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7 there are inconsistencies. Figure 5E and F show that Ccl17 and Ccl22 have a GRA18-dependent increase in expression and protein levels but Ccl24 only changes at the level of transcript. Instead of exclusively focusing on Ccl17 and Ccl22, all 3 are noted in Figure 6 (using only expression data) with Figure 6F suggesting that Ccl22 changes in GRA18-β-catenin-independent mechanism. This idea seems to be contradicted in Figure 7 where the authors use Ccl22 as a readout for GRA18 inhibiting GSK3 which leads to increased β-catenin activity which then drives over-expression of Ccl22. These discrepancies need to be addressed including in the model.</p></disp-quote><p>The contribution of GRA18 in regulating <italic>Ccl17, Ccl22</italic>, and <italic>Ccl24</italic> chemokines in BMDMs is indisputable, but the data do not authorize a clear-cut conclusion about the actual reliance on β-catenin for the regulation of <italic>Ccl22</italic>, particularly. The use of BMDMs mutant for <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> and direct transfection of our different GRA18 constructions (Nt vs. Ct) and infection with wild-type and <italic>gra18</italic> mutant parasites would have provided a straightforward demonstration of the contribution of GRA18 and β-catenin, but construction of such a mutant remains a challenging task. As an alternative approach, we studied GRA18 functionality in the RAW cell line because they are transfectable cells and responded to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection similarly to BMDMs with regard to <italic>Ccl17</italic> expression, and <italic>Ccl22</italic> to some extent. We agree, it is confusing that the chemokine induction differs from each other with regard to β-catenin in RAWs. However, it seems important to us that the apparent inconsistencies for data obtained in different settings and contexts could be presented as they might provide relevant information for a better understanding of the GRA18-β-catenin and chemokine functional interactions. We have tried to address this issue in the following comment:</p><p>Visibly, there are some GRA18 and β-catenin-independent effects but would argue that the major induction effect upon <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection of the primary BMDM is GRA18 dependent. By ectopic expression of GRA18 in RAWs, we showed that the up-regulation of both <italic>Ccl17</italic> and <italic>Ccl22</italic> was dependent on β-catenin, though with a modest contribution of β-catenin for <italic>Ccl22</italic> (Figure 6E). Different results were obtained upon infection: in this assay, <italic>Ccl22</italic> expression is poorly dependent on <italic>GRA18</italic>, and as expected, independent of β-catenin (Figure 6F). Conversely, parasites overexpressing GRA18 allowed a further induction of <italic>Ccl22</italic> (from 30 to 500 RQ) (Figure 6F). Importantly, this effect is partially dependent on β-catenin, consistent with our general conclusion about GRA18 activity relying on β-catenin, at least partially. We think that these discrepancies are reflecting a different mode of regulation of <italic>Ccl22</italic> between the transformed RAWs and the primary BMDMs. We currently do not have explanation for why GRA18 at physiological levels (provided by wt parasites) is not active in RAWs. We propose that the induction of <italic>Ccl22</italic> in the RAWs is more likely dependent on a different regulator delivered by <italic>T. gondii</italic>, which explains why the induction is β-catenin independent. We have modified the text (line 284-293) as well as the model proposed in Figure 8 accordingly, expectantly clarifying that the mechanism of regulation of <italic>Ccl22</italic> is likely less dependent on β-catenin than <italic>Ccl17</italic> and might differ according to the transformed (RAW) or primary (BMDM) status of the cells under analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Quantitative real-time PCR”: Was the RNA quality/integrity controlled and Tbp as the only control gene tested for its expression stability? Not doing so could potentially undermine the robustness and reliability of the qPCR data. Why is only 1 biological replicate shown in the qPCR data and not a combination of 2 or more?</p></disp-quote><p>Total RNA quality and integrity were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis while quantification of 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA considered as the gold standard for evaluation of RNA integrity (Sambrook and Russel, 2001). Additionally, <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection rates were verified as judged by the parasite rRNA band that migrates in-between the 28S and 18S RNAs of the host cell. Our lab uses different genes as internal controls for qRT-PCR analysis (i.e. <italic>Tbp, B2m, 18S</italic> rRNA…). It is difficult to predict exactly how any given gene behaves under a given range of conditions, but the RNA-Seq data from our lab and others have shown that the <italic>Tbp</italic> transcripts remained constant in BMDM regardless of <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection and <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains (Melo et al., 2013).Furthermore, <italic>Tbp</italic> transcript levels are close to those of <italic>Ccl17, Ccl22,</italic> and <italic>Ccl24</italic> studied in the present manuscript (i.e. with RPKM ranging from 10 to 100), therefore making <italic>Tbp</italic> an appropriate control gene for assaying gene expression in murine macrophages. When performing the qRT-PCR, a particular attention was made to having constant Ct values across the different samples, thus confirming both RNA integrity and quantification. We certainly appreciate this concern but feel confident in the robustness and reliability of our qPCR data that confirm the RNA-Seq results. The method section now includes RNA quality and integrity assessment. To ensure that the effects of GRA18 on host cell gene expression was not dependent on the quality of the BMDMs prepared, the biological replicates were performed using different lots of BMDMs using somewhat different MOI. As expected, whilst the patterns were generally consistent, the Ct values were sufficiently different to introduce a large error when combined. It sounds more cumbersome than helpful to combine the data. So, we strongly feel that showing representative data set in these conditions is the more reliable for accurately interpreting the general trends.</p></body></sub-article></article>
