However mechanisms that maintain or compromise choroidal homeostasis are obscure. We discovered that the ablation of choroidal macrophages via CSF1R blockade was associated with choroidal vascular atrophy and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) changes including structural disruption, downregulation of visual cycle genes, and altered angiogenic factor expression. Suspending CSF1R blockade following ablation enabled spontaneous macrophage regeneration, which fully restored original macrophage distributions and morphologies. Macrophage regeneration was accompanied by arrested vascular degeneration and ameliorated pathological RPE alterations. These findings suggest that choroidal macrophages play a previously unappreciated trophic role in maintaining choroidal vasculature and RPE cells, implicating insufficiency in choroidal macrophage function as a factor in aging- and AMD-associated pathology. Modulating macrophage function may constitute a strategy for the therapeutic preservation of the choroid and RPE in age-related retinal disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>choroidal macrophage</kwd><kwd>choroidal vasculature</kwd><kwd>RPE disorganization</kwd><kwd>choroid</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Lian</given-names></name><name><surname>Campos</surname><given-names>Maria M</given-names></name><name><surname>Abu-Asab</surname><given-names>Mones</given-names></name><name><surname>Ortolan</surname><given-names>Davide</given-names></name><name><surname>Hotaling</surname><given-names>Nathan</given-names></name><name><surname>Bharti</surname><given-names>Kapil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Vascular degeneration of the choroid and RPE disorganization were associated with pharmacological macrophage ablation, indicating that insufficiency of macrophage function may be a mechanism underlying age- and AMD-associated pathology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The choroid of the mammalian eye comprises a dense vascular network located external to the retina and provides necessary material transport to the outer retina across the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) layer constituting the outer blood retinal barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fields et al., 2019</xref>). The functional significance of the choroidal supply is underscored by the implication of choroidal vascular atrophy as a significant contributor to degenerative diseases of the outer retina, particularly age-related macular degeneration (AMD)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sohn et al., 2019</xref>), a current leading cause of blindness in the developed world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bourne et al., 2018</xref>). While progressive loss of choroidal vasculature has been observed with aging and AMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keenan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spaide, 2009</xref>), the mechanisms that either actively drive choroidal atrophy or fail to sustain choroidal homeostasis are not well understood, and treatments that can successfully preserve choroidal structure are unavailable.</p><p>Like in vascular networks located at border regions surrounding the brain within the dura mater, subdural meninges and choroid plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McMenamin, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van Hove et al., 2019</xref>), the choroid of the eye contains a large constituent population of innate immune cells in the form of resident choroidal macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forrester et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McMenamin, 1999a</xref>). Under normal conditions, these macrophages are distributed across the entire choroid in the perivascular space in close juxtaposition with choroidal vessels. As they possess ramified cellular processes that demonstrate dynamic behavior, choroidal macrophages can potentially survey the perivascular environment and exchange signals with nearby vascular and RPE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). While activated choroidal macrophages have been implicated in contributing to pathological changes in posterior uveitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 1999</xref>) and choroidal neovascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherepanoff et al., 2010</xref>), their endogenous functions under healthy conditions are obscure, and if and how they may contribute to homeostasis in the choroid are not understood.</p><p>Dysfunction in choroidal macrophages has been linked to choroidal vascular alterations detected in aging and in AMD. Altered macrophage morphology and distribution have been correlated with attenuation of the choriocapillaris in the aged mouse choroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>), and increased density and expression of activation markers in macrophages have been documented with the onset of AMD in human eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McLeod et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting a causal relationship between macrophage changes and vascular loss. The implication of choroidal vascular loss as a driver of drusen accumulation and RPE disruption in AMD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biesemeier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lengyel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>) have prompted strategies aimed at maintaining choroidal vascular health and improving vascular supply to the outer retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coleman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whitmore et al., 2015</xref>), but the intrinsic mechanisms that maintain vascular and RPE integrity in the choroid have not been elucidated, limiting translational efforts.</p><p>We investigated here the homeostatic relationship that choroidal macrophages have with choroidal vasculature and RPE cells. We found that pharmacological CSF1R inhibition, which has been found to ablate tissue-resident innate immune cells in different CNS compartments, but relatively sparing circulating monocytes, induced the ablation of choroidal macrophages in a sustained manner. We discovered using in vivo structural imaging and histopathological and molecular analyses that choroidal macrophage ablation was associated with progressive vascular atrophy and with multiple structural and functional changes in the RPE layer, in ways resembling those observed in the aging and AMD eyes. We also discovered that residual choroidal macrophages, following depletion, can undergo regeneration upon suspension of CSF1R inhibition. Although normally non-proliferative in nature, residual macrophages following depletion proliferated in situ and underwent morphological maturation to fully reconstitute features of the endogenous macrophage population. These regenerated macrophages appear to restore endogenous macrophage homeostatic functions, as their repopulation of the choroid was associated with the arrest of vascular atrophy and the amelioration of pathological RPE alterations.</p><p>Taken together, our findings implicate a previously unappreciated constitutive function for resident choroidal macrophages in maintaining structural and functional homeostasis of choroidal vasculature and RPE cells and the ability of macrophages to regenerate the full complement of cells following depletion. These suggest a potential etiological mechanism of macrophage insufficiency for pathological choroidal vascular atrophy and highlight choroidal macrophage renewal as a phenomenon that may be potentially harnessed in regenerative strategies in the outer retina. Modulating choroidal macrophage presence and phenotype may be therapeutically effective in maintaining choroidal vasculature and consequently delaying AMD progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Age-related progressive choroidal thinning and vascular atrophy are associated with alterations in choroidal macrophages</title><p>Aging has previously been associated with negative changes in the human choroid, including reductions in choroidal thickness on in vivo imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Entezari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gattoussi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wakatsuki et al., 2015</xref>) and decreased choriocapillaris density on histopathological analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramrattan et al., 1994</xref>), however mechanisms underlying this association are largely unelucidated. To examine whether similar age-related choroidal changes were present in our model of the mouse choroid, we examined and compared the vascular structure of the young adult (3 month-old) with aged (24 month-old) BALB/cJ mice. Consistent with observations in human subjects, the choroid of aged mice showed significantly decreased thickness on in vivo enhanced-depth OCT imaging in both the nasal and temporal quadrants relative to young adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Quantitative analysis of choriocapillaris structure in sclerochoroidal flatmounts of DiI-perfused animals also showed decreased vascular area coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). We observed that these age-related changes in choroidal vasculature were associated with alterations in macrophages located in the perivascular space of the vascular choroid. Examination of MHCII-immunopositive macrophages in sclerochoroidal flatmounts showed that these were significantly increased in overall density in the aged choroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) compared with the young choroid, but the macrophages in the aged choroid demonstrated decreased ramification as evidenced by significantly decreased cell area, dendritic field area, and number of cellular processes per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>).

However, whether choroidal macrophages in the adult choroid can regenerate is unknown. To investigate this, we depleted choroidal macrophages in young adult mice using a PLX5622-containing diet for 3 weeks, a time-point when significant choroidal thinning has occurred (depletion phase), and then reverted these animals to a standard diet for another 4 weeks (repopulation phase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). An age-matched group fed a standard diet served as a control. We observed that when macrophage-depleted animals were returned to a standard diet, MHCII+, IBA1+ macrophages reappeared rapidly in the choroid, with cell density reaching 50% of control levels after 1 week of repopulation, attaining 100% of control levels at 4 weeks, and remaining stable at that level thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). This increase in macrophage cell numbers was at least in part enabled by local proliferation of residual IBA1+ cells; while resident macrophages in the choroid of control animals were mostly non-proliferative and negative for the proliferation marker Ki67, prominent numbers of Ki67+,IBA1+ cells were detected at 1 week of repopulation when macrophage numbers were rising sharply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). At 4 weeks repopulation, Ki67+ cell counts decreased back to control levels at a time when macrophage numbers have recovered to control levels. We cannot rule out that infiltrating monocytes from the circulation may contribute to the repopulation process, but it is likely that repopulated macrophages are, at least in part, originating from the proliferation of the local residual macrophages.Â These observations reveal a previously uncharacterized regenerative capability of choroidal macrophages in which local proliferation of myeloid cells in the choroid likely contributes to the recovery of the macrophage population following depletion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Choroidal macrophages demonstrate spontaneous repopulation and recovery of constitutive numbers following depletion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Adult 3 month old mice were administered a diet containing PLX5622 for 3 weeks to achieve depletion of choroidal macrophages (depletion phase), and then returned to a standard diet for another 4 weeks (repopulation phase).

These induce choroidal vascular atrophy, reducing choroidal thickness and decreasing choriocapillaris coverage.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55564-fig9-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tissue-resident innate immune cells, in addition to playing multiple inflammation-related functional roles, have been recently recognized to carry out constitutive homeostatic functions in adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wynn et al., 2013</xref>). In the adult brain, these cell populations comprise of microglia, which are located behind the blood-brain barrier (BBB) within the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>), and border-associated macrophages, which are located external and adjacent to the BBB in the meninges and choroid plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van Hove et al., 2019</xref>). How these populations mediate CNS homeostasis under normal conditions is an active area of investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li and Barres, 2018</xref>). In the eye, microglia resident within the healthy retina help maintain the structural and functional integrity of neuronal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), but the role of resident macrophages within the choroid of the eye is less well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McMenamin et al., 2019</xref>). Significantly, deficiencies in maintaining long-term structural homeostasis of the choroid feature importantly in ocular pathologies; the vascular choroid in in clinical studies has been found to undergo progressive atrophic thinning with normal aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wakatsuki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) and with increasing severity of AMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keenan et al., 2020</xref>), which are supported by histopathological and molecular evidence of vascular dropout and attenuation in these scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhutto and Lutty, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chirco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seddon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sohn et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies have associated AMD severity with increased choroidal macrophage number and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McLeod et al., 2016</xref>), however whether age-related and AMD-related choroidal changes may arise from deficient homeostatic function of resident macrophages has not been previously explored.</p><p>In the current work, we discover that choroidal macrophages may indeed play a previously unappreciated trophic role in maintenance of the vascular structure of the choroid. We found that the ablation of a significant majority of choroidal macrophages was accompanied by a generalized and progressive atrophy of the choroidal vasculature affecting choroidal vessels at multiple levels. This atrophic process extended to multiple levels of the vascular choroid, resulting in an overall decrease in choroidal thickness and choriocapillaris attenuation at the border of the RPE-Bruchâs membrane interface. The ability of resident innate immune cells to maintain local vasculature appears to vary according to tissue context; within the CNS, the depletion of retinal or brain microglia results induces changes in vessel structure and permeability in developing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold and Betsholtz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stefater et al., 2011</xref>), but not in adult systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elmore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In the adult gut, the depletion of resident macrophage subsets results in vascular alterations in the submucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Schepper et al., 2018</xref>), a feature observed analogously in the adult choroid. In the choroid, resident macrophages are distributed in a manner suitable for vascular regulation; they are found in close proximity to choroidal vessels at all levels and possess a dendritiform ramified morphology with dynamic cellular processes that constitutively survey the perivascular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McMenamin, 1999a</xref>). As such, choroidal macrophages may function to integrate cues from the local environment to shape vascular organization and blood supply, adapting to ongoing physiological needs in the outer retina. Interestingly, the phenotype of choroidal vascular attenuation that accompanied macrophage ablation resembled that occurring with aging in which vascular structural losses were accompanied by a general deramification of choroidal macrophages and thus a potential decrease in macrophage-vasculature interactions. This similarity supports the notion that macrophages can signal endogenously to the vascular choroid in ways that facilitate their constitutive maintenance.</p><p>We observed here that the trophic influence of choroidal macrophages may extend also to the maintenance of RPE structure and function. The nature of RPE changes accompanying macrophage depletion has a notable resemblance to structural and functional alterations seen with aging and AMD in the RPE layer, including increased cellular disorganization and decreased cell density in the RPE monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Del Priore et al., 2002</xref>), increased numbers of multinucleated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), and increased RPE dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Makarev et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies have connected microglia/macrophage activation with RPE alterations, but these had been in pathological situations in which increased production of inflammatory mediators induces RPE cell changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kutty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamawaki et al., 2016</xref>). Contrastingly, our findings here suggest that trophic macrophage-RPE signaling may be constitutively present under normal conditions, indicating that not only macrophage overaction, but also insufficiency of endogenous macrophage function, may contribute pathogenically to changes in the choroid and RPE layer observed in age-related retinal degeneration.</p><p>In our experiments here, we have employed pharmacological CSF1R inhibition to ablate choroidal macrophages to evaluate their agency in choroidal homeostasis. PLX5622 had been designed to target CSF1R with high specificity, and demonstrates 200-fold higher selectivity over KIT and FLT3, the two most homologous receptors of CSF1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Spangenberg et al., 2019</xref>), indicating improvements over earlier less selective precursors (e.g. PLX3397) and decreasing the likelihood of off-target effects. While other methods exist to ablate innate cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spangenberg and Green, 2017</xref>), longer-term sustained ablations such as those featured in our experiments are currently possible only with pharmacological CSF1R inhibition. While it cannot be ruled out that PLX5622 may have induced off-target effects that produce the phenotypes observed here independently of CSF1R inhibition and macrophage depletion, there has not been evidence from the multiple studies involving its use in which deleterious effects, including vascular degenerative phenotypes, have been detected in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dagher et al., 2015</xref>), spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halder and Milner, 2019</xref>), or retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) in non-disease states. In our previous work, we had noted that CSF1R inhibition using PLX5622 additionally ablates microglia in the healthy adult retina and that neuronal synapses in the plexiform layers in close proximity to retinal microglia showed structural and functional degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). While we have related choroidal vascular and RPE changes to the ablation of choroidal macrophages, which are in close physical proximity and have been shown to be capable of exerting their influence, we cannot rule out the possibility that the ablation of more distant microglia in the inner retina may also contribute to these associated phenotypes, although this âaction-from-a-distanceâ capability have not been previously demonstrated.</p><p>Our findings here indicate the existence of cellular and molecular mechanisms that may underlie trophic relationships between choroidal macrophages, choroidal vasculature, and RPE cells. Multiple studies have shown that the maintenance of vasculature in the adult choroid is highly dependent on the nearby presence of viable RPE cells, and specifically on RPE-expressed angiogenic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blaauwgeers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saint-Geniez et al., 2006</xref>). Measures that ablate RPE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hayashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Korte et al., 1984</xref>), or otherwise deplete or prevent the delivery of RPE-derived VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marneros et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saint-Geniez et al., 2009</xref>), resulted in prominent atrophy of choroidal vessels. This dependence of the choroidal vasculature on constitutive RPE support indicates that it is possible that choroidal macrophages may contribute to vascular maintenance indirectly via their effects on RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In our experiments, we observed that macrophage depletion is accompanied by a significant decrease in ratio of VEGF/PEDF factors that are expressed in the RPE-choroidal complex, with a significant decrease in VEGF immunopositivity and an increase of PEDF in the RPE cells layer, indicating that macrophage depletion may induce vascular atrophy by decreasing RPE-mediated angiogenic support. One mode of macrophage-to-RPE signaling that is potentially relevant in this mechanism involves TGFÎ²; TGFÎ² ligands, particularly TGFB1, is prominently expressed by tissue macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kwong et al., 2006</xref>). Signaling via TGFBR1/2, which is expressed in RPE cells, has been shown to potentiate RPE production and secretion of VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagineni et al., 2003</xref>). We observed that <italic>Tgfb1</italic> expression is significantly decreased in the RPE-choroidal complex with choroidal depletion, suggesting that TGFB1 secretion by choroidal macrophages to TGBR1/2 on RPE cells may contribute here. Verification of this mode of signaling, as well as other potential modes, await studies involving inducible macrophage-specific loss-of-function interventions in suitable in vivo models. Alternatively, it is possible that macrophage-vasculature signaling may occur directly, and that the RPE structural changes observed here may be secondarily induced by a resulting deficiency of choroidal supply. VEGF-secreting choroidal macrophages can directly potentiate choroidal neovascularization, as demonstrated in experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seddon et al., 2016</xref>) and suggested by macrophage presence in neovascular membranes in exudative AMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherepanoff et al., 2010</xref>). However, our immunohistochemical data do not indicate that macrophages in the healthy choroid constitutively secrete significant levels of VEGF, unlike those in neovascular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grossniklaus et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishibashi et al., 1997</xref>). Future studies identifying constitutive angiogenic factors expressed by macrophages in the healthy choroid will help address this mechanism of direct macrophage-vascular signaling.</p><p>We additionally discover here that macrophages in the adult choroid, which under normal conditions are non-migratory and demonstrate little constitutive proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>), can be induced by depletion to initiate a regenerative program de novo, in ways akin to barrier-associated macrophages in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van Hove et al., 2019</xref>). The cellular source for repopulating macrophages in this context is yet undetermined, and may involve the proliferation of residual resident macrophages, as observed for microglia in the adult retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), or the infiltration of circulating monocytes, as occurs in models of retinal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Our observations here highlight that the regeneration process involves the in situ proliferation of repopulating cells in the choroid, morphological and marker maturation during repopulation, and an accurate recapitulation of original macrophage density, distribution, and morphology, akin to the repopulation of microglia in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elmore et al., 2014</xref>). The ability of regenerated macrophages to recapitulate the endogenous function of the original macrophages is supported here by the arrest of choroidal vascular atrophy and RPE degenerative change, and the recovery of angiogenic factor balance upon the full restoration of macrophage numbers in the choroid. Interestingly, we did not observe a complete reversal of vascular and RPE degenerative changes that recovers the original, pre-depletion anatomy in the RPE-choroid, suggesting that aspects of degenerative change may be permanent and resist restoration by reinstituted trophic signals. This ability to regenerate choroidal macrophages presents a new potential therapeutic opportunity for immune modulation in the choroid in which depletion-repopulation measures may be employed to âresetâ the immune environment in the choroid in pathological situations in which choroidal macrophages demonstrate chronic activation. The feasibility of this approach will require further elucidation of the nature of macrophage repopulation in models of retinal pathology.</p><p>Taken together, our results here have significant relevance to understanding choroidal degeneration in aging and AMD progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arya et al., 2018</xref>) and to ongoing translational efforts to preserve or restore the vascular choroid in age-related disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whitmore et al., 2015</xref>). Additional to the concept that abnormal and imbalanced immune activation within the choroid involving proinflammatory and complement-mediated mechanisms can exert deleterious effects on choroidal vascular structure, our findings show that non-inflammatory trophic influences from resident choroidal macrophages may be additionally important in maintaining choroidal structural integrity across the lifespan of the organism. Our findings suggest that age- and AMD-associated degeneration in the RPE-choroid complex may be contributed to by multiple immune influences that combine inappropriate inflammatory activation and insufficient trophic support. The balance between these possibly simultaneous mechanisms may influence the relative severity of degeneration between the choriocapillaris vs. the adjacent RPE layer, which may influence the progression to the atrophic vs. the neovascular forms of AMD as hypothesized from histopathological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seddon et al., 2016</xref>). As such, immunomodulatory interventions aimed at preserving the integrity of the RPE-choroid complex should optimally enable both increased macrophage trophic influences and decreased inflammatory damage. These perspectives add to the strategy of choroidal macrophage-targeted interventions as potential therapies aimed at choroidal preservation in diseases like AMD.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The imaging was performed using a 30x objective (Heidelberg) and scan fields, measuring 6.5 by 4.4 mm and centered on the optic nerve (1000 A-scans/horizontal B-scan, 25 horizontal B-scans, average of three frames per B-scan, each spaced 182 Âµm apart) were captured in each imaging session. Repeat OCT imaging was performed at 1, 3, 5, and 7 weeks following the initiation of PLX5622. Thickness measurements in OCT images were made using the instrument manufacturer software; choroidal thickness measurements (defined as the axial distance from the Bruchâs membrane to the outer edge of the choroid) were measured at 300 Âµm temporal and nasal from the optic nerve on the horizontal meridian, and average retinal thickness measurements per eye (defined as the axial distance from the vitreal surface to the Bruchâs membrane) were made at 300 Âµm temporal and nasal from the optic nerve in corresponding locations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Direct labeling and visualization of choroidal vessels</title><p>Choroidal vessels are labeled by cardiac perfusion of an aqueous solution containing 1,19-dioctadecyl-3,3,39,39-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI, D-282, Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA), a lipophilic dye that incorporates into membranes of endothelial cells revealing the structure of choroidal vessels as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, experimental mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation and the thoracic cavity opened to expose the heart. A volume of 100 ÂµL of DiI stock solution (6 mg/ml in 100% ethanol) was dissolved in 5 ml of diluent comprising 1xPBS and 5% glucose in a 1:4 ratio and the resulting solution delivered via cardiac perfusion at a rate of 1â2 mL/min. This was immediately followed by the perfusion of 6 mL of PBS. The animals were immediately enucleated and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-sclera-choroid complex dissected from the harvested globes after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. These flat-mount preparations were mounted on glass slides in Fluoromount (Sigma-Aldrich) with the RPE cell layer uppermost. Confocal multiplane z-stack images of Dil-labeled endothelial cells were obtained with confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM700) under a 63x oil-immersion objective at 300â600 Âµm temporal and nasal from the optic nerve. Images of labeled vessels in the choriocapillaris were used to compute the fraction of vascular coverage as the fractional area of the imaging field occupied by DiI-labeled vessels using ImageJ Software (NIH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis</title><p>Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of isolated mouse choroid was performed to identify the molecular changes after macrophage depletion. RPE-sclerochoroidal tissue were acutely isolated from euthanized animals and total RNA was extracted using a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and amplified to cDNA using the PrimeScript 1<sup>st</sup> strand cDNA synthesis kit (TaKaRa Bio) per manufacturersâ instructions. cDNA in 1 ÂµL volume was used for real-time PCR analysis using SYBR Green PCR Mastermix (Affymetrix) on the CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad). Levels of mRNA expression were normalized to those in controls as determined using the comparative CT (2ÎÎCT) method. GAPDH was used as an internal control. Tgfb1 primer was purchased from Bio-Rad (Assay ID qMmuCID0017320), and other oligonucleotide primer pairs used are listed in the Key Resources Table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histological analysis of Choroid-RPE sections</title><p>Eyes from control and 7 weeks PLX5622-treated animals were isolated and fixed for 30 min in 4% glutaraldehyde followed by 10% formalin for at least 24 hr. Fixed eyes were embedded in methacrylate, serially sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images were taken with a Zeiss microscope and mean thickness of the choroid from temporal and nasal quadrants and mean cross-sectional area of vascular lumina were measured using ImageJ software (NIH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Transmission Electron Microscopy of RPE sections</title><p>The eyes from control and PLX5622-treated mice were isolated and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde. The specimens were prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ogilvy et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, specimens were embedded in Spurr's epoxy resin and processed into ultrathin sections (90 nm) which were then stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and imaged with a transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JM-1010).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Protein quantitation in choroid-RPE-complex</title><p>Mouse RPE-choroidal samples were isolated from the following groups: untreated control group, group treated with 7 weeks of PLX5622, group treated with 3 weeks of PLX5622 and switched to regular diet for another 4 weeks to allow macrophage repopulation. Four biological replicates were obtained for each group. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) protein levels were measured in the samples using the Mouse SERPINF1/PEDF ELISA kit (LifeSpan BioSciences; LS-F36110). Protein levels of VEGF, PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB were analyzed using a Magnetic Luminex Assay kit (R and D Systems, LXSAMSM-11).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Electroretinographic (ERG) analysis</title><p>ERGs were recorded using an Espion E2 system (Diagnosys). Mice were dark-adapted for 12 hr and their pupils were dilated prior to ERG assessment. Mice were anesthetized and flash ERG recordings were obtained simultaneously from both eyes using gold wire loop electrodes, with the reference electrode placed in the animalâs mouth and the ground subdermal electrode at the tail. ERG responses were obtained at increasing light intensities over the ranges of 1 Ã 10<sup>â4</sup> to 10 cdÂ·s/m<sup>2</sup> under dark-adapted conditions, and 0.3 to 100 cdÂ·s/m<sup>2</sup> under a background light that saturates rod function. The stimulus interval between flashes varied from 5 s at the lowest stimulus strengths to 60 s at the highest ones. Two to ten responses were averaged depending on flash intensity. ERG signals were sampled at 1 kHz and recorded with 0.3 Hz low-frequency and 300 Hz high-frequency cutoffs. Analysis of a-wave and b-wave amplitudes was performed using customized Espion ERG Data Analyzer software (v2.2) that digitally filters out high-frequency oscillatory potential wavelets. The a-wave amplitude was measured from the baseline to the negative peak and the b-wave was measured from the a-wave trough to the maximum positive peak. ERGs were recorded before and after macrophage depletion. The a- and b-wave measurements of animals with or without macrophage depletion were compared using a two-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7.0d (GraphPad). For comparisons involving two data columns, t tests (paired or unpaired) or nonparametric tests (MannâWhitney U) were used, depending on whether the data followed a Gaussian distribution as determined by normality tests. A normality test (DâAgostino and Pearson) was used to analyze the distribution of all datasets. For comparisons involving three or more data columns, a one-way ANOVA (with Dunnettâs multiple-comparisons test) was used if the data in an experimental group were found in a Gaussian distribution, and a nonparametric KruskalâWallis test (with Dunnâs multiple-comparisons test) was used otherwise.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is supported by National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Supervision, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Mechanisms that maintain choroidal homeostasis are not well understood. The authors report that the ablation of choroidal macrophages via CSF1R blockade was associated with choroidal vascular atrophy and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) structural disruption, down regulation of visual cycle genes, and altered angiogenic factor expression. Suspending CSF1R blockade then enabled spontaneous macrophage regeneration, which fully restored original macrophage distributions and morphologies. Macrophage regeneration arrested vascular degeneration and reversed RPE alterations. These findings suggest that choroidal macrophages help maintain choroidal vasculature and RPE cells, implicating choroidal macrophage depletion or malfunction as a factor in aging- and AMD-associated pathology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please add the number of mice and eyes assessed in each sub figure.</p><p>2) The purpose of this manuscript is to show a relationship with macrophages and visual function, if there is experimental recovery of macrophages is there recover of visual function?

This significantly strengthens the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs query. While we have associated the depletion of choroidal macrophages with degenerative changes in choroidal and RPE structure, as well as decreases in ERG physiological function, we found that the repopulation of choroidal macrophages was associated with the recovery of some but not all of these phenotypes. Phenotypes such as choroidal thickness were stabilized upon macrophage repopulation but did not recover back to baseline levels.</p><p>With regards to the potential recovery of ERG function with macrophage repopulation, we have now added Figure 8âfigure supplement 2 to describe the changes in ERG function. This experiment involved the analysis of two separate groups of age-matched animals: (1) the continuous depletion group which was administered a PLX5622 diet continuously over 7 weeks and assessed with ERG at baseline, 3 weeks and 7 weeks, and (2) the depletion-repopulation group which was administered PLX5622 for only the first 3 weeks and resumed on a regular diet thereafter; these animals were also assessed at baseline, 3 weeks and 7 weeks. We found that in the continuous depletion group, the scotopic a- and b-wave amplitudes decreased significantly from baseline at 3 weeks of depletion. and then decreased only a small amount further at 7 weeks of depletion. In the depletion-repopulation group, a similar decrease in the scotopic a- and b-wave amplitudes were observed at 3 weeks of depletion, but the scotopic a- and b-wave amplitudes stabilized and were unchanged between 3 to 7 weeks during macrophage repopulation. These changes in ERG changes upon macrophage repopulation resembled the changes in choroidal thickness which stabilized but did not recover after macrophage repopulation.</p><p>In the Results section, we have added the following description:</p><p>âIn addition to the RPE morphology and gene expression changes, the scotopic a- and b-wave amplitudes decreased significantly at 3 weeks of depletion in the continuous depletion group and decreased slightly further in the scotopic b-wave amplitude at 7 weeks of depletion while the scotopic a-wave amplitude remained stable. However, in the depletion-repopulation group, while similar decrease in the scotopic a- and b-wave amplitudes were observed at 3 weeks of depletion, the scotopic a- and b-wave amplitudes were unchanged between 3 to 7 weeks during macrophage repopulation (Figure 8âfigure supplement 2A).â</p><p>âTaken together, these data demonstrate that structural and gene expression changes induced in the RPE-choroid complex upon macrophage depletion were significantly ameliorated or stabilized upon macrophage repopulation, supporting the notion of a homeostatic supportive function for choroidal macrophages.â</p><p>The following figure legend was added to Figure 8âfigure supplement 2:</p><p><italic>â</italic>Figure 8âfigure supplement 2.

How much of the observed staining is intravascular cells? It is difficult with the whole mounts to determine if the decrease in vascular structure is because of lost functional choroidal cells, or because of reduced number of white blood cells in the blood circulation causing the vessels to look smaller and less stained.</p></disp-quote><p>All experimental mice referenced in this section were perfused prior to enucleation with DiI-containing perfusate; the incorporation of DI into endothelial cell membranes enabled labeling of the choroidal vascular structure. It is possible that the removal of intravascular cells may have introduced some alterations in the vascular structure of choroidal vessels, however because all animals were similarly perfused, the detected vascular structural differences between depleted and non-depleted animals do not arise from this potential influence. These differences between the DiI-labelled vascular structures of depleted vs. non-depleted animals were corroborated by comparisons using H&amp;E-stained choroidal sections and in vivo OCT imaging â techniques that do not involve vascular perfusion. As such, we are of the opinion that vascular perfusion did not constitute a confounding factor in our study.</p><p>For clarification, we added the sentence âto visualize the choriocapillaris, vessels were perfused and labeled with Dil lipophilic dyeâin the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) None of the figures have staining controls presented.
