H3.3-G34R/V mutants are common in tumors with mutations in p53 and ATRX, an H3.3-specific chromatin remodeler. To gain insight into the role of H3-G34R, we generated fission yeast that express only the mutant histone H3. H3-G34R specifically reduces H3K36 tri-methylation and H3K36 acetylation, and mutants show partial transcriptional overlap with <italic>set2</italic> deletions. H3-G34R mutants exhibit genomic instability and increased replication stress, including slowed replication fork restart, although DNA replication checkpoints are functional. H3-G34R mutants are defective for DNA damage repair by homologous recombination (HR), and have altered HR protein dynamics in both damaged and untreated cells. These data suggest H3-G34R slows resolution of HR-mediated repair and that unresolved replication intermediates impair chromosome segregation. This analysis of H3-G34R mutant fission yeast provides mechanistic insight into how G34R mutation may promote genomic instability in glioma.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27406.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27406.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27406.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Children suffering from a brain cancer called high-grade glioma rarely recover because there are no therapies that can effectively target this disease. Recently, mutations in a gene that encodes a protein called histone H3 were found in children’s glioma cells. Histone proteins bind to DNA to help package it into cells. They help to protect the DNA from damage, control when genes are switched on or off, and influence how the DNA is copied when cells are preparing to divide to produce two daughter cells. However, little was known about why one of the histone H3 mutations is associated with high-grade gliomas.</p><p>Humans and other animals have many different versions of the histone H3 protein, which makes it difficult to study a mutation that only affects one particular version. Therefore Yadav et al. used fission yeast – which they engineered to only contain one form of histone H3 – to study what effect the mutation has on cells.</p><p>The experiments show that fission yeast cells with the mutant form of histone H3 took longer to replicate their DNA and were more likely to die when exposed to chemicals that interfere with DNA duplication. Furthermore, the mutant cells were slower at repairing certain types of damage to DNA and were more likely to go on to divide before DNA duplication and repair were completed. As a result, the daughter cells produced were more likely to have gained or lost whole chunks of their DNA. This phenomenon is known as chromosomal instability and is often seen in cases of high-grade glioma in children.</p><p>The findings of Yadav et al. give new insight into how a specific mutation affecting the histone H3 protein may act in cells. Future experiments will need to confirm whether this mutation also has a similar effect on children’s glioma cells, which may help to provide new options for treating this cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27406.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27406.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

is packaged into chromatin, which regulates all DNA transactions including transcription, replication and repair. The basic subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which is made up of 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a core octamer of histone proteins. Proteins that regulate chromatin dynamics are frequently mutated in cancer, and recently mutations in the histone genes themselves have been discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwartzentruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behjati et al., 2013</xref>). One such mutant is the Glycine 34 to Arginine (G34R) mutant of histone H3.3, identified as a frequent somatic mutation in pediatric high-grade cortical glioma (pHGG). H3.3 is a non-canonical H3 variant, whose deposition is not linked to replication and which can accumulate in post-mitotic cells and in areas of high transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Skene and Henikoff, 2013</xref>). Notably, G34R mutations are only found in H3.3, primarily in one of two H3.3 genes (<italic>H3F3A</italic>) and not in the replication coupled H3 proteins H3.1 and H3.2, which are encoded by a total of 13 genes. G34R mutations are commonly found in tumors additionally mutant for the tumor suppressor p53 and ATRX, a chromatin remodeler involved specifically in nucleosomal deposition of the H3.3 variant histone at telomeres and pericentric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drané et al., 2010</xref>). While p53 and ATRX mutations may contribute to the genomic instability exemplified by these gliomas, the specific role of the G34R H3.3 mutant in disease remains a mystery.</p><p>One published study showed G34R nucleosomes had reduced K36me2/3 on the same H3.3 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting a potential role in regulating H3K36 methylation in gliomas. Furthermore, mutations in SETD2, the enzyme that performs H3K36 di- to tri-methylation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edmunds et al., 2008</xref>), have also frequently been identified in pHGG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fontebasso et al., 2013</xref>). However, SETD2 mutations are not found in conjunction with histone mutations, suggesting the importance of disruption of the H3K36me3/ SETD2 axis in cortical pHGG. To gain biological insight into the role of the G34R mutant, we engineered fission yeast to express either wild-type or G34R mutant histone H3. In fission yeast, a single enzyme, Set2, performs all methylation on H3K36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morris et al., 2005</xref>). We hypothesized that H3-G34R mutation may reduce Set2 function and influence important chromatin-templated processes such as DNA transcription, replication and repair, which are highly conserved between fission yeast and human.</p><p>Here, we show that histone H3-G34R mutation specifically reduced tri-methylation, but not di-methylation of H3K36, and caused a decrease in H3K36 acetylation. However, G34R mutants displayed different phenotypes to <italic>set2Δ</italic>, suggesting that defective H3K36 modification may not be the sole defect in G34R. H3-G34R mutants showed chromosome instability and sensitivities to DNA damaging agents which are distinct from cells lacking Set2. H3-G34R mutants had defects in HR-directed repair, which may be attributed to a delay in DNA repair dynamics at compromised replication forks. Together, our work provides valuable insight to the potential role of H3-G34R mutations in pediatric high-grade gliomas.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In contrast to the complexity of mammals, where fifteen genes encode three different histone H3 proteins (H3.1, H3.2, H3.3), fission yeast have three genes that code for a single histone H3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsumoto and Yanagida, 1985</xref>). Fission yeast H3 has features of both H3.1 and H3.3 proteins of higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

Five enzymes can methylate H3K36 in mammals, with only SETD2 responsible for H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edmunds et al., 2008</xref>). In fission yeast, a single enzyme (Set2) performs all methylation on H3K36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morris et al., 2005</xref>). We began our investigation by determining if H3-G34R mutation reduces Set2 H3K36 methyltransferase activity. Because of the proximity of G34R to K36, we tested whether antibodies can specifically recognize K36 methylation states in the G34R mutant. Using di- or tri-methylated K36 H3 peptides as targets, we identified two anti-K36me3 antibodies that were minimally affected by G34R mutation, and one antibody against K36me2 whose binding was weakened ~10 fold by the G34R mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f–g</xref> serve to demonstrate reproducibility of the H3K36me3 methylation pattern with an alternate H3K36me3-specific antibody. Using these antibodies, we found that H3K36me3 was markedly reduced in H3-G34R compared to H3-WT cell extracts, but that H3K36me2 levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>). As we observed that binding of the H3K36me2 antibody is reduced ~10 fold on G34R peptides, these results suggest that K36me2 is elevated in H3-G34R cells. Thus Set2 function is altered in H3-G34R cells, with specific reduction of H3K36me3 and retention/ accumulation of H3K36me2.</p><p>Since endogenously tagged Set2-FLAG protein levels were similar in H3-WT and H3-G34R cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h</xref>), the reduction in H3K36me3 is not caused by a loss of <italic>set2<sup>+</sup></italic> expression in H3-G34R cells. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that Set2-FLAG recruitment to chromatin was not reduced in H3-G34R cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), suggesting that the H3-G34R mutation hinders Set2 activity but not access to K36. We therefore asked if we could force the generation of H3K36me3 in H3-G34R cells by overexpression of the Set2 methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1i</xref>). Western analysis of extracts prepared from cells that overexpress Set2 showed that pSet2-FLAG restored K36me2 and me3 in H3-WT <italic>set2Δ</italic> strains but was able to generate only low levels of H3K36me3 in both H3-G34R and H3-G34R <italic>set2Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Thus the H3-G34R mutation reduces Set2 activity on the H3 tail, leading to a specific reduction in tri-methylation of H3K36, and this effect cannot be bypassed by overexpression of Set2.</p><p>In addition to methylation of H3K36, this residue is also regulated by acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morris et al., 2007</xref>). To address whether H3-G34R impedes acetylation at H3K36, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to perform targeted analysis of acetylation of tails of histone H3 and H4 in histones acid extracted from H3-WT, H3-G34R and <italic>set2Δ</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuo and Andrews, 2013</xref>). Calibration was performed to monitor the elution time of the acetylated and propionylated tryptic peptides and transitions were created to study acetylation of H3-WT and H3-G34R as well as the H4 tails (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">2</xref> and Materials and methods). These studies showed acetylation of K36 on histone H3 was greatly reduced in H3-G34R strains and somewhat reduced in <italic>set2Δ</italic>. Additionally, there was a slight upregulation of H3K18 acetylation and possibly enhanced K27 acetylation in H3-G34R, although K27 acetylation in H3-WT was highly variable. <italic>set2Δ</italic> cells showed more widespread changes, with a slight reduction of H4 K16 acetylation, some induction of H3K9 and K18 acetylation and a marked increase in H3K14 acetylation. In summary, H3-G34R cells showed a focal pattern of chromatin changes centered on inefficient tri-methylation and reduced acetylation of histone H3K36, whereas <italic>set2Δ</italic> effects were more widespread.</p><p>H3K36me3 and H3K36 acetylation have been shown to be cell cycle regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pai et al., 2014</xref>), with K36me3 accumulating in G1 and early-mid S phase. We assessed the consequence of H3-G34R mutation on K36me3 accumulation at several stages of the cell cycle, using cells synchronized in G1, S, G2 and M phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although levels of H3K36me3 were reduced in H3-G34R cells compared to H3-WT at all stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a,b,c</xref>), H3K36me3 did accumulate in both H3-WT and H3-G34R cells synchronized in G1, indicative that the G34R mutation does not override cell cycle control of Set2 function. Additionally, this experiment also demonstrates that H3K36me2 levels are higher throughout the cell cycle in H3-G34R compared to H3-WT cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>H3-G34R mutants are transcriptionally distinct from <italic>set2Δ</italic> cells</title><p>Post-translational modifications of H3K36 are important for transcriptional control, raising the possibility of transcriptional disruption in H3-G34R cells.

In most other cases (44/46), transcripts accumulated in <italic>set2Δ</italic> but were repressed in H3-G34R. As can be seen on chromosome-wide plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>), transcripts that are differentially regulated between H3-G34R and <italic>set2Δ</italic> map to regions adjacent to subtelomeric regions of chromosome 1 and 2 (ST or sub-subtelomeric domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsuda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchanan et al., 2009</xref>]), which are not heterochromatic and are normally expressed at low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mata et al., 2002</xref>).

Thus H3K36me2 is perhaps critical for the repression in ST domains seen in H3-G34R cells.

There is some overlap with Set2-mediated control as shown by similar regulation of some sense and some antisense genes, but also differences as evidenced by opposite regulation of transcription with sub-subtelomeric domains.

Interestingly, we found that H3-G34R cells lost minichromosomes at an elevated frequency (3.5%), while minichromosome loss in <italic>set2Δ </italic>was not significantly upregulated (1.6%). We further tested for specific chromosome segregation defects in H3-G34R strains by monitoring frequencies of lagging chromosomes on late anaphase spindles, using anti-tubulin antibodies to stain the spindle, and DAPI to stain DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ekwall et al., 1995</xref>).

We found that chronic exposure to each genotoxin resulted in significant sensitivity of H3-G34R cells compared with H3-WT cells. Conversely, when H3-G34R and H3-WT cells were exposed to gamma irradiation (γIR) or bleomycin, two replication-independent genotoxins, H3-G34R mutants showed no sensitivity, whereas <italic>set2Δ</italic> cells were sensitive to γIR and bleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>) as seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pai et al., 2014</xref>).

To assess Cds1 replication checkpoint function, we performed HU treatment of H3-G34R cells since, in <italic>cds1Δ</italic> cells, prolonged DNA synthesis occurs both during HU treatment and after release.

We mutated genes for post-replication repair (PRR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and homologous recombination (HR) in H3-WT and H3-G34R cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c–e</xref>). To test PRR, we generated combination mutants of H3-G34R with either <italic>rad18</italic> (important for trans-lesion synthesis) or <italic>ubc13</italic> (important for template switching) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branzei et al., 2008</xref>). H3-G34R mutants with either of these mutations show synergistic sensitivity to MMS, suggesting that the PRR pathways are functional in H3-G34R cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Additionally we monitored epistasis with a mutant in the NHEJ pathway. Combination mutants of H3-G34R were generated with mutants in Ku70, a subunit of the Ku complex responsible for recognizing double strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manolis et al., 2001</xref>). H3-G34R showed synergistic defects with <italic>ku70Δ</italic> when assessed on MMS compared with either single mutant, indicating that NHEJ is functional in H3-G34R cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we assessed the genotoxin sensitivity of H3-G34R in combination with a mutant necessary for HR-directed repair. Combination mutants were generated with <italic>rad51</italic>Δ (Rad51 encodes a strand exchange protein that forms a filament on DNA and facilitates the search for homology). In contrast to mutations with PRR or NHEJ proteins, H3-G34R <italic>rad51Δ</italic> double mutants showed epistasis with single mutants when plated on MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). This suggests that H3-G34R cells have a defective HR pathway.</p><p>To extend this analysis, we developed an assay to directly monitor the frequency of HR-directed repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We transformed <italic>leu1-32</italic> mutant cells (that bear a single nucleotide mutation in <italic>leu1</italic> that renders cells auxotrophic for leucine) with a 576 bp fragment of wild type <italic>leu1<sup>+</sup></italic> and scored <italic>leu1<sup>+</sup></italic> transformants that can only arise by HR, normalizing for transformation efficiencies of strains using plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). As expected, <italic>rad51Δ</italic> cells were very defective with HR rates of only ~3% of H3-WT cells. H3-G34R and <italic>set2Δ</italic> strains were also defective (~35% efficiency) and the double H3-G34R <italic>set2Δ</italic> mutant showed an even stronger defect, with a 90% drop in HR efficiency. The reduction in HR in <italic>set2Δ</italic> was not due to the genetic background, as we obtained similar results when <italic>set2Δ</italic> was assessed in a 3xH3/H4 genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Thus both H3-G34R and <italic>set2Δ</italic> reduce HR efficiency but via distinct mechanisms, as additive defects are seen in the <italic>set2Δ</italic> H3-G34R double mutant. We note that our finding of an HR defect in <italic>set2Δ</italic> differs from the previously published result of enhanced HR and defective NHEJ in 3xH3/H4 <italic>set2Δ</italic> cells as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pai et al., 2014</xref>. Their study utilized an engineered non-essential minichromosome with an HO break site. The authors monitored four different markers for loss, and interpret combinations of marker loss as NHEJ-repair, gene conversion, loss of heterozygosity and loss of the chromosome. However, due to the nature of the assay, there are many possible causes of apparent marker loss which may cloud interpretation. Our simple and direct approach to measure HR relies on a site specific gain of marker function at a defined locus. We note that we have just assessed HR at one site, and it is quite feasible that distinct outcomes may be obtained by assessing HR at different genomic regions. We sought to determine if the difference in interpretation of Set2 function was indeed caused by the different assays or by strain differences between the <italic>set2Δ</italic> backgrounds. We performed the transformation-based HR assay in the <italic>set2Δ</italic> strains used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pai et al., 2014</xref>, and in NHEJ defective <italic>ku70Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>), and found that all <italic>set2Δ</italic> strains tested showed a defect in HR, whereas HR efficiency was strongly enhanced in <italic>ku70Δ,</italic> as HR is now the sole method of DNA break repair available. We conclude that the difference in interpretation of whether <italic>set2Δ</italic> cells are deficient in HR lies with the use of distinct assays.</p><p>In fission yeast, NHEJ is restricted to G1, while HR operates in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferreira and Cooper, 2004</xref>). One possible cause of the decreased HR in H3-G34R cells and the dependence of H3-G34R cells on NHEJ for viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>) is an alteration in the cell cycle, with an extension of G1. We measured the generation time during exponential growth and found that H3-G34R had an extended doubling time of 201 min (±4 min) compared to 180 min (±10 min) for H3-WT, and 194 min (±8 min) for <italic>set2Δ</italic> in rich media at 32°C. To determine if the growth delay of H3-G34R mutants was linked to a particular cell cycle stage, we monitored cell cycle kinetics using FACS sorting of cells synchronized in G1 or in metaphase and then released back into the cycle at 25°C. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <italic>cdc10-M17</italic> (G1) arrested and released cells begin DNA synthesis at 40 min after release. H3-WT cells have completed DNA synthesis by 80–100 min, whereas S phase is prolonged in H3-G34R cells and not completed until 140–160 min after release. It is difficult to draw conclusions from the <italic>nda3-km311</italic> arrest and release experiment since fission yeast do not undergo cytokinesis until G1, which complicates analysis of G1 cells. From these data we can surmise that H3-G34R cells spend longer in S phase when released from a G1/S block.</p><p>Next we asked whether there were defects in localization of HR proteins. We evaluated foci formation of RPA, Rad51, and Rad52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3a</xref>). Consistent with enhanced replication stress in H3-G34R cells, H3-G34R cells showed increased numbers of RPA and Rad52 foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2012</xref>). As expected, all cells showed increased foci for all three proteins following MMS treatment. Surprisingly however, fewer MMS-treated H3-G34R cells showed Rad51 and Rad52 foci compared with H3-WT and <italic>set2Δ</italic>. The reduction in foci was not linked to a change in protein expression as Rad51 and Rad52 protein levels were similar in MMS treated H3-WT and H3-G34R cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3b</xref>). Additionally, Rad52 foci co-localized with RPA, suggesting that Rad52 foci occur at sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3c</xref>). In summary, H3-G34R cells exhibit elevated marks of replicative stress, and on MMS-damage, have diminished foci formation for Rad51 and Rad52, which may be linked to the HR defect seen in H3-G34R cells.</p><p>We questioned whether the chromosome segregation defects in H3-G34R may be related to delayed resolution of replicative intermediates. To address this, we monitored RPA localization in anaphase cells following <italic>cdc10</italic> block and release, and found that H3-G34R cells exhibit anaphase bridges, with RPA marking ultrafine bridges between DAPI staining masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3d</xref>). We are unable to determine the frequency of these bridges in anaphase cells since attempts to co-stain the spindle hampered visualization of bridges, but they were easy to identify in synchronized populations suggesting that they are frequent events. This supports that chromosome segregation defects in H3-G34R cells are linked to the delayed resolution of replication intermediates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>H3-G34R mutants exhibit delayed recovery from replicative stress</title><p>HR-directed repair is often utilized to restart replication forks following stress. Because we observed a defect in HR, and a defect in Rad51 and Rad52 foci formation in MMS-treated H3-G34R cells, we speculated whether this was due to a delay in Rad51/Rad52 filament formation, and thus a defect in replication restart. To address whether the kinetics of recovery were affected, cells were arrested with HU, washed, and then counted at intervals following release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Checkpoint-defective <italic>cds1Δ</italic> cells do not recover from the arrest.

To directly monitor the rate of DNA replication, we arrested cells with HU and on release, monitored de novo DNA synthesis by EdU incorporation, gating on cells that had fully incorporated EdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>).

MMS treatment led to a rapid induction of γH2A signal in H3-WT cells, such that at 45 min treatment, maximal signal was achieved which was retained during treatment. Surprisingly, γH2A signal accumulated more slowly in H3-G34R cells, and peaked at 45 min into the recovery period, at higher levels than seen in H3-WT cells. On recovery from MMS, γH2A remained intensely phosphorylated at later time points in H3-G34R cells compared with H3-WT cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).</p><p>Similar to γH2A, Rad52 foci accumulated faster in MMS treated H3-WT cells than H3-G34R, even though more Rad52 foci were present in untreated H3-G34R cells than in H3-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). During recovery, H3-WT cells with Rad52 foci dropped to ~50% by 180 mins while Rad52 foci continued to accumulate in H3-G34R, peaking at 90 min following release, before dropping. These data suggest that the kinetics of DNA damage response are different between H3-WT and H3-G34R cells, with H3-G34R mutants showing a slower induction of damage response, as well as accumulation of recombination proteins at later timepoints following damage, which may contribute to the HR-mediated repair defect in H3-G34R mutants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we generated single copy histone mutants in fission yeast with the aim of studying the behavior of the H3-G34R mutant. This system allows a detailed examination of the possible consequences of this histone mutant, divorced from the complexity of mammalian histone regulation. Using this system, we show that H3-G34R mutants have focal histone modification changes, with reduced tri-methylation and acetylation, but retention of di-methylation on the nearby K36 residue on histone H3. These results are consistent with some perturbation of Set2 function and we demonstrate that this defect cannot be overridden by overexpression of Set2 as, even under these conditions, H3-G34R cells fail to accumulate normal levels of H3K36me3.</p><p>Furthermore, the transcriptional consequence of H3-G34R mutation is limited, with fewer genes affected than in <italic>set2Δ</italic>. Indeed for genes whose transcription is altered in both <italic>set2Δ</italic> and H3-G34R, only some are coordinately regulated. Notably, these include antisense genes, which suggests that trimethylation of H3K36 is important for suppression of antisense gene transcription. Interestingly, genes showing discordant regulation map to specific chromosomal loci- the ST regions. Transcriptional upregulation in ST domains in <italic>set2Δ</italic> is likely a direct consequence of loss of Set2 function on H3K36, since the histone H3 K36A mutant shows similar upregulation of expression of ST domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsuda et al., 2015</xref>). Of interest, ST regions have recently been shown to be the most highly condensed regions of the genome, forming ‘knobs’, with condensation linked to Set2 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsuda et al., 2015</xref>), but the biological implications of knob formation are not yet known.</p><p>Perhaps the most consequential findings from this work are the effects of H3-G34R mutation on genome stability. We see evidence for enhanced chromosome loss and for defects in chromosome segregation, with accumulation of cells that have trailing or ‘stretched’ chromosomes. We find that RPA coats ultrafine anaphase bridges in mitotic H3-G34R cells, marking DNA that links chromosome masses, which is indicative of unresolved replication problems. These data are consistent with our finding that H3-G34R cells are sensitive to replication stress, and that HR pathways are defective in these cells. These phenotypes are unlikely to be due to transcriptional deregulation in H3-G34R cells since transcription of DNA damage genes, under non-perturbed conditions, is unaltered. Instead, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, these findings may derive from the altered kinetics of signal response to damage in H3-G34R cells, with slowed accumulation of γH2A and delayed formation of Rad52 foci, features which may also contribute to the delayed replication of H3-G34R cells during recovery from replication stress. H3-G34R mutation may thus impair HR-mediated repair of DNA damage induced DSBs.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27406.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model illustrating how HR defects in H3-G34R mutants may compromise genomic integrity.</title><p>Model illustrates the key defects in H3-G34R cells and how these may contribute to genomic instability. Replication forks provide an endogenous source of DNA damage, as they are fragile structures that are prone to stalling and collapsing. (<italic>left</italic>) To cope with replication stress, cells activate the checkpoint signaling pathway by sensing ssDNA via Rad3. Rad3 interacts with ssDNA through RPA and phosphorylates H2A, which helps to transduce the checkpoint response to downstream kinases. For lesions that require HR-directed repair, nucleosome removal and subsequent 5’ to 3’ DNA resection exposes ssDNA which is initially coated with RPA, and then replaced by Rad51, facilitated by the Rad52 protein. The search for a homologous template can begin once sufficient Rad51-ssDNA filament has been formed and strand invasion of the Rad51-ssDNA filament generates Holiday junctions which need to be resolved prior to cell division. (<italic>right</italic>) In H3-G34R cells, HR is defective. Checkpoint signaling is functional, but appears delayed with slower accumulation of γH2A possibly due to impaired nucleosome removal and delayed resection, which would limit the amount of Rad3 on RPA/DNA. Retention of γH2A indicates a defect in nucleosome removal and resection which in turn, could account for the delayed Rad52 foci formation in H3-G34R cells and likely delayed Holiday junction resolution following repair. H3-G34R cells show elevated chromosome segregation defects without defects in heterochromatin or kinetochore chromatin, suggestive that a delayed resolution of HR products contributes to genomic instability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27406.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27406.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-27406-fig8-v1"/></fig></p><p>How might H3-G34R mutation elicit these effects? One possibility may be via modulation of H3K36 methylation signal. However this seems unlikely given that cells that lack Set2 show no defects in chromosome segregation, and the HR defects that we uncovered in <italic>set2Δ</italic> cells are not epistatic to HR defects in H3-G34R cells. Another alternative is that the altered kinetics for γH2A phosphorylation and Rad52 foci formation during MMS treatment and recovery are indicative of chromatin defects in the H3-G34R cells. H2A phosphorylation occurs within the C-terminal tail of H2A, which projects out from the DNA and occupies a territory close to the N-terminal tail of H3 within the nucleosome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du and Briggs, 2010</xref>). Incorporation of an additional basic charge in the H3 tail close to where the H3 tail exits the H3 core domain may have conformational consequences and the H3-G34R tail may modulate kinase activity on the C-terminal H2A tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, checkpoint signaling is clearly functional in H3-G34R cells, even if it is delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Once damage has occurred, H3-G34R cells retain γH2A for longer than H3-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). It is thought that, in order for γH2A to be dephosphorylated, nucleosomes must first be removed from chromatin where they can be acted upon by phosphatases in free nuclear pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keogh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jablonowski et al., 2015</xref>). Retention of γH2A may stem from a defect in efficient chromatin remodeling, thereby preventing timely repair. In support of this, an H2A mutant that mimics γH2A shows decreased interaction with the chromatin remodeler Fun30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eapen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>H3-G34R cells show defects in HR-directed repair. Nucleosome removal from damaged chromatin facilitates resection and subsequent coating by RPA. After sufficient resection of DNA, Rad52 helps to facilitate the exchange from RPA-coated DNA to a Rad51-coated filament, to allow for homology searching and HR repair. The presence of a γH2A mimetic can inhibit the rate of resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eapen et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we show that H3-G34R mutants are specifically deficient for HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>) with prolonged retention of γH2A and delayed Rad52 foci formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c,d</xref>). It is possible that H3-G34R cells are defective in timely nucleosome removal and resection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Following this model, delayed HR-mediated repair in H3-G34R cells, or delayed resolution of replicative intermediates in undamaged H3-G34R cells, may allow accumulation of unresolved Holliday junctions prior to mitosis, and contribute to the chromosome segregation defects shown in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3d</xref>). We note that consistent with our findings, clearance of γH2A.X foci in human cells that lack H3K36me3 due to deletion of SETD2 is delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hacker et al., 2016</xref>), and such cells are defective for HR and exhibit genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pfister et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Clearly an important consideration is that our data was obtained in an organism where the whole population of histone H3 is mutant. In pHGG, only one allele of four that encodes H3.3 protein is affected in cells with 13 other genes that encode wild type H3.1 and H3.2 proteins. Unlike the H3K27M mutation that dominantly blocks PRC2 activity, G34R mutation does not dominantly affect K36 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, we suggest that the H3.3 G34R mutant may be greatly enriched at specific chromosomal loci. H3.3 is deposited into regions of constitutive heterochromatin including repetitive telomeric and pericentromeric domains, and at regions of high transcriptional activity through the activity of specialized chaperones (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kallappagoudar et al., 2015</xref>). These sites of H3.3 deposition are already subject to replicative stress. As cells traverse S phase, the replicative delay incurred by the presence of G34R mutant H3.3 at these sites and impaired resolution of replication intermediates could greatly enhance genomic instability and offer a potent source of genomic perturbations to facilitate tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macheret and Halazonetis, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain generation</title><p>Histone mutant strains were generated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mellone et al., 2003</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Julia Cooper (Reviewer #2).</p><p>All three reviewers think highly of your manuscript. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Below are the comments that the reviewers agree should be addressed. If you have questions, want to discuss the comments, or send a revision plan ahead of time, please let us know.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> - The purpose of this figure is to convince us that the levels of histones H3 and H4 are the same in a wild-type strain as in the strain with only the single H3/H4 locus. While the western looks nice, the authors should present quantification of three or more western blots.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> – Similar to the comment above, the other westerns in this manuscript should be presented in a quantitative fashion. These two panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>, are another important case – the quantification of the H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 levels in the G34R mutant. Why do <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> both show westerns analyzing H3K36me3 levels? What's the point of showing this twice? One representative western accompanied by quantification of multiple westerns would be best.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> – In this figure, there is no detectable H3K36me3 in the G34 mutant, whereas it's easily seen, although reduced, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Why is there this difference? Is the result variable? Some comment should be included. As for other westerns, quantification is needed for these results. (And please state what EV stands for.)</p><p>4) Several studies in both <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have shown that Set2 functions to repress antisense transcription. Examples of <italic>S. pombe</italic> papers are Nicolas et al. (2007) NSMB 14, 372 and Shim et al. (2012) Embo J. 31, 4375. The most recent paper for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> studies is Vankatesh et al. (2016) Nature Comm. As the authors performed strand-specific RNA-seq, they have the data to a set2 mutant and the G34R mutant. This would provide more information regarding the possible transcriptional differences between the two mutants.</p><p>5) The Results section about the transcriptional profiling describes the results, but it leaves us hanging. Can the authors state a conclusion at the end of the section? It appears that these results clearly show that the phenotypes caused by G34R are distinct from set2 and therefore are not likely caused by the reduction of H3K36me3. This is emphasized by opposite effects on the transcript levels of some genes (nicely demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). As the authors study a G34R set2 double mutant in later experiments, it would be interesting, although not necessary, to measure <italic>fah1</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>grt1</italic><sup>+</sup> mRNA levels in the G34R set2 double mutant.</p><p>6) Previous studies have shown that K36 acetylation and methylation peak at different times during the cell cycle (Pai et al., Nat Comm 2014; Li et al., Cell 2013) and that these events are correlated with DNA repair pathway choice. The consequences of H3-G34R on H3-K36 modification should thus be assessed in the context of cell cycle progression.</p><p>7) Please say more about the sub-subtelomeric regions affected differentially in the set2 mutant versus the G34R mutant – are they the Sgo2-associated 'knob' regions? It could be informative to check Sgo2 loading/function, particularly as it plays important roles at centromeres, which are likely sensitive sites for the replication difficulties conferred by G34R. ChIP-seq of phospho-H2A would also be informative, although it seems beyond the scope of the current studies.</p><p>8) As one of the key phenotypes of H3-G34R is genomic instability that may be related to DNA replication, characterization of cell cycle progression in this background should be provided. This includes an analysis of the effect of this alteration on the generation time, the cell cycle phase distribution, and the length of S phase (by flow cytometry, for instance). These data would provide valuable information for interpreting the defects observed in these cells. For instance, NHEJ is normally virtually dispensable in wild-type fission yeast (Ferreira and Cooper, Genes Dev 2004), which have a very short G1. However, as G34R appears to make NHEJ crucial for viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), one possibility is that cells are spending more time in G1, making NHEJ an important repair pathway. The authors can use their <italic>nda3-km311</italic> strain to synchronize cells for flow cytometry for cell cycle analysis.</p><p>9) The authors state in several places that RPA intensities are unaffected by G34R, but this is not clear from the images – in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>, it looks like, while wild type responds to damage with increased RPA intensity/number, this does not happen in G34R. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> as well, it looks like there are less RPA in G34R. Please define the quantitation method. It would be useful to look at RPA during mitosis, when it may coat ultrafine bridges left behind from unresolved replication problems. The affected H3 modifications may promote robust resection and RPA loading. This should be re-examined and ideally, a site specific DSB induced so that resection extent could be measured.</p><p>10) A role for methylation of H3-K36 by Set2 has been identified in suppressing homologous recombination in the fission yeast (Pai et al., Nat Comm 2014). This contrasts with the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, which show a reduction in HR efficiency in <italic>set2Δ</italic>. The authors do not address this difference, which is significant for the interpretation of the results for H3-G34R.</p><p>11) The HR assay used in this work involves the integration of a linear PCR fragment containing the <italic>leu1</italic> gene. Given that the H3-G34R background displays increased replications stress and that cells can use both NHEJ and HR pathways to repair double-stranded DNA breaks, it is important to demonstrate that 1) the majority of these events occur at the chromosomal locus and/or 2) an NHEJ mutant such as <italic>ku70Δ</italic> does not alter the HR efficiency measured in this assay. This is particularly relevant as a previous study using a human cell line has reported that H3-K36 dimethylation enhances the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks by NHEJ (Fnu et al., PNAS 2011).</p><p>12) It appears that there may be different sets of phenotypes induced by H3-G34R: 1) those related to H3-K36 modification/Set2, which may include the effect on genome stability, and 2) and those that the authors state are unlikely to be due to modulation of H3-K36, such as the defect in chromosome segregation. The possibility that H3-G34R affects chromosome stability and repair choice by mechanisms other than through H3-K36 is interesting, and while this is discussed, the reader would benefit from a more clear presentation of these potentially distinct functions.</p><p>13) In addition to the westerns, the number of replicates for some experiments is not always clear. Please provide that information and the relevant statistical analysis.</p><p>14) The protocol for <italic>orp1-4</italic> utilization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> is confusing compared with text and Methods.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27406.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] 1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> - The purpose of this figure is to convince us that the levels of histones H3 and H4 are the same in a wild-type strain as in the strain with only the single H3/H4 locus.

As suggested, we ran replicate westerns for K36me2 and K36me3 (using the Abs used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>/C) including 2 biological replicates for H3-WT and H3-G34R strains for quantitation.

Examples of S. pombe papers are Nicolas et al. (2007) NSMB 14, 372 and Shim et al. (2012) Embo J. 31, 4375. The most recent paper for S. cerevisiae studies is Vankatesh et al. (2016) Nature Comm. As the authors performed strand-specific RNA-seq, they have the data to a set2 mutant and the G34R mutant. This would provide more information regarding the possible transcriptional differences between the two mutants.</italic> </p><p>We assessed antisense transcripts in H3-WT, H3-G34R and set2D, and show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> plots for antisense and sense transcripts that are differentially regulated in set2Δ compared to H3-WT (upper panel) and H3-G34R compared to H3-WT (lower panel). Like set2Δ, G34R shows accumulation of antisense transcripts. Lists of differentially regulated antisense transcripts are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref> (antisense tab).</p><p><italic>5) The Results section about the transcriptional profiling describes the results, but it leaves us hanging. Can the authors state a conclusion at the end of the section? It appears that these results clearly show that the phenotypes caused by G34R are distinct from set2 and therefore are not likely caused by the reduction of H3K36me3. This is emphasized by opposite effects on the transcript levels of some genes (nicely demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). As the authors study a G34R set2 double mutant in later experiments, it would be interesting, although not necessary, to measure fah1<sup>+</sup> and grt1<sup>+</sup> mRNA levels in the G34R set2 double mutant.</italic> </p><p>Interpretation of the transcriptional profiling results is complex. As stated, there is some overlap with Set2-mediated control which is now reinforced by the data on accumulation of antisense transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), but also differences as evidenced by opposite regulation of transcription within sub-subtelomeric domains. The additional experiments suggested by reviewers have now helped clarify the situation- thank you. As suggested we have included analysis of <italic>fah1<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>grt1<sup>+</sup></italic> mRNA levels in <italic>set2Δ</italic> H3-G34R double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and find that the results mimic data obtained from <italic>set2Δ</italic>. From these additional analyses we conclude that suppression of antisense transcripts appears to be linked to trimethylation of K36 (reduced or lost in H3-G34R and <italic>set2Δ</italic>), and that repression of sub-subtelomeric domains may be linked to dimethylation of K36 in H3-G34R, as it is abolished in <italic>set2Δ</italic> or compound <italic>set2Δ</italic> H3-G34R mutants.</p><p><italic>6) Previous studies have shown that K36 acetylation and methylation peak at different times during the cell cycle (Pai et al., Nat Comm 2014; Li et al., Cell 2013) and that these events are correlated with DNA repair pathway choice. The consequences of H3-G34R on H3-K36 modification should thus be assessed in the context of cell cycle progression.</italic> </p><p>We harvested H3-WT and H3-G34R mutant cells arrested by <italic>cdc10</italic> (G1), HU (S phase), <italic>nda3</italic> (metaphase) and <italic>cdc25-22</italic> (G2) mutation / treatment and monitored K36me2 and me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Quantification of 3 westerns from two biological replicates for each condition revealed that at all cell cycle points, K36me3 was reduced in H3-G34R mutants, and that H3K36me2 was elevated in H3-G34R. Interestingly, G1 arrested (<italic>cdc10</italic>) cells showed increased K36me3 for both H3-WT and H3-G34R cells, suggestive that the cell cycle regulation of Set2 function is maintained in G34R cells, even though G34R mutation generally diminishes Set2 function. We were not able to easily measure K36Ac as all tested antibodies are unable to recognize K36Ac on the G34R tail so this was not assessed through the cell cycle.</p><p><italic>7) Please say more about the sub-subtelomeric regions affected differentially in the set2 mutant versus the G34R mutant – are they the Sgo2-associated 'knob' regions? It could be informative to check Sgo2 loading/function, particularly as it plays important roles at centromeres, which are likely sensitive sites for the replication difficulties conferred by K34R. ChIP-seq of phospho-H2A would also be informative, although it seems beyond the scope of the current studies.</italic> </p><p>Yes, the sub-subtelomeric regions are the Sgo2-associated ‘knob’ regions. We plan to include Sgo2 ChIPs in a follow up manuscript comparing H3-G34R and V mutant phenotypes.</p><p><italic>8) As one of the key phenotypes of H3-G34R is genomic instability that may be related to DNA replication, characterization of cell cycle progression in this background should be provided. This includes an analysis of the effect of this alteration on the generation time, the cell cycle phase distribution, and the length of S phase (by flow cytometry, for instance). These data would provide valuable information for interpreting the defects observed in these cells. For instance, NHEJ is normally virtually dispensable in wild-type fission yeast (Ferreira and Cooper, Genes Dev 2004), which have a very short G1. However, as G34R appears to make NHEJ crucial for viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), one possibility is that cells are spending more time in G1, making NHEJ an important repair pathway. The authors can use their nda3-km311 strain to synchronize cells for flow cytometry for cell cycle analysis.</italic> </p><p>We monitored generation time during exponential growth and found that H3-WT have a doubling time of 180 min (+/- 10 min), H3-G34R 201 min (+/- 4 min), and <italic>set2Δ</italic> 194 min (+/- 8 min) in rich media at 32<sup>o</sup>C. We also performed cell cycle synchronization and release using <italic>cdc10</italic> (G1 arrest) and <italic>nda3</italic> (mitotic) blocks and used flow cytometry to monitor cell cycle progression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <italic>cdc10</italic> released H3-G34R cells exhibit delay in completion of S phase. We were not able to decipher if G1 was extended as fission yeast do not undergo cytokinesis until G1, which hampers interpretation of FACS.</p><p><italic>9) The authors state in several places that RPA intensities are unaffected by K34R, but this is not clear from the images – in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>, it looks like, while wild type responds to damage with increased RPA intensity/number, this does not happen in G34R. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> as well, it looks like there are less RPA in G34R. Please define the quantitation method. It would be useful to look at RPA during mitosis, when it may coat ultrafine bridges left behind from unresolved replication problems. The affected H3 modifications may promote robust resection and RPA loading. This should be re-examined and ideally, a site specific DSB induced so that resection extent could be measured.</italic> </p><p>The data presented was not the best choice of images. We have re-assessed RPA foci in cells using more robust fixation (3% formaldehyde) and have replaced images in what is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>. For the initial submission we had manually counted several hundred cells for each genotype for foci and repeated the complete experiment 2-3 times. The images obtained with formaldehyde fixation better represent the results. We attempted to use automated counting of cells bearing foci, but this was complicated since cells bear distinct numbers of foci and of different sizes, but limited data obtained through this approach supported that there was no difference in RPA foci intensity between MMS treated strains. In the absence of a system to quickly assess RPA loading dynamics at a defined break by ChIP, we can just conclude that there is no defect in initial detection of damage in H3-G34R cells as defined by intact checkpoint responses and γH2A signaling. Instead, there appears to be a defect at a later stage of HR damage repair prior to Rad51 and 52 loading.</p><p>As suggested, we monitored RPA-GFP localization in H3-G34R cells during mitosis, using cells synchronized by <italic>cdc10</italic> block and release, and found evidence for RPA fluorescence linking DAPI stained masses in cells enriched for anaphase. This is an exciting result, as it reinforces that G34R confers replicative difficulties that may contribute to chromosome segregation defects seen in these strains. This data is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D</xref>. We were unable to quantify numbers of late anaphase cells displaying this phenotype since we could not co-stain with tubulin antibodies and still see the faint GFP signal on anaphase bridges due to bleed through issues. However, cells displaying these anaphase bridges were relatively easy to detect, suggestive that they occur at relatively high frequency.</p><p><italic>10) A role for methylation of H3-K36 by Set2 has been identified in suppressing homologous recombination in the fission yeast (Pai et al., Nat Comm 2014). This contrasts with the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, which show a reduction in HR efficiency in set2Δ. The authors do not address this difference, which is significant for the interpretation of the results for H3-G34R.</italic> </p><p>We have been concerned by this difference, which was the stimulus for assessing HR in 3xH3/H4 <italic>set2Δ</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Pai et al. 2014 assessed frequencies of gene conversion using an engineered non-essential minichromosome with an HO-break site. The authors monitor 4 different markers for loss, and interpret combinations of marker loss as NHEJ-repaired, Gene conversion, loss of heterozygosity and loss of the chromosome. However, due to the nature of the assay, there are many possible causes of apparent marker loss which may cloud interpretation. Our simple and direct approach to measure HR relies on a site-specific gain of marker function at a defined locus. We note that we have just assessed HR at one site, and it is quite feasible that distinct outcomes may be obtained by assessing HR at different genomic regions. We sought to determine if the difference in data was caused by the different assays or possibly by strain differences between the <italic>set2Δ</italic> backgrounds. Using <italic>set2Δ</italic> strains from Tim Humphrey’s lab that were used in Pai et al., we monitored HR using our assay, and found that HR activity was suppressed similar to the results obtained with our <italic>set2Δ</italic> 3xH3/H4 strains. This data is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>. We conclude that the difference in interpretation lies with the assays used.</p><p><italic>11) The HR assay used in this work involves the integration of a linear PCR fragment containing the leu1 gene. Given that the H3-G34R background displays increased replications stress and that cells can use both NHEJ and HR pathways to repair double-stranded DNA breaks, it is important to demonstrate that 1) the majority of these events occur at the chromosomal locus and/or 2) an NHEJ mutant such as ku70Δ does not alter the HR efficiency measured in this assay. This is particularly relevant as a previous study using a human cell line has reported that H3-K36 dimethylation enhances the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks by NHEJ (Fnu et al., PNAS 2011).</italic> </p><p>The HR assay was designed so that only recombinants at the correct locus would yield <italic>leu1+</italic> colonies, since only a 576 bp PCR fragment of <italic>leu1</italic> was used. We have confirmed this by sequencing <italic>leu1</italic>+ in ~ 40 “repaired” strains from different genetic backgrounds and all were correctly targeted. We were interested to see the effect of loss of NHEJ function in our assay, so tested strains deficient in Ku70. Perhaps as expected, these strains showed a large increase in HR frequency in our assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), as HR is now the sole method of DNA break repair. Discussion of these results has been incorporated within the text.</p><p><italic>12) It appears that there may be different sets of phenotypes induced by H3-G34R: 1) those related to H3-K36 modification/Set2, which may include the effect on genome stability, and 2) and those that the authors state are unlikely to be due to modulation of H3-K36, such as the defect in chromosome segregation. The possibility that H3-G34R affects chromosome stability and repair choice by mechanisms other than through H3-K36 is interesting, and while this is discussed, the reader would benefit from a more clear presentation of these potentially distinct functions.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the phenotype of H3-G34R mutants is complex and very interesting. We hope that the additional analyses included in this revision have helped to define which aspects of G34R function are possibly linked to modification of H3K36, such as a requirement for trimethylation of K36 for suppression of antisense gene transcription. We are very excited to see the localization of RPA to anaphase bridges in mitotic cells, as this reinforces that replicative defects likely contribute to the chromosome segregation defects in H3-G34R mutants. However, in the absence of separation of function mutants, it is very difficult to determine whether retention or accumulation of K36 dimethylation in H3-G34R cells is linked to the replicative defects, or whether reduction in K36 Ac is a contributory factor. What is clear is that further analysis is required to fully understand the behavior of H3-G34R, but we believe that our work represents a highly significant advance in characterization of this mutant.</p><p><italic>13) In addition to the westerns, the number of replicates for some experiments is not always clear.
