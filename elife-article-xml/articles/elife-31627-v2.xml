Single-unit recording evidence for such a role is sparse, however, and it remains uncertain how that role relates to the disparate functions described for anatomic subdivisions of the STN. Here we address that gap in knowledge using non-human primates and a task that distinguishes reactive and proactive action inhibition, switching and skeletomotor functions. We found that specific subsets of STN neurons have activity consistent with causal roles in reactive action stopping or switching. Importantly, these neurons were strictly segregated to a ventromedial region of STN. Neurons in other subdivisions encoded task dimensions such as movement <italic>per se</italic> and proactive control. We propose that the involvement of STN in reactive control is restricted to its ventromedial portion, further implicating this STN subdivision in impulse control disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>non-human primate</kwd><kwd>stop-signal task</kwd><kwd>reaching</kwd><kwd>inhibitory control</kwd><kwd>basal ganglia</kwd><kwd>neurophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS091853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Robert S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS070865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Robert S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS076405-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Robert S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-unit activity consistent with a selective causal role in reactive stopping or switching behaviors is found only in the most ventromedial subregion of the subthalamic nucleus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although considerable effort has been directed to identify the neural circuits involved in action initiation, much less attention has been given to neural substrates of response suppression. The ability to inhibit inappropriate action is an important component of executive functions necessary for adaptive behavior. Because deficient forms of response inhibition are associated with many impulse control disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Robbins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bari and Robbins, 2013</xref>), a better understanding of the inhibition brain-network should help improve treatments for those patients. One of the most common paradigms for investigating inhibitory control is the stop-signal task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schall and Godlove, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Verbruggen and Logan, 2008</xref>). Subjects are required to initiate a movement in response to a Go signal, but in a small fraction of trials, a subsequent Stop signal instructs subjects to withhold the impending movement. This kind of reactive stopping becomes increasingly more difficult as the time interval between Go and Stop signals lengthens. Stop-signal task performance is well explained by a race model in which the Go and Stop signals trigger independent processes that compete to be the first to finish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Boucher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Logan et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Verbruggen and Logan, 2009</xref>). Recent studies have suggested that reactive stopping behavior is actually composed of a cascade of movement-suppressive processes that depend on transmission of activity along multiple brain pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pouget et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schmidt and Berke, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Neuroimaging and lesion studies have posited a critical role for the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in stopping actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aron and Poldrack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aron et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sharp et al., 2010</xref>). Because the STN stands at the crossroad between âhyperdirectâ and indirect basal ganglia (BG) pathways, this structure occupies an unique position from which it is hypothesized to block Go-related activity conveyed by the BG direct pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mink, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nambu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nambu et al., 2002</xref>). Specifically, STN lesions result in impulsive and perseverative behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Baunez et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wiener et al., 2008</xref>), with a reduced ability to suppress action in the stop-signal task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eagle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Obeso et al., 2014</xref>). In parkinsonian patients, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of STN has a variety of effects on the stopping of pre-planned or on-going actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mirabella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Obeso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Swann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">van den Wildenberg et al., 2006</xref>), and beta frequency local field potentials are modulated by inhibitory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alegre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bastin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Benis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">KÃ¼hn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ray et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although the STN is commonly modeled as a key node in action suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nambu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frank, 2006</xref>), direct electrophysiologic evidence remains weak. Recent single-unit recordings from rats showed that success or failure on the stop-signal task correlated with the timing of STN responses evoked by the stop-signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). The picture is far from complete, however. These short-latency STN responses, for example, were not selective to the Stop cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mallet et al., 2016</xref>), but were also present for Go cues that prompted a switch in behavior (i.e. the selection and initiation of an alternate action). This illustrates the fact that paradigms used to study action suppression rarely control for potentially confounding factors such as the attentional detection of the stop cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Erika-Florence et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hampshire et al., 2010</xref>) or behavioral switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crone et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Isoda and Hikosaka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Isoda and Hikosaka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rushworth et al., 2002</xref>). Consequently, the degree to which STN neuronal activity is involved specifically in response inhibition remains unclear. Indeed, one non-human primate study reported that a sub-population of STN neurons exhibit a change of activity when an animal is required to switch from an automatic (i.e., pre-potent) action to one guided by sensory instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Isoda and Hikosaka, 2008</xref>). Such a mechanism could account for many of the previous observations.</p><p>In addition, it has been unclear how these hypothesized roles for STN in action inhibition relate to the known organization of STN into anatomically and functionally distinct territoriesÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nambu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Parent and Hazrati, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hamani et al., 2004</xref>). The posterior-dorsal-lateral STN is interconnected with a basal ganglia circuit devoted to skeletomotor function, whereas associative- and limbic-related territories are found in progressively more anterior, ventral and medial regions of the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haynes and Haber, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mettler and Stern, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Monakow et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shink et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wichmann et al., 1994</xref>). We predicted that activity correlated with movement inhibition would be concentrated in the anterior ventromedial regions of the STN known to receive direct afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Inase et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">KÃ¼nzle, 1978</xref>) from stop-associated regions of prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aron et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>To determine if the STN conveys signals consistent with its predicted role in action suppression, we trained two monkeys to perform a novel stop-signal task that disentangled processes that are often confounded in studies of inhibitory control. We hypothesized that a subset of STN neurons exhibits a short-latency change in activity consistent with a selective role in stopping. Here we tested that hypothesis by studying single unit activity in the STN while monkeys performed action inhibition and switching tasks. Our results support an active role for the STN in stopping, and refine current theories by implicating a discrete anterior ventromedial region of the STN in inhibitory control, further confirming that this site is critical for impulse control disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Baup et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mallet et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral suppression of on-going action</title><p>Two monkeys (C and H) were trained to perform a Go/NoGo-countermanding arm movement task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that combines two paradigms commonly used to investigate the neuropsychology of inhibitory functions: the stop-signal task and the Go/NoGo task. Specifically, early in a trial, during a start position hold period, an animal was instructed how to respond to an upcoming âtriggerâ stimulus: in 50% of trials a Go cue was presented (green stimulus; referred to hereafter as <italic>go</italic> trials) instructing animals to respond to the trigger stimulus by initiating a targeted reaching movement; in the other 50% of trials a NoGo cue (red stimulus; referred to as <italic>no-go</italic> trials) instructed animals to withhold a response to the trigger and continue holding the hand at the start position. On a minority of trials (25% each of Go and NoGo conditions), the trigger stimulus was followed by a switch-signal (blue stimulus) instructing the animal to countermand the already-triggered nascent response. If the switch-signal occurred during a Go trial, the animal had to suddenly suppress the triggered movement and hold the initial position (referred as <italic>switch-stop</italic> trials). In these trials, the switch-signal was equivalent to a stop-signal in a traditional stop-signal task. Alternatively, if the switch-signal occurred during a NoGo trial, the animal was required to rapidly initiate a reaching movement (referred to as <italic>switch-go</italic> trials). Thus, the same blue switch-signal had different meanings (stop vs. go) depending on which type of trial it was used in. The target for reaching movements was presented at one and the same location for all trial types and a food reward was delivered at the end of each successful trial.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31627.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Go/NoGo-countermanding task.</title><p>Temporal sequence of visual displays for the four trial types. After the animal initiated a trial by moving the hand-controlled cursor (+) to the start position (gray circle), one of two possible instruction cues (selected at random between trials) were presented briefly. A green cue indicated a Go condition, while a red cue indicated a NoGo condition. Depending the condition, the animal was then required to respond to the Trigger stimulus by moving to the target (<italic>go trials</italic>) or continuing to hold the cursor in the start position (<italic>no-go trials</italic>). On a small fraction of trials (25%), the Trigger stimulus was followed after a variable delay (the switch-signal delay, SSD) by a switch-signal (blue cue) that instructed the animal to countermand the initially planned response.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-31627-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>As is typical for stop-signal tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Scangos and Stuphorn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mirabella et al., 2011</xref>), median RTs for <italic>switch-stop</italic> trials in which the monkeys failed to suppress the response (referred as <italic>stop-failure</italic> trials) were faster than median RTs detected for <italic>go</italic> trials (Mann-Whitney U-test, p&lt;0.001). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the RT distributions calculated across sessions for <italic>stop-failure</italic> trials (C: medianÂ =Â 555Â Â±Â 64 ms; H: medianÂ =Â 502Â Â±Â 77 ms) were shifted to the left with respect to the RT distributions of <italic>go</italic> trials (C: medianÂ =Â 580Â Â±Â 58 ms; H: medianÂ =Â 516Â Â±Â 93 ms). Thus, consistent with the race model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Boucher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Logan et al., 1984</xref>), reaching movements that monkeys could not stop despite the presentation of switch-signal were largely those that had the shortest RTs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the incidence of <italic>stop-failure</italic> trials increased (inhibition functions: linear regressions, p&lt;0.05) as a function of the delay between the go trigger signal and the switch-signal (i.e., the <italic>switch-signal delay</italic>, SSD). In other words, the longer the SSD, the more difficult it became for an animal to stop the nascent triggered movement. This kind of behavior is commonly modeled by a race model in which Stop and Go processes compete to be the first to finish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Logan et al., 1984</xref>). For each individual behavioral session, we used a race model to estimate the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT, see Materials and Methods), which is an estimate of the maximum delay within which a triggered response can be stopped successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Congdon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Band et al., 2003</xref>). Distributions of SSRTs estimated session by session from each monkeysâ behavior are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We calculated that the average SSRT during our task was around 160 ms (C: medianÂ =Â 169Â Â±Â 37 ms; H: medianÂ =Â 152Â Â±Â 47 ms). The SSRTs had similar distributions for the two animals (Mann-Whitney U-test, p=0.14), but were slightly longer than those reported in earlier studies that used a manual stop-signal task [~140 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Scangos and Stuphorn, 2010</xref>);~150 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mirabella et al., 2011</xref>)]. The difference is likely attributable to higher-level cognitive aspects of our novel paradigm, in which monkeys had to integrate different task events to identify the appropriate behavioural response (i.e., stopping or going).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31627.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Estimation of the time required to inhibit the planned response.</title><p>Subject performance in our version of the stop-signal task.

To determine whether and how the STN was involved in action suppression, we investigated Stop-related activity in this sample of neurons by comparing the firing rate during successful <italic>switch-stop</italic> trials with the firing rate recorded during those <italic>go</italic> trials in which the response would have been stopped if the switch-signal had been presented at the equivalent SSDs (referred to as latency-matched trials, see Materials and methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref> show the activity, aligned to switch-stop signal, for two example STN neurons. We compared activity between switch-stop and go conditions using a sliding window procedure combined with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) reflected the degree to which firing rates differed reliably between conditions. The logic of our task set two criteria a single neuronâs activity was required to meet to qualify as being involved in the stop process. First, the activity must differ between trials in which a response is initiated versus when it is cancelled. Second, this difference (i.e. the neural cancellation time) must occur within the SSRT; otherwise, it would be too late to mediate response inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hanes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">ParÃ© and Hanes, 2003</xref>). Following this line of reasoning, the discharge rates for both example STN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref>) diverged significantly after switch-stop signal presentation (2-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, p&lt;0.01). The evolution of AUC values over time indicated that the Stop-related changes in activity occurred within the SSRT, with a neural cancellation time preceding the behavioral response inhibition (-48 ms and -34 ms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, respectively). Inspection revealed distinct response patterns in the two example neurons, however. The activity shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> exhibited a short-latency phasic increase in discharge during switch-stop trials at times suitable for an active role in stopping. We tested for this type of âswitch-stopâ activity as a significant decrease of AUC values (p&lt;0.01) during the SSRT (<italic>blue shaded</italic> area of AUC curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Other STN neurons showed a pre-movement buildup of activity during <italic>go</italic> trials and that buildup was truncated abruptly during the SSRT of <italic>switch-stop</italic> trials (e.g., <italic>red shaded</italic> area of AUC curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Neurons with this type of activity were termed âMovementâ cells because the pattern of activity approximated what might be observed in motor output structures such as primary motor cortex. Movement cells were characterized by a significance increase in AUC values (p&lt;0.01). Within the race model framework, the switch-stop pattern was consistent with an active participation in the stop process whereas the movement-like pattern more likely reflected involvement in successful termination of the competing go process.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31627.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Response of STN neurons to switch-stop signal.</title><p>The activity of two exemplar neurons that were classified as a (<bold>A</bold>) Switch-stop cell and (<bold>B</bold>) Movement cell.

This paradigm imposes tight timing constraints in that a neural response must occur within the calculated SSRT for it to contribute to stopping. More than one-third of our STN neurons met this temporal criterion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Among those cells, the most common response pattern was a movement-related activation that decayed rapidly in response to the stop-signal, similar to the activity observed in agonist muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Notably, the second response pattern consisted of a phasic increase in discharge in response to the stop-signal. The co-existence of these two response patterns is consistent with roles for the STN in both the execution of movement and stopping movement (discussed in more detail below). The race model, in its simplest form, predicts that Stop-related activity should precede or at least coincide with the truncated buildup of movement-related activity. We found, however, that the mean neural cancellation time for Movement cells was slightly earlier than that for Stop cells. Moreover, Stop-related activity preceded the earliest stop-related truncation of EMG activity by a mere 10 ms. One potential conclusion is that the exact position of the STN in models of reactive stopping may require modification contingent on identification of brain areas with earlier Stop-related activities. An alternative interpretation, that STN Stop-related activity is transmitted to motor centers via a fast-conducting pathway, is discussed below.</p><p>The classic stop-signal task, when used by itself as in previous neurophysiologic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aron and Poldrack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Scangos and Stuphorn, 2010</xref>), has the potential to conflate several distinct cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Erika-Florence et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hampshire et al., 2010</xref>). First, because the stop-signal is both infrequent (15â30% of trials) and behaviorally relevant, some neural responses to the stop-signal may reflect attentional processing of an unexpected visual cue. Indeed, the STN is part of the network in which visual attention and the salience of events are implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Baunez and Robbins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Baunez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">BoÄkovÃ¡ et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schmalbach et al., 2014</xref>). Second, stop-signal task performance requires several aspects of executive control including changes in cognitive set, enhancement of sensory responsiveness, facilitation of a desired response and performance monitoring. Thus, some phasic responses to a Stop-signal may reflect switching-related sub-processes.</p><p>Our stop-signal paradigm disentangled those factors by presenting an identical visual stimulus to signal unexpected commands either to suppress an incipient action or to initiate a reaching movement. <italic>Switch-stop and switch-go</italic> trial types were similarly infrequent and behaviorally relevant and both required a behavioral switch from habitual to controlled responding. Comparison of STN activities between the two types of switch trials identified two categories of short-latency responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although standard criteria would have classified all as playing an active role in stopping, 43% of cells with short-latency stop responses responded similarly or more strongly with sudden action initiation in <italic>switch-go</italic> trials. Quite consistent with the role in attentional or switching processes proposed by Isoda and Hikosaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Isoda and Hikosaka, 2008</xref>), these STN neurons modified their activity when an animal had to shift behavior rapidly from default to a more attention-demanding controlled behavior.</p><p>The second subset of STN neurons were activated selectively only when an animal had to cancel the on-going action on <italic>switch-stop</italic> trials. These cells did not overlap, categorically or anatomically, with the STN neurons most likely to be involved directly in the activation of antagonist muscles, namely those responsive to proprioceptive stimulation and concentrated in the skeletomotor territory of the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nambu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Parent and Hazrati, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baron et al., 2002</xref>). Together, these results provide consistent support for the presence of a selective encoding of reactive stopping in a subset of STN neurons after controlling for a range of potential confounds.</p><p>Few previous studies have examined STN single-unit activity during performance of a response inhibition-type task. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schmidt et al. (2013)</xref> described a population of STN neurons in the rat that responded at short-latency to a Stop cue. Notably, unlike the present study, those neurons also responded at roughly equal latency and magnitude to the Go cue, which was presented on all trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mallet et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, Schmidt et al. provided evidence that stop-selective activity appeared in an anatomically-restricted region of the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr), a BG output nucleus located downstream from the STN. Many factors differed between the Schmidt study and ours, including species, tasks, and collection and analysis methods, any combination of which may account for the differences between results. In a recent study in human subjects undergoing DBS surgery for Parkinsonâs disease, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Benis et al. (2016)</xref> described distinct sub-populations of STN neurons that responded selectively and at short latency to <italic>Stop</italic> and <italic>Go</italic> task signals, similar to our findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Isoda and Hikosaka (2008)</xref> recorded from the macaque STN during a task that required animals to switch behaviors between familiar and unexpected oculomotor responses, somewhat similar to our switch-go type trials. Like us, they found a distinct sub-population of STN neurons that responded selectively and at short latency to the unexpected switch stimulus. No previous study, however, dissociated STN activities related to reactive stopping, reactive switching and proactive (NoGo) response control, tested for potential overlap between stop-related activity and skeletomotor responsiveness, or addressed whether stop-related activity is concentrated in a sub-region of the STN.</p><p>Finally, similar movement- and stop-related response patterns have been found in frontal eye cortex and superior colliculus of macaques performing an eye movement countermanding task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schall and Godlove, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hanes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">ParÃ© and Hanes, 2003</xref>). Although the STN includes an oculomotor territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Matsumura et al., 1992</xref>), we found no evidence that the Stop-related activity identified here actually reflected movements of the eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Use of the Go/NoGo task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bari and Robbins, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dalley et al., 2011</xref>) also allowed us to study STN involvement in the sustained (âproactiveâ) maintenance of a movement-suppressive behavioral set between the time of NoGo instruction and the presentation of a trigger stimulus seconds later. Fully a quarter of STN neurons exhibited sustained activity preferentially after a NoGo cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These cells were not confined to a particular territory of the STN, a result that contrasted sharply with the anatomically-restricted location of <italic>stop</italic> cells. The distribution of NoGo cells throughout the STN implies that many functional sub-circuits through the STN are activated during this behavior. It is likely that NoGo activity, as identified here, actually reflects of a variety of independent cognitive and motor processes, analyses of which will require further refinement of behavioral paradigms. Previous studies have implicated the striatum and the striato-pallidal-STN âindirectâ pathway in proactive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Casey et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kelly et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Smittenaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vink et al., 2005</xref>). Although the present results do not address that possibility, they do argue that proactive and reactive movement suppressions involve categorically different neural mechanisms. Not only were <italic>Stop</italic> and NoGo activities distributed differently within the STN, but the presence of NoGo activity in a single-unit had no predictive power over whether that unit also responded preferentially to <italic>switch-stop</italic> or <italic>switch-go</italic> signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The STN receives topographically-organized glutamatergic inputs from most regions of the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nambu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haynes and Haber, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Monakow et al., 1978</xref>). Among these, the inferior frontal cortex (IFC; potential homologue in macaques: area 45) has been linked closely to reactive stopping based on lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aron et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Swick et al., 2008</xref>) and stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Verbruggen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wessel et al., 2013</xref>) studies. Although the specific topography of the IFCâtoâSTN projection has yet to be determined, tract-tracing studies indicate that most prefrontal areas [i.e., ventromedial, orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate and dorsal prefrontal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haynes and Haber, 2013</xref>)] project to ventral and medial portions of the STN that encompass the regions where <italic>Stop</italic> and <italic>Switch</italic> cells were located. This portion of the STN also receives strong GABAergic inputs from the rostral-medial external pallidum (part of the BG associative circuit) and ventral pallidum (of the BG limbic circuit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haynes and Haber, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shink et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Karachi et al., 2005</xref>), and additional glutamatergic inputs from the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus, also a limbic circuit-connected nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sadikot et al., 1992</xref>). Consistent with its afferent connectivity, this ventromedial region contained few cells with Movement-like activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), making it unlikely that Stop and Go processes are compared locally within the ventromedial STN.</p><p>What efferent pathway allows stop-related activity in the STN to inhibit motor execution at short latency? The present results do not address that question directly, but they do put considerable constraints on the viable answers. A commonly accepted model states that the first efferent step from the STN is a highly divergent projection to the output nuclei of the BG [i.e., internal pallidum (GPi) and SNr] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aron and Poldrack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). Divergence in this pathway is said to be crucial for the broadcast of stop-related activity from the associative/limbic territory of the STN to GABAergic neurons in the skeletomotor and oculomotor territories of GPi and SNr, respectively. The need for divergence at some point in the circuit is reinforced by evidence that reactive stopping behavior is associated with an apparently global suppression of motor and even cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wessel and Aron, 2017</xref>). Limited evidence supports divergence in the STN-GPi/SNr pathway, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hazrati and Parent, 1992</xref>), while multiple lines of evidence indicate instead that this axonal projection is highly specific and topographically organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shink et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Smith et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kolomiets et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kelly and Strick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Miyachi et al., 2006</xref>). Potential alternative pathways include the direct STN projection to the tegmental pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shink et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hazrati and Parent, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Parent and Smith, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nakano et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Smith et al., 1990</xref>) as well as the disynaptic STN-GPi/SNr-PPN pathway. It is interesting to note in this respect that selective activation of cholinergic neurons of the ventral PPN triggers a short-latency and wide-spread inhibition of motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Takakusaki et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Takakusaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kohyama et al., 1998</xref>) in addition to a range of alerting and behavior-modulating functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mena-Segovia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gut and Winn, 2016</xref>). Further study is required to clarify the degree of divergence and specific sites of termination of projections from the ventromedial STN to the PPN and GPi/SNr. And, as mentioned in the Introduction, it is quite likely that reactive stopping such as that studied here depends on a cascade of movement-suppressive processes and multiple brain pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pouget et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schmidt and Berke, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Also worth discussing is our frequent observation in the STN of peri-movement increases in activity that were truncated immediately following a stop-signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), activity termed movement-like due to its similarity in form to agonist muscle EMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Making sense of this type of activity is complicated by the widely-held view that the STN influences motor control centers primarily via direct excitation of the GABAergic output neurons of the BG (in GPi and SNr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nambu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wichmann et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamada and DeLong, 1992</xref>). When transmitted via this pathway, peri-movement increases in STN activity should be movement-suppressive, and the sudden stop-related truncation of activity, movement-facilitator â both of which effects are antithetic to the roles hypothesized for the STN in reactive stopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aron and Poldrack, 2006</xref>). One recently-proposed solution is that another STN efferent pathway, which inhibits BG output neurons via a disynaptic pathway through the external pallidum (GPe), may dominate function of the circuit in certain behavioral contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jantz et al., 2017</xref>). That, however, does not address the central challenge of explaining the simultaneous presence in the STN of <italic>Stop</italic>-related and movement-related activity patterns. Answers to this puzzle may come from research into the organization of projections from STN subregions, the activity of distinct STN neuronal sub-types during stop-task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sato et al., 2000</xref>), or how this seemingly-paradoxical combination of STN activities is interpreted in downstream nuclei.</p><p>The present results concur in general terms with existing lines of evidence that implicate the ventromedial STN in various clinical disorders of inhibitory control. Case studies have shown that DBS in the ventral STN produces greater effects on inhibitory control behaviors than does stimulation in the dorsal STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greenhouse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hershey et al., 2010</xref>). In fact, this anatomic location is a current target for STN-DBS to treat severe obsessive compulsive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mallet et al., 2008</xref>), which is considered a disorder of inhibitory control. And local micro-infusions of bicuculline (a GABA antagonist) only into that part of the STN induced stereotypies and hyperactive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karachi et al., 2009</xref>). The present study is the first to show that single unit encoding of reactive stopping also is restricted to the anterior ventromedial STN. It is important to acknowledge that inhibitory control is a general term that encompasses a disparate array of behavioral faculties and subservient brain circuits. Our results reinforce the view that the ventromedial STN is an important node in one of those brain circuits, but the range of roles played by this circuit in specific behaviors and behavioral disorders remains to be determined. It is interesting to note that activity related to rapid response switching (i.e., <italic>Switch</italic> cells) was also confined to the same anatomic hotspot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Further research is needed to determine whether the <italic>Stop-</italic> and <italic>Switch</italic>-related activities identified here reflect truly distinct processes or rather graded mixtures of signals reflecting different aspects of reactive control.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Two rhesus monkeys (monkey C, 8 kg, male; and monkey H, 6 kg, female) were used in this study.

When animals were not in active use, they were housed in individual primate cages in an air-conditioned room where water was always available. The monkeysâ access to food was regulated to increase their motivation to perform the task. Throughout the study, the animals were monitored daily by an animal research technician or veterinary technician for evidence of disease or injury and body weight was documented weekly. If a body weightÂ &lt;90% of baseline was observed, the food regulation was stopped.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Apparatus</title><p>Monkeys were trained to execute reaching movements with the left arm using a torquable exoskeleton (KINARM, BKIN Technologies, Kingston, Ontario, Canada). This device had hinge joints aligned with the monkeyâs shoulder and elbow and allowed the animal to make arm movements in the horizontal plane. Motors and encoders attached to the mechanical linkage provided angular position of the joints and applied torques when desired (flexion or extension) to both shoulder and elbow. Visual targets and cursor feedback of hand position were presented in the horizontal plane of hand movements by a virtual-reality system. A detailed description of the apparatus can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pasquereau and Turner, 2013</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Go/NoGo-countermanding task</title><p>This task was designed to manipulate different modes of movement suppression (i.e., reactive and proactive controls) and to disentangle possible confounding signals (i.e., stop-related, attention-related or switch-related). We combined the two paradigms used most widely to investigate inhibitory functions and impulse control behaviors: the stop-signal task and the Go/NoGo task. Specifically, in our paradigm, we used a switch-signal (<italic>blue</italic> cue) to unpredictably countermand the initially planned response: going or stopping, depending of the task conditions.</p><p>In our Go/NoGo-countermanding task, the monkey was required to align the cursor with a series of distinct visual targets (radius: 1.8 cm) displayed in succession. A trial began when a gray-filled target appeared at a start position proximal to the monkey and the monkey made the appropriate joint movements to align the cursor with this target. The monkey maintained this position for a random-duration hold period (2.9â5.1 s) during which: (a) an instruction cue was displayed at the start position (0.7â1.3 s after hold period start, 0.5 s duration), and (b) a peripheral target was displayed (0.7â1.3 s after offset of the instruction cue, at the same location for all trials, 7.5 cm distal to the start position). Two possible instruction cues were presented in random order across trials with equal probability: a <italic>green</italic> cue indicated a Go trial in which subsequent disappearance of the gray fill from the start position target (the trigger, 0.5â1.5 s after appearance of the peripheral target) cued the animal to promptly move the cursor to the peripheral target (&lt;0.8 s); or alternatively, a <italic>red</italic> cue indicated a NoGo trial in which the animal was required to continue holding the cursor within the start position upon subsequent disappearance of the gray fill from the start target. At the end of each successful trial food reward was delivered via a sipper tube attached to a computer-controlled peristaltic pump (~0.5 ml, puree of fresh fruits and protein biscuits). The temporal delays to reward were calibrated to be equivalent across task conditions. Reward was delivered either 0.7â1.3 s after movement for Go trials or 1.3â1.9 s after withholding movement for NoGo trials.</p><p>On 25% of all trials (both Go and NoGo conditions), the trigger was followed after a short delay (the switch-signal delay, SSD) by a switch-signal (<italic>blue</italic> cue, 0.3 s duration). The SSDs varied randomly from trial-to-trial between 200â450 ms. This range of SSDs was selected so that the monkey were able to perform the task with a limited number of errors (5â25% of switch-signal trials). When the switch-signal appeared after a Go cue, the monkey had to inhibit the pending movement and continue to hold the cursor within the start position until reward delivery. In this context, the switch-signal was equivalent to a stop-signal (referred as <italic>switch-stop</italic> trials). If the monkey generated a movement to the peripheral target during switch-stop trials (<italic>stop-failure</italic> trials), no reward was given and a time-out of 4 s occurred to penalize the animal. For the NoGo condition, the monkey was normally required to not respond to the trigger signal, except when the blue switch-signal appeared. Here, the switch-signal was equivalent to a sudden go-signal (<italic>switch-go</italic> trials), thereby cueing the animal to capture the peripheral target to receive a reward. Successive trials were separated by 1.5â2.5 s inter-trial intervals (randomly distributed at 100 ms resolution), during which the screen was black.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Proprioceptive stimulation</title><p>On one-third of the trials (selected at random), single flexing or extending torque impulses (0.34 Nm â 70 ms duration with 10 ms for onset and offset ramps) were applied to the monkeyâs arm (shoulderÂ +elbow) by two torque motors at an unpredictable time beginning 200â500 ms after capture of the initial target (i.e., before the instruction period). Each torque impulse induced multi-joint angular displacements causing a sudden stretch of arm extensor or flexor muscles. The animal was required to rapidly counter the perturbation and return its arm to the initial pre-impulse position to continue the current trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Surgery</title><p>After reaching asymptotic task performance, animals were prepared surgically for recording using aseptic surgery under Isoflurane inhalation anesthesia. An MRI-compatible plastic chamber (custom-machined PEEK, 28 Ã 20 mm) was implanted with stereotaxic guidance over a burr hole allowing access to the STN. The chamber was positioned in the parasagittal plane with an anterior-to-posterior angle of 20Â°. The chamber was fixed to the skull with titanium screws and dental acrylic. A titanium head holder was embedded in the acrylic to allow fixation of the head during recording sessions. For electromyographic (EMG, in monkey C only) recording, pairs of Teflon-insulated multistranded stainless steel wires were implanted into multiple arm muscles: biceps longus, triceps lateralis, anterior deltoid and posterior deltoid. Prophylactic antibiotics and analgesics were administered post-surgically.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Localization of the recording site</title><p>The anatomical location of the STN and proper positioning of the recording chamber to access it were estimated from structural MRI scans (Siemens 3 T Allegra Scanner, voxel size of 0.6 mm). An interactive 3D software system (Cicerone) was used to visualize MRI images, define the target location and predict trajectories for microelectrode penetrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miocinovic et al., 2007</xref>). Electrophysiological mapping was performed with penetrations spaced 1 mm apart. The boundaries of brain structures were identified based on standard criteria including relative location, neuronal spike shape, firing pattern, and responsiveness to behavioral events (e.g. movement, reward). By aligning microelectrode mapping results (electrophysiologically characterized X-Y-Z locations) with structural MRI images and high resolution 3-D templates of individual nuclei derived from an atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martin and Bowden, 1996</xref>), we were able to gauge the accuracy of individual microelectrode penetrations and determine chamber coordinates for the STN.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Recording and data acquisition</title><p>During recording sessions, a glass-coated tungsten microelectrode (impedance: 0.7â1 MOhm measured at 1000 Hz) was advanced into the target nucleus using a hydraulic manipulator (MO-95, Narishige). Neuronal signals were amplified with a gain of 10K, bandpass filtered (0.3â10 kHz) and continuously sampled at 25 KHz (RZ2, Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua FL). Individual spikes were sorted using Plexon off-line sorting software (Plexon Inc., Dallas TX). The timing of detected spikes and of relevant task events was sampled digitally at 1 kHz. Horizontal and vertical components of eye position were recorded using an infrared camera system (240 Hz; ETL-200, ISCAN, Woburn, MA). EMG signals were differentially amplified (gainÂ =Â 10 K), band-pass filtered (200 Hz to 5 kHz), rectified and then low-pass filtered (100 Hz). EMG data were collected during only a subset of data recording sessions (nÂ =Â 55).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of behavioral data</title><p>Data were collected after animals had extensive experience with the Go/NoGo-countermanding task (&gt;6 months, withÂ &gt;600 trials per session). Kinematic data derived from the exoskeleton were numerically filtered and combined to obtain the cursor position. The time of response onset, used for determining reaction times (RTs), was determined as the point at which the cursor crossed the outline of the start position target. The Go/NoGo paradigm allowed an animal to decide proactively whether or not to initiate a target capture movement in response to the trigger cue. To test if animals did use such a proactive response strategy, we calculated a behavioral index reflecting the preparation cost by subtracting RTs measured on <italic>go</italic> trials from those on <italic>switch-go</italic> trials.</p><p>Two key behavioral measures that characterize performance in the stop-signal task are (1) the inhibition function and (2) the RT distribution for the responses on <italic>go</italic> trials. The inhibition function plots the proportion of <italic>stop-failure</italic> trials (i.e., trials in which the animal fails to stop the incipient movement) as a function of the SSD. Classically, the probability of erroneous initiation of the movement increases as the SSD increases. The inhibition function has been modeled as a race between a process that initiates movement (Go) and a process that inhibits the response (Stop) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Logan et al., 1984</xref>). If the Stop process reaches a theoretical threshold before that the Go-related activity is fully processed, the pending movement is suppressed. Otherwise, if the Go process finishes before the Stop process, the movement is generated. As previously described in detail, the race model permits estimation of a stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), which is the time required to inhibit the planned movement. We estimated SSRTs for each session using the quantile method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Congdon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Band et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Williams et al., 1999</xref>), as follows. First, RTs on correct <italic>go</italic> trials were arranged in ascending order, and the RT corresponding to the same proportion of <italic>stop-failure</italic> trials was selected. For example, for a <italic>P</italic>(failure) of 0.35 we selected the RT 35% up the ordered list. The SSD was then subtracted from this quantile RT, providing an estimate of the time required to stop the response. For each selected SSDs (binsÂ =Â 28 ms) a value of the SSRT was computed, and then the overall behavioral estimate of cancellation time in a given session was obtained by averaging all the SSRTs. Note that we used six different time bins in the inhibition function in order to optimize the consistency of SSRTs across sessions. All of the data analyses were performed using custom scripts in the MATLAB environment (Mathworks, available online in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref> File - Custom Matlab code).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Neuronal data analysis</title><p>Neuronal recordings were accepted for analysis based on electrode location, and recording quality and duration (&gt;250 trials). Adequate single unit isolation was verified by testing for appropriate refractory periods (&gt;1 ms) and waveform isolation (signal/noise ratio superior to 3 s.t.d.).</p><p>The logic of the stop-signal task sets two criteria a single neuron or a population must meet to play a causally sufficient role in the behavioral response. First, the emitted signal must be different when a movement is initiated versus when it is stopped. Second, this difference must appear within the SSRT; otherwise, it would be too late to drive response inhibition. Following this line of reasoning, we investigated Stop-related activity in our sample of STN neurons by comparing the activity during successful <italic>switch-stop</italic> trials with the activity recorded during the subset of <italic>go</italic> trials in which movement initiation would have been stopped if the switch signal had been presented at the same SSDs. This subset of <italic>go</italic> trials, which we refer to as latency-matched trials, was defined as those with RTs greater than the sum of the SSD and the SSRT calculated from the same data. In the classical approach to this type of analysis, single-unit data are aligned on the time of trigger presentation separately for a series of constant SSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Scangos and Stuphorn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mirabella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hanes et al., 1998</xref>). In our paradigm, however, SSDs varied randomly from trial-to-trial between 200â450 ms (time resolutionÂ =Â 1 ms), making such an approach impossible in many cases because the same delays between task events were seldom repeated more than twice during any one neuronal recording (probability of occurrenceÂ =Â 1/250). Nevertheless, for the small subset of recordings amendable to such an analysis, we found that application of an adapted version of the âclassicâ method yielded results congruent with those from the standard method detailed below (compare the same single-unit data analyzed using âclassicalâ and standard approaches in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, respectively).</p><p>Consequently, to identify Stop-related encodings in neuronal data, rasters and spike density functions were aligned on the time of the Switch-signal. Spike density functions were obtained by convolving spike trains with a Gaussian kernel function (kernel width 20 ms). For <italic>latency-matched go</italic> trials, we used the possible times at which the Switch-signal would have occurred by shuffling delays (SSD: 200â450 ms, 1 ms resolution) 1000 times, and by excluding trials with RTÂ &lt;Â SSDÂ + SSRT. In order to optimize the time resolution, the STN activity was compared between trials using a sliding window procedure combined with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. For each step of 1 ms, we calculated the area under the ROC curve (AUC) derived from the respective spike count distributions detected in a 60 ms test window. The AUC provides a quantitative measure of the separation between two distributions of activity. An AUC value of 0.5 signifies that the two distributions are completely overlapped, whereas an extreme value of 0 or 1 signifies that the two distributions do not overlap. The time of differential activity (i.e., the neural cancellation time) was determined from the evolution of the ROC area over time and was defined as the time at which the AUC differed from a 500 ms control period preceding the Switch-signal (2-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, p&lt;0.01). If the neural cancellation time occurred before the SSRT, the STN signal was deemed to qualify as <italic>switch-stop</italic> related activity. To estimate the reliability of this method, we repeated the full procedure 1000 times (neural alignment, AUC measure, and estimation of the neural cancellation time) and calculated the 95% confidence interval of the neural cancellation times yielded for each neuron. We found that the mean temporal resolution for estimating neural cancellation times (i.e., characterized by the size of the confidence interval) was less than 3 ms (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>To disentangle confounding signals such as those related to attentional detection of the cue or those involved in behavioral switching function, we compared STN responses observed on successful <italic>switch-stop</italic> trials with the activity recorded on successful <italic>switch-go</italic> trials. The same sliding window ROC method was used to test whether respective activities were significantly different between trials. Briefly, we tested whether the AUC differed from a 500 ms control period preceding the Switch-signal (2-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, p&lt;0.01). A neuron was judged to be specifically involved in stopping if it generated a countermanding-related signal on <italic>switch-stop</italic> trials that exceed the neuronal response emitted on <italic>switch-go</italic> trials. Otherwise, if a neuron generated an equivalent or greater response on <italic>switch-go</italic> trials, then it was considered to be related to attentional or switching function. We referred to cells with this latter form of non-specific neuronal activity as Switch cells.</p><p>We also tested STN neurons for their responsiveness to proprioceptive input from the proximal arm and thus their membership in the STN skeletomotor circuit and potential involvement in the short latency activation of antagonist muscles related to stopping. We aligned the STN activity on the time of sudden torque motor-induced rotations of the animalâs elbow and shoulder joints. Mean peri-torque rasters and SDFs were constructed separately for two torque directions (flexion and extension). A phasic response to a torque perturbation was detected by comparing spike counts in a 60 ms test window to spike counts time-shuffled (ROC procedure with a sliding step of 1 ms). The threshold for significance was estimated from the AUC values calculated within a 500 ms control period preceding the torque (2-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, p&lt;0.01). A neuron was judged to be torque-related if it generated a significant short-latency response (&lt;200 ms) for at least one movement direction.</p><p>Following the same procedures as described above, we also tested STN single-unit activity for responsiveness to an error signal or reward delivery when the animal, respectively, failed or succeeded to stop during switch-stop trials. Mean peri-event rasters and SDFs were constructed around the trial outcomes (error or reward) and phasic responses were detected by comparing spike counts in a 60 ms test window to spike counts time-shuffled (2-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, p&lt;0.01). A neuron was judged to be error- or reward-related if it generated a significant response within 500 ms of the error or reward signal.</p><p>To further characterize individual STN neurons, the Go/NoGo-countermanding task was also devised to study the proactive control of movement suppression. Following the well-defined logic of the Go/NoGo task, if a neuronâs activity is related to proactive movement suppression, the activity preceding the trigger on <italic>no-go</italic> trials must exceed the activity on <italic>go</italic> trials. Alternatively, for a neuronâs activity to be related to movement preparation, the activity preceding the response on <italic>go</italic> trials must exceed that on <italic>no-go</italic> trials. To this end, we compared STN activity between <italic>go</italic> and <italic>no-go</italic> trials using the same sliding window procedure and ROC method as above. The neuronal activity was aligned on the time of the instruction and on the time of the response trigger, and we calculated the AUC derived from the respective spike count distributions. The AUC values compared spike counts from the instruction-trigger interval against a cellâs 500 ms baseline preceding the instruction period (2-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, p&lt;0.01).</p><p>Although monkeys were not required to control their gaze while performing the task, we conducted a multiple regression analysis to estimate how task-related neuronal activity around the time of the switch-signal was related to eye positions and saccades.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Naoshige Uchida (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Veit Stuphorn (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is thought to play a critical role in switching behaviors in response to a cue (e.g. a stop signal). Pasquereau and Turner conducted a very careful characterization of STN neuron firing in monkeys performing a Go/No-go countermanding arm movement task (a combination of a stop signal task and a Go/No-go task). The authors aimed to dissociate various confounding factors. First, because stop signals were presented infrequently, these signals would trigger strong attentional responses. Therefore, the authors examined the effect of go signals that indicated a switch from a No-go to a Go response (instead of a stop signal indicating a switch from a Go to a No-go response). The presence of these types of trials allowed the authors to test whether a neural response is related to attentional modulation since both the go and stop signals are equally infrequent. By comparing neural activities responding to a cue indicating a No-Go response versus those responding to a stop signal in cued Go trials, the authors were able to examine whether a stop signal response was related to reactive stopping or proactive action inhibition. In addition, the use of both go and stop signals allowed the authors to examine whether a switch activity is specific to a switch to a go or a switch to a stop, or both. The authors also examined whether the neural activity was correlated with mere motor parameters or proprioceptive responses. Through these examinations, the authors found neurons encoding a reactive stop or switching to go, and these neurons were localized to the ventromedial 'limbic' region of STN instead of the 'skeltomotor' regions of the STN.</p><p>All the reviewers thought that the study is excellent, and timely. A role of the STN in response inhibition has been proposed for a long time, but this was mainly based on human fMRI data and general notions about the function of different pathways in the basal ganglia. Recently, the role of STN has been investigated in rodents, but there were a number of technical differences in the design of the experiment relative to the previous experiments in humans and non-human primates. Thus, it is important that this issue is investigated in monkeys using single unit recording, whose high temporal and spatial resolution allows the disambiguation of different potential cognitive signals and of the functional role of different cortico-basal ganglia circuits. In addition, the 'classic' stop signal paradigm potentially conflates a number of different cognitive processes. This problem has been elegantly addressed in the new innovative experimental design that combines aspects of the Go/NoGo and the Stop Signal tasks. The findings are clear and interesting. The STN contains neurons with an activity profile that is sufficient to be causally involved in controlling response initiation and suppression. This finding confirms the prevailing theories. An unexpected aspect of the findings is that these neurons were not found in the 'skeletomotor' regions of the STN, but instead in the ventromedial STN, which receives input from limbic structures.</p><p>In summary, all the reviewers thought that this work will likely become an important (one reviewer said a landmark) study in the field of inhibitory control. While the reviewers are enthusiastic, there are a few questions and suggestions that may improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A somewhat surprising finding is that the stop-related STN neurons were <italic>not</italic> in the motor sections of the STN. At a glance, this appears to contradict with the author's emphasis on a causal involvement of these neurons in switching responses. The reviewers noted that there are at least two possibilities that these neurons may affect motor responses. First, such stop activity may have influence on motor execution through overlapping cortico-basal ganglia pathways (the segregation of parallel pathways might not be complete). Alternatively, such limbic STN activity may have influence on limbic cortical areas that in turn, affect motor execution indirectly. Please discuss possible route through which the limbic STN regulates motor outputs.</p><p>2) Although the present results provide novel insights, there are some previous studies that provided overlapping observations. Please discuss more explicitly differences from the previous recording studies (particularly, Schmidt et al., 2013 and Isoda and Hikosaka, 2008). It is very helpful to discuss what findings are invariant to detailed task parameters and species, and what findings differ among these studies.</p><p>3) Please clarify the way the comparison between the go and the switch-stop trials is done. In the go trials there is no switch signal. In the 'classic' countermanding studies (eye: Hanes et al., 1998; arm: Scangos and Stuphorn, 2010; Mirabella et al., 2011) the trials were therefore aligned on target onset and neuronal activity across multiple SSDs was compared. In the current manuscript, the authors use a shuffling (bootstrapping?) technique, where they draw 1000 trials randomly from the go trial distribution, pick a SSD in proportion to the actually used times, throw the trial out, if RT is faster than SSD, and add the activity to the 'switch-aligned' average, if RT is slower than SSD. (Please make the description clearer, if there is a misunderstanding.) This procedure appears to be fine. However, there remains a few concerns. First, we would like to see the 'classic' alignment on target onset (as a supplementary figure for a neuron where enough trials exist across at least two SSDs). This would help convince that this new procedure works accurately. Second, we were confused about the trial number in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>. How many trials are shown in the raster plots for the two types of trials? There are certainly not 1000 trials shown in the case of the 'switch-stop' trials. So, how were the trials picked? Also, should the procedure not be to assign randomly SSDs to all go trials, get an AUC measure and then repeat this 1000 times to get an estimate of the reliability of the AUC strength and the time of significant differences (if any).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31627.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A somewhat surprising finding is that the stop-related STN neurons were not in the motor sections of the STN.

As described by the reviewers, the classical approach is to align single-unit data on the time of trigger presentation separately for a series of constant SSDs (Hanes et al., 1998; Scangos and Stuphorn, 2010; Mirabella et al., 2011). In our paradigm, however, SSDs varied randomly from trial-to-trial between 200â450 ms (time resolution = 1 ms), making such an approach impossible in many cases because the same delays between task events were seldom repeated more than twice during any one neuronal recording (probability of occurrence = 1/250).</p><p>Nevertheless, for the small subset of recordings amendable to such an analysis, we found that application of an adapted version of the âclassicâ method yielded results congruent with those from our standard method. Example single-unit data analyzed using âclassicalâ and standard approaches are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, respectively.</p><p>To identify Stop-related encodings in neuronal data, rasters and spike density functions were aligned on the time of the Switch-signal. For latency-matched go trials, we used the possible times at which the Switch-signal would have occurred by shuffling delays (SSD: 200â450-ms, 1-ms resolution) 1,000 times, and by excluding trials with RT &lt; SSD + SSRT. To estimate the reliability of our method, we repeated the full procedure 1,000 times (neural alignment, AUC measure, and estimation of the neural cancellation time) and calculated the 95% confidence interval of the neural cancellation times yielded for each neuron. We found that the mean temporal resolution for estimating neural cancellation times (i.e., characterized by the size of the confidence interval) was less than 3-ms (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> in which we show the distribution of confidence intervals for estimation of cancellation times), making our method quite accurate.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>, only a subset of trials (randomly chosen) is shown in the raster of go trials to aid visualization of spike occurrences. The density of points would impair visualization if the full 1000 trials had been included in the figure. We have added a note in the figure legend to explain this.</p></body></sub-article></article>
