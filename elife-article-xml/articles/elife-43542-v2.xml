(cryo-EM) maps at resolutions ranging from near-atomic to subnanometer. It utilizes a chemically accurate force field and thermodynamic sampling to improve the real-space correlation between the modeled structure and the cryo-EM map. Our framework employs a gradual increase in resolution and map-model agreement as well as simulated annealing, and allows fully automated refinement without manual intervention or any additional rotamer- and backbone-specific restraints. Using multiple challenging systems covering a wide range of map resolutions, system sizes, starting model geometries and distances from the target state, we assess the quality of generated models in terms of both model accuracy and potential of overfitting. To provide an objective comparison, we apply several well-established methods across all examples and demonstrate that CDMD performs best in most cases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>structure refinement</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Igaev</surname><given-names>Maxim</given-names></name><name><surname>Kutzner</surname><given-names>Carsten</given-names></name><name><surname>Bock</surname><given-names>Lars V</given-names></name><name><surname>Vaiana</surname><given-names>Andrea C</given-names></name><name><surname>Grubmüller</surname><given-names>Helmut</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG 109/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Igaev</surname><given-names>Maxim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR 1805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vaiana</surname><given-names>Andrea C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Correlation-driven molecular dynamics provides a fully automated and human-bias-free framework for quantitative interpretation of modern cryo-electron microscopy data.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>State-of-the-art cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) allows biomolecules to be resolved in different functional states and at near-atomic resolution previously achieved only by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang and Nogales, 2015</xref>). A new generation of electron detectors and the development of sample motion correction algorithms have been the major contributors to this rapid progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bai et al., 2015</xref>). Cryo-EM maps determined to resolutions better than 4 Å have become standard with several examples claimed to break the 2Å-resolution barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frank, 2017</xref>). Yet, benefiting from the recent advances in image classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frank and Ourmazd, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakane et al., 2018</xref>), cryo-EM now provides ensembles of low- to high-resolution reconstructions describing differently populated conformational states of vitrified molecular complexes. However, methods for deriving accurate atomistic models from cryo-EM maps lag behind this <italic>resolution revolution</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saibil, 2017</xref>). The increasing amount of molecular detail requires the development of new methodologies and software to accurately and timely interpret experimental densities.</p><p>For de novo building of polypeptide/nucleotide chains many methods are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Langer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Terwilliger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burnley et al., 2017</xref>), including tools for subsequent refinement of hand-built or homology models into densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fabiola and Chapman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schröder et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Topf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lopéz-Blanco and Chacón, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">DiMaio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kovalevskiy et al., 2018</xref>). In these methods, stereochemical properties and local electrostatics are not fully enforced, nor is a proper description of large-scale concerted motions guaranteed. When applied to maps with medium (local) resolutions or lower, they tend to produce errors such as atomic clashes, improper bond lengths and angles, and poor agreement between the density and the corresponding model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hooft et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Neumann et al., 2018</xref>). As a result, multiple rotamer, backbone and secondary structure restraints, manual intervention on the system during refinement, and subsequent re-refinement are often required to preserve stereochemical plausibility and avoid overfitting.</p><p>As an alternative, several molecular dynamics (MD)-based refinement methods have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brünger et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunger and Adams, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Trabuco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Orzechowski and Tama, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fenn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGreevy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miyashita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). A more comprehensive overview of how MD simulations can be used to assist structure refinement is given elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kirmizialtin et al., 2015</xref>). Here, the refinement rests on a chemically accurate force field and thermodynamic sampling of conformations in addition to guiding the model into the density, as opposed to minimizing a simple target function. These MD-based methods have markedly higher computational requirements which are usually met by today’s efficient parallel and GPU implementations. High-resolution maps, however, pose a challenge to MD-based refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGreevy et al., 2016</xref>). Frequently, parts of the system get trapped due to inefficient conformational sampling in rugged density regions commonly present in such maps. Despite recent improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGreevy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miyashita et al., 2017</xref>), the obtained models still strongly depend on local map resolution and the choice of a particular refinement scheme or force field. Also, systematic, force-field driven deviations in model geometry have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It is therefore fair to say that no available cryo-EM refinement method simultaneously meets the three challenges posed by the current resolution revolution: resolution-independent density fitting, stereochemical accuracy, and automation. Here, we have developed and implemented such an automated yet accurate method for structure refinement and validation, denoted correlation-driven molecular dynamics (CDMD), by combining a previously published methodology for low-resolution maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Orzechowski and Tama, 2008</xref>) with continuously adaptive resolution and simulated annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brünger et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunger and Adams, 2002</xref>). In all the presented application examples, we challenge CDMD to refine distant starting models of diverse quality against cryo-EM densities at various resolutions (2.6–7 Å). Performance is assessed using commonly defined measures such as the radius of convergence, model geometry and overfitting. A full analysis of the results and a discussion of the practical conclusions in the general context of structure refinement are presented.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Basic concept of CDMD</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> summarizes the early approach proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Orzechowski and Tama (2008)</xref> for refinement of crystal structures into low-resolution electron densities.

Steps (<italic>1–4</italic>) are repeated, yielding a structure that correlates better with the cryo-EM map than the starting structure.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43542-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To overcome sampling issues in rugged density regions, which are particularly severe given high resolutions and fine grids offered by cryo-EM today, we have extended the method to additionally allow for adaptive resolution and simulated annealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and Materials and methods for a detailed description of the designed protocol). The complete framework has been embedded into the GPU-accelerated GROMACS MD suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>). The refinement process is controlled by only three parameters which are varied during the MD run. First, to avoid local minima, the resolution of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mi>sim</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">𝐫</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is gradually increased from very low to the maximum available from the cryo-EM data. This increase allows the structure to adapt globally and only then locally to the experimental density during refinement. In contrast to previous approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Singharoy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), only the simulated density is continuously resampled so that the full experimental density is used throughout the refinement. Although the correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is invariant with respect to whether <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">𝐫</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mi>sim</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">𝐫</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is blurred, changing the resolution of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mi>sim</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">𝐫</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> only is computationally much cheaper for the biasing potential of choice, which facilitates automation. Second, the relative weight of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>fit</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> over <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>ff</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is gradually increased via a force constant <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. It has been shown previously that gradually increasing <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> improves the refinement outcome for low-resolution maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miyashita et al., 2017</xref>). For high-resolution maps, higher force constants at late refinement stages are required to ensure an accurate density fit at the side chain level which could otherwise be distorted by thermal fluctuations. Third, high-temperature simulated annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brünger et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunger and Adams, 2002</xref>) is used to enhance local map-model agreement (e.g. side chain rotamers), while keeping well-refined parts of the model unchanged.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43542.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the proposed continuous refinement protocol: (<italic>1</italic>) a low temperature optimization phase, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>fit</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is monotonously increased by increasing the force constant <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (columns <bold>a–d</bold>), followed by (<italic>2</italic>) simulated annealing (columns <bold>e, f</bold>).</title><p>The local effect of the protocol is exemplified in the upper row for a one-dimensional single-atom case.

Stages 2 and 3 (gray and green) include the refinement against one of the half-maps (training map) followed by cross-validation by means of Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) against the other half-map (validation map). In case no overfitting of the training map is observed, the final structure from the half-map refinement is passed to stage 4 (cyan), where it is refined against the full map to account for high-resolution features not present in both half-maps. Finally, in stage 5 (purple), the average structure from the last 5 ns of the full map refinement is subjected to geometry and goodness-of-fit assessment. Note that the procedure is automated such that stages 1–4 can be run without human intervention. Pausing the refinement to inspect intermediate results or introduce changes to the protocol should be possible at any stage.

We were additionally encouraged by the reviewers to use the following alternative approaches for the high- and medium-resolution cases to compare our results to: Phenix real space refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>), Rosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">DiMaio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>) and Refmac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kovalevskiy et al., 2018</xref>). All methods are applied straightforwardly to the same far-away starting models (without manual corrections) and using protocols recommended by the developing research groups and/or described in recent literature. While we are aware that most of these methods have <italic>not</italic> been originally designed or further optimized to refine distant starting models and/or DNA/RNA, such a comparison further supports the results of this work. In the last example, we specifically compare our model with that generated by MDFF, a method originally designed for flexible fitting of distant high-resolution structures into low-resolution densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Trabuco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Trabuco et al., 2009</xref>). Starting model preparation, refinement simulation setups, and validation protocols are described in Materials and methods.</p><p>Throughout the rest of the work, the following important notions will be used. (1) The <italic>deposited reference</italic> (or simply reference) is the atomistic model that has been generated using and deposited together with a particular cryo-EM data set in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB). Importantly, for all cases, we use starting structures that are much farther away from the target state defined by the map than those originally used to produce the deposited references. (2) The <italic>control structure(s)</italic> (or simply control(s)) is a higher quality atomistic model of the same biomolecule captured in the same conformational state as the reference that has been derived from a higher resolution data set (usually X-ray). (3) The <italic>true structure</italic> is a hypothetical and practically unreachable structure that one would obtain from the ‘perfect’ data set. We generally assume that a control structure is closer to the true structure than ones derived from lower resolution cryo-EM data sets. (4) Any refinement with many parameters (here, atomic coordinates) may be prone to <italic>overfitting</italic>, that is refinement of the atomic coordinates into noise or map regions already occupied by the refined structure, if the strength of the biasing term is not selected appropriately. It is therefore important to refine the model against only a subset of data (<italic>training map</italic>) and to cross-validate it with another independent subset (<italic>validation map</italic>), making sure that the refinement does not lead to an overinterpretation of the training map at the cost of losing agreement with the validation map or stereochemical quality (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Aldolase: good starting model against a high-resolution map</title><p>We first evaluated how well CDMD refines good starting models into high-resolution maps. Specifically, we asked if, in the absence of any other source of atomistic knowledge than the MD force field, the chosen biasing potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) per se introduces steric clashes and disrupts backbone and side chain geometries. The absence of such artifacts is an important requirement for the CDMD application at medium to low resolutions for which side chains and the secondary structure may not be sufficiently described by the density alone. To this end, our method was applied to fit the X-ray structure of a rabbit muscle aldolase (PDB ID: 6ALD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choi et al., 1999</xref>) to the recently deposited data set (EMD ID: 8743, PDB ID: 5VY5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Herzik et al., 2017</xref>).

The target force constant was set to 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> which was roughly 10% of the total system energy and was a good initial guess.

Already during the half-map refinement the fitted model converged to a structure with RMSD<sub>ref</sub> ≈2 Å. To assess whether the refined model is overfitted, we monitored the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harauz and van Heel, 1986</xref>) between the model and the training map (FSC<sub>train</sub>, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>, top). The FSC between the model and the validation map (FSC<sub>val</sub>) was calculated simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>, bottom). No large differences were observed between FSC<sub>train</sub> and FSC<sub>val</sub> at any point during the half-map refinement, confirming the absence of overfitting. Driving the force constant beyond 5 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:mo>×</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> 10<sup>5</sup> kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> led to gradually increasing deviations between FSC<sub>train</sub> and FSC<sub>val</sub> until the refinement simulation became unstable due to the biasing potential being too strong (15–20% of the total system energy). Finally, we performed additional refinement including simulated annealing against the full map to account for features not present in the training map, which brought RMSD<sub>ref</sub> further down to ∼1.8 Å. The force constant was no longer increased.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> (top) compares the starting, the deposited and our model in terms of FSC with respect to the full map (FSC<sub>full</sub>).

Only Rosetta was able to converge as close to the reference as our method, yielding a structure with good geometry, while neither Phenix nor Refmac was. Refinement with Phenix produced reasonable geometry but showed poor convergence of solvent-exposed flexible loops, which contributed to the larger RMSD<sub>ref</sub>. Refinement with Refmac did not place those protein regions into the density that showed the largest RMSD<sub>ref</sub> prior to refinement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) and produced rather poor geometry.

We assume that this relationship between the number of steric clashes and the rotamer/backbone quality may be explained by the way CDMD and those methods relying on knowledge-based structural restraints (e.g. Rosetta or Phenix) optimize the fit to density. We postpone a more detailed discussion on this observation to the end of the Results section. To determine which of the two models was in fact closer to the ‘true structure’, we compared both with the higher-quality control structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Neither model showed a considerably smaller RMSD value to any of the control structures, suggesting that both models might be equally good approximations of the ‘true structure’. Overall, the aldolase results suggest that CDMD is capable of correcting structural errors and converges quickly to the target state while maintaining good geometry at all refinement stages.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Tubulin: accuracy and convergence at medium resolutions</title><p>We next applied CDMD to a medium-resolution map (4.1 Å) of a GDP-tubulin dimer in the straight microtubule-like conformation derived from an asymmetric helical reconstruction of a complete, kinesin-decorated microtubule lattice (provided by courtesy of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang and Nogales, 2015</xref>).

In summary, the TRPV1 refinements demonstrate that CDMD has a large and robust radius of convergence and is able to significantly improve poor starting models irrespective of local resolution and within a single refinement run.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>TRPV1: comparison with Rosetta and ReMDFF</title><p>The TRPV1 system has been previously used to benchmark the Rosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>) and ReMDFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Singharoy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) algorithms, which offers an additional comparison to these methods.

To this end, the structure of an ATP-bound NSF (PDB ID: 3J94; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>) was refined into the ∼3.9 Å map of a NSF complex (EMD ID: 9102, class 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">White et al., 2018</xref>). To enable a direct comparison, the starting structure was completed to match the deposited Phenix model (see Materials and methods).

The map-model agreement improved gradually as the target force constant increased, but the final models correlated almost equally well with the full map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, top, red curves). Because the half-maps were not available, it was challenging to judge which of the obtained models suffered from under- or overfitting. We therefore assessed the stereochemistry of the models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, bottom), while simultaneously comparing them to the deposited reference structure (PDB ID: 6MDO). One would expect that, as the force constant becomes too high, the map-model agreement would increase at the expense of geometry violations (atomic clashes or rotamer and Ramachandran outliers), whereas for insufficiently strong force constants, the model stereochemistry should be less dependent on the biasing force, suggesting that the ‘optimal’ force constant should fall within the chosen range (2–8 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf45"><mml:mo>×</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> 10<sup>5</sup> kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>). Indeed, this was the case for the NSF refinement: while the models at <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> = 2–6 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf47"><mml:mo>×</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> 10<sup>5</sup> kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> showed similar geometry, increasing the force constant beyond 6 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf48"><mml:mo>×</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> 10<sup>5</sup> kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> led to a drastic increase in the number of rotamer outliers comparable with that of the starting model, potentially indicating overfitting. We also noticed that the models at 2 and 3 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:mo>×</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> 10<sup>5</sup> kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> had lower EMRinger scores, suggesting that the biasing force was insufficient to improve the local side chain-map correlation and potentially indicating underfitting. This was further supported by the weaker reciprocal correlation for these two models as compared to both reference and other models at <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf50"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mi/></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> 3 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf51"><mml:mo>×</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> 10<sup>5</sup> kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, top).

To determine whether this difference also indicated that our NSF model was closer to the ‘true structure’, we compared both models with the higher quality X-ray structures in terms of RMSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). As the control structures contained only a single protomer of the D2 ring, we truncated our model and the reference to match each of the control structures prior to RMSD calculation. Our NSF model showed systematically lower RMSD values to both controls (roughly a 0.2 Å difference, which is detectable given the small size of the compared structures). Visual inspection revealed that this was mainly explained by the difference in the ATP binding pockets and that our model more closely resembled the control structures in this region. Particularly, we noticed that either the adenosine group of ATP was rotated by 90° or 180° relative to that of the controls (3 of 6 NSF protomers in 6MDO) or the phosphate tail of ATP deviated from that of the controls (all protomers in 6MDO). In contrast, our model reproduced the structure of the ATP binding pocket equally well across the entire D2 hexamer. We speculate that a proper treatment of electrostatics is important for correct ligand placement in the absence of sufficient density information.</p><p>Finally, we assessed the convergence of the NSF refinement across the different methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Stereochemical quality statistics for the models are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>. Unlike in the above test cases, none of the alternative refinement methods was able to approach the reference structure demonstrating only ∼0.5 Å of improvement in terms of RMSD<sub>ref</sub> as compared to ∼2 Å of improvement by CDMD. Interestingly, the convergence was better in the D2 domain for all alternative methods than in the D1 domain, where the split region between protomers A and F and the SNAP-25A 17 N-terminal residues were only poorly modelled by Phenix, Rosetta and Refmac. We speculate that, for the alternative methods, the hexagonal symmetry of the D2 domain translated into global symmetry restraints improves the refinement of this part of the NSF complex relative to the D1 domain, where the symmetry is broken by the split region. Here, we again emphasize that CDMD does not need symmetry restraints (or any other geometry-based restraints) and relies solely on the interatomic interactions defined by the force field.</p><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43542.032</object-id><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Refinement statistics for the NSF system.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th/><th>CDMD</th><th>Phenix</th><th>Rosetta</th><th>Refmac</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>FSCavg (full map)</td><td>0.765</td><td>0.706</td><td>0.748</td><td>0.479</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>EMRinger</td><td>1.77</td><td>0.90</td><td>1.56</td><td>0.11</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Bond lengths (Å)</td><td>0.022</td><td>0.007</td><td>0.021</td><td>0.020</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Bond angles (°)</td><td>2.30</td><td>1.52</td><td>2.17</td><td>3.29</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>MolProbity</td><td>1.38</td><td>1.38</td><td>1.42</td><td>3.78</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>All-atom clashscore</td><td>0.13</td><td>6.93</td><td>3.26</td><td>47.1</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ramachandran statistics:</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Favored (%)</td><td>92.37</td><td>98.86</td><td>95.67</td><td>89.53</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Allowed (%)</td><td>6.71</td><td>1.03</td><td>3.73</td><td>7.03</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Outliers (%)</td><td>0.92</td><td>0.11</td><td>0.60</td><td>3.44</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Poor rotamers (%)</td><td>2.95</td><td>0.41</td><td>0.08</td><td>25.8</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>CaBLAM flagged (%)</td><td>13.1</td><td>20.5</td><td>14.9</td><td>22.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Nucleosome: non-rigid-body transition in a protein-DNA complex</title><p>We next sought to test how CDMD would perform on a system (a) for which a non-trivial concerted motion is expected (i.e. which cannot be described by a set of rigid body translations or rotations), and (b) that also includes DNA whose correct stereochemistry is notoriously hard to maintain using modern force fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Galindo-Murillo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ivani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dans et al., 2017</xref>). To this end, we refined the recently published low-resolution structure of a ‘breathing’ nucleosome complex (PDB ID: 6ESI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilokapic et al., 2018</xref>) into the 3.7 Å map of the canonical nucleosome state (EMD ID: 3947, PDB ID: 6ESF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilokapic et al., 2018</xref>). The major rearrangements between the two states include a contraction along the symmetry axis coupled to a concomitant expansion in the perpendicular direction and a shift by ∼1 base pair in the DNA due to rearrangements in the histone-DNA interface. To further challenge our refinement method, we increased the RMSD of the starting structure from the target state by subjecting it to MD simulation in explicit solvent at <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf54"><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> = 300 K, which, in addition to the above deviations, led to overall DNA buckling and slipping off the histone octamer (RMSD ≈5 Å with local deviations reaching ∼15 Å; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>).

The goodness-of-fit slowly improved as the force constant increased, but the refined structure never reached the same extent of reciprocal-space correlation as the deposited reference, suggesting that the deposited reference structure might be slightly overfitting the full map. This conclusion was also supported by the model quality statistics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>, bottom) which showed a systematic improvement of our model relative to both starting and deposited reference structure, except for a moderate fraction of Ramachandran outliers and a slightly lower EMRinger score.</p><p>To validate these results, we compared our model and the deposited reference with the higher resolution control structures in terms of RMSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>, only protein non-hydrogen atoms). As in the aldolase case, neither model had systematically lower RMSD values to both control structures, suggesting that both models are good representations of the ‘true structure’. The DNA part was very similar across all models: RMSD<sub>control</sub> ≈1.4 Å for both our model and the reference, and RMSD less than 0.9 Å between the compared models themselves (all DNA non-hydrogen atoms). It should be noted that the DNA accuracy in the deposited reference (refined with Phenix) was due to the use of base-pairing and base-stacking restraints and a much closer starting structure. On the contrary, the high level of achieved DNA quality in our model is particularly remarkable because (a) no geometry restraints were used, and (b) the CHARMM force field family used to refine the nucleosome (see Materials and methods) is rather inaccurate in reproducing correct nucleotide base pairing when used in plain MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Galindo-Murillo et al., 2016</xref>). We hence conclude that the ‘soft’ (global) fitting potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) with a well-adjusted weight is a substantial factor in maintaining the modelled structure’s accuracy, even in cases where neither the resolution nor the structural knowledge (e.g. a force field) are satisfactory.</p><p>Finally, the convergence of our and the alternative methods was assessed using the same distant starting structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Stereochemical quality statistics for the generated models are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>. Among all the methods tested, only CDMD was able to achieve a model accuracy and map-model agreement similar to the deposited reference. Although the histone part was refined similarly well by all of the methods, the DNA part was, if anything, only poorly refined (Refmac) and in most cases disintegrated (Phenix and Rosetta). The poor DNA quality of the Rosetta model is likely due to the internal Rosetta energy function that was originally designed for protein modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alford et al., 2017</xref>), and a generalization for RNA/DNA is currently being developed. The fact that the Phenix refinement, in which DNA restraints were constantly switched on, was unable to converge to the reference structure might indicate that the starting structure is out of this method’s radius of convergence. For Refmac, the optimal geometry weights necessary to obtain good agreement for the DNA and the histone part differed by 2–3 orders of magnitude such that a refinement of the entire nucleosome structure in a single run was impossible without severe geometry violations.</p><table-wrap id="table5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43542.033</object-id><label>Table 5.</label><caption><title>Refinement statistics for the nucleosome system.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th/><th>CDMD</th><th>Phenix</th><th>Rosetta</th><th>Refmac</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>FSCavg (full map)</td><td>0.659</td><td>0.676</td><td>0.572</td><td>0.399</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>EMRinger</td><td>1.20</td><td>1.50</td><td>0.88</td><td>0.76</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Bond lengths (Å)</td><td>0.022</td><td>0.008</td><td>0.019</td><td>0.018</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Bond angles (°)</td><td>1.82</td><td>1.10</td><td>2.60</td><td>3.38</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>MolProbity</td><td>0.65</td><td>1.58</td><td>2.60</td><td>3.88</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>All-atom clashscore</td><td>0.1</td><td>8.84</td><td>91.7</td><td>63.5</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ramachandran statistics:</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Favored (%)</td><td>97.31</td><td>99.87</td><td>97.04</td><td>88.84</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Allowed (%)</td><td>1.88</td><td>0.13</td><td>1.75</td><td>8.60</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Outliers (%)</td><td>0.81</td><td>0.0</td><td>1.21</td><td>2.55</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Poor rotamers (%)</td><td>0.51</td><td>1.36</td><td>0.16</td><td>22.62</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>CaBLAM flagged (%)</td><td>5.6</td><td>8.2</td><td>9.4</td><td>15.3</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Ribosome: refinement of a large protein-RNA complex</title><p>As a second example of a mixed nucleotide-protein system, we refined a large bacterial 70S ribosome/SelB complex in the codon reading (CR state; PDB ID: 5LZC) into the recently published 3.4 Å map (EMD ID: 4124, PDB ID: 5LZD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>) of the GTPase-activated state (GA). Similar to the nucleosome test case, the chosen ribosome system is a nucleic-acid-protein complex (here, RNA) which undergoes non-trivial rearrangements in switching from CR to GA to form the codon-anticodon base pairs (local deviations reaching ∼19 Å in the A-site tRNA and SelB elongation factor; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig9video1">Figure 9—video 1</xref>).

Although this refinement case was not as challenging in terms of radius of convergence as the above examples (RMSD<sub>ref</sub> ≈2.5 Å for the starting structure after equilibration), CDMD was able to produce a good quality model despite the system size and the straightforwardness of the CDMD refinement, compared to the multi-method approach used in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>).

As the control <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ribosome structure (4YBB) was in a different translation state, we extracted only the 23S rRNA together with proteins L4 and L22 of the large 50S subunit (also shown in part in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d</xref>). From the control structure of the SelB mRNA-binding domain (2PJP) only the protein part was extracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9e</xref>). Both reference and CDMD model were in good agreement with the 23S control structure showing RMSD values of ∼3 Å, which is small given the size of the compared parts. The agreement was worse for the much smaller SelB part, where both models deviated from the control by ∼2.7 Å in terms of RMSD. This can be explained by the lower local resolution of the cryo-EM density in this region. None of the compared models showed significantly smaller or larger RMSD<sub>ref</sub> values from the controls, suggesting that both models are equally good approximations of the ‘true structure’.</p><p>To assess the radius of convergence of CDMD and the other alternative methods, we used the same starting structure as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Refinement statistics for the generated models are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>. Similarly to the NSF case, none of the tested alternative methods was able to achieve a map-model agreement and accuracy consistent with the reference or CDMD model. While Phenix performed relatively well in the ribosomal core domains, yielding a structure with good geometry, its convergence was poor for solvent-accessible parts and for the SelB factor (the region with the largest RMSD<sub>ref</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). As a result, the Phenix model had a larger RMSD from the reference than the starting structure itself. Refinement with Rosetta yielded a rather poor model due to its energy function’s unsuitability for DNA/RNA modeling. Also in this case the final RMSD<sub>ref</sub> value was larger than the starting one. Refmac was the only alternative method tested that refined the starting structure toward the reference, resulting in a final RMSD<sub>ref</sub> being smaller than the starting one. However, as in the Phenix refinement, it was unable to refine regions of the starting model that deviated strongly from the reference. Overall, these comparative modeling results confirm the necessity for a multi-method method approach when refining large systems such as the ribosome with current non-MD methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, they also suggest that CDMD may drastically reduce the effort in such a refinement.</p><table-wrap id="table6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43542.034</object-id><label>Table 6.</label><caption><title>Refinement statistics for the ribosome system.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th/><th>CDMD</th><th>Phenix</th><th>Rosetta</th><th>Refmac</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>FSCavg (full map)</td><td>0.766</td><td>0.807</td><td>0.549</td><td>0.724</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>EMRinger</td><td>1.56</td><td>1.87</td><td>0.24</td><td>0.50</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Bond lengths (Å)</td><td>0.017</td><td>0.016</td><td>0.062</td><td>0.010</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Bond angles (°)</td><td>2.01</td><td>1.41</td><td>6.88</td><td>1.83</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>MolProbity</td><td>1.61</td><td>1.42</td><td>3.17</td><td>2.69</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>All-atom clashscore</td><td>0.28</td><td>7.65</td><td>152.9</td><td>9.34</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ramachandran statistics:</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Favored (%)</td><td>94.09</td><td>99.25</td><td>90.84</td><td>92.06</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Allowed (%)</td><td>5.10</td><td>0.75</td><td>5.78</td><td>6.69</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Outliers (%)</td><td>0.81</td><td>0.0</td><td>3.38</td><td>1.25</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Poor rotamers (%)</td><td>6.23</td><td>1.01</td><td>0.33</td><td>8.69</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>CaBLAM flagged (%)</td><td>14.0</td><td>19.0</td><td>23.7</td><td>16.8</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>RNA backbone</td><td>0.54</td><td>0.41</td><td>0.381</td><td>0.38</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>CorA magnesium transporter: low-resolution map fitting</title><p>Having shown that CDMD provides plausible model geometries consistent with the map even when the cryo-EM density contains only partial structural information, we proceeded to a more challenging case where only low-resolution information was available.

To answer this question, a comparison with high-resolution structures of the asymmetric open state is required which were not available for the CorA system. Nevertheless, there is experimental and simulation evidence that removal of the regulatory Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions from the symmetric CorA conformation leads to large-scale rearrangements of the intracellular stalk helices that increase the diameter of the gating pore, hence triggering ion conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chakrabarti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dalmas et al., 2014</xref>). Although pore opening is hard to infer by inspecting the cryo-EM map due to its low resolution, it is conceivable that an accurate refinement of the symmetric CorA structure with well-balanced contributions from both cryo-EM map and molecular force field would induce such structural changes. We therefore compared the structure of the gating pathway in all of the models analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b,c</xref>. Specifically, we analyzed the structure and biophysical properties of the CorA gating pathway using the CHAP program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klesse, 2019</xref>). This analysis yielded a surface representation of the gating pathway as well as its radius at every position along the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3</xref>). The fact that we used explicit solvent in all of the simulations also allowed us to estimate the solvent density in the pore. The gating pore of our CorA model was, on average, wider along the pathway than that of the closed symmetric structure. The average solvent density in the gating pore of our CorA model was lower, consistent with the increased pore volume. Surprisingly, the gating pore in the MDFF model was rather curled and significantly smaller in volume than that of the closed symmetric structure, despite the intracellular stalk helices adopting an asymmetric conformation very similar to our model. It was mainly due to the gate closure in the central part of the transmembrane domain (pore radii reaching 0.5 Å, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3</xref>) that led to a complete permeation block as indicated by zero number density in this region (no water molecules were present). We speculate that this conformation of the gating pore in the MDFF model would lead to even weaker conductance than in the case of the closed symmetric channel in free MD simulations. Although a higher-resolution control is still required to validate the open structure produced by CDMD, the fact that the gating pore opens and is on average more solvated in the CDMD fitting simulations is in agreement with previous biochemical and simulation data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chakrabarti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dalmas et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, MDFF was unable to induce gate opening. To test whether it is the secondary structure restraints (an option strongly recommended for low-resolution refinement with MDFF) that prevented the torque generated by rearranging the intracellular domains from propagating into the gate region, we switched off all the restraints and re-refined the starting structure. This restraint-free MDFF setup did not lead to gate opening either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>, rightmost structure; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3</xref>, bottom right plot). We note that the restraint-free MDFF setup used here was identical to our refinement setup, except for the biasing potential form. We therefore speculate that it is the ‘hard’ MDFF biasing potential (each density grid point is an attractor) that makes the refined model less compliant and restricted only to the highest-density regions. On the contrary, the ‘soft’ correlation-based potential (global map-model overlap is maximized) allows more internal flexibility while maintaining a comparable degree of map-model agreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b,c</xref>, top, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). When coupled to a stereochemically accurate treatment (atomistic force field), our refinement protocol might thus be useful in modeling biologically relevant transitions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Force field influence and model accuracy</title><p>We now return to the question of why in many of the above test cases the remarkable reduction of steric clashes by CDMD often comes at the cost of increased rotamer and/or Ramachandran outliers, as compared to the deposited reference models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). It should be first noted that, by construction, the refinement methods used to produce the deposited models (COOT, Phenix, Rosetta, Refmac) often enforce accurate rotamer and Ramachandran distributions, whereas, also by construction, force-field-based refinement guarantees almost zero steric clashes. The question therefore narrows down to whether the structural errors observed in our models (a) arise due to imperfections of the force fields in use (<italic>e.g.</italic>, inaccurate backbone dihedral, rotamer torsion angles or atomic partial charges), (b) are enforced by the cryo-EM data (real or noise), or (c) are a synergetic combination of these effects. It is conceivable that in scenario (a), outliers of certain amino acid types would be systematically and significantly overrepresented in the total outlier pool, both before and after structure refinement. In contrast, a low to moderate number of outliers being rather homogeneously distributed across the amino acid alphabet would point to scenario (b). These unspecific outliers might, in turn, be contributed by poorly determined map regions or be naturally occurring outliers in densely packed protein interiors.</p><p>To test this idea, we performed a per-residue analysis of the rotamer and Ramachandran outliers detected in our models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, left; see Materials and methods). For each of the above non-ribosome test cases, the final structures and the ones pre-equilibrated in explicit solvent prior to refinement were analyzed, and the resulting statistics were merged. The ribosome case was analyzed separately because a different force field family was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, right). We first asked if our refinement procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) per se improves the rotamer and Ramachandran distributions. Indeed, there was an overall decrease both in the average per-residue outlier propensity and in the total outlier occurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, gray <italic>vs.</italic> blue or red dots), irrespective of the force field. These data indicate that a considerable fraction of structural conflicts is resolved by the refinement and support scenario (b) above: that the cryo-EM density improves the geometry of initially poorer models leaving a certain number of residue-unspecific outliers.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43542.026</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Per-residue outlier analysis.</title><p>Per-residue rotamer and Ramachandran outlier propensities calculated from the non-ribosome structures (left panels; CHARMM22*/CHARMM36m force fields were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 2017</xref>) and the ribosome structure (right panels; AMBER12sb was used; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010</xref>) after pre-equilibration with the force field (gray dots) and after the actual refinement with our approach (blue and red dots, respectively).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43542-fig11-v2.tif"/></fig><p>However, mainly for the rotamer distributions, we observed that those peaked at certain amino acid types more frequently, both before and after structure refinement. In particular, for the non-ribosome systems refined using CHARMM22*/CHARMM36m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 2017</xref>), aspartates, leucines, tryptophans and valines contributed most to the overall outlier occurrences, which, however, remained rather low (outlier propensities of ∼0.04 or lower). AMBER12sb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010</xref>) force field used for the ribosome refinement performed similarly to CHARMM22*/CHARMM36m for all rotamer types except for threonines and valines which systematically disagreed with their knowledge-based conformations (an order of magnitude higher outlier propensities, ∼0.33 and ∼0.2, respectively). The presence of systematic structure errors, therefore, supports scenario (a) as these errors are residue- and force-field-specific and not corrected by the refinement.</p><p>Thus, there are several lines of evidence that the structural errors detected in our models are likely to be a combination of cryo-EM data-specific outliers and force field artifacts (scenario (c) above). It should be noted that the quality of a refined structure is only as good as the experimentally determined map. Low determinacy of 3D classification and poor alignment of cryo-EM particles may be related to the non-ideal nature of structure refinement. Furthermore, conformational heterogeneity and ensemble averaging misinterpreted as a single structure can be another source of structural errors in which case an ensemble refinement may be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rice et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burnley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herzik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonomi et al., 2018</xref>). In our present study, we have concentrated on single-structure refinement and have implicitly assumed that each map stems from a unique conformational state of the biological complex in question. This is a good approximation for high-resolution maps (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For medium- and low-resolution maps, the best representation might not be a single structure but rather a weighted set of structures. The TRPV1 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is one example of such a case in our study. Here, three independent refinements produced three structures with very similar conformations in the high-resolution TM region and with much more variability in the low-resolution ARD domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The subject of ensemble refinement, however, lies beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Correction of the force-field outliers, in turn, is tightly linked to the general force field development. Still undefined, apparently, is the way a reduction of steric clashes should be reconciled with an improvement of other stereochemical measures (e.g. rotamer and Ramachandran statistics, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf68"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> deviations, chirality errors, etc.), as these might currently represent conflicting optimization goals. On the one hand, it is well known what the expectations are for such errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bower et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shapovalov and Dunbrack, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Renfrew et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Towse et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, incorporation of this knowledge into the force field development is challenging as it fundamentally differs from the way a rotameric library is constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Towse et al., 2016</xref>). Even without solutions to the above problems, our results clearly imply that the correlation-driven MD refinement is able to generate models with a quality consistent with well-established methods given the map quality.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have established and validated the accuracy and convergence of CDMD by applying it to a diverse set of test cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) covering the most typical refinement challenges posed by modern cryo-EM: starting models in conformational states distant from the target map, poor starting model geometry, highly heterogeneous local map resolution, multiscale fitting where local adjustments have to be balanced by global optimization, low- or medium-resolution maps where high-resolution features have to be drawn elsewhere, or combinations thereof. Our results demonstrate that all these challenges can be handled by CDMD without additional backbone- and rotamer-specific restraints or manual intervention. Yet, our method has a much higher radius of convergence than current non-MD methods, which is largely independent of the map resolution and which is comparable to that of the most recent MDFF versions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Singharoy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), namely, at least 6–7 Å in terms of the overall RMSD from the target state and at least 25 Å in terms of local deviations. We, once again, emphasize that some of the tested alternative approaches are not entirely optimal for the presented refinement cases, mainly due to the starting structures we used being too distant and/or containing RNA/DNA. The comparisons with the alternative methods, however, clearly illustrate the challenge of reconciling local refinement accuracy and large convergence radius, in which a proper treatment of concerted molecular motions plays a major role. Finally, the CorA case demonstrates that CDMD is capable of capturing biologically relevant conformational changes, thus underlining the advantage of using the correlation-based biasing potential for low-resolution refinements.</p><p>The dramatic recent advances in image collection and processing have resulted in cryo-EM densities being generated at an unprecedented pace, with the above challenges tightly interlaced. CDMD largely overcomes the shortcomings of the refinement methods available so far, namely, the poor convergence and accuracy when applied to maps with medium/low resolution (non-MD methods) or high resolution (MD-based flexible methods). Integrating well-established techniques, for example, the correlation biasing potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Orzechowski and Tama, 2008</xref>) or simulated annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brünger et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunger and Adams, 2002</xref>), into an optimized protocol involving a chemically accurate force field, adaptive resolution and the half-map-based validation scheme has finally allowed to overcome these shortcomings in an automated fashion. We note that our method can still be used for quick (re-)refinement of close starting models against high-resolution maps (for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,b</xref>) or as a tool for flexible fitting of distant atomic models into low-resolution maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), which underlines its flexibility and universality. Also, our implementation based on the highly scalable, GPU-accelerated GROMACS engine provides a good trade-off between refinement time and hardware cost (see the benchmark section in Materials and methods). In combination with modern de novo chain building tools, it provides a fully automated and human-bias-free framework for quantitative interpretation of modern cryo-EM data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Preparing maps and starting structures</title><p>Unless differently specified, VMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>) and UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) were used to perform all map and structure manipulations.

To this end, structure snapshots were extracted from the refinement trajectory and stripped of all waters, ions, hydrogens, and virtual sites.

The force constant was not further increased during the full map refinement as there was no longer a validation map to control overfitting.</p><p>The average structure from the last 5 ns of the full map refinement was used as the final model to calculate FSC<sub>full</sub> and for comparison with the deposited reference. All FSC calculations were done with the PDBe Fourier Shell Correlation Server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/validation/fsc/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/validation/fsc/</ext-link>).

X-ray scattering positions were consistently used to place hydrogen atoms with MolProbity (default option) for all models analyzed in this study. Using nuclear positions to place hydrogens led to a increase in the number of steric clashes by 15–20%. This number, however, never exceeded 0.4–0.5 for the models refined with our method or MDFF, as those had almost zero steric clashes by construction. Average FSC (FSC<sub>avg</sub>) was calculated by integrating the FSC curves over the resolution shells starting from 1/100 Å<sup>-1</sup> to 1/<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf108"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf109"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the full map resolution according to the 0.143 criterion (Equation 2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We note that the purpose of the half-map validation discribed above (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) is to find the optimal range of force constants that do not cause overfitting and yet guarantee good map-model agreement (e.g., in terms of FSC). For many cryo-EM reconstructions, half-maps are not always deposited, which, of course, does not preclude the use of our method. In such cases, it is possible to perform a series of independent refinements against the deposited full map using a range of target force constants and to select a final model(s) with the best map-model agreement and geometry (see the NSF refinement example). It is, however, strongly advised not to omit the half-map cross-validation because: (a) it is a computationally much less expensive strategy – one half-map refinement <italic>vs.</italic> 5–7 independent full map refinements per system, and (b) it gives more confidence in the final model’s accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Comparative refinement with alternative methods</title><p>Comparative refinement with Phenix, Rosetta, Refmac, and MDFF was performed using the most recent versions of the respective software packages.

Jelly-body restraints on the current interatomic distances and local NCS restraints were enabled to improve the radius of convergence. To identify the optimal weight between geometry and experimental data, we performed multiple refinement runs with weights starting at 0.0001 and doubling at every next run until the value of 0.1 was reached. The optimal weight was determined using the half-map validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2015</xref>) and by assessing the model geometry with MolProbity, which was typically on the order of 0.001–0.01 for protein systems.</p><p>NAMD 2.13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>) was compiled with Intel Compiler 18.0, Intel MPI 2018 and without CUDA support.

Only backbone atoms were allowed to feel the fitting potential due to the lack of side chain density information, and all the other atoms were subjected only to molecular dynamics. We additionally tested two versions of the above protocol: with secondary structure, chirality and <italic>cis</italic> peptide bond restraints being enabled to minimize the risk of overfitting and without such restraints for consistency with our method. The optimal GSCALE value for the CorA system was ∼0.1. Higher values led to strong structure distortions even in the presence of restraints.

Calculations of the Coulomb and Van der Waals potentials and forces were offloaded to the GPU. Irrespective of the number of atoms in the simulated system, refinement performance was mainly dictated by the number of grid points in the density map, which explains the order of magnitude difference in timings between the tubulin (smallest) and the ribosome (largest) system. The highest performance was recorded on a single 24-core server node equipped with two consumer-class GPUs. In the non-ribosome cases, the complete refinement (half-map, full map, simulated annealing) took 0.4–2 days and 0.6–3.3 days on the faster hardware for the shortest and the longest protocols, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), respectively. The ribosome refinement took approximately 19 days using the shortest protocol. Currently, the density code used to calculate the correlation coefficient between the experimental and the simulated map poses a bottleneck. However, our preliminary code optimization for multiple GPU node usage showed almost a three fold performance improvement, bringing the refinement time for the ribosome system down to ∼6 days when running on 8 GPU nodes. Moreover, we expect an additional gain in performance by a factor of 2 due to a less computationally expensive representation of the simulated map, yielding ∼3.5 days for the ribosome refinement using the same number of GPU nodes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Structure availability</title><p>All refined structures presented in this work are provided as supplementary material.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Max Planck Society and the German Research Foundation via the research grant No. IG 109/1–1 (M Igaev) and FOR 1805 (AC Vaiana).

The basis of the method is the inclusion of a biasing term in a molecular dynamics potential that increases the overlap of the model with the experimental map. This approach is not new, and has been used in programs such as MDFF. The authors do describe a new approach to gradually increasing the resolution of the data in refinement, and the application of simulated annealing protocols. However, the limited novelty of the work, and other considerations significantly reduce my enthusiasm. Some important points for consideration:</p><p>In the Abstract the authors make several claims for the work:</p><p>&quot;The method utilizes a chemically accurate force field and exhaustive thermodynamic sampling while efficiently improving the cross-correlation between the modeled structure and the cryo-EM map. For several test systems of different size with resolutions 2.5-3.4 Å, it generates stereochemically accurate models from cryo-EM data with a low risk of overfitting. The presented automated framework allows efficient refinement of large molecular complexes such as the ribosome without manual intervention or any additional ad hoc restraints, providing a good balance between stereochemical accuracy, refinement time, and hardware requirements.&quot;</p><p>There are several problems:</p><p>- While it is true that the models are improved in some ways after the refinement protocol, in general the rotamer conformations are significantly poorer (outside the realm of what is acceptable for a protein structure), and the Ramachandran distributions also poorer. Therefore the claim of &quot;stereochemically accurate models&quot; is overreaching.</p><p>- &quot;Efficient refinement&quot; clearly means different things to different people. For the systems studied the methods described took between 2 and 25 days running on a multiple core system with 2 GPUs. For many researchers this would be considered very long run times, especially when there are other methods that produce comparable results in much shorter times.</p><p>- A minor quibble, but the phrase &quot;exhaustive thermodynamic sampling&quot;, suggests just that. However, the protocols described are unlikely to be exhaustive. They employ simulated annealing methods which do expand the conformational space that is sampled, but not exhaustively.</p><p>There are other issues that need to be considered:</p><p>- The authors apply their method to 4 test cases, including a large ribosome structure. However, this is a limited sampling of models, and in particular doesn't include models with very poor starting geometries. All 4 test cases are of high quality to begin with – as judged by the EMRinger score, Molprobity score and other presented criteria. The manuscript would be much more persuasive if it presented results for a larger number of structures – it should be noted that other researchers have applied automated refinement methods to all suitable cryo-EM structures available from the Protein Data Bank. In particular it would be helpful to see results for models with significant initial structural errors.</p><p>- The work, as presented, focuses on higher resolution cryo-EM data (3Å or higher is stated in the Abstract). There is definitely a need for accurate refinement methods at these resolutions. However, the quality of starting models at these resolutions is typically very high, and often don't present significant challenges for refinement algorithms. In addition, it is worth noting that, as of a few weeks ago, there are 107 structures from 3Å or better cryo-EM data, 808 structures between 3Å and 4Å resolution, and 515 structures between 4Å and 5Å resolution. The 3.5Å to 5Å resolution range often presents some serious challenges for both model building and subsequent refinement. The application of the methods to 3.1Å and 3.5Å test cases in the manuscript is applauded. However, the manuscript would have been more exciting if it presented a more thorough analysis of the application of the method at resolutions worse that 3.5Å.</p><p>- The authors could consider test cases where there is some higher resolution &quot;gold standard&quot; available to validate the results of refinement with lower resolution data. This is, of course, non-trivial, but very helpful in confirming the accuracy and radius of convergence of the refinement method.</p><p>- As noted above, much of what is described has been introduced in earlier works, so the novelty is limited. The approach to a gradual increase in data resolution is interesting – blurring of the model density only. However, the authors don't demonstrate that this is an improvement over previous methods.</p><p>- Simulated annealing has been already applied in other programs for model to map fitting (DEN, MDFF). This is also used, as an option, in the phenix.real_space_refine program.</p><p>- Other approaches to model refinement have been implemented, with the goal of stereochemical quality and computational efficiency. In particular the phenix.real_space_refine program is not mentioned in the manuscript. This program has been used for the successful refinement of many cryo-EM models.</p><p>- In the description of the proteasome 3.1A refinement it is stated that &quot;The improved quality statistics for our model (Figure 4A, top-right) now indicate that the conformations of these loops were refined more accurately&quot;. How do the authors know this? The model may have improved overall, while the confirmation of these particular loops may be worse after refinement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The major goal of this paper is to use molecule dynamics simulations to improve the fit and geometry of structures refined against high resolution (better than 4A) maps from single particle cryoEM. The principle contribution is to combine advances (classic work on simulated annealing, MDFF, and recent work from the Tama group) with improved MD and map calculation codes. The manuscript is beautifully formatted and the figures are very clear. The software is benchmarked against a very limited set of targets, focusing on experimental data and previously known crystal structures, which mimics its potential application in the real world. The ribosome dataset seems to be the only one somewhat challenging case, but even that consists largely of a rigid body rotation with few internal degrees of freedom changing during the low resolution part of the search. Given the long run time of the method, and the lack of comparisons against existing software (REFMAC, MDFF, phenix.real_space_refine), it is unclear how widely used this package will become. The major weaknesses of the manuscript are lack of benchmarking against these methods and whether the radius of convergence will hold for poorer starting models (e.g. structures based on homology modeling, etc.).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Automated cryo-EM structure refinement using correlation-driven molecular dynamics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Axel Brunger as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: James S Fraser (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the reviewers believe that this paper would be of considerable general interest, provided that the validity of the method can be demonstrated in a convincing way. They continue to feel, however, that the demonstration that the method performs better than alternative methods is still not convincing. After discussion, we are prepared to consider a revised manuscript that addresses the concerns raised by reviewers. The eventual acceptance of this paper hinges on a satisfactory resolution of these issues. We recognize that the revisions would require a substantial amount of new work. If this is not possible, you might choose to submit this work elsewhere in its present form.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this revised manuscript, the authors have addressed many, but not all, of the concerns that were raised. The use of a &quot;complete&quot; empirical force field (rather than the simplified force fields commonly used in macromolecular refinement packages) seems to contribute to the differences when compared with other methods, along with the use of simulated annealing, and ramping up the resolution. While each of these individual approaches is not new, the authors suggest that the combination of them produces better quality EM structures. If this claim can be substantiated, it would represent a welcome new tool in the arsenal of refinement tools for EM structures. However, we are not convinced that the current manuscript definitely demonstrates such superiority, and major revisions are required for further consideration of this manuscript as outlined in the following.</p><p>Critical points to address:</p><p>1) Overall, while the manuscript has been improved by inclusion of multiple test-cases of different quality maps and comparisons to alternative (standard) methods. However, distinct alternative approaches were used for each test case and not applied across all examples. For example, MDFF was initially developed primarily for lower (~5-10 A) resolution cases, but is not used for the CorA example here (perhaps the strongest new result in the paper). Please consistently use a common set of alternative (standard) methods for all cases, and, additionally, use methods such as MDFF for the low resolution cases.</p><p>2) NSF test case, subsection “N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF): comparison with Phenix”: for the re-refinement of the recent NSF/SNAP/SNARE EM single particle structure by White et al., 2018 (Figure 7 in the paper), the most significant advantage appears to be the substantially lower clash score compared to phenix refinement. The authors seem to be able to do better (especially for the clash score), without extensive grid searching (at least as far as we can tell). However, the clashscore itself does not indicate if their refined models are closer to the true structure. We had previously asked for the CABLAM analysis that should be included. Nevertheless, ultimately, the question arises if the re-refined structure is closer to the true structure of the 20S complex. Since there is no higher resolution structure of the entire complex available, the authors could test the quality of their refinement with the D2 domain of NSF by comparing it with the available high-resolution crystal structures.</p><p>Other important points to address:</p><p>1) NSF test case: &quot;Finally we again point out the strong anti-correlation between the number of steric clashes and rotamer/Ramachandran outliers in the deposited reference and our models (discussed later in the Results section).” Which anti-correlation does this statement refer to?</p><p>2) Figure 7: the deposited 6MDO structure (referred to as the &quot;reference&quot; structure) actually has rather reasonable geometry. The improvement by the author's method is primarily a reduction of the clash score (Figure 7B). Please comment and speculate about the reasons (e.g., use of an accurate force field might clean up poorly determined regions?). Note that the Ramachandran statistics also slightly improves, contrary to the suggested anti-correlation (see previous point).</p><p>3) Figure 7A: Please calculate the heat map but compared to 6MDO instead of 3J94 as well since 6MDO and 3J94 are not equivalent models (e.g., they just pasted the SNAP-25 N terminal residues into 3J94, in which those residues do not exist in 3J94).</p><p>4) Figure 7A: it appears that their method mostly fixed the geometry of the solvent exposed parts of the model, so likely the ATP binding pocket is pretty much the same? These differences could possibly also arise from changes in rigid body positions of the domains in the hexamer. Please comment.</p><p>5) Figure 7: clarify how the various parameters for their refinement were chosen. Was there a lot of trial and error involved?</p><p>6) &quot;Furthermore, the NSF refinement demonstrates the usefulness of the half-map-based cross-validation procedure as, for a refinement against a full map only, much more refinement runs have to done to identify the optimal map bias&quot;. Where is it is shown that more refinement runs have to be performed without access to half maps?</p><p>7) The question of whether a single model or an ensemble is more appropriate is worth discussing. For example, the three TRPV1 structures produced by independent refinement vary across the model (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), and may suggest that an ensemble refinement may be suitable. Moreover, the discussion of &quot;ideal geometry and over/underfitting&quot; in the last paragraph of the subsection “Force-field dependence of the model geometry” completely ignores the effect of conformational heterogeneity that may be related to the non-ideal nature of refining a single conformation against an EM map. Ensemble averaging misinterpreted as a single structure is a possible reason. See Rice, Shamoo and Brünger, 1998, and Burnley et al., 2012 for crystallographic multi-start and ensemble refinements, respectively, and Herzik, Fraser and Lander et al., 2018 and Bonomi, Pellarin and Vendruscolo, et al.2018 for EM structure ensemble refinement. On the other hand, low determinacy of 3D classification and refinement of the particles may be another reason for the non-ideal nature of the refinement. These two issues are likely convoluted and represent a major challenge for the interpretation of single particle EM data. The authors are not expected to perform ensemble refinements, but rather, a discussion of this point is requested.</p><p>8) Note that the use of an empirical force field for crystallographic refinement was first suggested by Brunger et al., 1987, and re-investigated in more recent papers, e.g., Fenn et al., 2011. A discussion of this point would be appropriate.</p><p>9) How were the MolProbity statistics calculated? There are some subtleties that might need to be taken into consideration. By default Molprobity uses bond lengths for hydrogen atoms that are centered on the X-ray scattering position (electron cloud), as opposed to the nuclear position of the atom – i.e. the former is shorter than the latter (see Protein Sci. 2018, 27:293-315). This can have some consequences depending on the workflow. If MolProbity is given a model containing hydrogen atoms whose positions have been defined using nuclear positions the clash score may be reported as high. Alternatively, if a model is optimized using nuclear position hydrogen atoms, and these are removed, MolProbity automatically adds hydrogen atoms at the electron cloud position, resulting in systematically low clash scores. The authors should consider their protocol in light of this, and make it clear what was done in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>10) Is a complete model a requirement for the method? In the Materials and methods section it appears that any missing residues in the test structures were &quot;filled in&quot; using homology modeling or other approaches. Is this mandatory? If so it needs to be clearly communicated in the paper. The creation of parts of models for which there is no clear experimental data to support that model are questionable.</p><p>11) The authors make an interesting argument about clashes and side- and mainchain outliers. However, arguing that a very low clash score and a significant number of geometry outliers is reasonable stretches credulity. It is well known from high resolution structures what the expectations are for outliers. It is also observed that at lower resolution it becomes increasingly hard to determine correct rotamer and mainchain conformations based on the experimental data. The authors might be better off to emphasize that they are able to create models with a quality consistent with many other methods at this resolution, often better than the starting models, and accept that there is room for improvement.</p><p>12) The authors should be clear what they mean when they use the phrase &quot;overfitting&quot; in this context. There is often confusion about this term's meaning – e.g. fitting of noise, model correctness, determination of the optimal protocol.</p><p>13) It would seem appropriate to mention the work of Sanbonmatsu and colleagues: Kirmizialtin et al., 2015.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Automated cryo-EM structure refinement using correlation-driven molecular dynamics&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The application to NSF shows that the method can obtain a model that is closer to the true structure as assessed by the agreement with the high-resolution crystal structures of the NSF D2 domain. In particular, the improved placement of the nucleotide is impressive. However, there are some remaining minor issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1.

You are correct in their assertion that the CDMD procedure has a larger radius of convergence than the Refmac, Phenix and Rosetta procedures. However, while it is very much appreciated that making use of other programs can be challenging, it is probable that some of the protocols used are not optimal for the particular cases being studied. For example, in the case of phenix.real_space_refine the default protocols are appropriate for refinement of models close to correct, i.e. not significantly displaced from the cryo-EM volume (globally or locally). Moreover, the protocol outlined in White et al., 2018 helps extend the radius of convergence. However, for models that have more significant starting errors, morphing is an important option for increasing the radius of convergence. It can also be necessary to run more refinement cycles to increase the convergence radius. Please comment in the Discussion.</p><p>3. The benchmark information in Table 2 is likely to be confusing for many readers (the timings provided in the Benchmark text are very useful). Would it be possible to provide statistics in the form of total run times for refinements in a table form?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43542.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>Many thanks for handling our manuscript and for the constructive feedback. It has helped us to completely rewrite and re-structure our manuscript. As you will see from our detailed replies to the reviewers’ comments below, we have now addressed all major issues, with a particular emphasis on the two main ones: (1) As requested, we now provide a thorough assessment of our method using a much larger and more diverse set of test cases, covering the most typical refinement challenges posed by modern cryo-EM: poor starting models, low- and medium-resolution maps, highly heterogeneous local map resolutions, or combinations thereof. (2) Concerning the lack of comparison to other methods in the original manuscript, we now carefully analyze and discuss in detail the differences between our results and previously published structures refined with other widely used methods, in terms of both model accuracy and potential of overfitting. For some test cases, we now present a direct comparison to the most recent versions of the well-established methods (Rosetta, ReMDFF and Phenix). Overall, we are convinced that the manuscript now meets the high standards of <italic>eLife</italic> and provides a substantial contribution to the field.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Please comment on optimization of the resolution ramp, relative weight (force constant), and simulated annealing temperature vs. simulation time. The Materials and methods section suggests that somewhat different refinement protocols were used for each of the four example systems. What rationale was used to design these different protocols? More generally, please provide a guideline for selecting the various parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the rationale behind the protocols and the choice of the refinement parameters (resolution and force constant ramps, simulated annealing temperature etc.) was not sufficiently explained in the original manuscript. We have now added this information as well as a schematic representation of the refinement and validation protocols in a supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The Materials and methods section now also contains guidelines for selecting the various parameters and protocol durations. The tutorial containing instructions and files necessary to set up the aldolase refinement (Figure 3) additionally explains technical aspects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a lack of a comparison to methods that are implemented in other programs, such as Phenix or Refmac. In particular, Phenix does have a simulated annealing option, although it does not use a full force field.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been completely revised to include (a) more test systems to challenge the method in different, orthogonal ways (Figures 3-10), (b) a more detailed analysis and discussion of the obtained models in the context of the previously published structures, and (c) direct comparisons to other widely used refinement methods (see Figure 5 for a COOT comparison, Figure 6A, B for a Rosetta comparison, Figure 6C, D for a ReMDFF comparison, and Figure 7 for a Phenix comparison). More specific changes are described further below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Afonine et al., 2018, showed that judicious use of restraints improves the quality of real-space refinement against medium/low cryo-EM density maps. The presence of such additional restraints may be beneficial during the low-resolution stages of the refinement. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that rotamer, Ramachandran and secondary structure restraints used in some refinement algorithms have been shown to improve the quality of fitted structures in some cases, we prefer not to mix force field parameters and knowledge-based restraints. We think that modern atomistic force fields should already contain all necessary information to maintain accurate model geometries and, therefore, that the addition of knowledge-based restraints may create conflicting optimization goals. Therefore, our approach, by construction, does not contain such restraints. As demonstrated by the structure quality assessment for all of the refined systems, our approach also does not require those. The use of the “soft” (global) correlation biasing potential further reduces the risk of structural deteriorations.</p><p>Of course, our implementation technically allows one to introduce such restraints, which are already part of the GROMACS functionality.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] In the Abstract the authors make several claims for the work:</p><p>&quot;The method utilizes a chemically accurate force field and exhaustive thermodynamic sampling while efficiently improving the cross-correlation between the modeled structure and the cryo-EM map. For several test systems of different size with resolutions 2.5-3.4 Å, it generates stereochemically accurate models from cryo-EM data with a low risk of overfitting. The presented automated framework allows efficient refinement of large molecular complexes such as the ribosome without manual intervention or any additional ad hoc restraints, providing a good balance between stereochemical accuracy, refinement time, and hardware requirements.&quot;</p><p>There are several problems:</p><p>- While it is true that the models are improved in some ways after the refinement protocol, in general the rotamer conformations are significantly poorer (outside the realm of what is acceptable for a protein structure), and the Ramachandran distributions also poorer. Therefore the claim of &quot;stereochemically accurate models&quot; is overreaching.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that, for some of our models, the Ramachandran distributions were poorer after refinement as compared to the deposited reference structures. It would be nevertheless highly surprising if it were not the case. While the deposited structures (except for the ReMDFF model) were built with structural restraints enforced and, therefore, by construction, did not violate the “ideal” rotamer and Ramachandran distributions, this came at the cost of significant steric clashes (in many cases tens per thousand atoms or more). In contrast, the force field in our approach avoided steric clashes at the cost of, in our view, tolerable rotamer and Ramachandran outliers. Furthermore, the above situation is far from being the general rule – in fact, we saw improvements in rotamer geometries for the TRPV1 (Figure 5, Figure 6C, D) and nucleosome (Figure 8) systems which came together with the drastic reduction in steric clashes, and the rotamer quality of the tubulin system (Figure 4) was comparable with that of the higher-resolution control structures. The TRPV1 (Figure 6C, D) and ribosome (Figure 9) cases, in turn, demonstrated that increased Ramachandran outliers are not a strict trend and can be reduced by our method.</p><p>We have now added a new section at the end of the Results, where we specifically summarize – using now a much larger set of test cases – the structure quality statistics aggregated from all the test cases and thoroughly discuss the “acceptability” of rotamer and Ramachandran outliers in the general context of structure refinement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- &quot;Efficient refinement&quot; clearly means different things to different people. For the systems studied the methods described took between 2 and 25 days running on a multiple core system with 2 GPUs. For many researchers this would be considered very long run times, especially when there are other methods that produce comparable results in much shorter times.</p><p>- Other approaches to model refinement have been implemented, with the goal of stereochemical quality and computational efficiency. In particular the phenix.real_space_refine program is not mentioned in the manuscript. This program has been used for the successful refinement of many cryo-EM models.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer notes that the computational efficiency of our refinement method is below that of several other methods. Although these methods do achieve shorter run times, we respectfully disagree with the statement that the obtained results are comparable. Whereas these methods perform similarly well for maps at near-atomic resolution (Figure 3 and Figure 6A, B), the additional hard test cases we now show that our method performs better, in particular at low and spatially heterogeneous local resolutions. Concerning the run times, for small to medium-sized systems (Figure 3-8 and Figure 10), these range from 0.5 to 3 days, which we would consider acceptable given the higher quality of the resulting models and the method’s universality. For large systems (Figure 9), the refinement performance is mainly dictated by the large number of grid points in the density map, which is indeed the main bottleneck in the current implementation of the density calculation code. Preliminary code optimization for multiple GPU node usage showed almost a 3-fold performance improvement, thus bringing the refinement time for the ribosome system down to 6-7 days when running on 8 GPU-nodes. Moreover, we expect an additional gain in performance by a factor of 2 due to a less computationally expensive representation of the simulated map, eventually yielding ~3.5 days for the ribosome refinement using the same number of GPU nodes. For a fully automated method, we think this is acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A minor quibble, but the phrase &quot;exhaustive thermodynamic sampling&quot;, suggests just that. However, the protocols described are unlikely to be exhaustive. They employ simulated annealing methods which do expand the conformational space that is sampled, but not exhaustively.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have removed this phrasing in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are other issues that need to be considered:</p><p>- The authors apply their method to 4 test cases, including a large ribosome structure. However, this is a limited sampling of models, and in particular doesn't include models with very poor starting geometries. All 4 test cases are of high quality to begin with – as judged by the EMRinger score, Molprobity score and other presented criteria. The manuscript would be much more persuasive if it presented results for a larger number of structures – it should be noted that other researchers have applied automated refinement methods to all suitable cryo-EM structures available from the Protein Data Bank. In particular it would be helpful to see results for models with significant initial structural errors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the previous set of test cases was limited and did not entirely reflect the full spectrum of refinement challenges posed by modern cryo-EM. In the revised manuscript, following the reviewer’s advice, we have substantially extended the set of refinement cases to include more challenging systems. We particularly added cases for which the starting structures had significant initial errors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The work, as presented, focuses on higher resolution cryo-EM data (3Å or higher is stated in the Abstract). There is definitely a need for accurate refinement methods at these resolutions. However, the quality of starting models at these resolutions is typically very high, and often don't present significant challenges for refinement algorithms. In addition, it is worth noting that, as of a few weeks ago, there are 107 structures from 3Å or better cryo-EM data, 808 structures between 3Å and 4Å resolution, and 515 structures between 4Å and 5Å resolution. The 3.5Å to 5Å resolution range often presents some serious challenges for both model building and subsequent refinement. The application of the methods to 3.1Å and 3.5Å test cases in the manuscript is applauded. However, the manuscript would have been more exciting if it presented a more thorough analysis of the application of the method at resolutions worse that 3.5Å.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we agree that considering only high-resolution cases (~3.5 Å or higher) was insufficient to assess the method’s convergence and accuracy. In the new, extended set of test cases, a much wider range of resolutions (2.6-7.1 Å) is covered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors could consider test cases where there is some higher resolution &quot;gold standard&quot; available to validate the results of refinement with lower resolution data. This is, of course, non-trivial, but very helpful in confirming the accuracy and radius of convergence of the refinement method.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have now included such a test case (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- As noted above, much of what is described has been introduced in earlier works, so the novelty is limited. The approach to a gradual increase in data resolution is interesting – blurring of the model density only. However, the authors don't demonstrate that this is an improvement over previous methods.</p><p>- Simulated annealing has been already applied in other programs for model to map fitting (DEN, MDFF). This is also used, as an option, in the phenix.real_space_refine program.</p><p>- Other approaches to model refinement have been implemented, with the goal of stereochemical quality and computational efficiency. In particular the phenix.real_space_refine program is not mentioned in the manuscript. This program has been used for the successful refinement of many cryoEM models.</p></disp-quote><p>Although many individual components of the proposed refinement method are, indeed, not new (e.g., correlation biasing potential or simulated annealing), the actual novelty is the integration of these components into an automated protocol involving a chemically accurate force field, the &quot;soft&quot; (nonlocal) correlation biasing potential coupled to adaptive resolution, and the half-map-based validation scheme, and we demonstrate, using the extended set of refinement cases, that this is indeed an improvement over previous methods. Unlike other methods, this integration allows fully automated refinement into density maps with heterogeneous local resolutions, as typical of modern cryo-EM maps. We now also explicitly compare our results to the deposited reference models and discuss in the context of other refinement methods used, including the most recent version of phenix.real_space_refine (Afonine et al., 2018) with optimized target functions (White et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the description of the proteasome 3.1A refinement it is stated that &quot;The improved quality statistics for our model (Figure 4A, top-right) now indicate that the conformations of these loops were refined more accurately&quot;. How do the authors know this? The model may have improved overall, while the confirmation of these particular loops may be worse after refinement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed the proteasome refinement case from the revised manuscript, as it was very similar to the aldolase refinement (Figure 3) both in terms of map resolution and starting structure quality.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major goal of this paper is to use molecule dynamics simulations to improve the fit and geometry of structures refined against high resolution (better than 4A) maps from single particle cryoEM. The principle contribution is to combine advances (classic work on simulated annealing, MDFF, and recent work from the Tama group) with improved MD and map calculation codes. The manuscript is beautifully formatted and the figures are very clear. The software is benchmarked against a very limited set of targets, focusing on experimental data and previously known crystal structures, which mimics its potential application in the real world. The ribosome dataset seems to be the only one somewhat challenging case, but even that consists largely of a rigid body rotation with few internal degrees of freedom changing during the low resolution part of the search. Given the long run time of the method, and the lack of comparisons against existing software (REFMAC, MDFF, phenix.real_space_refine), it is unclear how widely used this package will become. The major weaknesses of the manuscript are lack of benchmarking against these methods and whether the radius of convergence will hold for poorer starting models (e.g. structures based on homology modeling, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that all of the concerns raised by reviewer #3 have now been addressed, as described above. The fact that there was such a big overlap between these concerns and those of the other reviewers brought us to pay particular attention to (a) substantially expanding the set of challenging test cases and (b) comparing against existing methods (Phenix, Rosetta, MDFF, Refmac, COOT).</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Critical points to address:</p><p>1) Overall, while the manuscript has been improved by inclusion of multiple test-cases of different quality maps and comparisons to alternative (standard) methods. However, distinct alternative approaches were used for each test case and not applied across all examples. For example, MDFF was initially developed primarily for lower (~5-10 A) resolution cases, but is not used for the CorA example here (perhaps the strongest new result in the paper). Please consistently use a common set of alternative (standard) methods for all cases, and, additionally, use methods such as MDFF for the low resolution cases.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad the reviewers agree that the inclusion of more test cases has improved the original version of our manuscript. Further encouraged by the reviewers, we have added a full, “all-structures-by-all-methods” comparison using the same far-away starting structures across all test cases. Considering that many of the tested methods have <italic>not</italic> been originally optimized to work with distant starting models or DNA/RNA, we think that, taken together, these comparisons strengthen our main conclusions. These new comparisons indeed demonstrate that the correlation-driven MD refinement has a much larger radius of convergence than current non-MD methods. As requested, we also provide a comparative refinement of the CorA system (Figure 10) using MDFF, which has helped to gain a clearer picture.</p><p>The manuscript has been modified as follows:</p><p>- Phenix, Rosetta and Refmac have been chosen as alternative methods for comparison for the test cases in Figures 3-9. The radius-of-convergence analysis is shown in the supplementary figures corresponding to Figures 3-9. The results of the comparative refinements are additionally discussed as separate paragraphs in each of the Results subsections. A separate subsection in Materials and methods is dedicated to the description of the Phenix/Rosetta/Refmac refinement protocols.</p><p>- MDFF has been applied to the CorA system (Figure 10), and the corresponding refinement protocol is described in Materials and methods. For consistency with MDFF, we have re-refined the CorA starting structure with our method but using a different force field (CHARMM36m), as CHARMM22* used in Figures 3-9 has no version compatible with NAMD. This has also allowed a fairer comparison of our method with MDFF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) NSF test case, subsection “N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF): comparison with Phenix”: for the re-refinement of the recent NSF/SNAP/SNARE EM single particle structure by White et al., 2018 (Figure 7 in the paper), the most significant advantage appears to be the substantially lower clash score compared to phenix refinement. The authors seem to be able to do better (especially for the clash score), without extensive grid searching (at least as far as we can tell). However, the clashscore itself does not indicate if their refined models are closer to the true structure. We had previously asked for the CABLAM analysis that should be included. Nevertheless, ultimately, the question arises if the re-refined structure is closer to the true structure of the 20S complex. Since there is no higher resolution structure of the entire complex available, the authors could test the quality of their refinement with the D2 domain of NSF by comparing it with the available high-resolution crystal structures.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that an improvement (however pronounced it is) in any of the model quality metrics relatively to the published reference model does not per se indicate that the resulting model is closer to the “true structure”, and that a higher-quality control structure would be required for validation (ideally derived from a higher-resolution data set, e.g., X-ray). We therefore welcomed the suggestion by the reviewers and have validated our refined models in those test cases where higher resolution structures of either the entire refined system or parts of it were available (including NSF). The only exception was TRPV1 for which we could not find a high-resolution crystal structure of the channel or close homolog structures. The results of the validations are shown in panels D of Figures 39 and are now discussed in separate paragraphs in each of the Results subsections. Also following the request to calculate CaBLAM scores, all quality metrics including CaBLAM are now summarized in separate supplementary tables to each main text figure.</p><p>Regarding the grid searching mentioned by the reviewers, indeed, we did not perform any extensive parameter search as in the original study by White et al. The major challenge in this particular refinement case was the absence of the half-maps which could have drastically simplified the choice of the optimal force constant. As the half-maps were not available, we did a scan of the force constant space by performing seven independent refinements (instead of just one like in, e.g., Figure 3) with different target force constants (Figure 7B). The optimal force constant for the NSF system turned out to be close to the initial guess – 4-5 × 10<sup>5</sup> kJ / mol – which was comparable with the one we used to refine the TRPV1 system. Other than that, there was no trial and error involved. This has now been explained more clearly in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other important points to address:</p><p>1) NSF test case: &quot;Finally we again point out the strong anti-correlation between the number of steric clashes and rotamer/Ramachandran outliers in the deposited reference and our models (discussed later in the Results section).” Which anti-correlation does this statement refer to?</p></disp-quote><p>This statement refers to the reduction of steric clashes by our method that often comes at the price of increased rotamer and/or Ramachandran outliers, if one compares the refined models with the deposited ones. Examples are, <italic>e.g.</italic>, Figure 3b (bottom, gray vs. green), Figure 4B (bottom, gray and dark gray vs. cyan), Figure 6b (bottom, gray vs. pink, rotamers), Figure 9B (bottom, gray vs. orange, rotamers). We have now included a more detailed discussion of this observation in the last subsection of the Results (“Force field influence and model accuracy”). Additionally, we now avoid the repetitive use of this statement in the main text, mentioning it only once when describing the results of the aldolase refinement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 7: the deposited 6MDO structure (referred to as the &quot;reference&quot; structure) actually has rather reasonable geometry. The improvement by the author's method is primarily a reduction of the clash score (Figure 7B). Please comment and speculate about the reasons (e.g., use of an accurate force field might clean up poorly determined regions?). Note that the Ramachandran statistics also slightly improves, contrary to the suggested anti-correlation (see previous point).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have added a paragraph to the section dedicated to the NSF refinement (Figure 7) discussing the difference between the reference structure (6MDO) and our model in more detail. See also our response in point (4) below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 7A: Please calculate the heat map but compared to 6MDO instead of 3J94 as well since 6MDO and 3J94 are not equivalent models (e.g., they just pasted the SNAP-25 N terminal residues into 3J94, in which those residues do not exist in 3J94).</p></disp-quote><p>For each refinement case (Figures 3-10), panel (A) in the corresponding figures shows the per-residue (or per-nucleotide) RMSD between the distant starting structure and the deposited reference. The same applies to Figure 7A where the heat map shows the per-residue RMSD between 6MDO and the distant starting structure. This was not sufficiently clearly stated in the previous manuscript version and is now explicitly pointed out in the respective figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 7A: it appears that their method mostly fixed the geometry of the solvent exposed parts of the model, so likely the ATP binding pocket is pretty much the same? These differences could possibly also arise from changes in rigid body positions of the domains in the hexamer. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that the solvent exposed parts of the NSF model were improved in our model, this was not the only difference between our model and 6MDO. In fact, the validation using higher-resolution X-ray structures (referred to as “controls” in our work), as suggested by the reviewers in Critical point (2), has helped identify the ATP binding pocket as yet another region in the NSF protomers that also differs considerably between the two models. This validation has revealed that either the adenosine group of ATP is rotated by 90° or 180° (3 of 6 NSF protomers in 6MDO) or the phosphate tail of ATP deviates considerably from that of the controls (all protomers in 6MDO). In contrast, our model reproduced the structure of the ATP binding pocket equally well across the entire D2 hexamer. As mentioned above, we have added a paragraph to the NSF section discussing these aspects in more detail.</p><p>With respect to global rigid-body positioning of the domains in the hexamer, we have not found any difference between 6MDO and our model, which is also supported by the very similar reciprocal correlation at low spatial frequencies (Figure 7B, top).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 7: clarify how the various parameters for their refinement were chosen. Was there a lot of trial and error involved?</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to Critical point (2). The improved versions of the sections “Simulation setup and refinement” and “Cross-validation and stereochemical quality” in Materials and methods in combination with the protocol summary in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 now provide a guide for how the refinement parameters were chosen. In particular, we have added a paragraph to the section “Cross-validation and stereochemical quality” that specifically elucidates how to proceed in refinement situations in which the half-maps are not available.</p><p>In some cases, for example, several half-map refinements at different temperatures (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1) were performed to test the method’s robustness. In other cases (e.g., the nucleosome refinement), independent refinements with different force constants were done to test the underfitting hypothesis. Overall, very little trial and error was required – the fact that the whole refinement procedure is fully automated really paid off.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) &quot;Furthermore, the NSF refinement demonstrates the usefulness of the half-map-based cross-validation procedure as, for a refinement against a full map only, much more refinement runs have to done to identify the optimal map bias&quot;. Where is it is shown that more refinement runs have to be performed without access to half maps?</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to point (5). We have now clarified this issue in the revised manuscript by explicitly stating why and how the absence of half-maps affected the NSF refinement in the first paragraph of the corresponding section of the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The question of whether a single model or an ensemble is more appropriate is worth discussing. For example, the three TRPV1 structures produced by independent refinement vary across the model (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), and may suggest that an ensemble refinement may be suitable. Moreover, the discussion of &quot;ideal geometry and over/underfitting&quot; in the last paragraph of the subsection “Force-field dependence of the model geometry” completely ignores the effect of conformational heterogeneity that may be related to the non-ideal nature of refining a single conformation against an EM map. Ensemble averaging misinterpreted as a single structure is a possible reason. See Rice, Shamoo and Brünger, 1998, and Burnley et al., 2012 for crystallographic multi-start and ensemble refinements, respectively, and Herzik, Fraser and Lander, 2018 and Bonomi, Pellarin and Vendruscolo, 2018 for EM structure ensemble refinement. On the other hand, low determinacy of 3D classification and refinement of the particles may be another reason for the non-ideal nature of the refinement. These two issues are likely convoluted and represent a major challenge for the interpretation of single particle EM data. The authors are not expected to perform ensemble refinements, but rather, a discussion of this point is requested.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and thank the reviewers for pointing out these important issues and now discuss them in more detail in the last two paragraphs of the section “Force field influence and model accuracy”. Briefly, we now explicitly distinguish between the two sources of errors in our refined models: (a) conformational heterogeneity and poor 3D classification convoluted in cryo-EM data and (b) the imperfect nature of atomistic force fields. Each point is discussed in a separate paragraph. Besides citing the above literature on ensemble refinement, we also explicitly state that the present work is limited to single-structure refinements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Note that the use of an empirical force field for crystallographic refinement was first suggested by Brunger et al., 1987, and re-investigated in more recent papers, e.g., Fenn et al., 2011. A discussion of this point would be appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. The mentioned studies as well as a comprehensive review on the use of molecular dynamics in cryo-EM refinement by Sanbonmatsu and coworkers are now cited and acknowledged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) How were the MolProbity statistics calculated? There are some subtleties that might need to be taken into consideration. By default Molprobity uses bond lengths for hydrogen atoms that are centered on the X-ray scattering position (electron cloud), as opposed to the nuclear position of the atom – i.e. the former is shorter than the latter (see Protein Sci. 2018, 27:293-315). This can have some consequences depending on the workflow. If MolProbity is given a model containing hydrogen atoms whose positions have been defined using nuclear positions the clash score may be reported as high. Alternatively, if a model is optimized using nuclear position hydrogen atoms, and these are removed, MolProbity automatically adds hydrogen atoms at the electron cloud position, resulting in systematically low clash scores. The authors should consider their protocol in light of this, and make it clear what was done in the Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>This information, indeed, was not provided in the previous manuscript version. Throughout the study, we consistently used X-ray scattering positions (electron cloud, default option) for all structures. When using the nuclear position option in MolProbity, we noticed that the number of steric clashes increased by 15-20%. This, however, had almost no effect on the MolProbity scores of the structures refined with our method or MDFF (CorA in Figure 10), as those had almost zero steric clashes by construction, independently of the hydrogen placement option used. We have now made this clear and have added all required details in the section “Cross-validation and stereochemical quality” in Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Is a complete model a requirement for the method? In the Materials and methods section it appears that any missing residues in the test structures were &quot;filled in&quot; using homology modeling or other approaches. Is this mandatory? If so it needs to be clearly communicated in the paper. The creation of parts of models for which there is no clear experimental data to support that model are questionable.</p></disp-quote><p>The short answer is no. While it is true that missing parts in the starting structures were filled in using MODELLER or by copying them from other structures (unrelated to both refinement and validation), this is generally not required for the method’s application. The filled-in parts in the starting structures can be split into two groups: (a) parts that are missing in the starting structures and reflected in the density in which case they are allowed to feel the correlation biasing potential, and (b) missing parts that are not reflected in the density and, hence, are subjected only to the atomistic force field. The latter were added for completeness but were later excluded in all subsequent analyses.</p><p>A new paragraph at the end of the section “Preparing maps and starting structures” in Materials and methods now clearly communicates whether or not starting structures need to be complete prior to refinement with our method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors make an interesting argument about clashes and side- and mainchain outliers. However, arguing that a very low clash score and a significant number of geometry outliers is reasonable stretches credulity. It is well known from high resolution structures what the expectations are for outliers. It is also observed that at lower resolution it becomes increasingly hard to determine correct rotamer and mainchain conformations based on the experimental data. The authors might be better off to emphasize that they are able to create models with a quality consistent with many other methods at this resolution, often better than the starting models, and accept that there is room for improvement.</p></disp-quote><p>Considering the discussions in Critical point (2) and point (7), we fully agree with this statement and have rewritten the last paragraph of the section “Force field influence and model accuracy” in the Results part accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The authors should be clear what they mean when they use the phrase &quot;overfitting&quot; in this context. There is often confusion about this term's meaning – e.g. fitting of noise, model correctness, determination of the optimal protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and now provide a statement at the beginning of the subsection “Refinement” about how the term “overfitting” should be understood in the structure refinement context. In fact, the concept of overfitting validation is already incorporated in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 describing our refinement protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) It would seem appropriate to mention the work of Sanbonmatsu and colleagues: Kirmizialtin et al., 2015.</p></disp-quote><p>The work is cited and acknowledged in the Introduction.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Please provide the CABLAM and other statistics (provided in the supplemental files as. tex files) as proper tables.</p></disp-quote><p>We were previously asked by the <italic>eLife</italic> editorial support to provide all supplementary tables as separate editable files and include only legends for them in the main article file. For this resubmission, we have compiled the supplementary tables into a single. pdf file and appended it to the end of the main article file (after supplementary figures), as requested. The tables are still available as editable. tex files.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. You are correct in their assertion that the CDMD procedure has a larger radius of convergence than the Refmac, Phenix and Rosetta procedures. However, while it is very much appreciated that making use of other programs can be challenging, it is probable that some of the protocols used are not optimal for the particular cases being studied. For example, in the case of phenix.real_space_refine the default protocols are appropriate for refinement of models close to correct, i.e. not significantly displaced from the cryo-EM volume (globally or locally).</p></disp-quote><p>It is, indeed, true that the tested alternative protocols are not entirely optimal for the presented refinement cases. This is mostly due to the distant starting structures we used to test CDMD. Expectedly, the alternative methods applied to the same distant structures yielded poorer results. Although they were somewhat better than we initially anticipated: for example, the aldolase model generated by Rosetta looked promising, but given the fact that Rosetta was also used to generate the reference aldolase model (5VY3), this result was not surprising. As mentioned in the previous response letters, this was the reason why we refrained from the complete “all-to-all” comparisons in the previous manuscript version. However, we are now convinced that this comparison is necessary and clearly illustrates the challenge of reconciling local refinement accuracy and large convergence radius, in which a proper treatment of concerted molecular motions plays a major role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the protocol outlined in White et al., 2018 helps extend the radius of convergence. However, for models that have more significant starting errors, morphing is an important option for increasing the radius of convergence. It can also be necessary to run more refinement cycles to increase the convergence radius. Please comment in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>In all of our Phenix refinements, we switched off the morphing option because we were not expecting the deforming procedure implemented in Phenix (Terwilliger et al., 2012; iterative displacement and smoothing of atom positions in the vicinity each residue to maximize the map-model overlap) to improve the radius of convergence, exactly for the reason mentioned above. To further support this, we have repeated the Phenix refinement of NSF, but this time letting Phenix apply morphing in each macrocycle (this structure is attached to this resubmission; NSF_PHENIX_MORPH.pdb). We have not seen any significant improvements relative to the protocol without morphing in terms of RMSD to the reference structure, and for some solvent-exposed loops, the agreement with the map became even worse.</p><p>Concerning the number of refinement cycles, 15 macrocycles used in our Phenix protocols were largely sufficient. In fact, the correlation coefficient (CC<sub>mask</sub>) stopped increasing already after 7th-8th cycle in all of the refinements.</p><p>We have added a remark on the above issue in the Conclusion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The benchmark information in Table 2 is likely to be confusing for many readers (the timings provided in the Benchmark text are very useful). Would it be possible to provide statistics in the form of total run times for refinements in a table form?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We agree that providing only the MD simulation performance might be confusing and requires further recalculations to obtain the total run times. We have now added two columns to Table 2 showing the total refinement run times for the short and long protocol versions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
