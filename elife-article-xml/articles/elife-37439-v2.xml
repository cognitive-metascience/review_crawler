So far, only five lipoate-dependent multienzyme complexes have been characterized: three α-ketoacid dehydrogenases (pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase), acetoin dehydrogenase and the glycine cleavage complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cronan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cronan et al., 2005</xref>). In all of these enzymes, a specific subunit is modified by lipoic acid attachment to the ε-amino groups of specific lysine residues within conserved lipoyl domains. In the five characterized lipoylated enzyme complexes, lipoate acts both as an electrophile that binds to reaction intermediates (via a thioester or thioether bond) and as a swinging arm that channels the bound substrate between the active sites of different subunits. During catalysis, the intramolecular disulfide bond of lipoate cycles between oxidized lipoamide and reduced dihydrolipoamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reed and Hackert, 1990</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37439.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structures of lipoic acid and its reduced derivative dihydrolipoic acid.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-37439-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Comparative genome mining of sulfur-oxidizing prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quatrini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Venceslau et al., 2014</xref>), transcriptomic and proteomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Latorre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mangold et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osorio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ouyang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quatrini et al., 2009</xref>) as well as first biochemical evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boughanemi et al., 2016</xref>) indicated that a large group of archaeal and bacterial sulfur oxidizers utilize a novel pathway of sulfur oxidation involving a heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr)-like enzyme complex resembling the HdrABC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>) of methanogens, although a coenzyme M-coenzyme B (CoM-S-S-CoB) heterodisulfide is not present in the sulfur oxidizers. Recently, we provided conclusive genetic evidence that this complex is indeed essential for oxidation of thiosulfate to sulfate in <italic>Hyphomicrobium denitrificans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koch and Dahl, 2018</xref>).

The sulfur-oxidizing prokaryote genes (<italic>hdrC1B1A-hyp-hdrC2B2</italic>) encoding the Hdr-like complex are associated with genes encoding novel lipoate-binding proteins resembling GvcH, the lipoate-binding component of the bacterial glycine cleavage system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ehrenfeld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).

In <italic>E. coli</italic>, using exogenous lipoate requires LplA, a two domain lipoate-protein ligase. Lipoate is first activated to lipoyl-AMP at the expense of ATP. The N-terminal domain then transfers the lipoyl-group to the target protein. In contrast, endogenous lipoate synthesis proceeds through two steps: i. LipB-catalyzed transfer of an octanoyl group from octanoyl acyl carrier protein (octanoyl-ACP) to the apoprotein and ii. insertion of two sulfur atoms at C<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>8</sub> of the octanoyl chain catalyzed by the radical SAM protein lipoyl synthase (LipA).</p><p>Here, we set out to test for functional linkage between <italic>hdr-</italic>like sulfur oxidation genes with genes for lipoate-binding proteins together with the enzymes putatively involved in their modification.

With very few exceptions all these organisms are either established chemo- and photolithotrophs oxidizing reduced inorganic sulfur compounds or they have been reported as oxidizing mineral sulfides (FeS, FeS<sub>2</sub> and others) or volatile organic sulfur compounds (e.g. dimethylsulfide).

Bootstrap values given at branching points are based on 1000 replicates. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories (+<italic>G</italic>, parameter = 0.8540)).

First, we assayed the LplA-like protein for both the overall ligase reaction and the first partial reaction (activation of lipoic acid/octanoic acid with ATP to form lipoyl/octanoyl-AMP intermediate) of the ligase reaction. In the absence of an acceptor protein, synthesis of both octanoyl-adenylate and lipoyl-adenylate intermediates were readily demonstrated by use of ATP labeled in the α-phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Moreover, upon addition of an acceptor protein, LbpA1 or LbpA2, the adenylate intermediates were hydrolyzed to AMP. This was readily observed by the increased formation of AMP. This could be clearly observed by the increased levels of AMP. The overall lipoate ligase activity of LplA-like proteins was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Lipoylated Lbp proteins had a mass increase of about 185 Da for both Lbp proteins (184.5 Da for LbpA1 and 186.2 for LpbA2) comparing with the unmodified forms (17457.1 Da for LbpA1 and 16410.7 for LbpA2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). The mass increases matched well with the expected value (188 Da) upon addition of a lipoyl group.

In most prokaryotes specialized for lithotrophic growth on reduced inorganic sulfur compounds like sulfide or thiosulfate, the initial steps occur outside of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Venceslau et al., 2014</xref>). These include the release of the more oxidized sulfone sulfur atom in thiosulfate as sulfate and/or the formation of polysulfide. The same holds true for <italic>H. denitrificans</italic> where sulfide is released from DMS and further processing is initiated in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eyice et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koch and Dahl, 2018</xref>). Subsequent oxidative reactions occur after transfer of the sulfur into the cytoplasm where it is processed in a protein-bound persulfidic state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Rhodanese- or DsrE-like sulfurtransferases as well as the sulfur carrier protein TusA appear to be of ubiquitous relevance for delivery of sulfane sulfur into the different enzymatic machineries generating sulfite, which is then usually further oxidized to sulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahl, 2015</xref>). Details of the sulfur oxidation route employing Hdr-like proteins are just emerging. The similarity of its components with subunits of archaeal heterodisulfide reductase points at (protein-bound) persulfide and/or disulfides (RSS<sup>-</sup>, RSSR) as possible substrates/intermediates in the reaction cycle. The LpbA protein is a prime candidate as a sulfur substrate-binding entity that might present the sulfur substrate to different catalytic sites of the Hdr-like complex. This idea is corroborated by in vitro studies with bovine and one microbial rhodanese showing that dihydrolipoate can serve as sulfane sulfur acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cianci et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silver and Kelly, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Villarejo and Westley, 1963a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">1963b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37439.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed function of LbpA proteins in the Hdr-like pathway of sulfur oxidation.</title><p>The TusA protein is proposed as a central sulfur carrier in the cytoplasm and collects sulfur stemming from the oxidation of organic and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds like DMS, methanethiol, sulfide or thiosulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koch and Dahl, 2018</xref>).

In the course of the reaction two of the four electrons released per reaction cycle may serve as reductants for dihydrolipoyl formation on LpbA. Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (indicated here as component E3 of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) then catalyzes reoxidation of the cofactor to lipoamide and concomitant reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup>.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-37439-fig8-v2"/></fig><p>Currently, the reason for the presence of two different LbpA proteins in some sulfur oxidizers is unexplained. Sequence comparison does not indicate conserved differences between obviously functionally important amino acids like cysteine between the LbpA1 and LbpA2 types. It should be noted that the E2 subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenases contain up to three related but non-identical lipoyl domains. Deletion of one or even two of these domains as well as permutation has no adverse effect on assembly and catalytic activity and it appears that the reach of the outermost domain is extended by the other two domains residing more inwards in the enormous assembled pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Group transfer and redox reactions are possible between lipoyl groups of E2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perham, 2000</xref>). It is likely that LbpAs from sulfur oxidizers serve a similar substrate-channeling function and that more than a single LbpA monomer is present and functional in the mature Hdr-like multienzyme system. Gene duplication may have occurred allowing more efficient protein production followed by independent evolution of both genes. The reaction center subunits of phototrophic bacteria are probably the most prominent example for such an evolutionary history. In that case, an original protein homodimer encoded by one gene evolved into a heterodimer of two related yet distinct proteins after gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blankenship, 2010</xref>).</p><p>With the exception of the sulfite/sulfate couple the midpoint reduction potential of reduced sulfur compounds and their oxidation products is more positive than that of the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH couple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thauer et al., 1977</xref>). It is therefore generally put forward that the production of NADH and NADPH ultimately needed for carbon dioxide fixation in sulfur-oxidizing lithoautotrophs requires reverse electron flow from quinol onto NAD<sup>+</sup> at the expense of proton motive force. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the presence of lipoate as a key cofactor in the Hdr-like sulfur-oxidizing system bears the possibility that two of the four electrons released in the catalyzed reaction (R-S-S<sup>-</sup> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O → R-S<sup>-</sup> + HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + 5 H<sup>+</sup>) are used to generate dihydrolipoamide during the reaction cycle. Since the lipoamide/dihydrolipoamide system possesses one of the lowest standard biological redox potentials (E<sup>0</sup>’=−0.29 V), the electrons released upon reoxidation of dihydrolipoamide can be directly transferred onto NAD<sup>+</sup>. This reaction could considerably reduce the need for energy-demanding reverse electron flow in lithoautotrophic sulfur oxidizers. In fact, a gene for a <italic>bona fide</italic> dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase is tightly linked with the <italic>hdr</italic>-gene cluster in sulfur oxidizing archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Such a gene is not apparent in bacterial <italic>hdr-</italic>like gene clusters but the function may be provided by an E3 subunit that is shared with the lipoate-dependent 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases just as the same E3 is used for pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steiert et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>The lipoate-binding proteins studied in this work are specifically designed for sulfur oxidation.

The LpbA proteins involved in sulfur oxidation obviously differ so much from GvcH proteins that they are not recognized by the GvcH maturation enzymes but are specifically modified by lipoate-protein ligases encoded in the same gene cluster.</p><p>Our finding that TkLplA is an active lipoyl/octanoyl ligase despite lacking the small C-terminal domain seen in all other lipoate ligases studied to date was unexpected. As mentioned above the small domain can be covalently attached to either terminus of the large domain or be a separate subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cronan, 2016</xref>). However, the role of this domain/subunit in the ligase mechanism is unclear. Prior work showed that both domains are required for the overall reaction and for lipoyl-adenylate formation whereas only the large domain was required for transfer of lipoate from the adenylate to the acceptor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao and Cronan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christensen and Cronan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McManus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Posner et al., 2013</xref>). The exact role of the small auxiliary domain remains obscure despite crystal structures of the isolated large domain, the isolated small domain and two-domain complex from the bipartite <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic> ligase. Apparently, all of the catalytic machinery lies in the large domain. This is where ATP binds and forms the adenylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Posner et al., 2013</xref>). However, the large domain cannot synthesize lipoyl-adenylate without interaction with the small domain. This interaction requires substrate and upon association both domains undergo marked conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Posner et al., 2013</xref>). It seems clear that conformational changes in the large domain that occur upon binding substrate and interaction with the small domain somehow trigger the overall ligase reaction. If this is the case, how does HdLplA and TkLplA function as a ligase without a small domain? The most straightforward hypothesis is that the lipoate-binding proteins LbpA1 and LbpA2 not only act as lipoate acceptors but also have a motif that triggers the conformational change usually engendered by the small domain. If so, this could explain the inability of either the HdLplA/TkLplA ligase or LbpA1 and LbpA2 binding proteins to interact with the ligases and acceptor domains of central metabolism proteins of other bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Media and chemicals</title><p> <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains were grown on LB rich or M9 minimal media under aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sambrook et al., 1989</xref>) at 37°C unless otherwise indicated. <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> strains were grown on LB medium at 30°C. <italic>H. denitrificans</italic> strains were cultivated in minimal media kept at pH 7.2 with 100 mM 3<italic>-</italic>(N<italic>-</italic>Morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer and containing per liter: 1 g NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 0.2 g MgSO<sub>4</sub> × 7 H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.5 g NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> × 2 H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.55 g K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and 0.2 ml l<sup>−1</sup> trace element solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vishniac and Santer, 1957</xref>).

Are both of the enzymes important, is the presence of two Lpls functional redundancy or complementarity (e.g. are the two proteins expressed on different substrates, under different conditions or are they forming a heterodimer)? In which respect differ the A1 and A2 proteins from each other? This information would be very useful top the reader who wonders about the presence of two proteins in one cluster.

However, the authors did not show that the lipoate transferase from <italic>Thialkalivibrio</italic> would be able to function with the <italic>H. denitrificans</italic> in my opinion! This statement is not supported/backed up by data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript describes very interesting follow-up work on the recently discovered heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr)-like multienzyme systems for sulfur oxidation found in a large group of bacteria and archaea: these enzyme systems are resembling HdrABC of methanogenic archaea (but without CoM-CoB heterodisulfide). In another manuscript submitted to ISMEJ, the Ch. Dahl group apparently confirmed the role of these hdr-like genes in oxidation of thiosulfate (as derived from DMS) to sulfate, in their genetically accessible system, <italic>Hyphomicrobium denitrificans</italic>. For the present manuscript, the Dahl lab used the same system, and joined forces with the J.E. Cronan lab, for an exploration of the role of genes for lipoate-binding proteins (LpbA) and lipoate-protein ligases (LplA), which are co-encoded in these hdr-like sulfur-oxidation gene clusters in this organism, in Thioalkalivibrio, and in almost all gene clusters of other organisms with (predicted) Hdr-like sulfur oxidation systems.</p><p>First, a comprehensive analysis was done for the potential lipoate-binding protein genes, lipoate-protein ligase genes (and radical-SAM protein genes), which are each co-occurring in such hdr-like gene clusters, essentially in three different arrangements (group 1, 2 and 3). The detailed analysis of the LbpA sequences indicated two strictly conserved Cys residues in comparison to the archetype GcvH of the glycine cleavage system, and two subtypes of LbpAs, i.e. LbpA1 and LpbA2. Then, four different LpbAs were recombinantly produced and tested: both LbpA1 and A2 from a Thioalkalivibrio sp. (Tk-LbpA1 and A2), LbpA1 from a Thiorhodospira sibirica (Ts-LbpA1), and the LbpA2 from H. denitrificans (Hd-LbpA2). Non-lipoylated versus lipoylated proteins obtained dependent on anoxic expression, were distinguished by immunoblotting and by gel-mobility shift. For <italic>H. denitrificans</italic>, specific production of lipoylated HbpA2 during DMS and thiosulfate utilization was demonstrated by proteomics and by immunoassays targeting a representative HdrA2- or the lipoyl-domain. In addition, a HbpA2 in-frame knockout was constructed, which had lost the ability to utilize DMS, and which produced the dead-end product tetrathionate from thiosulfate but not sulfate, thus confirming that HdrA2 is essential for sulfur oxidation (as with the knock-out of the Hdr-like genes).</p><p>Next, it was tested whether LpbA1 or A2 can substitute for GcvH in a <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> ∆<italic>gcvH</italic> strain (no, they can't) and this failure was attributed to a lack of octanoate-transfer to the LipAs through Bacillus-LipM, as demonstrated in vitro assays using 14C-octanoate as substrate and autoradiography. Further, the ligases Hd-LplA and Tk-LplA cannot substitute for the native ligases of <italic>E. coli</italic> in vivo (in a Δ<italic>lipB</italic> Δ<italic>lplA</italic> knockout strain), and not an in-vitro lipoylation assay using the recombinant proteins. Finally, it was confirmed that the LplAs encoded in the hdr-like gene cluster have activity only with their own LbpAs encoded in the same cluster, by MALDI, autoradiography and mobility-shift assays. This specificity was attributed to a difference in the domain structure of the ligases (absence of auxiliary domain in the LbpAs) and an absence of the octanoyl-transferase activity in these LplAs; it is then speculated whether the LbpAs may confer this function.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript provides important, and convincing evidence that lipoate is involved as key component in another metabolic function not previously recognized – sulfur oxidation via the HDR-like system – and that the mechanisms by which lipoate is synthesized and attached to its binding-protein(s) LbpA is more diverse than initially known – here specifically designed to sulfur oxidation. Clearly, one would like to know more on the details of sulfur oxidation route in these Hdr-like enzyme systems, particularly on the electron transfer via the dihydrolipoamide (which might substitute for reverse-electron flow, as postulated in the Discussion), however, this was not the scope of the present study. Rather, the results presented here are (on top of the points mentioned above) also a very important prerequisite for a future characterization of this enzyme system.</p><p>I've got no major criticism to raise:</p><p>In my opinion, this study is very sound, the results from the two labs allow for all conclusions drawn (as expected), and the topic of the study is clearly in <italic>eLife</italic>'s scope.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37439.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Congratulations on your high quality manuscript, which the Reviewing Editor and two expert reviewers agree should be published in eLife pending some straightforward revision/experimental clarification.

In fact, the Thioalkalivibrio LplA-like protein is able to catalyze an ATP-dependent ligase reaction. In that ligase reaction lipoic acid as well as octanoic acid are accepted as substrates. The reaction consists of two steps. The first is activation of lipoic or octanoic acid by formation of an adenylated form. AMP is hooked up to the substrate, pyrophosphate is released. In the second step, AMP is released and lipoic acid or octanoic acid is hooked up to the acceptor protein.</p><p>The octanoyl transferase reaction that was also tested is very different. Here, an octanoyl residue that is already hooked up to a donor protein (either acyl carrier protein or <italic>B. subtilis</italic> GcvH) is simply transferred to an acceptor protein. This reaction is not ATP-dependent. We show, in the subsection “LplA-like protein from sulfur-oxidizing bacteria does not exhibit octanoyltransferase activity”, that the sulfur oxidizer LplA-like proteins do not exhibit this transferase activity. They have this in common with characterized LplA proteins from other organisms that are also enzymes restricted to catalysis of the lipoate:protein ligase reaction. To make these points even clearer to the reader, we introduced a new heading for the aforementioned subsection describing the lack of octanoyltransferase activity for Thioalkalivibrio LplA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Maybe LplA-lilke protein is promiscuous and has a dual function?

To the best of our knowledge, kinetic data have never been provided for any lipoate:protein ligase or octanoyl transferase. This is due to assay limitations. The assays developed so far and applied in this study allow assessment of substrate consumption and/or product formation by autoradiographic analysis or via gel mobility shifts but are not suited to delineate K<sub>M</sub> or V<sub>max</sub> values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another, related problem, is that the authors demonstrate that both LbpA1 and A2 are loaded by LplA-like protein.

We would like to point out that there is no genetic system for any of the organisms featuring two different lbpA genes, so this question cannot be answered by genetic methods. Just as most of the other organisms containing two different lbpA genes,</p><p>Thioalkalivibrio is an obligate chemolithoautotroph that is dependent on oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds. We can thus not test, whether the two proteins are expressed on different substrates or under different growth conditions. <italic>H. denitrificans</italic>, the only genetically accessible model organism encoding the Hdr-like system, has only a single lbpA gene and is thus not suited for answering questions on redundancy or complementarity of LbpA1/LbpA2. As clearly stated in the manuscript, sulfur oxidizer LbpA proteins are not lipoylated in an <italic>E. coli</italic> background when produced as recombinant proteins. We therefore refrained from co-production of <italic>Thioalkalivibrio</italic> LbpA1 and LbpA2 because a possible oligomerisation could have been due to artificial interaction of immature apoproteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In which respect differ the A1 and A2 proteins from each other? This information would be very useful top the reader who wonders about the presence of two proteins in one cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>At the moment it would be premature to delineate different functions for LbpA1 and LbpA2 in those organisms where we have both variants encoded. Sequence comparison does not indicate any conserved differences in functionally important amino acid residues (e.g. cysteine). It should be noted that the well-described α-ketoacid dehydrogenases and acetoin dehydrogenases are enormous protein complexes containing many copies of E1, E2 (the lipoate binding protein) and E3 subunits. The amino-terminal region of each E2 subunit contains one or more small, about 80-aa lipoylation domains. The E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase contains up to three or these domains. Deletion of one or even two of its three lipoyl domains has no adverse effect on the assembly or catalytic activity nor does the creation of E2 chains containing various combination and permutations of functional and nonfunctional lipoyl domains (Perham 2000). The lipoylation domains are displayed on the outer face of the oxoacid dehydrogenases complexes where they then interact with the E1 and E3 subunits. Acyl group transfer and redox reaction are possible between lipoyl groups on different E2 proteins. A total of three lipoyl domains turned out to be optimal for the E2 subunit of <italic>E. coli</italic> PDH, of which only the outermost needs to be lipoylated, suggesting that the inner two exist principally to extend the reach of the outermost domain and its lipoyl lysine residue (reviewed in Perham 2000). It is likely that LbpAs from sulfur oxidizers serve a similar substrate-channeling function and that more than a single LbpA monomer is present and functional in the mature Hdr-multienzyme system. Gene duplication may have occurred allowing more efficient protein production followed by independent evolution of both genes. The reaction center subunits of phototrophic bacteria are probably the most prominent example for such an evolutionary history. In that case, an original protein homodimer encoded by one gene evolved into a heterodimer of two related yet distinct proteins after gene duplication (Blankenship, 2010). These considerations have been included into the Discussion (third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, I did not quite understand if the second lipoates ligase outside of the cluster would activate be able to attach the lipoate cofactor to A1 and A2!?</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, preliminary experiments were performed with the second lipoate ligase (TK90_0648) from Thioalkalivibrio residing outside of the hdr-like gene cluster. Recombinant TK90_0648 exhibited neither octanoate ligase activity nor octanoate transferase activity upon LbpA1 (TK90_0638) and LbpA2 (TK90_0640). These experiments were performed using hot C<sup>14</sup> labeled octanoate as the substrate. Given these first negative results we focused on the TK90_0642 encoded ligase which proved to be active with both LbpAs. It is intended to perform further experiments with the second ligase. The outcome of these experiments will be presented in a separate publication in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors conclude that &quot;the LplA does not does not recognize lipoyl domains/proteins stemming from other organisms&quot;.
