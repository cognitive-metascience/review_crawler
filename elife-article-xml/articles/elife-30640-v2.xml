We also find isoform-specific roles for AKT in multiple paradigms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in area CA1. AKT1, but not AKT2 or AKT3, is required for L-LTP through regulating activity-induced protein synthesis. Interestingly, AKT activity inhibits mGluR-LTD, with overlapping functions for AKT1 and AKT3.

The AKT (Protein kinase B, PKB) signaling pathway is thought to play a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hers et al., 2011</xref>). AKT is a central serine/threonine kinase expressed in almost all cell types throughout the body and regulates cell growth, proliferation and metabolism. In post-mitotic neurons, the AKT pathway has significant functional impact on stress responses, neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O' Neill, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Synaptic plasticity describes the specific modification of neuronal connections in response to neural activity. A persistent increase in synaptic strength after stimulation is known as long-term potentiation (LTP), while a decrease in synaptic strength is known as long-term depression (LTD). Late-phase LTP (L-LTP) is a long-lasting form of LTP that requires changes in gene expression and the synthesis of new proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sweatt, 2016</xref>). A form of LTD mediated by group one metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR-LTD) also requires protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huber et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, AKT plays an important role in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway controlling protein synthesis, and previous studies found that induction of L-LTP or mGluR-LTD in the hippocampus leads to AKT activation measured by increased phosphorylation of serine 473 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hou and Klann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horwood et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>AKT is known to include a family of three closely related isoforms, named AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3. Each isoform is encoded by a different gene, but the proteins share a high degree of structural homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumar and Madison, 2005</xref>). Despite this homology, accumulating evidence suggests that each isoform is involved in distinct neurological disorders. Mutations in <italic>AKT1</italic> have been associated with schizophrenia, <italic>AKT2</italic> with gliomas and <italic>AKT3</italic> with brain growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emamian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Supporting these observations in humans, single-isoform <italic>Akt</italic> knockout (KO) mice also show distinct phenotypes. <italic>Akt1</italic> KO mice have growth retardation and increased neonatal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Easton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>Akt2</italic> KO mice suffer from a type two diabetes-like syndrome and <italic>Akt3</italic> KO mice show decreased brain size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Easton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tschopp et al., 2005</xref>). These data suggest that each isoform subserves different cellular functions to give rise to distinct phenotypes. Whether each AKT isoform plays different roles in synaptic plasticity has not been examined.</p><p>Activation of AKT has been correlated with LTP and LTD induction, implicating a role for AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hou and Klann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horwood et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakai et al., 2014</xref>). However, whether AKT activity is necessary in synaptic plasticity has not been directly tested. Moreover, all three AKT isoforms are present in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Easton et al., 2005</xref>). Given the numerous forms of synaptic plasticity, isoform-specific functions of AKT may provide an important mechanism for control and precision of the cellular processes supporting synaptic plasticity. Here, we show for the first time that each AKT isoform has a distinct expression pattern in the hippocampus. We then examined the role of each isoform in several hippocampal synaptic plasticity paradigms known to involve different molecular and cellular processes: early-phase LTP (E-LTP), L-LTP, low-frequency stimulation (LFS)-LTD, and mGluR-LTD. Our studies provide evidence that AKT isoforms play differential roles in synaptic plasticity due to cell-type-specific expression of <italic>Akt</italic> genes in the hippocampus and isoform-specific functions in protein synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AKT isoforms show differential expression in the hippocampus</title><p>AKT is a well-studied kinase that may play a central role in brain disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hers et al., 2011</xref>). However, most studies examining AKT activity made no distinction between the activities of each isoform. We hypothesized that AKT isoforms play distinct roles in synaptic plasticity. To test this, we first examined the expression pattern of AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3 in the mouse hippocampus. We found that AKT1 and AKT3 were distributed throughout somatic layers of the hippocampus, with local differences in expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). AKT1 showed more intense immunoreactivity in the cell body layer of area CA1, whereas AKT3 showed more intense staining in cell bodies within area CA3 and the hilus of the dentate gyrus but reduced expression in the CA2/CA1 region. Interestingly, AKT2 showed a very different staining pattern. AKT2 was mostly expressed in cells of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and stratum radiatum of CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Isoform-specific KO tissues confirmed specificity of the staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Because the brain consists of neurons and glia cells, we next determined the cell types in which each isoform is expressed by co-staining brain slices for the neuronal marker neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN), the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and each AKT isoform. This triple stain approach revealed that within CA1, AKT1 was mainly expressed in pyramidal layer neurons, with no detectable staining in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Interestingly, certain neurons seemed to express more AKT1 compared with neighboring neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). In the CA1, AKT3 was also mainly expressed in neurons, including in the processes extending into stratum radiatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). AKT2 showed no detectable co-localization with NeuN but co-localized with GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). To confirm that AKT2 is not expressed in neurons, we employed a Cre-mediated strategy of selective <italic>Akt2</italic> gene disruption by crossing mice with floxed alleles of <italic>Akt2</italic> to three different mouse lines. Two of the lines have neuron-specific Cre recombinase expression (<italic>Camk2Î±</italic>-Cre and rat specific enolase, Nse or <italic>Eno2</italic>-Cre), while the third line expresses Cre recombinase in early neural progenitor cells that become astrocytes and neurons (<italic>Nestin</italic>-Cre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tronche et al., 1999</xref>]). Using this strategy, we confirmed that AKT2 levels in the hippocampus were not affected by either neuron-specific Cre line, showing that <italic>Akt2</italic> is not likely to be expressed in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). In contrast, the Nestin-Cre line completely abolished hippocampal AKT2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1b,c</xref>), providing further support that AKT2 protein may be solely expressed in astrocytes and not in neurons of the hippocampus. Combined, our results demonstrate differential AKT isoform expression in the hippocampus. This isoform-specific expression may lead to unique functions of each isoform in synaptic plasticity processes.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30640.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AKT isoform-specific expression in the hippocampus.</title><p>Immunohistology using isoform-specific antibodies revealed distinct expression patterns for each AKT isoform in the hippocampus.

We chose to test the effects of two AKT inhibitors, AZD5363 (AZD) and MK2206-HCl (MK), on synaptic plasticity. AZD and MK have different mechanisms of action; AZD is an ATP-competitive AKT inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) and MK is an allosteric AKT inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). To examine AZD and MK action in the brain, we first assessed their effects on the phosphorylation of AKT and a well-characterized downstream target of AKT, glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² (GSK-3Î²) in hippocampal slices. Incubation with 10 ÂµM MK strongly inhibited AKT activity as measured by the reduction of AKT phosphorylated on serine 473 (pAKT S473); however, phosphorylation levels of GSK-3Î² on serine 9 (pGSK-3Î² S9) were not reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3aâc</xref>). At higher doses of MK (30 ÂµM and 100 ÂµM), pAKT continued to be reduced at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>), while pGSK-3Î² levels were ultimately reduced in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,c</xref>). MK also reduced phosphorylation of another AKT target, tuberous sclerosis complex 2 on serine 939 (pTSC2 S939) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inoki et al., 2002</xref>) but did not have a dose-dependent effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,d</xref>).

Immunostaining of the hippocampus showed <italic>Akt1</italic> was mostly deleted from excitatory pyramidal neurons in area CA1, while other neurons, most likely inhibitory neurons, still expressed AKT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). Next, we examined mGluR-LTD in cA1F/A3K mice. Consistent with our results from the AKT inhibitor experiments, we found that mGluR-LTD was enhanced in cA1F/A3K mice compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). Thus, concomitant <italic>Akt1</italic> and <italic>Akt3</italic> deletion results in enhanced mGluR-LTD, supporting the idea that the AKT1 and AKT3 isoforms function in hippocampal mGluR-LTD and can compensate for each other.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30640.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>AKT1 and AKT3 are involved in mGluR-LTD.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Double <italic>Akt1</italic> and <italic>Akt3</italic> mutant (cA1F/A3K) mice with Cre-mediated removal of both <italic>Akt1</italic> alleles in the <italic>Akt3</italic> KO background were generated with WT littermate controls by breeding <italic>Camk2a-Cre::Akt1<sup>loxP/+</sup></italic>/<italic>Akt3<sup>+/-</sup></italic> female mice with <italic>Akt1<sup>loxP/+</sup></italic>/<italic>Akt3<sup>+/-</sup></italic> males.

We show, for the first time, that AKT2 expression is localized to astrocytes in the hippocampus, while AKT1 and AKT3 are primarily but differentially expressed in neurons. We also show for the first time that these differences in isoform expression are associated with different functions in the brain involving synaptic plasticity. We demonstrate that the AKT1 isoform is critical for the expression of L-LTP and regulating activity-induced protein synthesis that supports L-LTP in area CA1. Interestingly, in contrast to the apparent singular requirement for AKT1 in L-LTP, we found that AKT1 and AKT3 serve overlapping roles to inhibit the expression of mGluR-LTD in area CA1. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify AKT isoform-specific expression in the hippocampus and AKT isoform-specific activity underlying different forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.</p><p>Because AKT controls numerous cellular processes, uncovering isoform differences is important to improve understanding about normal AKT function. Moreover, isoform-specific roles for AKT have been associated with different disease pathologies. The AKT2 isoform, for example, has been implicated in diabetes. A missense mutation in <italic>AKT2</italic> that causes loss of AKT2 function leading to insulin resistance was identified in a family with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">George et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, AKT2-deficient mice have resistance to insulin and a subset develop diabetes-mellitus-like syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2001a</xref>). AKT2 also has been associated with glioma, a type of brain cancer with malignant tumors derived from glial cells. High-grade gliomas have been shown to overexpress AKT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Although this correlation suggests a role for AKT2 in astrocytic function, we were surprised that our immunostaining in the hippocampus showed AKT2 to be present predominantly in astrocytes. Cre recombinase under the nestin promoter in neural progenitor cells, which generate both neurons and astrocytes, completely ablated AKT2 in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1c</xref>), whereas neuron-restricted Cre recombinase had no effect on hippocampal AKT2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). Deducing from these results suggests that AKT2 is only expressed in astrocytes. However, it may be that our strategies have limited sensitivity to detect trace amounts of AKT2 in neurons. Expression data from other studies also do not provide conclusive answers to where AKT2 is expressed in the brain. For example, the Allen Brain Atlas shows <italic>Akt2</italic> mRNA expression to be merely neuronal, whereas single-cell RNA sequencing of hippocampal cells identified <italic>Akt2</italic> only in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>). In a proteome analysis of the brain, expression of all three AKT isoforms were reported in all brain cell types in almost equal amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>). Although these methods generate large amounts of data and are important to examine the transcriptome on a large scale, these studies have not specifically verified AKT isoform expression in more depth. Close examination of our immunostaining revealed little or no detectable AKT1 and AKT3 expression in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), although we cannot exclude that they may be present. Therefore, it may be possible that AKT2 expression is restricted to hippocampal astrocytes or becomes restricted post-developmentally or that signals from other brain cell types in vivo restrict AKT2 expression to astrocytes. Although we found no evidence of a role for AKT2 in the synaptic plasticity paradigms tested in this study, AKT2 might play a role in synaptic plasticity as it relates to astrocytic function for supporting neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Papouin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The AKT1 isoform specifically has been linked to schizophrenia, a neurological disorder believed to represent brain dysconnectivity with a molecular basis in aberrant synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stephan et al., 2006</xref>). AKT1 is one of the effectors in the well-established pathway from neuregulin 1 (<italic>NRG1-ERBB4-PI3K-AKT1</italic> pathway), where each of these components have genetic polymorphisms that have been linked to schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emamian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hatzimanolis et al., 2013</xref>). These polymorphisms may lead to lower AKT1 protein levels in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emamian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Beveren et al., 2012</xref>), although increased AKT1 expression and activity also have been reported in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumarasinghe et al., 2013</xref>). Human olfactory neurosphere-derived cells collected from schizophrenia patients were shown to have reduced protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">English et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, the antipsychotic haloperidol used to treat schizophrenia can activate the AKT pathway, thereby inducing protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowling et al., 2014</xref>). Together, these reports may suggest protein synthesis is reduced in schizophrenia, which may be due to reduced AKT1 signaling. Because protein synthesis is crucial to maintain L-LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sweatt, 2016</xref>), our finding that <italic>Akt1</italic> deletion results in the impairment of L-LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and the associated protein synthesis response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggests AKT1 may be an important factor in the synaptic and cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stephan et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The AKT3 isoform is expressed in a highly overlapping pattern with AKT1 in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting overlapping roles with AKT1, but there are also notable differences between their expression. For example, AKT3 shows expression in the neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). AKT3 is known to control brain size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Easton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tschopp et al., 2005</xref>). Mutations that result in enhanced AKT3 activity lead to increased brain growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), while deletion of <italic>AKT3</italic> is involved in microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gai et al., 2015</xref>). AKT3 may control brain growth through regulation of protein synthesis. Deletion of <italic>Akt3</italic> is known to reduce phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Easton et al., 2005</xref>), which is an effector in the AKT-mTOR pathway leading to protein synthesis. Intriguingly, our results show that only AKT1-deficient mice display impaired protein synthesis-dependent L-LTP, while deletion of <italic>Akt3</italic> has no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These data are consistent with the idea that while both AKT1 and AKT3 can regulate neuronal protein synthesis, AKT1 is specifically recruited to support translation involved in L-LTP.</p><p>What mechanisms might underlie the differential regulation of protein synthesis by AKT1 and AKT3? Phosphorylation of S6 on S235/236 is increased after L-LTP, which correlates with increased translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antion et al., 2008b</xref>). Consistent with our finding that <italic>Akt1</italic> deletion leads to an impaired protein synthesis response, <italic>Akt1</italic> KO slices fail to increase S6 phosphorylation following stimulation, whereas <italic>Akt3</italic> KO slices still display dynamic range in protein synthesis and S6 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Noteworthy, previously it was found that basal phosphorylation of S6 is reduced in <italic>Akt3</italic> KO mice but not in <italic>Akt1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Easton et al., 2005</xref>), which we were able to confirm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e,f</xref>). These results show distinct roles for AKT1- and AKT3-mediated protein synthesis. AKT1 is the activity-regulated isoform, converting external stimuli into protein synthesis, while AKT3 may be more important for steady-state protein synthesis. This distinction may also correlate with the regional differences we observed in hippocampal AKT1 and AKT3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Thus, in regions where AKT3 expression predominates like area CA3, <italic>Akt3</italic> KO slices may show altered activity-induced protein synthesis, following stimulation of the mossy fiber-CA3 circuit for instance. Additionally, future experiments aimed at finer localization of AKT1 and AKT3 may help to answer this question.</p><p>mGluR-LTD has been widely studied in relation to the neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome (FXS) and shown to be enhanced in hippocampal slices from <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, a mouse model of FXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huber et al., 2002</xref>). mGluR-LTD requires protein synthesis, leading to AMPA receptor internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huber et al., 2001</xref>). AKT has been implicated in the cascade mediating this protein synthesis after mGluR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hou and Klann, 2004</xref>). Studies inhibiting upstream and downstream signaling of AKT have suggested that mGluR stimulation activates a cascade through PI3K-AKT-TSC-mTORC1-S6K to protein synthesis. However, there are conflicting findings about the role of this signaling cascade in mGluR-LTD. In support of the idea that AKT functions in this pathway to facilitate mGluR-LTD, pharmacological studies inhibiting PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hou and Klann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Potter et al., 2013</xref>) or mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Potter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>) have reported mGluR-LTD impairment. On the other hand, inhibiting mTORC1 also has been reported to have no effect on mGluR-LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auerbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Potter et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, loss of S6K1 has been shown to have no effect on mGluR-LTD, while S6K2 loss results in enhanced mGluR-LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antion et al., 2008a</xref>). Some of these divergent results may be due to methodological differences or the developmental stage at which experiments were performed. However, it remains that none of these earlier studies directly examined the role of AKT activity in mGluR-LTD. To address this gap, we targeted AKT directly using multiple approaches, including pharmacological agents and genetic removal of <italic>Akt</italic>.</p><p>Our results strongly support the idea that AKT normally acts to inhibit mGluR-LTD. We found that blockade of AKT activity with multiple separate approaches, using two different AKT inhibitors, genetic deletion of both <italic>Akt1</italic> and <italic>Akt3</italic> in CA1 as well as PI3K inhibition, all resulted in enhanced mGluR-LTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). By using two AKT inhibitors that have different mechanisms of action on AKT, complemented by genetically removing AKT, we addressed potential off-target effects of the compounds and provide converging evidence that the enhanced mGluR-LTD is due to specific inhibition of AKT. Developmental effects of AKT removal also are unlikely to contribute to the observed LTD enhancement as single <italic>Akt</italic> isoform deletion did not affect mGluR-LTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Additionally, in the double <italic>Akt1/Akt3</italic> deletion experiment, AKT1 is removed postnatally, eliminating potential confounds from the loss of multiple AKT isoforms during development. Combined, these data show that the role of AKT in mGluR-LTD may be more complex than originally thought. AKT may not simply be a facilitator of general mTORC1-mediated translation but may only be involved in regulating distinct pools of mGluR-induced protein synthesis, some of which may act to inhibit mGluR-LTD. In agreement with this idea, the AKT-TSC pathway has been suggested to act as a brake on mTOR-regulated protein synthesis, while the ERK pathway, which is also activated by mGluR stimulation, promotes protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auerbach et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, at 60 min post-DHPG, we found increased phosphorylation levels of ERK and S6 in cA1F/A3K mice compared with vehicle treatment but not in WT mice. This suggests that AKT1 and AKT3 removal may relieve the brake on protein synthesis after mGluR stimulation, leading to altered protein synthesis or AMPA receptor internalization and subsequently enhanced mGluR-LTD. Future studies examining these possibilities will be important to resolve the role of AKT in regulating these important pathways in mGluR-LTD.</p><p>In summary, this study provides valuable new insights into the role of AKT and its isoforms in the brain. The results show expression differences between AKT isoforms in the hippocampus, affecting their role in synaptic plasticity and protein synthesis. Hence, compounds targeting single AKT isoforms may be an attractive therapeutic target for treating disorders and diseases that impact synaptic plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-AKT1 (Western blot)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling</td><td valign="top">Cat# 2938;

When they were unresponsive to a toe pinch, mice were intracardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). After perfusion, brains were isolated and kept in 4% PFA for 24 hr at 4Â°C. Brains were then transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS for at least 24 hr at 4Â°C. Next, brains were sectioned into 30 Âµm coronal slices on a cryostat (Leica) and stored at â20Â°C in cryoprotectant (20% glycerol/2% DMSO in phosphate buffer) until used for immunohistology. Fluorescent immunostaining was performed as described previously with minor changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levenga et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, free-floating brain sections were washed with PBS and submitted to heat-mediated antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6) if needed. Slices were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in staining buffer containing 0.05 M Tris pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl, 0.25% gelatin, 0.5% TritonX-100, and 2% donkey serum.

Hippocampal slices were derived from mice 5â6 weeks of age for LTD experiments and greater than 10 weeks of age for LTP experiments. Briefly, slices were maintained in an interface chamber at 32Â°C infused with oxygenated ACSF containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 aH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 D-glucose, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>. For LFS-LTD recordings, slices were maintained in ACSF containing 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Slices recovered in the chamber at least 60 min prior to recordings. Next, constant-current stimuli (100 Î¼s) were delivered with a bipolar silver electrode placed in the stratum radiatum of area CA3, and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded with an electrode filled with ACSF in the stratum radiatum of area CA1. fEPSPs were monitored by delivering stimuli at 0.033 Hz and measuring their slopes using pCLAMP10 (Molecular Devices). Before LTP or LTD induction, a stable baseline was established for 20â30 min with a stimulus intensity of 40â50% of the maximum fEPSP. Late-phase LTP (L-LTP) was induced by four trains of 100 Hz high-frequency stimulation (HFS) for 1 s with a 5-min intertrain interval. LFS-LTD was induced by 900 stimuli of 1 Hz. For drug treatments, 100 ÂµM (RS)â3,5-DHPG (Tocris Bioscience,Â Minneapolis, MN), 30 ÂµM MK-2206 2HCL (Selleckchem,Â Houston, TX), 30 ÂµM AZD5363 (Selleckchem), 50 ÂµM LY294002 (Sigma,Â St. Louis, MO), or vehicle was applied to the ACSF.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Puromcyin-labeled protein synthesis assay</title><p>Newly synthesized proteins were labeled using an adaption of the SUnSET protocol as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoeffer et al., 2013</xref>).

All statistical tests were two-tailed with p&lt;0.05 considered as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"> <title>Acknowledgements</title> <p>For technical assistance, resources, and funding, we thank Thomas F Franke, Michael Roche, CU Boulder BioFrontiers Microscopy Core, Alzheimerâs Association MNIRGDP-12â258900 (CAH), NARSAD 21069 (CAH), NIH R01 NS086933 (CAH), Linda Crnic Institute Seed grant (CAH), NIH F31 NS083277 (HW), NIH T32 MH019524 (HW), Simons Foundation SFARI 27444 (CAH), and Sie Foundation (JL).</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writingâoriginal draft, Project administration, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writingâoriginal draft, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writingâoriginal draft, Project administration, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writingâoriginal draft, Project administration, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kimberly M Huber (Reviewer #1); Clive Bramham (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. There were differing opinions about the suitability of the paper for the journal.</p><p>In this paper, the distribution and function of the AKT family of genes in hippocampus synaptic plasticity was studied. The authors find roles for AKT1 in L-LTP and redundant roles for AKT1 and AKT3 in the suppression of mGluR-LTD. The reviewers indicated the results to be original and show that AKT proteins may play distinct roles in the regulation of protein synthesis during LTD and LTP. However, several reservations were raised about the data to support this conclusion. Specifically, there were concerns raised regarding inconsistencies of the pharmacological findings and the results from AKT knockout mice. The collective concerns are delineated below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) I commend the authors for doing a thorough job characterizing the AKT inhibitors in the slice preparation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. However, there are some confusing results that may require more explanation. The MK inhibitor at 10um completely blocks P-AKT, but has no effect on its substrate GSK3B, whereas the AZD drug enhanced P-AKT, but inhibits GSK3B phosphorylation. Is AKT autophosphorylated? Or are the distinct effects of the inhibitors due to feedback onto PDK1? It would be good to see the same data in the AKT1 and AKT3 KO mice to see if similar or different effects are observed.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, a</xref> pharmacological and genetic approach is used to study the effect of AKT on L-LTP. The Akt1 isoform is claimed to be the one involved in the maintenance of L-LTP and the target of the pharmacological blockers. Is somehow surprising that in AKT1 KO, the L-LTP seems to be only partially inhibited, whereas both of the pharmacological agents completely block this form of synaptic plasticity. Is the effect of the blockers specific? What is the effect of these inhibitors on the LTP induced in the AKT1 knockout mice.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors show impaired protein synthesis in AKT1 KO after L-LTP induction. Are there any differences in protein synthesis rate under basal condition in each of the KO mice? That is not reported and would help to interpret the results.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5EâF</xref>, the effect of HFS on S6 phosphorylation in AKT1 and AKT3 ko is reported. The phosphorylation of S6 after HFS does not look different in the wild type slice, perhaps because they are saturated. What seems to be different is only the total amount of S6 that is reduced in the WT after HFS. It would be nice to see a loading control, actin or tubulin?, for these western. Also in this case, knowing the effect of AKT1 and AKT3 absence on basal level of S6 phosphorylation would help to interpret the results.</p><p>5) The most surprising, and therefore interesting, result in the paper, in my opinion, is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, where the authors show enhanced mGlu-LTD using the inhibitors of Akt, and this result is confirmed with PI3K inhibitors and in AKT1/AKT3 CA1 dKO. The authors discuss a role for AKT as a brake on mGlu-LTD and protein synthesis machinery induction. However, they present no data to support this conclusion. Because these authors used SunSET to examine effects of AKT deletion on HFS-induced protein synthesis, this should also be done with mGluR-LTD. This result may suggest that AKT plays distinct roles in protein synthesis regulation depending on the stimulus (LTP or LTD), which in my opinion is very novel and impactful. Also, examining the effects of the inhibitors and AKT deletion on DHPG-induced signaling to mTORC1 and other pathways would provide more mechanistic insight into how AKT does this. However, this could be beyond the scope of this present manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The analysis of the mutant mice show that none of them affected synaptic plasticity up to an hour after any stimulation except the double mutant Akt1/3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> (mGluR-DHPG). Only L-LTP at 3 hours showed a decremental effect (incomplete LTP block) for Akt1 knockouts. They also find impaired protein synthesis in Akt1 knockouts and conclude that the effect on L-LTP is &quot;through regulating protein synthesis&quot;. They have not shown a causal link, merely a correlation. These findings are a minimal advance, do not present any conceptual advances and are not of the highest technical standards.</p><p>The results with the drugs are problematic for the reasons mentioned. The result of enhanced mGluR-LTD with LY294002 is preliminary.</p><p>My conclusion is that this not a high interest paper worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specific points in the order they arise in the manuscript:</p><p>1) The introduction to the Akt family is confusing and non-standard with respect to genes, gene families and proteins. The authors refer to &quot;three highly related isoforms&quot;. There are many splice isoforms described for each of three genes (see Ensemble and UniProt). Nowhere to they explain that they are referring to three genes, and each one expresses multiple splice isoforms. A figure with relevant schematic sequence alignments of the proteins and explanation of the isoforms and paralogs would be useful, showing where the antibodies bind and where the location of domains that bind to the drugs. This would enable the reader to understand the limitations of the specificity of the reagents.</p><p>2) The differential expression of the three genes shown using immunolabelling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> appears to describe differential expression, with Akt2 showing most differences to Akt1 and 3. An inspection of expression data in the Allen References Atlas shows Akt1,2 and 3 are expressed in all principal neurons, but Ak2 is at lower levels than either Akt1 and 3. Inspection of single-cell transcriptome data (Zeisel et al.,1934) shows that all three genes are expressed in many cell types in the hippocampus. The authors argue that the Cre lines (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) show evidence that Akt2 is not expressed, however these blots are overexposed (and not quantified) and the lack of reduction in Cre lines will have limited sensitivity (I doubt if it would detect a 20% reduction). Thus, I would suggest the authors caution their statements &quot;that Akt2 is not expressed in hippocampal neurons&quot; (and cite these other sources of expression data) and that &quot;Akt2 is specifically expressed in astrocytes&quot;. The authors could describe them as enriched in the particular cells.</p><p>3) Characterization of Akt inhibitors. Here the authors incubate brain slices with two different inhibitors and measure &quot;the phosphorylation of Akt&quot;. Surely, itâs important to measure the phosphorylation of each individual Akt isoform? This could be achieved by immunoprecipitation of each form followed by phosphoAKT blotting. Have these inhibitors been tested on Akt1, 2 and 3?</p><p>4) The authors say that AZD inhibitor increases pAKT S473, however the blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> is not convincing (the 30 and 100micM bands look the same as vehicle).</p><p>5) The dissociation between the dose-dependent effects of MK and AZD on pAKTS473 and pGSK3bS9 is confusing. Why do both drugs inhibit pGSK3bS9 when MK blocks pAKTS473 and AZD increases pAKTS473? The authors refer to a paper (Okuzumi, et al., 2009) that describes an interesting phenomenon of &quot;inhibitor hijacking&quot; that may be relevant. The original paper does not describe this effect on the different Akt proteins and the experiments suggested in point 3 would also address this.</p><p>6) They decide to use the inhibitors at 30micM. This is a very high dose, especially when the MK drug strongly inhibits pAKTS473 at 10micM. ATP-competitive inhibitors are notorious for the poor specificity between families of kinases and it is typical to test the potential for non-specific inhibition of kinases. Using similar phospho-blots as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors could confirm that the doses they use are not interfering with other kinases that are known to interfere with LTP.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4.</xref> L-LTP inhibition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> show the effects of the two inhibitors and from about 50' the drug-treated slices show a decremental LTP. In Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the effect of the inhibitors on the baseline is only recorded for 30'. An important control that is missing is to record baseline for the same duration as the L-LTP experiments (200+ minutes). In the absence of this it is not possible to claim that &quot;activity of AKT is required to sustain long-lasting LTP&quot;.</p><p>8) L-LTP experiment are technically very demanding and it is very easy to obtain decremental L-LTP simply as a result of poor health of the slice. To control for this, it is standard practice to perform 2-pathway experiments.</p><p>9) Since AKT inhibitors reduced L-LTP and pGSK3bS9, then it might be expected that Akt1-knockouts would also show reduced pGSK3bS9. But in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, apparently, this is not the case. Another dissociation is the reduction in pGSK3bS9 seen in Akt3 KO mice, which show normal L-LTP. This is confusing and important (the doses of the drugs were chosen on the basis that they inhibit pGSK3bS9).</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Are statistics for slices or mice?</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, mGluR-LTD, would also benefit from 2-pathway experiments (they also exceed the 30 min baseline in the control Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>12) The discrepancy between the results of LY294002 on mGluR-LTD is concerning. The original paper (Hou and Klann, 2004) showed they could reproduce the result with wortmannin. They also used an inactive structural analogue (LY294002), which had no effect. Given the controversial nature of this result, the authors should try these two other controls.</p><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, double mutant mice. This is a very nice line of investigation, especially since there is overlap of expression in Akt1 and Akt3. I am very surprised the authors have not performed the L-LTP experiment (and protein synthesis, and phosoph blots) to see if the partial effect on L-LTP in Akt1 kos is not further reduced in the double mutants.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The is a solid paper with important new findings on Akt-isoform specific localization, signaling, and function in the hippocampus. The authors have effectively combined knockouts and conditional gene deletion strategies with pharmacology. The results are clear and the story is compelling and novel. Akt1, but not Akt3, supports activity-induced protein synthesis in L-LTP. Akt1 works in concert with Akt3 to inhibit mGluR-LTD, which is a completely unanticipated but well-documented finding. The article is well-written and the controversial findings, implications, and future directions are all discussed. I have only minor comments (below).</p><p>1) From the staining shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it looks like Akt1 and Akt3 are expressed in the neuropil (synaptic/dendritic). The enzymes are not exclusively somatic. The authors should comment on this.</p><p>The synaptic/dendritic localization of Akt1 and Akt3 is an extremely important issue in view of the role of dendritic protein synthesis in synaptic maintenance and plasticity. PI3K/Akt signaling to mTOR has been shown to increase dendritic translation in CA1 by many labs.

However, there are some confusing results that may require more explanation. The MK inhibitor at 10um completely blocks P-AKT, but has no effect on its substrate GSK3B, whereas the AZD drug enhanced P-AKT, but inhibits GSK3B phosphorylation. Is AKT autophosphorylated? Or are the distinct effects of the inhibitors due to feedback onto PDK1? It would be good to see the same data in the AKT1 and AKT3 KO mice to see if similar or different effects are observed.</p></disp-quote><p>Originally, we were also surprised by the AZD result but then found that several studies have investigated this phenomenon. This inhibitor-induced âparadoxicalâ AKT hyperphosphorylation is not due to enhancement of upstream signals to compensate for the AKT signal loss but rather is related to the occupation and binding of this type of inhibitor at the ATP-pocket of AKT. Therefore, the hyperphosphorylation of AKT following AZD is not due to a feedback loop but due to âintrinsicâ mechanisms. Previously, it was shown that binding of the ATP-competitive inhibitor results in translocation of AKT to the membrane (Okuzumi et al., 2009). Here at the membrane it seems that AKT is either more susceptible to phosphorylation (Okuzumi et al., 2009) or more resistant to dephosphorylation (Chan et al., 2011), but either way AKT activity is inhibited. We have now explained this in more detail in the paper. Nevertheless, to make sure there was no feedback loop in brain slices, we tested phosphorylation of PDK1 and found no effect of AZD or MK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The inhibitory effects of AZD and MK on AKT activity have been tested and verified previously, showing differences in potency, consistent with our dose-dependent GSK3Î² results (MK2206: AKT<sub>1/2</sub>/3 with IC50 8/12/65 nM<sup>1</sup>; AZD5363: AKT<sub>1/2</sub>/3 with IC50 3/8/8 nM<sup>2</sup>. We also tested the effect of both inhibitors on another AKT substrate, TSC2 and found that this substrate was inhibited as well. Finally, we tested the effect of the inhibitors on each isoform and found that MK2206 dephosphorylates all isoforms and AZD hyperphosphorylates all isoforms. Based on these results, we believe it is unlikely that the drugs will perform differently in the context of an Akt mutant. Additionally, because we did not report any results combining pharmacology with Akt deficient mice, we believe testing the AKT inhibitors in Akt mutants will not provide any significant new information relative to the data already presented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, a pharmacological and genetic approach is used to study the effect of AKT on L-LTP. The Akt1 isoform is claimed to be the one involved in the maintenance of L-LTP and the target of the pharmacological blockers. Is somehow surprising that in AKT1 KO, the L-LTP seems to be only partially inhibited, whereas both of the pharmacological agents completely block this form of synaptic plasticity. Is the effect of the blockers specific? What is the effect of these inhibitors on the LTP induced in the AKT1 knockout mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that both inhibitors block L-LTP stronger compared to Akt1 KO alone. This could suggest that another isoform has an effect as well, most likely AKT3. The absence of an L-LTP impairment with Akt3 KO suggests that AKT1 can compensate for the loss of AKT3 or that AKT1 is the predominant kinase involved in this form of synaptic plasticity. Indeed, our data support the idea that AKT1, but not AKT3, is specifically involved in protein synthesis induced by high frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To more thoroughly explore this question, the cA1FA3K double mutants would be the best model to answer this question, and we have planned to examine L-LTP in this model for future studies. However, we believe this is beyond the scope of the current study because it is primarily focused on the role of single isoforms in synaptic plasticity. Another detail, as may be noticed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, is that the double mutants are rather difficult to generate (1 in 8 mice, or 1 mouse per 2 litters, will be a male double mutant); therefore, we chose instead to use the mice generated in our revision time frame for slices to answer point 5 made by this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors show impaired protein synthesis in AKT1 KO after L-LTP induction. Are there any differences in protein synthesis rate under basal condition in each of the KO mice? That is not reported and would help to interpret the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this would be very interesting. In the current paper, we controlled for basal protein synthesis differences between animals by performing the puromycin-labeling experiments within each animal, meaning that slices obtained from a singleanimal were either not stimulated or stimulated using HFS. The stimulated slices were then compared to the unstimulated slices for each animal to examine protein synthesis rates. This was repeated for each genotype separately. This approach is necessary because basal labeling rates can vary between different animals. Several factors can account for this, such as recent metabolism stimulation (i.e. feeding), sleep, and other factors that are difficult to control for across individual mice. Therefore, even though this would be a great question to answer, other strategies might be better used to address it. In future studies, we plan to employ a luciferase translation reporter to measure synthesis rates both in culture and in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5EâF</xref>, the effect of HFS on S6 phosphorylation in AKT1 and AKT3 ko is reported. The phosphorylation of S6 after HFS does not look different in the wild type slice, perhaps because they are saturated. What seems to be different is only the total amount of S6 that is reduced in the WT after HFS. It would be nice to see a loading control, actin or tubulin?, for these western. Also in this case, knowing the effect of AKT1 and AKT3 absence on basal level of S6 phosphorylation would help to interpret the results.</p></disp-quote><p>At the reviewerâs suggestion, we have included loading controls (GAPDH) for these westerns. We agree with the reviewer that the enhanced pS6 in WT samples after HFS seems largely due to reduced total S6 levels. We observed a similar phenomenon in an earlier study (3). So, while we agree that a simpler result would have been increased pS6 with no change in total S6 levels, it appears that consistent with previous results pS6 increases are driven by changes in total S6 protein. A previous study has also shown that basal pS6 levels are reduced in <italic>Akt3</italic> KO mice but not affected in <italic>Akt1</italic> KO mice (4). We observed the same results but because this was known and we were interested in how the <italic>Akt</italic> mutants responded to HFS, we had chosen to present our data to focus on their protein synthesis response post-HFS for clarity considerations. However, to address this point, we have now added discussion about pS6 levels basally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The most surprising, and therefore interesting, result in the paper, in my opinion, is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, where the authors show enhanced mGlu-LTD using the inhibitors of Akt, and this result is confirmed with PI3K inhibitors and in AKT1/AKT3 CA1 dKO. The authors discuss a role for AKT as a brake on mGlu-LTD and protein synthesis machinery induction. However, they present no data to support this conclusion. Because these authors used SunSET to examine effects of AKT deletion on HFS-induced protein synthesis, this should also be done with mGluR-LTD. This result may suggest that AKT plays distinct roles in protein synthesis regulation depending on the stimulus (LTP or LTD), which in my opinion is very novel and impactful. Also, examining the effects of the inhibitors and AKT deletion on DHPG-induced signaling to mTORC1 and other pathways would provide more mechanistic insight into how AKT does this. However, this could be beyond the scope of this present manuscript.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is of great interest and therefore attempted to address this point with new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Intriguingly, these results show that TSC2 signaling, upstream of mTORC1, is not altered whereas ERK signaling is enhanced in the double KO mice 60 min after DHPG treatment, leading to increased p-S6 signaling as well. This suggests that protein synthesis is indeed enhanced in cA1FA3K mice and that AKT1 and AKT3 together normally act as a brake on mGluR-LTD and the underlying protein synthesis. Owing to material (slice availability) and time constraints, we did not perform SuNSET analyses with the double mutant cA1F/A3K mice. The SuNSET protocol in our hands requires nearly all the slices generated from a single mouse to provide sufficient materials for control, stimulated and unlabeled experimental samples with technical replicates.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) The introduction to the Akt family is confusing and non-standard with respect to genes, gene families and proteins. The authors refer to &quot;three highly related isoforms&quot;. There are many splice isoforms described for each of three genes (see Ensemble and UniProt). Nowhere to they explain that they are referring to three genes, and each one expresses multiple splice isoforms. A figure with relevant schematic sequence alignments of the proteins and explanation of the isoforms and paralogs would be useful, showing where the antibodies bind and where the location of domains that bind to the drugs. This would enable the reader to understand the limitations of the specificity of the reagents.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that the background on the AKT family was confusing. The manuscript now explains in more detail that we are examining three AKT protein isoforms and each isoform is generated from a different gene (highlighted). While indeed Ensembl describes multiple splice isoforms for each of the three AKT genes, only the mRNA transcripts are different, and all transcripts of a gene result in the same protein. For example, human AKT1 has six mRNA splice isoforms (208, 202, 214, 201, 203, 211) which differ in their 5â or 3â untranslated region (UTR) but all result in the same protein. Although these UTR differences may be important for mRNA translation or localization, the protein is the same. Ensembl describes four other AKT1 splice variants (207, 213, 215, 209), which are shorter peptides, but these isoforms are âderived from an Ensembl automatic analysis pipeline and should be considered as preliminary dataâ (Uniprot). In addition, these isoforms have no CCDS code and therefore may not even exist. The CCDS project is a collaborative effort to identify a core set of protein coding regions that are consistently annotated and of high quality, so isoforms lacking such a code are not considered high-quality and may not be biologically relevant. In mice, the Akt1 gene has one isoform that is confirmed (201), while the other shorter peptides (205, 208, 206) are âderived from an Ensembl automatic analysis pipeline and should be considered as preliminary dataâ (Uniprot). The Akt2 gene has four splice isoforms (205, 204, 201, 214) that differ in their 5â or 3â UTR but result in the same protein. The other Akt2 splice isoforms are derived from an Ensembl automatic analysis pipeline but not verified. Only the Akt3 gene has a small difference in the last exon, where the Serine 472 phospho-site is found for the main isoforms 202 and 203, while the other isoform 201 has a different C-terminal. However, the 201 isoform has no CCDS code, suggesting it may not be a high-quality transcript. As with Akt1 and Akt2, all other Akt3 isoforms are predicted but not verified. Considering this information, we do not think the manuscript will benefit from describing mRNA splice variants because those verified for an Akt gene lead to the same protein and the focus of our study is the function of the three AKT protein isoforms in synaptic plasticity, not where the mRNA is localized or to what degree it is translated.</p><p>We had shared the same concern as the reviewer about the specificity of our reagents, which is why we used more than one AKT inhibitor in addition to genetic approaches. We also included staining in knockout samples to confirm specificity of our AKT antibodies. Although the exact epitope of these antibodies was confidential, we could retrieve information about the central peptide used for each antibody. To the best of our knowledge, these epitopes would be present in all Akt splice variants. Therefore, isoforms of each Akt gene (should they exist) would be recognized by our molecular tools. Our western results reveal single bands for both phospho- and total AKT proteins, consistent with the notion that each Akt gene generates one protein isoform. However, to address the reviewerâs concern, we have added epitope information to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The differential expression of the three genes shown using immunolabelling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> appears to describe differential expression, with Akt2 showing most differences to Akt1 and 3. An inspection of expression data in the Allen References Atlas shows Akt1,2 and 3 are expressed in all principal neurons, but Ak2 is at lower levels than either Akt1 and 3. Inspection of single-cell transcriptome data (Zeisel et al.,1934) shows that all three genes are expressed in many cell types in the hippocampus. The authors argue that the Cre lines (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) show evidence that Akt2 is not expressed, however these blots are overexposed (and not quantified) and the lack of reduction in Cre lines will have limited sensitivity (I doubt if it would detect a 20% reduction). Thus, I would suggest the authors caution their statements &quot;that Akt2 is not expressed in hippocampal neurons&quot; (and cite these other sources of expression data) and that &quot;Akt2 is specifically expressed in astrocytes&quot;. The authors could describe them as enriched in the particular cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs caution, but we have tested many different AKT2 antibodies, of which most were not specific (showing staining in the Akt2 KO). Once we found an antibody that was specific, we were also initially surprised that the immunostaining for AKT2 showed high expression in astrocytes only. That is why we proceeded with experiments to target AKT2 selectively using Cre-mediated removal. We were also aware that the Allen Brain Atlas showed Akt2 transcripts in most cells. However, this is mRNA expression data, and mRNA that are produced do not necessarily get translated into protein. Ironically, the Zeisel et al. study cited by the reviewer reports the presence of <italic>only</italic> Akt2 in astrocytes and not the other isoforms, which is in fact consistent with our data (See Zeisel et al., Supplementary table S1).</p><p>Although our western blot data were collected in the linear range of detection, we have replaced the AKT2 images with lower exposures and quantified the signals to address the reviewerâs concern. In addition, we added new AKT2 removal data using Nestin-driven Cre. Nestin is expressed early during embryogenesis in neural progenitor cells that become astrocytes and neurons. We found that Nestin-Cre mediated complete abolishment of AKT2 expression in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), whereas neuron-specific CamkIIa-Cre or NSE-Cre did not appear to remove any AKT2 protein, supporting our idea that AKT2 is expressed specifically in astrocytes. However, because we cannot rule out trace amounts of AKT2 in neurons, we have softened our conclusion to say, âour data suggests that AKT2 is not expressed in hippocampal neurons but is mainly expressed in astrocytesâ and have included discussion of other AKT expression data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Characterization of Akt inhibitors. Here the authors incubate brain slices with two different inhibitors and measure &quot;the phosphorylation of Akt&quot;. Surely, itâs important to measure the phosphorylation of each individual Akt isoform? This could be achieved by immunoprecipitation of each form followed by phosphoAKT blotting. Have these inhibitors been tested on Akt1, 2 and 3?</p></disp-quote><p>These inhibitors have been validated and studied previously and their pharmacological effects on each isoform have been tested (MK 2206: Akt<sub>1/2</sub>/3 with IC50 8/12/65 nM (1); AZD5363 Akt<sub>1/2</sub>/3 with IC50 3/8/8 nM (2). Our own independent data in brain slices to determine what dose to use verified the effects of these AKT inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3figure supplement 1</xref>). However, as the reviewer suggested, we have now added data showing the effect of both inhibitors on the phosphorylation status of each isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In agreement with our pan-AKT results, AZD5363 incubation hyperphosphorylates all AKT isoforms while MK2206 results in reduced phosphorylation of all AKT isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors say that AZD inhibitor increases pAKT S473, however the blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> is not convincing (the 30 and 100micM bands look the same as vehicle).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the selected image and in response to this critique, we replaced the blot with a more representative image.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The dissociation between the dose-dependent effects of MK and AZD on pAKTS473 and pGSK3bS9 is confusing. Why do both drugs inhibit pGSK3bS9 when MK blocks pAKTS473 and AZD increases pAKTS473? The authors refer to a paper (Okuzumiet al., 2009) that describes an interesting phenomenon of &quot;inhibitor hijacking&quot; that may be relevant. The original paper does not describe this effect on the different Akt proteins and the experiments suggested in point 3 would also address this.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that this was not presented clearly in the original manuscript. Please see our response to point 3 as well as our response to point 1 from the first reviewer, who was similarly confused by the paradoxical effect of the two inhibitors on phosphorylation of AKT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) They decide to use the inhibitors at 30micM. This is a very high dose, especially when the MK drug strongly inhibits pAKTS473 at 10micM. ATP-competitive inhibitors are notorious for the poor specificity between families of kinases and it is typical to test the potential for non-specific inhibition of kinases. Using similar phospho-blots as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors could confirm that the doses they use are not interfering with other kinases that are known to interfere with LTP.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern, which is noteworthy for all pharmacological studies. For this reason, our study also included genetic removal of AKT activity, although this approach carries its own caveats. Together however, the two approaches allow us to generate converging evidence in support of our conclusions. The congruent findings from our pharmacological and genetic studies strongly suggest that we were not observing non-specific effects of either approach. In addition, previous studies have used the AKT inhibitors at higher concentrations and longer durations than our study. For example, studies have reported inhibition of AKT by ~1-3 ÂµM AZD applied up to 36 h on cells grown in a monolayer (5, 6) but in vivo application required ~69 mM for an adult mouse (200 mg/kg) (6). For MK2206, in vitro doses that have been used range between 1-20 ÂµM for 2-72 h for cell monolayers (7-9) while in vivo application required ~75 mM for an adult mouse (240 mg/kg) (1). The brain slices that are used in our study are 400 Âµm thick, consisting of multiple cell layers, and treated for a short amount of time (30 min). Therefore, we disagree that 30 ÂµM is a high dose, especially as it resulted in similar effects as genetic AKT removal. Furthermore, this was the <italic>minimum</italic> dose required to block substrate activation. Using less would have left incomplete AKT blockade, confounding interpretation of our results. Finally, we have tested phosphorylation of PDK in response to reviewer 1, but the results also apply here, showing that the inhibitor doses are not interfering with at least one other kinase. To more extensively address the question of potential off-target effects, an unbiased kinome screen using a mass spec approach would be required, which is well beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. L-LTP inhibition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> show the effects of the two inhibitors and from about 50' the drug-treated slices show a decremental LTP. In Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the effect of the inhibitors on the baseline is only recorded for 30'. An important control that is missing is to record baseline for the same duration as the L-LTP experiments (200+ minutes). In the absence of this it is not possible to claim that &quot;activity of AKT is required to sustain long-lasting LTP&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the L-LTP impairment in <italic>Akt1</italic> KO slices supports our inhibitor results, we performed longer baseline recordings following inhibitor treatment at the reviewerâs request. We found no effect of AZD or MK on baseline recordings for as long as 90 min post-AKT inhibitor incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) L-LTP experiment are technically very demanding and it is very easy to obtain decremental L-LTP simply as a result of poor health of the slice. To control for this, it is standard practice to perform 2-pathway experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree that 2-pathway experiments are standard practice. L-LTP induced by high frequency stimulation is a well-established paradigm, for which 2-pathway experiments in the early days have confirmed that changes in synaptic plasticity are a phenomenon that occurs only after stimulation of a specific pathway. Most studies in mouse hippocampal slices have since not included 2-pathway experiments. Additionally, the reviewer seems to suggest that our results are due to poor health of Akt1 KO slices and AZD- and MK-treated slices only in the context of L-LTP and mGluR-LTD experiments; we do not believe this is a fair assessment. However, to address this critique, we have performed the baseline stability experiments in which slices were incubated with the inhibitors for extended periods of time (see point 7). These results show that (1) we can produce slices healthy enough to maintain stable baselines and (2) the inhibitors themselves do not reduce baseline fEPSP responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Since AKT inhibitors reduced L-LTP and pGSK3bS9, then it might be expected that Akt1-knockouts would also show reduced pGSK3bS9. But in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, apparently, this is not the case. Another dissociation is the reduction in pGSK3bS9 seen in Akt3 KO mice, which show normal L-LTP. This is confusing and important (the doses of the drugs were chosen on the basis that they inhibit pGSK3bS9).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the GSK3Î² results and their relationship to L-LTP are complicated, but these dissociations are the essence of our study. We had hoped to reveal signaling mechanisms linked specifically to different AKT isoforms and it appears GSK3Î² is one of them. GSK3Î² is a well-known and validated AKT target whose activity is blocked when it is phosphorylated by AKT (unphosphorylated GSK3Î² is the active form) (10) and was therefore chosen to validate our drug concentration. While it would have been more convenient for our study if Akt1 KO also led to reduced pGSKÎ² levels as with the AKT inhibitors, the data are reproducibly what we have presented. In Akt1 KO hippocampal tissue, pGSK3Î² levels are normal whereas in Akt3 KO tissue, pGSK3Î² is reduced (GSK3Î² is more active). We think the simplest explanation for these results is that specific AKT isoforms have preferences for certain targets, but other isoforms may be able to compensate. Thus, our results may suggest that the AKT3 isoform is specifically important for regulating pGSK3Î², but reduced pGSK3Î² does not necessarily result in impaired L-LTP. Previously, it was found that L-LTP results in increased pGSK3Î² (less active GSK3Î²) (11). Therefore, it is possible that the presence of AKT inhibitors prevented GSK3Î² from being modified, resulting in impaired L-LTP. On the other hand, that GSK3Î² is more active in Akt3 KO yet L-LTP is not affected suggests either that AKT1 could compensate for AKT3 loss or that pGSK3Î² is not the mechanism mediating impaired L-LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed, the revised manuscript now includes data on the phosphorylation of TSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>) to show that the inhibitors affect other downstream AKT targets as well, which justifies our drug concentration but also suggests that several other AKT mechanisms besides GSK3Î² regulation could underlie L-LTP. We agree with the reviewer that these are important points, so we have expanded discussion in the manuscript to help with clarity and interpretation of these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.

The original paper (Hou and Klann, 2004) showed they could reproduce the result with wortmannin. They also used an inactive structural analogue (LY294002), which had no effect. Given the controversial nature of this result, the authors should try these two other controls.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the 2004 paper indeed aimed to address the role of AKT in mGluR-LTD, it did not directly block AKT activity or use genetic animal models to confirm the results. Instead, the role of AKT was <italic>inferred</italic> from upstream inactivation of PI3K, whereas our study <italic>directly</italic> targets AKT using pharmacological and genetic approaches. Our results were unexpected based on the 2004 paper but not inconceivable because upstream manipulations can alter other pathways parallel to AKT signaling that lead to mGluR-LTD, which our study aimed to dissect by directly assessing AKT activity. Using three different compounds to inhibit AKT activity and a neuron-specific AKT1/3 double mutant mouse, we consistently found enhanced DHPG-induced mGluR-LTD. We did not perform mGluR-LTD experiments with wortmannin or the inactive analogue of LY294002 because the focus of our study was downstream and not upstream of AKT. We agree with the reviewer that the conflicting LY294002 results from the 2004 study and ours is concerning, but the preponderance of data suggest AKT activity is a brake on mGluR-LTD. On balance, we think the strength of our tools (multiple AKT inhibitors and genetic AKT removal) provides strong support for our conclusions, despite potential controversies generated here. We hope in the future that another group can independently confirm our results so that the role of AKT in this form of synaptic plasticity can be better clarified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, double mutant mice.

The authors mention the need for studies on localization but should spell out the need for work on Akt isoform signaling in local protein synthesis.</p></disp-quote><p>At the reviewerâs suggestion, we have addressed these points in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. There appears to be a gap in Akt3 staining in the CA1 region. Is this representative or an artefact? This segment does not seem to correspond to CA2, but there is a lot of interest in CA2 recently. The authors could comment on the distribution of Akt in CA2.</p></disp-quote><p>It may seem like an artefact but is representative of most of our AKT3 staining images in the WT hippocampus. We have included a different AKT3 staining image here as another example for the reviewer. We have also commented on AKT distribution in CA2 in the revised manuscript, as the reviewer suggested.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30640.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30640-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The electrophysiology is from CA1. The authors should state in subsection âAkt1 deletion results in impaired protein synthesis after L-LTP inductionâand the first paragraph of the Discussion section (and elsewhere, if applicable) that the findings on L-LTP/mGluR-LTD are from CA1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this detail to the first paragraph of the Discussion section and in other places of the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Akt1 and Akt3 are shown to have different roles in protein synthesis, and there appears to be a differential distribution of the enzymes in CA1, CA3, and DG. It is notable in this context that rapamcyin blocks L-LTP and CA1 but does not affect L-LTP in the DG (Panja et al., 2009, 2014). The regional differences in L-LTP and translation might be related to differential activation of Akt isoforms.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and we have included it in our Discussion section.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.
