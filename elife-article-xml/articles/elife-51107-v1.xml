growth and proliferation, yet the mechanisms of how zinc deficiency arrests these processes remain enigmatic. Here we induce subtle zinc perturbations and track asynchronously cycling cells throughout division using fluorescent reporters, high throughput microscopy, and quantitative analysis. Zinc deficiency induces quiescence and resupply stimulates synchronized cell-cycle reentry. Monitoring cells before and after zinc deprivation we found the position of cells within the cell cycle determined whether they either went quiescent or entered another cell cycle but stalled in S-phase. Stalled cells exhibited prolonged S-phase, were defective in DNA synthesis and had increased DNA damage levels, suggesting a role for zinc in maintaining genome integrity. Finally, we demonstrate zinc deficiency-induced quiescence occurs independently of DNA-damage response pathways, and is distinct from mitogen removal and spontaneous quiescence. This suggests a novel pathway to quiescence and reveals essential micronutrients play a role in cell cycle regulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>For an animal to grow, its cells have to divide. Cell division can only take place if the cell meets certain conditions: for example, the cell’s DNA must not be damaged. To ensure that cells only divide when these conditions are met, the cell goes through a series of stages or phases with checkpoints known as the cell cycle. The ability to control whether cells divide is essential for an animal to correctly form organs and tissues, or to heal wounds.</p><p>Zinc is a metal that animals get in their diet, and when zinc levels are low, animals usually grow more slowly because their cells stop dividing. Around 2 billion people worldwide do not get enough zinc in their diet. Amongst other processes, zinc is necessary for DNA repair, which could explain why low levels of zinc stop the cell from dividing. However, the evidence for why zinc is required for cell division is contradictory. Although it seems clear that zinc is necessary for cells to progress through the cell cycle, it was unknown whether it is needed at a specific stage or whether it influences a cell’s decision to divide.</p><p>Lo et al. have used microscopy to examine the effects that different levels of zinc had on individual cells grown in the lab. The results suggest that cells can monitor the levels of zinc in their environment, and respond to low levels by shutting down growth and cell division. This happens independently of the stage of the cell cycle a cell finds itself in, explaining the discrepancies between older studies. Additionally, the results show that although zinc is required for DNA repair, this process is not what triggers cells to stop dividing in the absence of zinc. In fact, low levels of zinc seem to be stopping cell division through a previously unknown mechanism.</p><p>Lo et al.’s findings illustrate the high sensitivity of cells to changes in zinc availability and highlight the importance of zinc in our diet. Further study of how cells determine zinc levels and how those levels affect the cell cycle may help explain zinc’s role in health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>zinc deficiency</kwd><kwd>quiescence</kwd><kwd>live cell imaging</kwd><kwd>cell cycle regulation</kwd><kwd>micronutrient</kwd><kwd>quantitative image analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1-GM114863</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palmer</surname><given-names>Amy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM-065103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Damon</surname><given-names>Leah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Anna and John J.

Zn<sup>2+</sup> was first reported to be essential for growth of <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> in 1869 and subsequently demonstrated for plants, animals, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prasad, 1993</xref>) with the first cases of human Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency and the associated growth and developmental disorders described in 1961 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Prasad et al., 1961</xref>). Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency has since been recognized as a global health problem, and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates a staggering one third of the world’s population does not consume adequate Zn<sup>2+</sup> and is therefore at risk for associated side effects and comorbidities (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/whr/2002/chapter4/en/index3.html">https://www.who.int/whr/2002/chapter4/en/index3.html</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roohani et al., 2013</xref>). While the clinical manifestations of Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency are diverse and can be organism specific, one defining feature is universal: Zn<sup>2+</sup>-deficient cells fail to divide and proliferate normally, leading to organismal growth impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vallee and Falchuk, 1993</xref>). Despite recognition of the fundamental role of Zn<sup>2+</sup> for proliferation, the mechanisms of how Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency leads to cell-cycle arrest at the cellular and molecular level remain poorly defined.</p><p>Eukaryotic cell proliferation is governed by the cell-division cycle, a series of highly choreographed steps that involve gap (G1), DNA replication (S-phase), gap (G2), and mitosis (M) phases. Regulated transitions between proliferative and quiescent (i.e. reversible non-proliferative) states are essential for maintaining genome integrity and tissue homeostasis, ensuring proper development, and preventing tumorigenesis. Given the essentiality of Zn<sup>2+</sup> for growth and proliferation, a fundamental question is whether Zn<sup>2+</sup> serves as a nutrient, like amino acids, whether it affects the rate of cell cycle progression, or whether it is required at a specific phase of the cell cycle. Pioneering work by Chesters et al sought to define precisely when Zn<sup>2+</sup> is required in the mammalian cell cycle. By chelating Zn<sup>2+</sup> at different timepoints after release from serum starvation-induced quiescence, they found that Zn<sup>2+</sup> was important for thymidine incorporation and thus DNA synthesis, leading to the conclusion that Zn<sup>2+</sup> was required for the G1 to S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chesters et al., 1989</xref>). Subsequent studies confirmed that treatment of mammalian cells with high concentrations of metal chelators (DTPA and EDTA) seemed to compromise DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chesters et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chesters and Boyne, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watanabe et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prasad et al., 1996</xref>). However, later studies by Chesters et al suggested that after cells passed the restriction point in mid-G1 there was no further Zn<sup>2+</sup> requirement for DNA synthesis in S phase, but rather Zn<sup>2+</sup> was needed to transition from G2/M back into G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chesters and Petrie, 1999</xref>). The restriction point is classically defined as the point at which cells commit to completing the cell cycle, regardless of the presence of external growth factors such as mitogens and/or serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pardee, 1974</xref>). Thus, while these early studies suggested that Zn<sup>2+</sup> was important for progression of the mammalian cell cycle, the precise role of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and whether it is required at a specific stage have remained enigmatic.</p><p>There are three limitations of these early studies on the role of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in cell proliferation. First, because the analyses were carried out on populations of cells, the cells were synchronized by artificial means (serum starvation or hydroxyurea treatment) and the cell cycle phase was inferred based on release from the cell cycle block. Recently, it has become clear that synchronization can induce stress response pathways that are specific to the type of arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matson and Cook, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Min and Spencer, 2019</xref>). Further, cells induced into quiescence by different mechanisms (serum starvation, loss of adhesion, contact inhibition) exhibit overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles, suggesting that different synchronization approaches impact cell cycle analysis upon emergence from quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coller et al., 2006</xref>). Second, population level analyses such as immunoblotting and qPCR mask cellular heterogeneity and subpopulations of cells with different cell fates and cell cycle dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matson and Cook, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>). Recent application of imaging and measurement tools for single cell analysis has uncovered distinct subpopulations of cells with different cell cycle dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>), and revealed key orders of molecular events in the decision between proliferation and quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cappell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heldt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moser et al., 2018</xref>). Third, many of the previous investigations into the role of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the mammalian cell cycle have relied on high concentrations of chelators (DTPA, EDTA or TPEN) to induce Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency. However, these studies did not explicitly define how these perturbations changed the intracellular labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> pool, nor did they characterize how the chelators affected cell viability. Indeed, the concentrations of chelators used have been shown to induce apoptosis in a number of different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sunderman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kolenko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canzoniero et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corniola et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makhov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carraway and Dobner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mendivil-Perez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we revisit the fundamental and unresolved question of how Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency blocks cell proliferation using a combination of fluorescent reporters, high throughput microscopy, and quantitative image analysis. It is often overlooked that in addition to serving as a reservoir for mitogens, serum is also the major source of essential micronutrients including Zn, Fe, Cu, and Mn, and thus complete removal of serum also eliminates exogenous supply of these and other essential nutrients. By controlling Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the medium, while maintaining mitogens at levels that normally sustain proliferation, we induced subtle perturbations of labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the cytosol from 1 pM to 210 pM and tracked asynchronously cycling cells over multiple rounds of cell division. We found that Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency induces cellular quiescence, but not death, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> resupply stimulates synchronized cell cycle reentry. By following the entry of single cells into quiescence over time after Zn<sup>2+</sup> deprivation, we found that depending on where cells were in the cell cycle, they either entered quiescence immediately after mitosis, or entered the cell cycle but stalled in S phase. Further, we determined that cells stalled in S phase were defective in DNA synthesis and had increased levels of DNA damage, consistent with previous bulk analysis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ho and Ames, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ho et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yan et al., 2008</xref>) suggesting a critical role for Zn<sup>2+</sup> in maintaining genome integrity during replication. Finally, we found that Zn<sup>2+</sup>deficiency-induced quiescence does not require p21, suggesting a mechanism distinct from spontaneous quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moser et al., 2018</xref>), and follows a different pattern than mitogen withdrawal. Ultimately, our study provides new insights into when Zn<sup>2+</sup> is required during the mammalian cell cycle and the consequences of insufficient Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nutritional Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels influence cell proliferation and intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels</title><p>To revisit the question of how Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency blocks cell growth and proliferation, we leveraged tools to visualize, track and measure molecular markers using fluorescent reporters in naturally cycling cells at the single cell level. Mammalian cells are generally recognized to contain hundreds of micromolar total Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krezel and Maret, 2006</xref>), which they are able to concentrate from the extracellular environment. The concentration of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in human serum is about 12–15 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hess, 2017</xref>) and cell culture medium typically contains 1–40 µM Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glassman et al., 1980</xref>), much of which is supplied by the serum. To rigorously control Zn<sup>2+</sup> availability in our growth medium, we treated serum and insulin (major sources of Zn<sup>2+</sup>) with Chelex 100 to scavenge Zn<sup>2+</sup>. We then generated a minimal medium (MM) containing a low percentage of serum (1.5%) still sufficient for proliferation that contained 1.46 µM Zn<sup>2+</sup> as determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), which was significantly lower than the 2.2 µM Zn<sup>2+</sup> measured in MM not treated with Chelex 100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further manipulate Zn<sup>2+</sup>, MM was either supplemented with 30 µM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> to generate a Zn<sup>2+</sup> replete medium (ZR) or 2–3 µM of a Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelator, tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) to generate a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-deficient medium (ZD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). TPA can chelate other metal ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), but with significantly lower affinity, except for Cu which binds TPA with high affinity. Using the CF4 Cu fluorescent probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>), we determined that the low concentration of TPA used in this study does not perturb the labile Cu pool. On the other hand, the Cu chelator neocuproine does deplete Cu, indicating that CF4 is capable of detecting depletion of the Cu pool in MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To establish the effect of ZD, MM, and ZR media on cell viability, we grew cells in the respective medium for 30 hr and measured viability using trypan blue. We also compared TPA to N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), another Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelator that has been widely used in studying the effect of Zn<sup>2+</sup>-deficiency on cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beyersmann and Haase, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haase and Maret, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaltenberg et al., 2010</xref>). Even at the low end of TPEN concentrations reported in the literature (3 µM), greater than 70% cell death was observed at 24 hr, compared to 3 µM TPA with ~15 % cell death. When noted, an even milder ZD condition of 2 µM TPA was used and this condition resulted in only ~1% cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Our results are consistent with several studies that found TPEN induces apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sunderman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kolenko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canzoniero et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corniola et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makhov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carraway and Dobner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mendivil-Perez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To determine how defined Zn<sup>2+</sup> medium conditions influenced intracellular labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels in the cytosol, we created an MCF10A cell line stably expressing a genetically encoded FRET-based sensor for Zn<sup>2+</sup> (ZapCV2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fiedler et al., 2017</xref>), grew the cells in ZD, MM, and ZR media, and measured the resting FRET ratio in individual cells. Cells grown in ZD had a significantly lower average FRET ratio than cells grown in MM, while those grown in ZR conditions had significantly higher FRET ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The FRET ratio correlates with the amount of labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the cytosol, and in situ calibration suggests the respective Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels are approximately 1, 80, and 210 pM for ZD, MM, and ZR media, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that exogenous nutritional Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels positively influence intracellular free Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nutritional Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels influence cell proliferation and intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The FRET ratio, which is proportional to labile Zn<sup>2+</sup>, of cells expressing ZapCV2 and grown in ZD, MM, or ZR conditions (n = 103, 382, and 402, respectively, pooled from four wells from each condition).

Thus, the ratio of cytosolic/nuclear fluorescence can be used as a readout for CDK2 activity and serves a ‘molecular timer’ for progression through the cell cycle.

Individual cells were segmented, tracked, and analyzed for CDK2 activity using a custom MATLAB pipeline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In Zn<sup>2+-</sup>sufficient medium, cells cycled naturally throughout the observation window, as evidenced by the observation of mitosis events, inter-mitotic time, and cyclical decrease in CDK2 activity after mitosis, followed by increase marking cell cycle commitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). When cell traces from each condition were aligned computationally to mitosis, we observed all three cell fate classifications (CDK2<sup>inc</sup>, CDK2<sup>emerge</sup>, CDK2<sup>low</sup>) with a similar percentage in each category in MM and ZR media (CDK2<sup>inc</sup>56% vs. 60%, CDK2<sup>emerge</sup>49% vs 41%, CDK2<sup>low</sup>17% vs 14% for MM and ZR, respectively). However, in ZD medium the number of mitosis events ceased after about 20 hr, the CDK2 activity either stayed low or rose to an intermediate level, and cells rarely underwent multiple rounds of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Computational alignment to mitosis and cell classification revealed that few cells were born with CDK2 activity sufficient to commit to the next cell cycle (9% CDK2<sup>inc</sup>), a significant decrease compared to MM and ZR, and there was a substantial increase in the percentage of cells with low CDK2 activity following mitosis CDK2<sup>low</sup> (41%). One of the most striking differences between ZD and MM or ZR conditions was the fate of cells that attempted to re-enter the cell cycle (i.e. whose CDK2 activity increased) following mitosis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, in ZD medium CDK2<sup>emerge</sup> cells increased CDK2 activity after a period of transient quiescence but plateaued at an intermediate CDK2 activity (a ratio of about 1.2), did not achieve maximal CDK2 activity, and failed to divide. Similarly, CDK2<sup>inc</sup> cells increased CDK2 activity to an intermediate level before they dropped to a low level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Analysis of mitosis events revealed that these cells did not divide before entering the CDK2<sup>low</sup> state. These results suggest a significant increase in the number of cells that go quiescent after mitosis and the emergence of a new cell fate, where cells attempt to re-enter the cell cycle but stall part-way through under conditions of Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency.</p><p>We also measured the elemental profile in response to 24 hr of growth in Zn-deficient conditions as compared to MM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition to Zn, there were significant decreases in Fe and Cu levels and significant increases in Mg, K, P, S, and Mn in ZD compared to MM growth conditions. These findings are consistent with the fact that large transcriptional changes have been identified in quiescent cells and suggest major remodeling of metal homeostasis following a period of Zn deficiency-induced quiescence.</p><p>To further define how Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency influences cell fate and characterize the consequences of the altered CDK2 activity profile in ZD cells, we examined a downstream CDK2 substrate, retinoblastoma protein (Rb). When CDK2 levels are low, Rb binds to and inhibits E2F family transcription factors, blocking cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giacinti and Giordano, 2006</xref>). As CDK2 activity increases, Rb gets hyper-phosphorylated which releases the inhibition, enabling E2F to transcribe cell cycle genes. A previous study showed that cells born with elevated CDK2 activity also had hyper-phosphorylated Rb (pRb), as determined by immunofluorescence, whereas cells born with CDK2<sup>low</sup> had low levels of phosphorylated Rb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>). We employed a similar protocol to measure phosphorylated Rb and DNA content by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). After 24 hr of growth in MM or ZR media, the majority of cells had hyper-pRb with either 2N, intermediate, or 4N DNA content, suggesting cells were actively cycling through G1, S, G2, and M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The small fraction of cells with hypo-pRb and 2N DNA content, correspond to the small fraction of cells with CDK2<sup>low</sup> and represent quiescent cells. Treatment of cells with 2 μM TPA for 24 hr revealed that most cells had 2N DNA content and hypo-pRb, consistent with most cells being in a quiescent state. However, some cells had hyper-pRb, indicating elevated CDK2 activity and an attempt to progress through the cell cycle, although there was a decrease in the fraction of cells with 4N DNA content indicating a deficiency in DNA replication. With 3 μM TPA the majority of cells had hypo-pRb with 2N DNA content, consistent with a quiescent state. A small population of cells had hypo-pRb and 4N DNA content, suggesting that after DNA replication, the cells entered quiescence without undergoing mitosis, consistent with the CDK2<sup>inc</sup> population of cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> that slips back to a CDK2<sup>low</sup> state. Combined, these results indicate that Zn<sup>2+</sup> is required for cell cycle progression and there is heterogeneity in the cellular response to Zn<sup>2+</sup> deprivation; some cells are born with low CDK2 activity and immediately enter quiescence, while others are born with elevated CDK2 activity (CDK2<sup>inc</sup>) or increase CDK2 activity after some delay (CDK2<sup>emerge</sup>). Further, our results suggest that the milder the Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency, the more cells attempt to progress through the next cell cycle following mitosis. However, there is a clear requirement for Zn<sup>2+</sup> to successfully progress past S-phase to G2/M, which we explore below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Timing of Zn<sup>2+</sup> removal with respect to the cell cycle state influences cell fate</title><p>The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> revealed heterogeneity in cell fate in response to Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency. Given that the cells were cycling asynchronously prior to Zn<sup>2+</sup> deprivation, we wondered whether the cell fate was determined by a cell’s position in the cell cycle at the time of Zn<sup>2+</sup> withdrawal. To address this, we imaged cells expressing the CDK2 sensor in MM for 8 hr to track cell cycle progression prior to Zn<sup>2+</sup> deprivation and follow entry of cells into quiescence. We binned cell traces according to when cells divided within specific 4 hr windows relative to TPA addition (hr 0), from 4 hr before TPA addition (−4 to 0) up to 16 hr after TPA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, gray shaded boxes). For cells that divided within 4 hr prior to TPA addition, a small but elevated percent of cells went quiescent (15% vs. 7% in MM), suggesting that cells need Zn<sup>2+</sup> when exiting mitosis and progressing into G1. Still, when cells divided within 4 hr of Zn<sup>2+</sup> deprivation, the majority of cells re-enter the cell cycle either immediately (CDK2<sup>inc</sup>) or with a slight delay (CDK2<sup>emerge</sup>). What was striking about this population of cells, was that only a small fraction was able to complete the next round of cell division compared to cells in MM conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> top two panels), and instead most cells stalled with an intermediate CDK2 ratio. Thus, even if cells are born with elevated CDK2 activity and pass the classical restriction point defined by a need for extracellular growth signals such as mitogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pardee, 1974</xref>), they rarely progress past an intermediate CDK2 activity in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>. In cells that divided in subsequent windows of time after TPA addition, there was a progressive decrease in the percentage of cells born with elevated CDK2 activity and classified as CDK2<sup>inc</sup> (43%, 30%, 17%, and 5%), indicating that longer Zn<sup>2+</sup> deprivation increases the probability of cells entering quiescence after mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> top to bottom). There was a small increase in the percent of quiescent cells in unperturbed MM over time due to increased cell density and quiescence induced by contact inhibition. Notably, when Zn<sup>2+</sup> was removed prior to cell division and cells attempted to enter another round of the cell cycle, they stalled at an intermediate CDK2 activity, consistent with an inability to progress past S-phase in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Timing of Zn<sup>2+</sup> deprivation with respect to cell cycle phase influences cell fate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single cell traces of CDK2 ratio over time in cells grown for 8 hr in MM followed by 24 hr in ZD conditions (left panels) or in unperturbed MM (right panels).

We computationally grouped cell traces by their CDK2 activity at the end of the growth period, demonstrating 1) the two major cell fates for ZD cells: quiescence in red and stalled at intermediate CDK2 in green-turquoise and 2) that if cells divided more than 8 hr after TPA addition they entered quiescence immediately after cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> top panel). If cells divided within 8 hr of TPA addition, the majority re-entered the cell cycle and stalled at an intermediate CDK2 activity (green-turquoise), consistent with an inability to progress past S-phase. As the time between TPA addition and cell division increased from 0 to ~8 hr, a greater proportion of cells experienced a prolonged low CDK2 activity period (longer red streak) before re-entering the cell cycle. These results suggest that if cells experience a short window of Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency they have a greater chance of re-entering the cell cycle; but as the length of time increases, cells experience prolonged bouts of low CDK2 activity, suggesting that Zn<sup>2+</sup> plays a role in processes involved in ramping up CDK2 activity to promote cell cycle entry. In contrast, the majority of cells in MM continued to cycle throughout the measurement window.</p><p>To compare Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency-induced quiescence to mitogen withdrawal, we aligned CKD2 traces computationally to the time of mitosis, with the first mitosis event at the top of the heat map (3B, bottom panel). Previously, this analysis demonstrated that if mitogens are withdrawn from newly born CDK2<sup>inc</sup> cells, they completed one additional round of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that achieving a certain threshold of CDK2 activity marks cell-cycle commitment, regardless of mitogen availability. When aligned in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom), our traces reveal that the CDK2 activity window that defines cell cycle commitment with respect to mitogen removal does not apply to Zn<sup>2+</sup> removal. Instead, as other data representations suggest, even if cells pass the restriction point for mitogens, they stall at an intermediate CDK2 activity in the absence of sufficient Zn<sup>2+</sup>, suggesting that Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency-induced quiescence acts through a different pathway compared to mitogen withdrawal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency causes a defect in DNA synthesis</title><p>Because we found a large population of cells which stalled at an intermediate CDK2 activity under Zn<sup>2+</sup>-deficient conditions and speculated that these cells were stalled in S phase, we wanted to measure whether these cells were capable of DNA synthesis.

Plotting EdU intensity against DNA content for single cells revealed the expected distribution of cell cycle phases, where EdU negative cells (Edu<sup>-</sup>) with 2N DNA were in quiescence (G0) or G1, EdU<sup>-</sup> cells with 4N DNA were in G2 or M, and EdU positive cells (Edu<sup>+</sup>) transitioning between 2N and 4N were in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, cell cycle phases shown in boxes on right plot). In MM and ZR, the Edu vs. DNA content density plot followed a classical arch distribution, as has been found previously for MCF10A in full growth medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gookin et al., 2017</xref>). In ZD conditions, cells did not exhibit high EdU intensity, indicating normal DNA synthesis was impaired, and a large portion of cells were EdU<sup>-</sup> with 2N DNA content, consistent with quiescence. Interestingly, in ZD conditions, many cells between 2N and 4N DNA content exhibited some Edu staining above that of cells classified as EdU<sup>-</sup>, suggesting that some cells are able to enter S phase, begin DNA synthesis, but at a reduced rate in the 15 min interval. The EdU intensities for cells grown in 2 µM TPA were slightly higher than those for cells grown in 3 µM TPA, demonstrating that 2 µM TPA is a milder ZD condition and impairment of DNA synthesis was less severe. These data confirm our findings from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, where in addition to quiescence, a cell fate with intermediate CDK2 activity exists. This state of intermediate CDK2 activity is indeed S phase, as indicated by cells undergoing DNA synthesis, albeit at a reduced rate.

Further, because we found that ZD conditions caused a defect in DNA synthesis, we wanted to assess whether cells stalled in S phase were experiencing replication stress. Because we observed heterogeneity in cell cycle fates upon Zn<sup>2+</sup> withdrawal, we sought to measure DNA damage at the single cell level and correlate it with a cell cycle marker. Previously, Arora and coworkers determined that whether naturally cycling cells enter quiescence and how long they spend in quiescence is in part explained by levels of double-stranded break (DSB) DNA damage inherited from mother cells, as measured by tracking fluorescent 53BP1 foci (a known marker of DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2017</xref>). Around the same time, Barr and coworkers demonstrated that both DSBs and single strand breaks (SSBs, measured by RPA2 foci) during S phase contribute to induction of quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr et al., 2017</xref>). We used a similar approach, quantifying 53BP1 and RPA2 puncta in individual cells to identify the presence of DSB and SSB, respectively. We correlated DNA damage markers with the cell cycle using phospho-Rb status in thousands of individual cells exposed to 24 hr of either ZD, MM, or ZR growth conditions, where cells that were hypo-pRb were classified as quiescent, while hyper-pRb cells were classified as cycling (G1, S, G2 or M). For cells classified as quiescent (hypo-pRb), there was no significant difference in the fraction of cells with 53BP1 foci (DSBs) and a small but statistically significant increase in RPA2 foci (SSB) (4% versus &lt;1% in MM and ZR) in ZD versus MM and ZR media. These results suggest that DNA damage is likely not the primary mechanism of quiescence induction in Zn<sup>2+</sup>-deficient cells. However, in cycling cells, there was a significant increase in 53BP1 foci (87% in ZD versus ~45% in MM and 41 ZR) and RPA2 foci (~17% in ZD versus &lt;1% in MM and ZR). DNA damage was measured after 24 hr in the respective medium, and for cells in ZD, this time point corresponds to about 60% of the cells in a low CDK2 activity/quiescent state and 40% of the cells stalled at a state with intermediate CDK2 activity, consistent with S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref>, 24 hr time point). Given the increase in DNA damage in cycling cells, but relatively subtle change in DNA damage in quiescent cells, we speculate that the cells with increased DNA damage correspond to the cells stalled in the cell cycle at S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and that Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency induces a defect in DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) that contributes to the inability of these cells to progress to G2/M. Our results also suggest that Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency can induce quiescence independent of induction of DNA damage because those cells that have gone quiescent by 24 hr do not exhibit a profound increase in DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Quiescence induced by Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency does not require p21</title><p>p21 is a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that binds to and inhibits the activity of cyclin-CDK complexes, thus regulating cell cycle progression. p21 is upregulated in response to contact inhibition and growth factor withdrawal and contributes to cell cycle arrest upon these perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perucca et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, p21 is a transcriptional target of p53 and has been shown to be upregulated in response to DNA damage, which results in cell cycle arrest and presumably enables DNA repair prior to cell cycle re-entry. Thus, p21 has emerged as an important regulator of the proliferation-quiescence decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr et al., 2017</xref>). This is underscored by the observation that in p21 null cells, the incidence of spontaneous quiescence is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2017</xref>). Given that Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency influences cell cycle progression by inducing quiescence and that it also results in increased DNA damage, we sought to determine whether quiescence resulting from Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency requires p21. We grew WT and p21<sup>-/-</sup> MCF10A cells expressing the CDK2 reporter and measured the fraction of cells in each classification (CDK2<sup>low/emerge/high</sup>) under ZD, MM, and ZR conditions (Figure 6A). p21 knockdown was validated as described in the methods section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In WT cells grown in MM or ZR, 17% or 16% (respectively) of cells were classified as quiescent (CDK2<sup>low</sup>), while in p21<sup>-/-</sup> cells, only 8% or 5% cells were classified as quiescent, consistent with previous results suggesting that spontaneous quiescence in naturally cycling cells is induced by endogenous DNA damage and is dependent on p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr et al., 2017</xref>). In ZD conditions quiescence occurred at a similar rate in p21<sup>-/-</sup> and WT cells (42% vs. 56%), suggesting that quiescence caused by Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency does not explicitly require p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This is perhaps not surprising, given that the cell population that was quiescent after 24 hr of growth in Zn<sup>2+-</sup>deficient medium did not exhibit increased DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Combined, our data indicate that Zn<sup>2+</sup>-deficiency induces quiescence via a p21-independent pathway. Because p21 is also upregulated to maintain quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coller et al., 2006</xref>), we measured p21 levels in WT MCF10A cells using immunofluorescence after 40 hr of growth. In ZD medium, cells that maintained low CDK2 activity had higher levels of p21, similar to cells in MM medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These data suggest that although p21 is not required for entry into quiescence, in WT cells p21 is upregulated when cells are quiescent, likely to maintain their quiescent state by suppressing CDK2 activity.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency leads to increased DNA damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cells were grown in ZD, MM, or ZR media for 24 hr and then stained with antibodies for pRb and either 53BP1 (a marker of DSB) or RPA2 (a marker of SSB).

Regulated exit of the cell cycle to quiescence is an important quality control pathway that reduces metabolic and biochemical activities and protects cells against stress and toxic metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tümpel and Rudolph, 2019</xref>). Given the importance of understanding the factors that regulate cell cycle entry, progression, and exit to quiescence, decades of research have sought to define the underlying mechanisms of the proliferation-quiescence ‘decision’. Much of our understanding of the mammalian cell cycle has derived from studies in which populations of cells were forced to exit the cell cycle upon induction of stress, such as serum starvation or amino acid deprivation. These studies have revealed many of the key regulators of the cell cycle and introduced the concept of a restriction point, a point at which cells commit to the cell cycle, and become mitogen-independent. However, recent application of single cell technologies for tracking cellular and molecular markers and the fate of individual cells have led to key revisions of the textbook model of the mammalian cell cycle, including the discovery that in naturally cycling cells there are multiple proliferation decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matson and Cook, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cappell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heldt et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, it is now appreciated, but still poorly understood that quiescence is not a single dormant state, but rather an assemblage of heterogeneous states, that is actively maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matson and Cook, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yao, 2014</xref>). Broadly speaking, control of the decision to proliferate or arrest is fundamental to various aspects of tissue architecture maintenance, differentiation, DNA damage repair, wound healing, and normal vs. cancerous cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matson and Cook, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heldt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Thus, understanding how individual triggers act to induce quiescence is important for ultimately identifying targets for improving nutritional deficiencies or disease states.</p><p>Building on the emerging conceptual framework of studying the cell cycle in asynchronous populations of cells, in this work we apply a combination of fluorescent reporters, high throughput imaging, and quantitative image analysis to revisit the important but unresolved question of how Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency blocks cell proliferation. While it has long been recognized that Zn<sup>2+</sup> is required for cell proliferation, how Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency influences the cell cycle on a single cell level has not been elucidated and whether Zn<sup>2+</sup> affects the critical proliferation-quiescence cell fate decision has not been determined. Zn<sup>2+</sup> is an essential metal that serves as a critical cofactor in approximately 10% of the proteins encoded by the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreini et al., 2006</xref>), including over 700 Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger containing transcription factors, DNA polymerase, superoxide dismutase, and proteins involved in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lambert et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is required for several key cellular processes involving these proteins, including processes relevant for the cell cycle such as transcription, antioxidant defense, DNA synthesis and repair.</p><p>It is often overlooked that in addition to serving as a reservoir for mitogens, serum is also the major source of essential micronutrients including Zn, Fe, Cu, and Mn, and thus complete removal of serum also eliminates exogenous supply of these and other essential nutrients. We sought to isolate the effect of Zn<sup>2+</sup> by examining Zn<sup>2+</sup> deprivation in an asynchronous population of cells still containing sufficient mitogen levels. We subjected cells to mild Zn<sup>2+</sup> perturbations that altered the labile pool of cytosolic Zn<sup>2+</sup> between 1 and 210 pM and avoided induction of cell death. Upon Zn<sup>2+</sup> deprivation, cells lost the ability to proliferate and the majority experienced one of two cell fates: entry into quiescence or stall in S phase. This resultindicates that unlike mitogens there is not a single restriction point for Zn<sup>2+</sup>, perhaps because it would be too hard to evolve a checkpoint for every nutrient, or perhaps because Zn<sup>2+</sup> is essential for so many cellular processes. Tracking individual cells before and after Zn<sup>2+</sup> deprivation revealed the temporal development of these two distinct fates, demonstrating that Zn<sup>2+</sup> is required at multiple places in the cell cycle and the depth of Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency relative to mitosis determines the cell fate. If cells underwent mitosis within 8 hr of Zn<sup>2+</sup> withdrawal, they were likely to re-enter the cell cycle and complete G1 before stalling in S phase, with a markedly prolonged S-phase (plateau at intermediate CDK2 activity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These cells synthesized DNA at reduced rates and accumulated increased amounts of DNA damage, indicating that sufficient Zn<sup>2+</sup> is necessary for maintaining DNA integrity. These results are consistent with previous work which showed at a population level that long term (multi-day) Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency led to increased DNA damage as measured by a comet assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ho and Ames, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ho et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we find that Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency increases both DSBs and SSBs in cycling hyper-phosphorylated Rb cells (~1.9 fold increase in DSBs and ~170 fold increase in SSBs compared to cells in MM or ZR). It is well established that Zn<sup>2+</sup> is a critical cofactor in a number of genome caretaker proteins, such as XPA and RPA of the nucleotide excision repair pathway, PARP involved in base excision repair, HERC2 involved in DSB recognition, CHFR involved in checkpoint regulation, and transcription factors such as p53 and BRCA that are involved in DNA damage response and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Danielsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Witkiewicz-Kucharczyk and Bal, 2006</xref>). While in vitro studies indicate these proteins would not function without Zn<sup>2+</sup>, little is known about the metal-binding properties in cells, how the myriad proteins of the zinc proteome acquire their Zn<sup>2+</sup>, and whether these proteins are sensitive to subtle perturbations of the labile zinc pool. Ho and coworkers demonstrated that long-term Zn<sup>2+</sup> depletion decreased the binding of transcription factors such as p53 and AP1 to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ho and Ames, 2002</xref>), and resulted in differential expression of genes involved in the cell cycle as well as DNA damage response and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yan et al., 2008</xref>). However, nothing was known about how rapidly cells sense Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency and how consequences of Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency, such as increased DNA damage, correlate with cell fate. By following the fate of cells over time in response to Zn<sup>2+</sup> withdrawal, we show that individual cells sense depletion of the labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> pool quickly (within 4 hr), and that cells in S-phase experience decreased rates of DNA synthesis and increased DNA damage, inducing cell cycle exit, despite these cells having sufficient mitogens to have passed the restriction point.</p><p>If cells divided &gt;8 hr after Zn<sup>2+</sup> withdrawal, the vast majority were born with low CDK2 activity and immediately entered a quiescent state. Intriguingly, these cells didn’t exhibit substantial increases in DNA damage and p21 was not required for entry into this quiescent state, indicating the mechanism of quiescence-induction is distinct from that of spontaneous quiescence. Entry into ‘spontaneous’ quiescence observed in naturally cycling cells was found to be associated with increased levels of DNA damage from the previous cell cycle was dependent on p21 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr et al., 2017</xref>). The observation that cells were born with low CDK2 activity suggests that Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency is sensed in the mother cell during the previous cell cycle. This new micronutrient deficiency-induced quiescent state occurs in the presence of mitogens and is not induced via replication stress/DNA damage. Importantly, quiescent cells and cells stalled in S phase after a period of Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency could be rescued by resupply of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and were competent to re-enter the cell cycle. Interestingly, we found that while the TPA chelator didn't perturb the labile pool of other metals such as Cu, the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-deficient quiescent state was characterized by notable changes in other essential metals, such as Cu, Fe, and Mn, suggesting significant changes to metal homeostasis in this quiescent state. Although quiescence was rescued exclusively by Zn (and not by Cu or Fe), it would be intriguing to study the mechanisms of metal homeostasis remodelling in a future study.</p><p>By addressing the question of how mild Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency reduces cell proliferation with modern tools at the single cell level in naturally cycling cells, we revealed that Zn<sup>2+</sup> status influences multiple checkpoints in the cell cycle, and uncovered a new quiescent state induced by micronutrient deficiency that is distinct from spontaneous quiescence and mitogen withdrawal. These findings are important for understanding how this cell cycle control might be perturbed in disease states such as cancer where Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels and localization have been shown to be perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prasad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandler et al., 2016</xref>). Future proteomic and transcriptomic studies have the potential to reveal the relevant Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent proteins that sense Zn<sup>2+</sup> status, thus uncovering the mechanism of entry into this quiescent state and the key Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent proteins responsible for maintaining genome integrity during DNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

maintained in full growth DMEM/F12 medium (FGM) supplemented with 5% horse serum, 1% Pen/strep antibiotics, 20 ng/mL EGF, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, and 10 μg/ml insulin in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2,</sub> as described previously by the Brugge lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Debnath et al., 2003</xref>). Cells were passaged with trypsin-EDTA. For imaging and growth experiments, cells were grown in 50:50 Ham’s F12 phenol red free/FluoroBrite DMEM with 1.5% Chelex 100-treated horse serum, 1% Pen/strep antibiotics, 20 ng/mL EGF, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, and 10 μg/ml Chelex 100-treated insulin. Chelex 100 was used to chelate excess Zn<sup>2+</sup> from horse serum and insulin to generate the defined minimal medium (MM). ICP-MS was used the measure the elemental content of Chelex 100-treated medium compared to untreated medium and revealed that Chelex 100 treatment significantly reduced Zn and Ni in the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We did not add back Ni (or other elements), but we consistently use Chelex 100–treated MM for all experiments so the concentration of elements other than Zn are the same in all media conditions. ZR medium was generated by supplementing MM with 30 µM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and ZD media was generated by adding 2–3 µM TPA. Cell lines were routinely tested and confirmed to be mycoplasma negative by PCR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>ICP-MS</title><p>ICP-MS was used to measure total Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, P, S, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn content in defined MM with and without Chelex 100 treatment of horse serum and insulin. Media samples were diluted 1:10 in Chelex 100- treated water with 1% TraceSELECT Ultra nitric acid (free of trace elements). Cells were grown for 24 hr in either 3 µM TPA, 2 µM TPA, or MM and the same elements as above were analyzed (four replicates per condition). Before digestion, cells were counted in triplicate. Cells were pelleted, rinsed with PBS, and cell pellets containing ~6–8 million cells were digested in 100 µL TraceSELECT Ultra nitric acid. Digestion was performed by vortexing constantly for 3 min followed by a 30 min incubation at 70°C. Samples were then diluted to 1 mL in Chelex 100 -treated water. All ICP-MS samples were processed at the Dartmouth Trace Element Analysis Core. Cell ICP-MS results were normalized to average cell counts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Plasmids and cell lines</title><p>MCF10A cell lines expressing PB-NES ZapCV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fiedler et al., 2017</xref>) and PB-H2B-mCherry were generated using the PiggyBac Transposon system via electroporation-mediated transfection. Stable cell lines used for long-term imaging were generated with G418 and puromycin antibiotic selection followed by FACS enrichment of dual positive fluorescent cells. The MCF10A cell line stably expressing DHB-Venus (CDK2 sensor) and H2B-mTurquoise2 and the MCF10A p21<sup>-/-</sup> were provided by the laboratory of Dr. Sabrina Spencer, CU Boulder, and generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>). Validation of p21 knockout in this cell line was performed using immunofluorescence with a p21 antibody, as described below (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Live cell imaging</title><p>Cells were counted with a Countess II Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and plated at a density of 2,500–3,500 cells/well ~ 24 hr before imaging in minimal medium in glass bottom 96-well plates (P96-1.5H-N, Cellvis, Mountain View, CA). This starting density was chosen to avoid significant contact inhibition during the imaging period. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, cells were plated in 100 µL MM and 2x media of each specific nutritional regime (ZD, MM, ZR) was added immediately prior to imaging. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, cells were plated in 100 µL MM and 2x ZD medium was added after 8 hr. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, cells were plated in 100 µL, 2x medium of specified conditions was added immediately prior to imaging; after 24 hr, 100 µL of medium was removed, and 2x medium of specified conditions was resupplied (effectively half of the medium was replaced with MM or 2x ZR media). For resupply of individual elements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, FeCl<sub>2</sub>, or CuCl<sub>2</sub> were added at concentrations found in a 50% MM change, 0.73 µM, 0.8 µM, and 0.16 µM, respectively). Images were collected using a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope microscope with a Lumencor SPECTRA X light engine (Lumencor, Beaverton, OR) and Hamamatsu Orca FLASH-4.0 V2 cMOS camera (Hamamatsu, Japan). Images were collected in time lapse series every 12 mins with a 10 × 0.45 NA Plan Apo objective lens (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY). During imaging, cells were in a controlled environmental chamber surrounding the microscope (Okolab Cage Incubator, Okolab USA INC, San Bruno, CA) at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 90% humidity. Total light exposure time was ≤600 ms per timepoint. Filter sets used for live cell imaging and immunofluorescence (described below) were as follows: CFP Ex: 440 Em: 475/20; GFP Ex: 470, Em: 540/21; YFP Ex: 470, Em: 540/21; CFPYFP FRET Ex: 395, Em: 540/21; mCherry Ex: 555, Em: 595/40; Cy5 Ex: 640, Em: 705/22.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image processing/Analysis</title><p>A detailed description of our custom MATLAB R2018A (Mathworks) pipeline for automated cell segmentation and tracking, as well as methods for calculating the FRET ratio and CDK2 ratio are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and the tracking code is available for download here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biof-git.colorado.edu/biofrontiers-imaging/palmer-zinc-cell-cycle">https://biof-git.colorado.edu/biofrontiers-imaging/palmer-zinc-cell-cycle</ext-link>. Briefly, mitosis events were identified when the nuclear signal generated by fluorescent H2B split into two distinct objects. The FRET ratio (FRET intensity/CFP intensity) was calculated in a cytosolic region outside the nuclear mask and the CDK2 ratio was calculated as the cytosolic intensity/nuclear intensity of the fluorescent CDK2 sensor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>FACS</title><p>Cell pellets were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with methanol at −20°C. Cells were stained for one hr with Phospho-Rb Ser 807/811 (D20B12 XP, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) at 1:500 dilution prior to Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (ab150073, Abcam, Cambrdige, MA) staining at 1:500 dilution for one hr. Antibodies were diluted in PBST with 1% BSA. PI DNA staining was performed using FxCycle PI/RNAse (Thermo Fisher Scientific F10797). FACS for phospho-Rb and PI was performed on a BD FACSCelesta instrument and analyzed with BD FACSDiva v8 software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). GFP: Ex 488, Em 530/30; mCherry Ex 561, Em 610/20. FACS enrichment of stable cell lines was performed using BD FACSAria Fusion with the following optics: CFP: Ex 445, Em 470/15; YFP: Ex 488, Em 530/30; and mCherry Ex 561, Em 610/20.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 solution. Blocking was performed in 3% BSA for one hr at 4°C. Primary antibody staining occurred overnight at 4°C, with the following antibody concentrations: p21, 1:200; pRB, 1:100, RPA2, 1:250; 53BP1, 1:200. Following primary staining, cells were washed with PBS and secondary antibody staining was performed for one hr with either AlexaFluor 488, AlexaFluor 568, or AlexaFluor 647 each at a 1:500 dilution. Antibodies were diluted in PBS with 3% BSA. Hoechst staining for 15 mins at 0.1 µg/mL diluted in PBS was used to identify nuclei. For experiments comparing CDK2 activity vs. p21 intensity, the fluorescence of the CDK2 sensor was preserved upon fixation. Images were acquired on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope (as described in Live Cell Imaging) with a 40 × 0.95 NA Plan Apo Lamda (Nikon). Primary antibodies used were: p21 Waf1/Cip1 (CST, 2947S, Lot 10), pRB Ser807/811 (CST, D20B12 XP, Lot8), RPA2 (Abcam, ab2175, Lot GR3224197-5), 53BP1 (BD Biosciences, 612523, Lot 6217571) and secondaries were: AlexaFluor 488 (Abcam, ab150073, Lot GR328726-1), AlexaFluor 568 (Life Sciences A10042, Lot 1134929), or AlexaFluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21244, Lot 1156625). Analyses were performed with custom MATLAB scripts and run in MATLAB R2018a. Briefly, nuclei were segmented using a combination of adaptive thresholding and the watershed algorithm to segment clumps of cells. The nuclear mask was used to calculate the mean nuclear pRB or p21 intensities for each cell. For cells containing the CDK2 sensor, the nuclear mask was used to draw a ring three pixels wide around the nucleus for computing the CDK2 activity (defined as the ratio of cytoplasmic intensity/nuclear intensity) of the cell. For DNA damage experiments, the centroid of each cell (as defined by the nuclear mask) was used to construct a 140 × 140 pixel square around each cell; this enabled the use of MATLABs ‘adaptthresh’ function for constructing an accurate foci mask for each cell. The foci mask was further refined by filtering out any objects that were not the appropriate size (area 10–100 px<sup>2</sup> for RPA2 and 10–200 px<sup>2</sup> for 53BP1) or shape (eccentricity &lt;0.6, where 0 is a perfect circle and one is straight line). Cells were scored as being positive for damage when they had one or more foci present.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>EdU assay</title><p>Live cells kept at controlled environmental conditions (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 90% humidity) were labeled with EdU according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C10356). Briefly, cells were labeled with 10 µM EdU for 15 mins, followed by fixation and permeabilization, as described for immunofluorescence. Cells were labeled for 30 mins via a click reaction with AlexaFluor 647 azide using CuSO<sub>4</sub> as catalyst. FxCycle PI/RNAse was used to quantify DNA content (2N vs 4N). Images were acquired on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope system with a 40 × 0.95 NA Plan Apo Lambda (Nikon). Analysis was performed with custom MATLAB scripts and run in MATLAB R2018a. The analysis workflow was the same as for immunofluorescence, with the exception that high residual background EdU staining necessitated background subtraction before quantifying intensities. Background subtraction was performed by dividing the image into 11 × 11 blocks and then using the lowest 5th percentile intensity value for each block as background. Quantification of DNA content was performed by computing the integrated intensity of each cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>FRET sensor calibration and analysis</title><p>Sensor calibrations of MCF10A cells stably expressing PB-NES-ZapCV2 were performed using the Nikon Ti-E. Cells were grown for 24 hr in either ZD (3 μM TPA), MM, or ZR media. For collection of R<sub>rest</sub>, cells were imaged for CFP-YFP FRET (200 ms exposure) and CFP (200 ms exposure) every 30 s for several mins. To collect R<sub>min</sub>, 50 µM TPA in MM was added and cells were again imaged for several mins. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate, calcium, and magnesium free HEPES-buffered HBSS, pH 7.4, for removal of TPA. Finally, for collection of R<sub>max</sub>, cells were treated with this HBSS buffer with 119 nM buffered Zn<sup>2+</sup> solution, 0.001% saponin, and 5 µM pyrithione, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter et al., 2017</xref>). Average R<sub>rest</sub> and R<sub>min</sub> were calculated by averaging across the timepoints collected. The maximum FRET ratio achieved after Zn<sup>2+</sup> addition was used as R<sub>max</sub>. Images were background corrected by drawing a region of interest in a dark area of the image and subtracting the average fluorescence intensity of the background from the average intensity of each cell. FRET ratios for each cell (n = 8 per condition) were calculated with the following equation: (FRET<sub>intensity</sub> of cell - FRET<sub>intensity</sub> of background)/(CFP<sub>intensity</sub> of cell - CFP<sub>intensity</sub> of background). Dynamic range (DR) of the sensor in each condition was calculating as R<sub>max</sub>/R<sub>min</sub>. Fractional saturation (FS) of the sensor in each condition was calculated as follows: (R<sub>rest</sub>-R<sub>min</sub>)/(R<sub>max</sub>-R<sub>min</sub>). Finally, Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were estimated by [Zn<sup>2+</sup>]=K<sub>D</sub> ((R<sub>rest</sub> - R<sub>min</sub>)/(R<sub>max</sub> - R<sub>rest</sub>))<sup>1/n</sup>, where K<sub>D</sub> = 5300 pM and n = 0.29 (Hill coefficient).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, FRET ratios between cells grown under ZD, MM, or ZR were compared using One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD, performed using KaleidaGraph v4.02.

This is an intriguing issue because while we know much about how the cell cycle is controlled in response to macronutrients, the mechanisms controlling the cell cycle in response to micronutrients such as metal ions is much less clear. The authors have improved on previous studies by adopting a growth condition of mild zinc deficiency in which cell death is minimal and by tracking the behavior of individual cells. They also used a FRET probe to establish the effect of their growth conditions on the labile zinc pool, which is the key determinant of whether newly synthesized zinc proteins obtain their metal cofactor. The authors' key findings are that zinc deficiency causes cells to arrest in either a quiescent phase or stalled in S phase, that cells stalled in S phase have increased DNA damage (consistent with the importance of zinc to DNA damage response pathways), and that the quiescence of zinc deficiency occurs thru mechanisms independently of DNA damage checkpoint regulation or response pathways to macronutrient starvation. Thus, this work is an important first step in defining micronutrient-responsive pathways of growth control. Overall the work is well done and clearly presented</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single cell analysis reveals multiple requirements for zinc in the mammalian cell cycle&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

While we know much about how the cell cycle is controlled in response to macronutrients, the mechanisms controlling the cell cycle in response to micronutrients such as Zinc is much less clear. The authors have improved on previous studies by adopting a growth condition of mild zinc deficiency in which cell death is minimal and by tracking the behavior of individual cells. Using a FRET probe they establish the effect of growth conditions on the labile zinc pool, which is the key determinant of whether newly synthesized zinc proteins obtain their metal cofactor.</p><p>Using markers of cell cycle progression, they show that zinc-deficient cells either become quiescent after mitosis or enter the cell cycle and stall in S-phase, and that zinc supplementation triggers re-entry into the cell cycle. Further, when zinc deficient, quiescent cells do not experience increased DNA damage, whereas cycling cells do. This is consistent with the importance of zinc in DNA damage response pathways and suggests that quiescence due to zinc deficiency occurs independent of DNA damage checkpoint regulation or responses to macronutrient starvation.</p><p>The experiments are well executed, clearly presented and point to a model where zinc is important at multiple places in the cell cycle. Given that many important zinc binding proteins have conserved roles in DNA synthesis, these are new and important observations that likely have broad significance.

It was unclear whether other metal ions were added back to the growth medium following Chelex treatment. Does Chelex treatment lead to a significant reduction in the levels of any other metals other than zinc, and if so where these metals added back?

To address this point, we did the following: 1) we surveyed the literature for information on the binding of TPA to other metals and provide a summary in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. 2) We tested whether the low concentrations of TPA used in this manuscript (3 μM) could alter the labile copper pool in MCF10A cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). 3) We measured ICP-MS of cells grown in TPA for 24 hrs (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), as suggested by the reviewers. The results of these are discussed below.</p><p>a) The only paper we could find measurement of binding of TPA to a variety of metal ions was: von Giorgio Anderegg et al., <italic>Helvetica Chimica Acta</italic>, Vol 60, Fasc 1 (1977) – Nr 1. We converted the ΔG<sub>binding</sub> values reported in this paper to K<sub>association</sub> and K<sub>dissociation</sub> values (Figure 1—figure supplement 2; assuming standard state conditions and 293K). The K<sub>d</sub> for binding to Zn<sup>2+</sup> was 4.95 x 10<sup>-12</sup> M. Given that the labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> pool in cells is ~ 100 pM (from multiple literature reports), TPA would be expected to decrease the labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> pool (as demonstrated in Figure 1). The Kd of TPA for other biologically relevant metal ions such as Fe and Mn were 3 to 6 orders of magnitude weaker, respectively, suggesting that TPA would be unlikely to perturb those metals. To our surprise, TPA had a high affinity for Cu<sup>1+</sup> (K<sub>d</sub> 2.24 x 10<sup>-17</sup> M). Multiple studies indicate that there is a kinetically labile pool of Cu in cells (Ackerman and Chang, 2017) and recent estimates suggest the level of Cu<sup>1+</sup> is 10<sup>-18</sup> M (Morgan et al., 2019). Multiple studies have indicated that 50-200 μM bathocuproine sulfate (BCS) or neocuproine (K<sub>d</sub> for Cu<sup>1+</sup> 1.26 x 10<sup>-20</sup> M) is required to reduce the labile Cu<sup>1+</sup> pool (Dodani et al., PNAS, 108(15), 2011; Xiao et al., 2018). Thus, we speculated that 2 – 3 μM TPA (with a 1000-fold weaker affinity than BCS or neocuproine for Cu<sup>1+</sup>) would be unlikely to directly perturb the Cu<sup>1+</sup> pool. To address this experimentally, we carried out the experiment detailed in point #2 below.</p><p>b) To test whether 3 μM TPA can perturb the labile Cu<sup>1+</sup> pool in cells, we obtained CF4 (K<sub>d</sub> 2.9 x 10<sup>-13</sup> M; Xiao et al., 2018) from Professor Chris Chang, treated cells with 3 μM TPA for two hours (conditions known to significantly decrease the labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> pool), and added CF4 to measure the labile Cu<sup>1+</sup> pool. As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, 3 μM TPA did not cause a measurable change in the CF4 fluorescence signal, while treatment with the Cu<sup>1+</sup> chelator neocuproine under typical treatment conditions (50 μM, 30 min) did cause a decrease in signal, demonstrating that CF4 is capable of detecting decreases in the labile Cu<sup>1+</sup> pool in MCF10A cells. These experiments suggest that although TPA can bind Cu<sup>1+</sup> with high affinity, the low concentrations of TPA used in this study don’t directly perturb the labile Cu<sup>1+</sup> pool.</p><p>c) As suggested by the reviewers, we carried out ICP-MS on cells treated with 2 or 3 μM TPA for 24 hrs. Importantly, these cells are quiescent and multiple studies have shown that quiescent cells undergo major transcriptional changes. We did observe significant changes in element distribution in these cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We believe that these changes result from remodeling of homeostasis in quiescent cells, perhaps as a consequence of zinc deficiency. For example, zinc deficiency may lead to changes in expression of zinc regulatory proteins such as transporters, and these transporters can also transport other metal ions. We think it is unlikely these changes occur because of direct perturbation of these elements by TPA, particularly given our experiments in (2) and because some elements (e.g. Mn) actually increase. But, to further strengthen the point that the main driver of quiescence is zinc depletion, we tested whether addition of zinc alone could rescue the quiescent phenotype as detailed in point #4 below.</p><p>d) In order to demonstrate the deficiency of zinc was the main driver of quiescence induction, we tested whether Zn alone, Cu alone, or Fe alone could rescue the quiescent state and induce cell cycle re-entry. As shown in Figure 7, minimal media was sufficient to induce cell cycle re-entry. Specifically, we replaced half the media with either minimal media or zinc-rich media. To test whether other elements present in minimal media could rescue quiescence, we added the concentration of each element measured by ICP-MS (Zn: 0.73 μM, Cu: 0.16 μM, Fe: 0.8 μM) to test for rescue. As shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1, only addition of Zn<sup>2+</sup> was able to rescue the quiescent state. This result reveals that although there are significant changes to cellular ion homeostasis in quiescence, rescue of zinc deficiency is sufficient to induce cell cycle re-entry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Chelex 100 will bind many other transition metals, including iron and manganese, besides zinc.

To address the question, we carried out ICP-MS on Chelex-100 treated and untreated minimal media to define the metal content. The results are presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. The data show that the only significant changes in metal content are decreases in zinc (~143 PPB to 95 PPB) and Ni (1 PPB to 0.7 PPB). We also clarify in the Materials and methods that we don’t add back any metals to the Chelex-100-treated minimal media. This means that the Ni concentration is slightly lower than normal. However, we would like to emphasize that we consistently compare TPA-treated or zinc-rich media to the same Chelex-treated minimal media so all medias should have the same concentration of Ni (as well as other nutrients that remained unchanged upon Chelex treatment).</p></body></sub-article></article>
