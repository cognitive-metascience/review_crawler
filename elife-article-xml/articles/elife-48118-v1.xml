in pain-initiating nociceptor neurons are attractive targets for new analgesics. We made a permanently charged cationic derivative of an N-type calcium channel-inhibitor. Unlike cationic derivatives of local anesthetic sodium channel blockers like QX-314, this cationic compound inhibited N-type calcium channels more effectively with extracellular than intracellular application. Surprisingly, the compound is also a highly effective sodium channel inhibitor when applied extracellularly, producing more potent inhibition than lidocaine or bupivacaine. The charged inhibitor produced potent and long-lasting analgesia in mouse models of incisional wound and inflammatory pain, inhibited release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from dorsal root ganglion neurons, and reduced inflammation in a mouse model of allergic asthma, which has a strong neurogenic component. The results show that some cationic molecules applied extracellularly can powerfully inhibit both sodium channels and calcium channels, thereby blocking both nociceptor excitability and pro-inflammatory peptide release.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cav2.2</kwd><kwd>calcitonin gene-related peptide</kwd><kwd>inflammatory

presynaptic nerve terminals of many neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Westenbroek et al., 1998</xref>), where they play a major role in synaptic transmission. In particular, N-type channels in primary sensory neurons play a major role in pain/nociceptive signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Park and Luo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hatakeyama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saegusa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sluka, 1997</xref>) and they are therefore an attractive target for inhibiting pain. In fact, one of the few new treatments for pain introduced in the last 50 years is intrathecal application of ziconotide, a highly potent peptide blocker of N-type calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Garber, 2005</xref>). While validating N-type calcium channels as a promising pharmacological target for treating pain, ziconotide has many practical drawbacks, as it is a large peptide with three disulfide bridges that is expensive to synthesize and must be administered intrathecally. Therefore, development of small molecule N-type blockers is an attractive strategy being actively pursued (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zamponi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zamponi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Patel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yekkirala et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Compared to the pharmacology of L-type (Cav1) calcium channels, which has been explored for many years, the pharmacology of N-type channels is still at an early stage. A number of L-type calcium channel inhibitors, including nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem, are widely-used clinically for treating arrhythmia and hypertension. The binding sites for the major classes of L-type calcium channel blockers have been defined (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Catterall and Swanson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tang et al., 2016</xref>) and the characteristics of inhibition have been studied in detail. In contrast, while the binding sites for peptide toxin inhibitors of N-type channels have been defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zamponi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bourinet and Zamponi, 2017</xref>), there is no such knowledge for small molecule inhibitors of N-type channels. In fact, most have been described based on screens that provide only minimal characterization of how they interact with channel gating or permeation.</p><p>There are general features that appear to be shared by many small-molecule inhibitors of voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels. The canonical small-molecule inhibitors of voltage-gated channels are local anesthetics like lidocaine, which inhibit voltage-dependent sodium channels by a mechanism that involves tight binding to open and inactivated states of the channel, with relatively weak binding to the closed resting state of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hille, 1977</xref>). This property results in channel inhibition that is promoted by steady depolarization (voltage-dependent inhibition) or by repeated cycling through the open state (use-dependence), which occurs if the recovery from depolarization-induced binding is slow enough. Most small-molecule inhibitors of calcium channels also show voltage-dependent inhibition. This behavior is characteristic of inhibition of L-type channels by nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Catterall and Swanson, 2015</xref>) and has also been described for many small molecule inhibitors of N-type calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zamponi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zamponi, 2016</xref>).</p><p>A particularly interesting feature of local anesthetic inhibition of sodium channels was revealed by studies of permanently charged cationic derivatives of the molecules, notably QX-314 (N-ethyl-lidocaine). QX-314 is ineffective in blocking neuronal sodium channels if applied externally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Frazier et al., 1970</xref>), apparently because it is too large to enter the outer mouth of the channel, but blocks effectively when applied to the internal (cytoplasmic) face of the channel, presumably because the inner mouth is larger. With intracellular application, QX-314 blocks sodium channels in a highly use-dependent manner because it enters channels only when the channels are open and is trapped inside channels when drug-occupied channels close (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Strichartz, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yeh, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cahalan and Almers, 1979</xref>). The inability of QX-314 to inhibit from the outside of the cell can be exploited to selectively block excitability of nociceptor neurons expressing channels like TRPV1 and TRPA1, whose pores are large enough to pass the QX-314 cation into the cell, effectively silencing only these neurons and producing a selective elimination of pain or itch by blocking action potential conduction to the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Binshtok et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Roberson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Puopolo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Spurred by the relative lack of knowledge about the pharmacology of N-type channel blockers and by the possibility of pursuing a strategy of large-pore channel-mediated drug entry to selectively block transmitter release from nociceptors, we explored the channel blocking properties of a cationic N-type channel inhibitor based on a scaffold described for a group of neutral N-type channel blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Seko et al., 2001</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that the cationic molecule effectively inhibits Cav2.2 channels when administered externally, as well as internally, and actually acts more rapidly with external application. Even more surprisingly, we found that the compound also very effectively inhibits both tetrodotoxin-sensitive and tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channels with external application, producing use-dependent sodium channel inhibition more potently than lidocaine or bupivacaine. In in vivo tests, the cationic molecule was highly effective in producing long-lasting analgesia in mouse models of surgical and inflammatory pain and was also very effective in reducing lung inflammation in an ovalbumin-sensitization model of allergic airway disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Voltage-dependent inhibition of Cav2.2 channels by neutral NNCB-2</title><p>Our strategy was to design a neutral compound with reasonably potent N-channel blocking activity that could be readily derivatized into a cationic molecule. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (inset) shows the neutral molecule that we designed for this purpose. Its structure is based on a scaffold of a family of molecules with blocking activity against N-type calcium channels described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Seko et al. (2001)</xref>, although it is not identical to any of the compounds they described. This molecule, which we call NNCB-2 (‘NNCB’ for ‘neutral N-type calcium channel blocker’) has a secondary amine group that can be readily converted to a quaternary form to form a cationic molecule, which we call CNCB-2 (‘CNCB’ for ‘cationic N-type calcium channel blocker’). We first examined the efficacy with which the neutral compound inhibits cloned N-type calcium channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We found effective and dose-dependent inhibition, with 10 µM NNCB-2 inhibiting calcium channel current by about 60% and 100 µM NNCB-2 producing complete inhibition in about 30 s, when applied at a holding potential of −70 mV, near typical neuronal resting potentials.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>State dependent inhibition of Cav2.2 channels by the neutral compound NNCB-2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of inhibition of Cav2.2 current by external NNCB-2 applied at concentrations from 3 to 100 µM.

We examined this possibility by testing whether channel opening is necessary for inhibition to develop, by applying the compound in the absence of depolarizing pulses to open the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We found that both NNCB-2 and CNCB-2 were able to inhibit effectively even in the absence of any channel opening. Application of 100 µM CNCB-2 for 3 min in the absence of stimulation resulted in a decrease of current to 33 ± 5% of control (n = 4, measured during the first depolarizing pulse after the 3 min application). Thus, inhibition by CNCB-2 can occur in the absence of channel opening.

Using a protocol in which various holding voltages were established for 2 s in a staircase-like manner, 3 µM CNCB-2 produced equal inhibition at holding voltages of −120 mV and −100 mV (to 67 ± 5% of control at −120 mV and to 67 ± 4% of control at −100 mV), where channels are in the resting state, but much more effective inhibition at more depolarized voltages where more channels are in inactivated states, inhibiting to 12 ± 4% of control from a holding potential of −60 mV where ~ 55% of channels are in the inactivated state under control conditions (n = 5 for all measurements).

We found that CNCB-2 potently inhibits action potential firing in these neurons. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> shows a typical example, in which the neuron fired multiple large-amplitude action potentials during depolarizing current injections in control conditions but only a single action potential of reduced size after application of 3 µM CNCB-2, even with large current injections.

This depolarization of the resting potential was never enough to stimulate firing of the neurons (which had an average threshold voltage of −32 ± 1 mV, n = 8).

We had two major surprises in the course of the work: first, that the charged version of the N-type calcium channel inhibitor was more effective in inhibiting N-type calcium channels with external than with internal application, in striking contrast to the charged lidocaine derivative QX-314, which acts only with intracellular application and has no effect when applied extracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Frazier et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Binshtok et al., 2007</xref>) and second, that the molecule is also a highly effective inhibitor of sodium channels when applied externally.</p><p>For both calcium and sodium channels, inhibition by CNCB-2 was enhanced if applied at more depolarized membrane potentials. This effect most likely reflects a dependence of binding on the gating state of the channel rather than some intrinsically voltage-dependent binding reaction, because the effect saturated when voltages were sufficiently negative to ensure that almost channels are in the resting non-inactivated state. Preferential binding to inactivated states of the channel is characteristic of many non-permanently charged small molecule inhibitors of both sodium and calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lenkey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lenkey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Swensen et al., 2012</xref>): <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kuryshev et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, however, QX-314 inhibition of sodium channels is qualitatively different from that of uncharged molecules in that QX-314 entry and exit appear to occur only when the channel is actually open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cahalan and Almers, 1979</xref>). In contrast, CNCB-2, like lidocaine, can clearly bind to inactivated channels in the absence of any significant channel opening.</p><p>Further work will be required to understand the molecular interactions that make it possible for charged CNCB-2 to interact with channels when applied externally. It seems unlikely that the inhibition by externally applied CNCB-2 represents movement through the membrane into the intracellular solution followed by entry into the internal mouth of the pore, because externally applied CNCB-2 acted much more rapidly than the same concentration applied directly inside the cell (for inhibition of both Cav2.2 and Nav1.7 channels). More plausible is access to a binding site on or in the channel that does not require complete translocation of the CNCB-2 molecule across the membrane. One possibility is that there could be partial entry into the bilayer of the more hydrophobic regions of the molecule so that the molecule localizes to the interface between lipid bilayer and the channel, perhaps even the voltage-sensing regions of the channel, analogous to the interaction seen with various toxins that interact with the gating regions of voltage-dependent channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Henriques et al., 2016</xref>). Another possibility is that the CNCB-2 molecule can somehow enter the pore region of the channel without first translocating to the cytosol. Recent molecular modeling enabled by cryo-EM structures of eukaryotic sodium channels suggests that the charged (protonated) form of lidocaine binds in the pore domain, with the cationic region of the molecule near the selectivity filter, partially displacing sodium ions in the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buyan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>). Modeling shows that the binding site for lidocaine in sodium channels can accommodate two lidocaine molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that the same intra-pore binding site could also accommodate the larger CNCB-2 molecule (MW 435 Daltons vs 234 Daltons for lidocaine). An intriguing possibility raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nguyen et al. (2019)</xref> is that a charged molecule like protonated lidocaine could enter the pore through ‘fenestrations’ in the pore forming regions of Domain III and Domain IV, as the uncharged form of lidocaine likely does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gamal El-Din et al., 2018</xref>), and they suggest that external QX-314 might enter the pore of Nav1.5 cardiac sodium channels by this pathway. However, molecular dynamic modeling on the scale of a few μsec cannot directly show the likelihood of such movements, which would be far slower, so this remains speculative. It is also not obvious why in neuronal sodium channels CNCB-2 could enter by this pathway if the smaller QX-314 molecule does not. Further experimental studies with a variety of cationic molecules will be needed to understand the structural characteristics enabling access from the external surface, complemented with the kind of molecular modeling done with lidocaine and QX-314 to understand likely binding sites within the channel. So far such modeling has been done for lidocaine binding to the inactivated state of the channel; similar modeling for interaction with resting state channels would be difficult with lidocaine, since the affinity is so low, but should be more feasible for CNCB-2, with its ~ 100 fold higher affinity than lidocaine for interacting with resting channels.</p><p>Molecular modeling may also be useful to understand why inhibition with CNCB-2 applied internally is slower than with external application in both Cav2.2 channels and Nav1.7 channels, a surprising result given the opposite behavior of QX-314. We cannot rule out the possibility that the inhibition by 300 µM internal CNCB-2 seen in Cav2.2 channels reflects slow movement of CNCB-2 molecules from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane to the external leaflet, especially because in these experiments the external medium was not flowing. A more general caveat for interpreting experiments with internal application of compounds in whole-cell recording is the inherent difficulty to accurately control the concentration of the compounds seen at the membrane, which reflects a combination of diffusion from the pipette and entry into or through the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jo and Bean, 2014</xref>). Application with inside-out patches could better define the kinetics and concentration- dependence of internally applied CNCB-2 but such experiments would be technically challenging because of the requirement for long-lived patches given the slow action of CNCB-2.</p><p>Sodium channel inhibition by external application has been reported for several other cationic small molecules, notably cationic derivatives of amitriptyline and duloxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gerner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), tricyclic molecules introduced clinically as antidepressants that have become first-line treatments for neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dworkin et al., 2010</xref>) where they may act in part by inhibition of sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dick et al., 2007</xref>). Inhibition by N-methyl-duloxetine was modulated by membrane potential in a manner consistent with preferential binding to inactivated channels, as we saw for CNCB-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). However, the interaction of CNCB-2 with sodium channels (estimated K<sub>R</sub> of 5.6 µM and K<sub>I</sub> of 0.71 µM) is far more potent than for N-methyl-duloxetine (estimated K<sub>R</sub> of 138 µM and K<sub>I</sub> of 2.8 µM), especially for interacting with the resting state of the channel. In fact, the high potency of resting channel inhibition by CNCB-2 stands out when compared with a systematic study of a large range of non-cationic sodium channel inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lenkey et al., 2010</xref>), where the lowest value of K<sub>R</sub> found was 21 µM (for the tricyclic antidepressant paroxetine) and most are &gt;100 µM.</p><p>This is the first test of a charged inhibitor of N-type calcium channels. A number of previous studies have examined inhibition of cardiac L-type calcium (Cav1.2) channels by charged derivatives of various small molecule inhibitors. Interestingly, different chemical classes of L-type calcium channel inhibitors behave very differently. A charged derivative of the benzothiazepine drug diltiazem behaves much like the QX-314 mediated inhibition of sodium channels, with little effect with external application but able to inhibit with intracellular application in a strongly use-dependent manner, as if the compound can enter channels from the inside and only when channels are open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shabbir et al., 2011</xref>). Several charged derivatives of the phenylalkylamine verapamil also produce strong use-dependent inhibition with internal application with no effect on external application (although one derivative did produce significant non-use-dependent inhibition with external application; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berjukov et al., 1996</xref>). In contrast, however, charged versions of the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel inhibitors have the opposite behavior, producing inhibition only with external application and having no effect when applied inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kass et al., 1991</xref>). It would be informative to explore possible parallels at the structural level in the ways in which CNCB-2 and charged dihydropyridine molecules are able to interact with various calcium and sodium channels from the outside.</p><p>Recent efforts to find new analgesics targeting sodium channels have focused on compounds that have high selectivity for Nav1.7 or Nav1.8 channels (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kornecook et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yekkirala et al., 2017</xref>) which are expressed in nociceptors but have little or no expression in heart or brain. Selectivity among sodium channel subtypes, or for sodium channels over other channel types, may be important for neutral compounds that are present systemically. However, the ability to non-selectively inhibit a wide range of sodium channels may actually be advantageous for a charged compound administered locally, because nociceptive neurons express a range of sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>) and inhibiting only one of them may not effectively block excitability. This may be a reason for the disappointing clinical results so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yekkirala et al., 2017</xref>), with the new generation of highly selective Nav1.7 inhibitors that bind with high affinity to external sites on Nav1.7 channels by means of a negatively charged ‘warhead’ region that interacts with externally-oriented parts of voltage-sensing regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahuja et al., 2015</xref>). Based on its similarly potent inhibition of Cav2.2 channels, Nav1.7 channels, and native TTX-sensitive and TTX-resistant channels, CNCB-2 is likely to inhibit a wide range of voltage-dependent channels. However, systemic exposure is likely to be very low, since the charged molecule is unlikely to penetrate well through tissue into the blood stream, which should minimize unwanted effects in tissues away from the site of application, including the heart and brain, unlike local application of anesthetics like lidocaine and bupivacaine.</p><p>It is remarkable that externally applied CNCB-2 inhibits sodium channels more potently than bupivacaine, one of the most potent local anesthetics. Recent work has introduced preparations of bupivacaine delivered in liposomes designed for slow release and longer-lasting effects when applied to wounds during surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abildgaard et al., 2019</xref>). The intrinsically higher potency and expected slower diffusion away from the site of application – as reflected in the long durations of action we saw in the mouse paw incision model - may make cationic CNCB-2 ideal for such applications even without packaging in liposomes, and its much greater solubility in aqueous solutions may facilitate its use in various other slow-release technologies for even longer-lasting local pain inhibition.</p><p>The dual inhibition of both sodium channels and calcium channels may make CNCB-2 or derivatives especially well-suited for treating inflammatory pain. Many kinds of inflammation involve a ‘vicious cycle’ of interactions between immune cells and nociceptor sensory neuron endings, in which inflammatory mediators from immune cells stimulate the neurons to release neuropeptides like CGRP, substance P, and VIP, which enhance local immune influx by producing vasodilation and increasing capillary permeability and can directly activate immune cells to release more cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Foster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Luger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nijhuis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Riol-Blanco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Talbot et al., 2015</xref>). A key element in neurogenic inflammation is calcium entry into neurons through voltage-dependent calcium channels, which triggers release of peptide-containing vesicles. In particular, N-type (Cav2.2) calcium channels mediate the neuronal release of neuropeptides and are found to be highly expressed in peptidergic primary sensory neurons involved in neurogenic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amrutkar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dunlap et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Holz et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Takasusuki and Yaksh, 2011</xref>). Inhibiting N-type channels with CNCB-2 constitutes a novel approach to reducing inflammation by inhibiting release of neuropeptides. Inhibiting N-type calcium channels should inhibit release of all neuropeptides, which may be more effective than targeting only one peptide, as, for example, in the current use of antibodies that target CGRP or its receptor to treat the vascular component of migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Raddant and Russo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mason and Russo, 2018</xref>). QX-314 also inhibits peptide release, presumably by reducing the depolarization that activates voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Talbot et al., 2015</xref>). CNCB-2 direct inhibition of Cav2.2 as well as sodium channels provides two mechanisms of reducing peptide release, which may increase the efficacy of the compound as an anti-inflammatory; CNCB-2 is more effective at 30 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) than 100 μM QX-314 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Talbot et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike QX-314 which will only enter cells in the presence of activated large pore channels, a feature of active inflammation, CNCB-2 can act even before inflammation is present, potentially preventing its establishment.</p><p>We validated this approach to treating inflammation using the clinically relevant mouse model of allergic airway disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Foster et al., 2017</xref>) in which inflammation levels can be easily measured by immunophenotyping the number and activation of immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The ability of combined calcium and sodium channel inhibition to reduce allergic airway inflammation is consistent with extensive evidence of a strong involvement of neuropeptide release in this form of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caceres et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Patterson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Talbot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wallrapp et al., 2017</xref>) and with the effect of sodium channel blockade with QX-314 in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Talbot et al., 2015</xref>). Other kinds of disease-associated inflammation known to critically involve release of inflammatory neuropeptides include atopic dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aubdool and Brain, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gouin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Misery, 2011</xref>), itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Oetjen et al., 2017</xref>), psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Luger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lotti et al., 2014</xref>), inflammatory bowel disease and colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chandrasekharan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chandrasekharan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Engel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Landau et al., 2007</xref>), arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krustev et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Walsh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bersellini Farinotti et al., 2019</xref>) and ocular inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mantelli et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore believe this neuronal targeted approach can potentially be used to treat many cutaneous or mucosal inflammatory conditions, where CNCB-2 is well-suited for local application by injection, inhalation, or topical application.</p><p>The recent scientific and patent literature has reported a wide range of uncharged compounds effective as N-type calcium channel blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbadie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pajouhesh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Seko et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yamamoto and Takahara, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zamponi et al., 2009</xref>), and many of these have structures that can be modified into cationic versions.

Mice were anesthetized with 3–4% isoflurane and surgery performed under maintenance anesthesia with 1.5–2% isoflurane. Following aseptic preparation with alternating washes of the plantar surface of the paw with 10% povidone-iodine solution and 70% alcohol, a 5 mm longitudinal incision was made on the plantar surface of the right paw with a number 11 surgical blade. The underlying muscles were elevated with forceps to confirm that the muscles and tendons were not damaged by the procedure. The skin was closed with two single sutures of 6–0 nylon. Twenty-four hours after the paw incision, mice were gently restrained in a cloth pocket and received a 10 μL bolus injection of either 15 or 30 mM CNCB-2, 30 mM bupivacaine, or vehicle (5% DMSO) in normal saline to the injured paw adjacent to the incision. Each group consisted of 8 mice, based on previous experiments showing sufficient power to detect significance with 95% confidence.

charged inhibitor of voltage-activated calcium channels. The results in your beautifully revised manuscript convincingly show that adding a permanent positive charge to a previously described uncharged inhibitor of N-type calcium channels results in a molecule that is surprisingly effective at inhibiting both N-type calcium channels and two types of voltage-activated sodium channels (Nav 1.7 and Nav 1.8) in a state-dependent manner from the extracellular side of the membrane. That your new charged inhibitor is more effective than uncharged local anesthetics for treating both incisional and inflammatory pain suggests that it is an exciting new lead molecule to be developed as an analgesic. Although previous studies with charged local anesthetics suggest that they are only effective at inhibiting sodium channels when applied to intracellular solutions, your surprising discovery of a charged inhibitor that is active on the extracellular side of voltage-activated calcium and sodium channels suggests that more effective new local analgesics might be discovered by adding charges to the growing number of neutral Nav 1.7 inhibitors being developed in search of new analgesics.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A novel cationic N-type calcium channel inhibitor active against neurogenic inflammation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Kenton Jon Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Diane Lipscombe (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript on the actions of positively charged and neutral small molecule inhibitors of N-type CaV channels. These compounds were synthesized based on previously described amino acid based CaV channel inhibitors, with the goal of extending the groups work on charges local anesthetic blockers of NaV channels that only block from the inside but can enter nociceptors through TRPV1 channels. In this case the charged inhibitor works from both sides, so the authors characterized the concentration and state-dependence of inhibition, showing that they can bind to closed channels but that they inhibit better at depolarized holding voltages. They also found that they are effective inhibitors of CGRP release and neurogenic pain. This is a very nice study, and with great potential to facilitate development of novel analgesics. The following are suggestions for improving the manuscript in revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We feel that it is essential to get more information about whether this compound is selective for Cav2.2 specifically or even calcium channels in general. All the characterization is done on HEK cells stably expressing CaV2.2. What about other channels? What effect does this compound have on the electrical properties of primary sensory neurons? Does it block the endogenous Cav2.2 current? Does it have effects on other ion channels expressed in sensory neurons? What's the IC50 in neurons? Feel free to contact the BRE directly if you need to discuss the scope of any of these suggested experiments, as <italic>eLife</italic> does not wish to ask for very extensive new experiments!</p><p>2) The effect of NNCB-2 on high K mediated CGRP release is relatively small and this seems somewhat inconsistent with the effect of NNCB-2 on CaV2.2 currents especially under steady depolarization conditions. Based on Figure 1, 30 μm NNCB-2 should inhibit most CaV2.2 channels. Do the authors have comparable experiments with w-CgTxGIVA or are there reports in the literature to reference? It's possible that other CaV channels are contributing to CGRP release from these neurons.</p><p>3) Can the authors provide any information about the mechanism of inhibition or why the charged compound works from both sides of the membrane. Our guess is that these inhibitors are not pore blockers but are interacting with the channel within the membrane. Maybe even the voltage sensors. The ion selectivity filter resides in the external pore in all these channels and would likely be a large barrier to access to the internal pore. It would be great if the authors could provide more mechanistic information, but even if they cannot at this time, it would be good to discuss the potential mechanisms and we would suggest replacing 'blocker' with 'inhibitor' throughout to avoid mechanistic inference.</p><p>4) A related point is whether the external solution was flowing during the internal application experiment. If not, perhaps the inhibitor can partition into the membrane and concentrate within the external leaflet where its site of action may reside?</p><p>5) How was chemical composition validated? Mass spec? 1D NMR? Some basic information should be provided even in cases where a company was contracted to do the synthesis.</p><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>1) The in vivo results while intriguing are only a single assay. What about nocifensive responses (since this is how they introduce their study)? Can it locally injected into the skin (as the authors have done previously with non-permeant sodium channel blockers)? Does the compound attenuate acute heat or mechanical responses? How about under inflammatory or injury conditions?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48118.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We feel that it is essential to get more information about whether this compound is selective for Cav2.2 specifically or even calcium channels in general.

We found that inhibition of native N-type calcium channels is similarly potent as for the cloned channels in HEK cells. This new data is in Figure 4.</p><p>In parallel, we also did tests of the compound on excitability of nociceptive primary sensory neurons, as was also suggested. We were very surprised to find that the compound inhibits firing of action potentials very effectively, quite unexpected if it were acting only on calcium channels. This new data is in Figure 7. We also did voltage clamp experiments on sodium channels in nociceptive DRG neurons as well as on Nav1.7 sodium channels expressed in HEK cells, and found that the charged compound inhibits both Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 channels very potently, producing use-dependent inhibition of Nav.7 channels 10 times more potently than lidocaine and three times more potently than bupivacaine, the most potent local anesthetic. This new data is in Figures 5, 6, and 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The effect of NNCB-2 on high K mediated CGRP release is relatively small and this seems somewhat inconsistent with the effect of NNCB-2 on CaV2.2 currents especially under steady depolarization conditions.

We have added references to reports in the literature on this point, suggesting that a mixture of calcium channels contribute to peptide release in this system. We have also modified the discussion of these experiments. Because it is likely that the calcium entry triggering CGRP release is through multiple calcium channels, we have removed the implication that the greater efficacy of CNCB-2 in this system is necessarily due to greater efficacy in inhibiting N-type calcium channels. We would have to do many more experiments studying dose-response of both CNCB-2 and NNCB-2 on multiple cloned calcium channels to clarify this. We are mainly interested in the efficacy of CNCB-2, not NNCB-2, as a possible clinical agent, so we have focused on its effects, which are stronger than those of NNCB-2 in both CGRP release and lung inflammation. At this point, the unexpectedly powerful effects of CNCB-2 on sodium channels seemed of more interest to study in detail than a study of effects on other calcium channels, although we plan to do such a study in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Can the authors provide any information about the mechanism of inhibition or why the charged compound works from both sides of the membrane.

We agree that interaction with the channel within the membrane to affect gating is a more plausible mechanism than pore block, especially given the compound’s ability to inhibit both calcium and sodium channels and its voltage-dependent and use-dependent properties for inhibition of both channels. We have added a discussion of this point and have replaced “blocker” with “inhibitor” throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A related point is whether the external solution was flowing during the internal application experiment. If not, perhaps the inhibitor can partition into the membrane and concentrate within the external leaflet where its site of action may reside?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a discussion discussing this possibility, along with the more general caveat about the difficulty of accurately defining the time-course of exposure of the cell membrane to compounds applied in the pipette solution in whole-cell recording, which we have previously explored in comparing lidocaine and QX-314 (Jo and Bean, 2014). Application with inside-out patches would be better for defining the kinetics and concentration-dependence of internally applied CNCB-2 but would be technically very challenging, especially for calcium channels where channel activity runs down quickly in inside-out patches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) How was chemical composition validated?

We have added this information to the Materials and methods. We also independently performed liquid chromatography mass spectrometry of stock solutions of CNCB-2 in DMSO to verify stability of the compound in solution (performed by co-author Laurel Heckman, trained as an organic chemist).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>1) The in vivo results while intriguing are only a single assay.

Does the compound attenuate acute heat or mechanical responses? How about under inflammatory or injury conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion that became even more important when we found that the compound effectively inhibits sodium channels as well as calcium channels. We originally assumed that the compound was only a calcium channel inhibitor and would only be effective in reducing inflammation associated with neuropeptide release. We choose the mouse asthma model because of previous evidence for a strong involvement of neuropeptides. We have now done a new series of experiments on two different pain models, nocifensive behavior following paw incision and a zymosan-induced inflammation model. We find very effective and long-lasting analgesia in both models, with effects of a single injection lasting at least 8 hours in the paw incision model. CNCB2 is far more long-lasting than bupivacaine in this model. The new data is presented in Figure 9.</p></body></sub-article></article>
