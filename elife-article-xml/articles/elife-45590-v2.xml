its organization, the cerebellum plays differential computational roles in distinct sensorimotor behaviors. Previously, we showed that Purkinje cell (PC) activity differs between zebrin-negative (Z–) and zebrin-positive (Z+) modules (Zhou et al., 2014). Here, using gain-of-function and loss-of-function mouse models, we show that transient receptor potential cation channel C3 (TRPC3) controls the simple spike activity of Z–, but not Z+ PCs. In addition, TRPC3 regulates complex spike rate and their interaction with simple spikes, exclusively in Z– PCs. At the behavioral level, TRPC3 loss-of-function mice show impaired eyeblink conditioning, which is related to Z– modules, whereas compensatory eye movement adaptation, linked to Z+ modules, is intact. Together, our results indicate that TRPC3 is a major contributor to the cellular heterogeneity that introduces distinct physiological properties in PCs, conjuring functional heterogeneity in cerebellar sensorimotor integration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellar function</kwd><kwd>Purkinje cell</kwd><kwd>zebrin/aldolase C</kwd><kwd>TRPC3</kwd><kwd>cellular heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>spiking activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-Stg #680235</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schonewille</surname><given-names>Martijn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#201306230130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALW / Zon-Mw</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-Adv</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-POC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartmann</surname><given-names>Jana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Purkinje cells feature molecular heterogeneity that introduces differentiation in physiological properties between zebrin-identified cerebellar modules and thereby underlies the differential control on sensorimotor integration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maintaining correct sensorimotor integration relies on rapid modifications of activity. The cerebellum is instrumental herein, evidenced by the fact that disruptions of cerebellar functioning, for example through stroke or neurodegenerative disorders, affect coordination and adaptation of many types of behaviors such as gait, eye movements and speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bodranghien et al., 2016</xref>). The palette of behavioral parameters controlled by the cerebellum is also broad and includes features like timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raymond et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Zeeuw and Yeo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang and Lisberger, 2014</xref>), strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirata and Highstein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Witter et al., 2013</xref>), as well as coordination of muscle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thach et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vinueza Veloz et al., 2015</xref>). However, the pluriformity of behavioral features does not match with the homogeneity of the structure and cyto-architecture of the cerebellar cortex.</p><p>Recently, it has been uncovered that the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, the Purkinje cells (PCs), can be divided into two main groups with a distinct firing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). One group, consisting of PCs that are positive for the glycolytic enzyme aldolase C, also referred to as zebrin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brochu et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 1994</xref>), shows relatively low simple spike firing rates, whereas the PCs in the other group that form zebrin-negative zones, fire at higher rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Zebrin II demarcates olivocerebellar modules, anatomically defined operational units each consisting of a closed loop between the inferior olive, parasagittal bands of the cerebellar cortex and the cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sugihara and Quy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ruigrok, 2011</xref>). Given that different motor domains are controlled by specific olivocerebellar modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ruigrok, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graham and Wylie, 2012</xref>), the differential intrinsic firing frequencies may be tuned to the specific neuronal demands downstream of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Zeeuw and Ten Brinke, 2015</xref>). Thus, dependent on the specific behavior controlled by the module involved, the PCs engaged may show low or high intrinsic firing as well as related plasticity rules to adjust these behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apps et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Cellular heterogeneity can drive differentiation in the activity and plasticity of individual cells that operate within a larger ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altschuler and Wu, 2010</xref>). The molecular and cellular determinants of differential electrophysiological processing in the cerebellar PC modules are just starting to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cerminara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apps et al., 2018</xref>). For example, while the impact of zebrin II itself is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), excitatory amino acid transporter 4 (EAAT4) and GLAST/EAAT1 may selectively modulate simple spike activity of zebrin-positive PCs as well as plasticity of their parallel fiber (PF) inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perkins et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, the distributions of particular subcategories of receptors that may be relevant for firing properties are linked to the same modular organization. For example, whereas γ-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptors occur in both zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tian and Zhu, 2018</xref>), the GABA<sub>B2</sub> receptor is selectively expressed in a pattern similar to that of zebrin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2008</xref>). Or, whereas the alpha isoform of mGluR1 (mGluR1a) is uniformly expressed in all PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohtani et al., 2014</xref>) the mGluR1b receptor is expressed in a pattern complementary to that of zebrin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mateos et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, the modular distributions of most of these receptors point towards a critical role of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 3 (TRPC3) in regulating electrophysiological properties of PCs. For example, while the mGluR1b receptor interacts with TRPC3 to drive mGluR1-dependent currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hartmann et al., 2008</xref>), the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors modulate mGluR1-triggered TRPC3-mediated currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tian and Zhu, 2018</xref>). However, where and how TRPC3 operates in cerebellar PCs is still largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that TRPC3 is a key player in the molecular machinery responsible for differential control over the activity and function of Z+ and Z– PCs. We demonstrate that TRPC3 in the brain has particularly high expression levels in the cerebellum, in a pattern largely, but not precisely, complementary to zebrin. We examined the impact of TRPC3 gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations and found effects on the spiking rate of Z– but not Z+ PCs in vitro. In vivo recordings during quiet wakefulness in the same mutants revealed that the level of TRPC3 influences both simple spike and complex spike rates, and the interaction between the two, also selectively in Z– modules. Finally, we show that adaptation of compensatory eye movements, which is controlled by Z+ modules in the vestibulocerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanchez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), is not affected by the loss of TRPC3 function, whereas the learning rate during eyeblink conditioning, which is linked to the Z– modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hesslow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mostofi et al., 2010</xref>), is decreased after PC-specific ablation of TRPC3, highlighting the behavioral relevance of firing rate modulation by TRPC3.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Specific expression pattern and subcellular localization of TRPC3 in the mouse brain</title><p>As the expression of TRPC3 in the adult mammalian brain is still unclear, we first set out to examine the immunohistochemistry of TRPC3 using a novel TRPC3-specific antibody (Cell signaling, #77934). We found that in the normal mouse brain TRPC3 is most prominently expressed in the olivocerebellar circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), specifically in PCs and unipolar brush cells (UBCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This is in line with previous immunostainings and in situ data (Allen Brain Atlas, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org/">http://mouse.brain-map.org/</ext-link>). Upon further scrutiny it is clear that, although expressed in all PCs, endogenous TRPC3 was not distributed homogeneously. The TRPC3 levels in the anterior cerebellum, where the PCs are predominantly Z–, were higher than those in the posterior PCs, which are primarily Z+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further visualize the relationship between TRPC3 and Zebrin II, labeled as Aldolase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 1994</xref>), we quantified their relative levels in several subregions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This analysis confirmed that TRPC3 expression is complementary to that of Zebrin in the vermis, while in the hemispheres the TRPC3 expression varies between homogeneous expression and expression complementary to Zebrin II. To visualize this pattern in a more comprehensive manner, we also employed whole-mount brain light sheet imaging following iDISCO-based clearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>-video 1). The antibody staining appears to be of better quality in the iDISCO protocol, resulting for instance in a clearer picture of the expression of TRPC3 in the inferior olive (most ventral, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>-video 1). The anterior/posterior differences in the protein amount were confirmed by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45590.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TRPC3 is predominantly expressed in the cerebellum in a zebrin-related pattern.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative image and magnification (right) of sagittal cryosection of an adult mouse brain stained with anti-TRPC3.

Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the TRPC3 expression differs substantially between these lobules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>), suggesting that the effects of gain- and loss-of-function mutations could be directly related to protein levels. Alternatively, other differences in molecular machinery could underlie or further enhance this cellular differentiation, for instance through mGluR1b-related effects. As the difference in TRPC3 expression is minimal or absent in the more lateral parts of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>), recording the activity of adjacent Z– and Z+ PCs there would solve this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu and Schonewille, 2018</xref>). To this end, we crossed <italic>pcp2<sup>Cre</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with EAAT4<sup>GFP</sup> mice that express GFP in Z+ PCs to generate <italic>pcp2<sup>Cre</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup>;EAAT4<sup>GFP/-</sup></italic> mice. Using two-photon microscopy, we identified Z+ and Z– modules on the dorsal surface (lobules IV-VI and simplex) of the cerebellum and recorded PC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Here, the absence of TRPC3 attenuated the firing rate (36.5 ± 23.2 Hz vs. 72.7 ± 26.5 Hz, mut. vs. ctrl, <italic>t</italic><sub>28</sub>=3.99, p&lt;0.001) and enhanced the irregularity (e.g. CV: 0.55 ± 0.16 vs. 0.44 ± 0.10, mut. vs. ctrl, <italic>t</italic><sub>28</sub>=-2.27, p=0.031) of Z– PCs even more robustly, without an effect on Z+ PCs (rate: 36.6 ± 19.5 Hz vs. 33.0 ± 9.8 Hz, mut. vs. ctrl, <italic>t</italic><sub>21</sub>=-0.550, p=0.588; CV: 0.47 ± 0.22 vs. 0.56 ± 0.26, mut. vs. ctrl, <italic>t</italic><sub>21</sub>=0.853, p=0.393) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>, cf <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The similar firing rates of Z– and Z+ PCs lacking TRPC3 in these targeted recordings supports the possibility that in some areas TRPC3 is solely responsible for the difference and that further differentiation divides the zebrin-based populations into smaller subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Armstrong et al., 2001</xref>). It also fits with the finding that other proteins, for example mGluR1b, influence TRPC3 activity and thereby differentially determine the spiking activity of PCs in areas where TRPC3 expression is more homogeneous. As stated above, the experiments in loss-of-function <italic>pcp2<sup>Cre</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice suggest that TRPC3 cannot account for the entire difference between Z+ and Z– PCs. As the L7 promotor turns on early in development (postnatal week 1–2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barski et al., 2000</xref>), it could be that the ablation of TRPC3 early in development provokes compensatory mechanisms that limit the decrease in simple spike rate in Z– PCs in adult mice. Alternatively, developmental changes in the activity in the olivocerebellar loop could be partially responsible for the lower firing rate. To test the possibility that developmental effects influenced PC activity in the adult mice, we crossed the <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked TRPC3 mice with tamoxifen-dependent <italic>pcp2<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> to generate <italic>pcp2<sup>CreERT2</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Four weeks after tamoxifen treatment, <italic>pcp2<sup>CreERT2</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice showed a virtually complete ablation of TRPC3 in PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

In vivo recordings revealed that, again, simple spike firing rates were affected in Z– (from lobules I-III, 72.9 ± 9.1 Hz vs. 86.5 ± 10.9 Hz, mut. vs. ctrl, <italic>t</italic><sub>53</sub> = 5.05, p&lt;0.001), but not Z+ PCs (lobule X, rate: 47.0 ± 11.6 Hz vs. 51.6 ± 13.4 Hz, mut. vs. ctrl, <italic>t</italic><sub>44</sub>=1.21, p=0.234) of tamoxifen injected adult <italic>pcp2<sup>CreERT2</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>), in a manner similar to that in <italic>pcp2<sup>Cre</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice.

When <italic>pcp2<sup>Cre</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were subjected to both out-of-phase and in-phase training paradigms, we did not observe any significant deficit in the VOR gain increase and VOR gain decrease, respectively (VOR increase, <italic>F</italic> = 0.012, p=0.913; VOR decrease, <italic>F</italic> = 0.252, p=0.621) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). To evaluate the ability of the mice to perform a long-term, more demanding adaptation, we subjected the mice for four more days, following the gain decrease training, to a training stimulus aimed at reversing the direction of their VOR, referred to as VOR phase reversal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

Mice were trained using a light pulse with 250 ms duration as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and a puff to the cornea as a short unconditioned stimulus (US) at the end of the CS, which over the period of several days evoked conditioned responses (CR, preventative eyelid closure) in the absence of the US (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

We recently uncovered that there are at least two main types of cerebellar modules with different intrinsic profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) and plasticity rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suvrathan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Voges et al., 2017</xref>). This organization is highly preserved throughout phylogeny and characterized by a series of molecular markers such as zebrin that are distributed in a complementary fashion across the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marzban and Hawkes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graham and Wylie, 2012</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that zebrin-negative PCs show a relatively high expression of TRPC3, which has a dominant impact on its electrophysiological features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Indeed, gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding for TRPC3 selectively affected activity in the zebrin-negative modules and the motor behavior that is controlled by these modules.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45590.026</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary of the electrophysiological changes in the gain- and loss-of-function <italic>TRPC3</italic> mutants.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45590-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our results confirm previous work indicating that TRPC3 is expressed in all PCs, yet for the first time reveal that its expression is non-uniform and largely complementary to that of well-known marker of cerebellar modules, Zebrin II. Notably, the ablation of TRPC3 decreased the firing rate of Z– PCs to that of Z+ PCs in the superficial areas that were targeted by imaging approaches, but did not completely delete the difference in lobules I-III. Hence, TRPC3 is at least a major contributor to the increased firing rate of Z– PCs, but other factors putatively contribute as well. Although TRPC3 is present in all PCs, loss- and gain-of-function mutations selectively affected Z– PCs, suggesting that other proteins in the pathway leading to TRPC3 activation may be involved. TRPC channels, which are calcium-permeable upon activation by phospholipase C or diacylglycerol, are widely expressed in the brain and critically involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hartmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hartmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Becker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). TRPC1 and TRPC3 are both prominently expressed in the cerebellum, but in PCs TRPC3 is most abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hartmann et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to its contribution to intrinsic activity, TRPC3 currents also mediate the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential following activation of mGluR1b, which is expressed in a pattern complementary to that of zebrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mateos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hartmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohtani et al., 2014</xref>). Our results indicate that TRPC3 can be detected in all PCs in a pattern that is largely, but not completely, complementary to that of Zebrin II, while the effects of TRPC3 ablation are restricted to zebrin-negative PCs. Taken together, this suggests that it is in fact the ‘molecular machinery’ involving mGluR1b activation combined with TRPC3 expression patterns, that drive the differential TRPC3 function.</p><p>In contrast to mGluR1b, mGluR1a is expressed by all PCs (estimated ratio 2:1 to mGluR1b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mateos et al., 2001</xref>). The metabotropic receptor mGluR1a is important for IP3-mediated calcium release, climbing fiber elimination as well as PF-PC LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohtani et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, and in line with the concept of modular differentiation, mGluR1-dependent processes are hampered in zebrin-positive PCs by the expression of EAAT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>), whereas zebrin-negative PCs selectively express PLCβ4 that works in concert with mGluR1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohtani et al., 2014</xref>). The differences in expression patterns may enhance the probability of PF-PC LTD in zebrin-negative PCs over that in zebrin-positive PCs, which is supported by experiments performed in P21 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>). The consequences of EAAT4 or PLCβ4 deletion on PC physiology have been evaluated in vitro in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hashimoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyata et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perkins et al., 2018</xref>), but what the consequences in vivo on circuit physiology and on the behaviors tested here are, is unclear. Our results here demonstrate that changes that occur at the cell physiological level, that is reduced simple spike rate and altered CS-SS interaction, lead to a more complex pattern of changes in the intact system. The additional effects are particularly striking in the <italic>pcp2<sup>Cre</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, where the reduced simple spike rate in zebrin-negative PCs leads to a lower complex spike rate. In principle, this could have been a direct olivocerebellar loop effect, as lower simple spike rate results in reduced inhibition of the also inhibitory projection from the cerebellar nuclei to the inferior olive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaumont et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Witter et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, <italic>TRPC3<sup>Mwk/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit a higher PC simple spike rate, but also a lower complex spike rate. This seems to argue against a direct olivocerebellar loop effect, but the gain-of-function mutation is present in all neurons of this mouse line and thus cell intrinsic processing probably plays a -currently unknown- role herein. The unaltered complex spike rate of <italic>pcp2<sup>CreERT2</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice suggests that there is a developmental component to the relationship between complex spikes and simple spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Badura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">White and Sillitoe, 2017</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that in some experiments we found that also the Z+ PCs were affected by TRPC3 mutations. In <italic>TRPC3<sup>Mwk/-</sup></italic> mice the regularity of simple spikes and complex spikes was higher compared to controls. TRPC3 is expressed in UBCs and inferior olivary neurons (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). UBCs are neurons that fire action potential with high regularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ruigrok et al., 2011</xref>) and provide mossy fiber input in lobule X, which -indirectly- drives PC simple spike activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nunzi et al., 2001</xref>), whereas inferior olivary neurons directly control the rate and regularity of complex spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</xref>). UBCs degenerate early in development in <italic>TRPC3<sup>Mwk/-</sup></italic>, while the effects of the mutation on inferior olivary neurons have not been described yet. Thus, the global nature of this mutation could drive changes in other cell types that explain the effects observed in the regularity of simple and complex spikes. In addition, it should be noted that the complex spike rate of Z+ PCs in <italic>pcp2<sup>Cre</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice as observed with the use of 2-photon imaging, was also lower, for which we at current do not have an explanation. In general, in all conditions the complex spikes rate in Z– and Z+ appear to be significantly or trending towards lower values in mutant mice, except for those in inducible mice where the mutation occurred after development. This has two potential implications: 1) TRPC3 mutations, through direct effects on inferior olivary neurons and/or indirect effects through the olivocerebellar loop, have an inhibiting effect on complex spike rates, and 2) these effects are absent when the mutation is induced later in life.</p><p>To test the functional consequences of the loss of TRPC3 and the modular specificity of these effects, we tested the impact on behavioral experiments that can be linked to specific modules. Eyeblink conditioning and VOR adaptation are controlled by different modules in the cerebellum and they are distinctly different by nature. Eyeblink conditioning requires a novel, well-timed eyelid movement to a previously unrelated, neutral stimulus, and has been linked to largely or completely zebrin-negative modules in the anterior cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hesslow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mostofi et al., 2010</xref>). The activity of the putative zebrin-negative PCs in this area is relatively high at rest, in line with their zebrin identity, and a decrease in this high firing rate correlates to the eyeblink response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jirenhed et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johansson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, VOR adaptation adjusts the amplitude of an existing reflex to optimize sensory processing using visual feedback and is controlled by the vestibulocerebellum, the flocculus in particular, which is classically considered to be zebrin-positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanchez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; cf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sugihara and Quy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fujita et al., 2014</xref>). There are several variations in VOR adaptation aimed at different changes in temporal and/or spatial parameters (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Voges et al., 2017</xref>). In unidirectional VOR gain increase, we recently found that the change correlating with the adapted eye movement consisted of a potentiation, an increase, of the -at rest- lower PC firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Voges et al., 2017</xref>). Although our current study has its main focus on the differential contribution of TRPC3 at the cell and systems physiological level, it is tempting to speculate how the loss of TRPC3 in PCs results in an eyeblink conditioning phenotype without affecting VOR adaptation. The reduction in firing rate of zebrin-negative PCs may directly contribute to the impaired conditioning. The suppression of simple spike firing that generally correlates with the conditioned response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>) might be occluded by the lower resting rate in <italic>pcp2<sup>Cre</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. Alternatively, PF-PC LTD could play a role as it is in line with the simple spike suppression and blocking TRPC3 function completely abolishes this form of LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim, 2013</xref>). However, genetically ablating PF-PC LTD did not affect the ability to perform eyeblink conditioning successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schonewille et al., 2011</xref>), arguing against an exclusive role for this form of plasticity. Schreurs and colleagues demonstrated that intrinsic excitability is increased after eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schreurs et al., 1997</xref>). A third option could be that TRPC3 also affects the adaptive increase of excitability, intrinsic plasticity, which is calcium-activated potassium channel function dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohtsuki et al., 2012</xref>), and thereby delays the expression of a conditioned blink response. All three options would not necessarily affect VOR adaptation and could contribute to the deficits in eyeblink conditioning, but given the relatively mild phenotype, one or two could be sufficient. Future experiments will have to unravel the cellular changes underlying eyeblink conditioning and VOR adaptation and the specific role of TRPC3 in the former.</p><p>In this study we aimed to gain insight in the mechanisms that convert molecular heterogeneity into differentiation of cell physiology and function. This mechanistic question goes hand in hand with the more conceptual question: why are there, at least, two different types of PCs? An appealing hypothesis is that zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive bands control two muscles with opposing functions, for example a flexor and an extensor. Trans-synaptic retrograde tracing using rabies virus from antagonist muscles demonstrated that there is no robust division in zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive strips, but that a partial segregation could not be excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruigrok et al., 2008</xref>). A second possibility would be that individual muscles are controlled by either only zebrin-negative or zebrin-positive strips, or a combination of both, when needed. In the vestibulocerebellum of the pigeon, each movement direction is controlled by a set of zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graham and Wylie, 2012</xref>). In this configuration each PC within the set, or separately, would then serve a distinct function, for which it is optimized by gene expression patterns. This dissociation of function could entail for example timing versus coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diedrichsen et al., 2007</xref>) or moving versus holding still (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shadmehr, 2017</xref>), although none of these distinctions have been linked to specific zebrin-identified modules. Alternatively, it may be the net polarity of the connectivity downstream of the cerebellar nuclei up to the motor neurons or the cerebral cortical neurons that determines the demand(s) of the module(s) involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Zeeuw and Ten Brinke, 2015</xref>). Module-specific driver lines would greatly aid to answer these questions, but are currently not available.</p><p>To summarize, our results support the hypothesis that cerebellar modules control distinct behaviors based on cellular heterogeneity, with differential molecular configurations. We present the first evidence for a non-uniform expression pattern of TRPC3 in PCs, complementary to that of zebrin in the vermis but more homogeneous in the hemispheres. Nonetheless, TRPC3 effects are directly coupled to zebrin, a specificity that putatively requires mGluR1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohtani et al., 2014</xref>), the activator of TRPC3 that is expressed in a pattern perfectly complementary to zebrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mateos et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Since the discovery of protein expression patterns in the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brochu et al., 1990</xref>), numerous other proteins with patterned expression have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cerminara et al., 2015</xref>). These patterns have been linked to circuit organizations of modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</xref>), to disease and degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cerminara et al., 2015</xref>), and more recently to electrophysiological differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Most expression patterns follow or complement that of zebrin II, but alternative patterns have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Armstrong et al., 2001</xref>). These patterns commonly further subdivided one of the two populations studied here and thus potentially underlie the remaining variation and differences between lobules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apps et al., 2018</xref>). Altogether, this work demonstrates that proper cerebellar function is based on the presence of (at least) two <italic>modi operandi</italic> that have distinct molecular machineries, with TRPC3 as one of the major contributing factors, so as to differentially control sensorimotor integration in downstream circuitries that require control with opposite polarity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Species <break/><italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J mice</td><td valign="top">Charles Rivers</td><td valign="top">IMSR_JAX:000664</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Species <break/><italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>TRPC3<sup>Mwk/-</sup></italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becker et al., 2009</xref></td><td valign="top">MGI:3689326</td><td valign="top">F1 of (original) C3H/HeH and C57BL/6J background</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Species <break/><italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hartmann et al., 2008</xref></td><td valign="top">MGI:5451202</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6Jbackground</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Species <break/><italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>pcp2<sup>Cre</sup></italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barski et al., 2000</xref></td><td valign="top">MGI:2137515</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6Jbackground</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Species <break/><italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>pcp2<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">The Institut Clinique de la Souris, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ics-mci.fr">www.ics-mci.fr</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">C57BL/6Jbackground</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Species <break/><italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>EAAT4<sup>GFP/-</sup></italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gincel et al., 2007</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">C57BL/6Jbackground</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Species <break/><italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>Ai14</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/007908">https://www.jax.org/strain/007908</ext-link></td><td valign="top">MGI:3809524</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6Jbackground</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-TRPC3</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling</td><td valign="top">Cat.#: 77934</td><td valign="top">IHC (1:500), WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse anti-actin</td><td valign="top">Millipore</td><td valign="top">Cat.#: MAB1501</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-Zebrin II/Aldolase C</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">Cat.#: SC-12065</td><td valign="top">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse anti-calbindin</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat.#: C9848</td><td valign="top">IHC (1:7000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-GFP</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat. #

Briefly, an immobilizing pedestal consisting of a brass holder with a neodymium magnet (4 × 4×2 mm) was fixed on the skull, overlying the frontal and parietal bones, and then a craniotomy (Ø3 mm) was made in the interparietal or occipital bone under general anesthesia with isoflurane/O<sub>2</sub> (4% induction, 1.5–2% maintenance). After over 24 hr of recovery, mice were head-fixed and body restrained for recordings. PCs were recorded from vermal lobules I-III and X, using a glass pipette (OD 1.5 mm, ID 0.86 mm, borosilicate, Sutter Instruments, USA; 1–2 µm tips, 4–8 MΩ) with a downward pitch angle of 40° and 65° respectively. The pipettes were filled with 2 M NaCl-solution and mounted on a digital 3-axis drive (SM-5, Luigs Neumann, Germany). After recording, BDA was iontophoretically injected to confirm that the recordings were from Lobules I-III or X. PCs were identified by the presence of simple and complex spikes, and determined to be from a single unit by confirming that each complex spike was followed by a climbing fiber pause. All in vivo recordings were analyzed offline using Spiketrain (used under Neurasmus license, currently: kai.voges@nus.edu.sg), running under MatLab (Mathworks, MA, USA). For each cell, the firing rate, CV and mean CV2 were determined for simple and complex spikes, as well as the climbing fiber pause. The CV is calculated by dividing the standard deviation, SD, by the mean of ISIs, whereas CV2 is calculated as 2×|ISI<sub>n+1</sub>-ISI<sub>n</sub>| / (ISI<sub>n+1</sub>+ISI<sub>n</sub>). Both are measures for the regularity of the firing, with CV reflecting that of the entire recording and mean CV2 that of adjacent intervals, making the latter a measure of regularity on small timescales. The climbing fiber pause is determined as the duration between a complex spike and the fist following simple spike. To extend this analysis, we also plotted histograms of simple spike activity time locked on the complex spike, and labeled the shape of this time histogram as normal, facilitation, suppression, or oscillation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vivo two-photon-targeted electrophysiology</title><p>Details on targeted electrophysiological recordings in vivo in the mouse cerebellum were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu and Schonewille, 2018</xref>).

The craniotomy was sealed with biocompatible silicone (Kwik-Cast; World Precision Instruments) and the animal was allowed to recover from surgery before recording.

Glass micropipettes with tip size of ~1 μm (resistance: 6–9 MΩ) were advanced from the dorsal surface under a 25° angle into the cerebellum, allowing concurrent two-photon imaging with a long working distance objective (LUMPlanFI/IR 40×/0.8; Olympus) on a custom-built two-photon microscope. Pipettes were filled with the same Ringer solution with an additional 40 μM AlexaFluor 594 hydrazide (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) for visualization. GFP and AlexaFluor 594 were simultaneously excited by a MaiTai laser (Spectra Physics Lasers, Mountain View, CA, USA) operated at 860 nm. Green (GFP) and red (AlexaFluor 594) fluorescence were separated by a dichroic mirror at 560 nm and emission filters centered at 510 nm (Brightline Fluorescence Filter 510/84; Semrock) and 630 nm (D630/60; Chroma), respectively.

As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peter et al., 2016</xref>), acute sagittal slices (250 μm thick) were prepared from the cerebellar vermis and put into ice-cold slicing medium which contained (in mM) 240 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 10 D-Glucose, carbogenated continuously with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After cutting using a vibrotome (VT1200S, Leica), slices were incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.25 Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 15 D-Glucose, equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 33.0 ± 1.0°C for 30 min, and then at room temperature. NBQX (10 μM), DL-AP5 (50 μM), and picrotoxin (100 μM) were bath-applied to block AMPA-, NMDA-, and GABA subtype A (GABA<sub>A</sub>)-receptors, respectively. PCs were identified using visual guidance by DIC video microscopy and water-immersion 40X objective (Axioskop 2 FS plus; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Recording electrodes (3–5 MΩ, 1.65 mm outside diameter and 1.11 mm interior diameter (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) were prepared using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA), and filled with ACSF for cell-attached recordings, or with an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 120 K-Gluconate, 9 KCl, 10 KOH, 4 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 28.5 Sucrose, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.4 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP (pH 7.25–7.35 with an osmolality of 295) for whole-cell recordings. We measured spontaneous firing activity of PCs in cell-attached mode (0 pA injection) and intrinsic excitability in whole-cell current-clamp mode by injection of brief (1 s) depolarizing current pulses (ranging from −100 to 1100 pA with 100 pA increments) from a membrane holding potential of –65 mV at 33.0 ± 1.0°C. The spike count of evoked action potential was taken as a measure of excitability. AP properties including peak amplitude, AHP and half-width were evaluated using the first action potential generated by each PC. AHP indicates the amplitude of undershoot relative to the resting membrane potential. Half-width indicates the width of the signal at 50% of the maximum amplitude. PCs that required &gt; −800 pA to maintain the holding potential at −65 mV or fired action potentials at this holding potential were discarded. The average spiking rate measured over the entire current pulse was used to construct current-frequency plots. For whole-cell Recordings, cells were excluded if the series (Rs) or input resistances (Ri) changed by &gt;15% during the experiment, which was determined using a hyperpolarizing voltage step relative to the −65 mV holding potential. All electrophysiological recordings were acquired in lobules I-III and lobule X of the vermal cerebellum using EPC9 and EPC10-USB amplifiers (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany) and Patchmaster software (HEKA Electronics). Data were analyzed afterwards using Clampfit (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Compensatory eye movement recordings</title><p>We subjected alert <italic>pcp2<sup>Cre</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (aged 12–39 weeks, ages roughly matched) to compensatory eye movement recordings which were described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schonewille et al., 2010</xref>). In short, mice were equipped with a pedestal under general anesthesia with isoflurane/O<sub>2</sub>. After a 2–3 days of recovery, mice were head-fixed with the body loosely restrained in a custom-made restrainer and placed in the center of a turntable (diameter: 63 cm) in the experimental set-up. A round screen (diameter 60 cm) with a random dotted pattern (‘drum’) surrounded the mouse during the experiment. Compensatory eye movements were induced by sinusoidal rotation of the drum in light (OKR), rotation of the table in the dark (VOR) or the rotation of the table in the light (visually enhanced VOR, VVOR) with an amplitude of 5° at 0.1–1 Hz. Motor performance in response to these stimulations was evaluated by calculating the gain (eye velocity/stimulus velocity) and phase (eye to stimulus in degrees) of the response. Motor learning was studied by subjecting mice to mismatched visual and vestibular input. Rotating the drum (visual) and table (vestibular) simultaneously, in phase at 0.6 Hz (both with an amplitude of 5°, 5 × 10 min) in the light will induce an increase of the gain of the VOR (in the dark). Subsequently, VOR Phase reversal was tested by continuing the next days (day 2–5, keeping mice in the dark in between experiments) with in phase stimulation, but now with drum amplitudes of 7.5° (days 2) and 10° (days 3, 4, and 5), while the amplitude of the turntable remained 5°. This resulted, over days of training, in the reversal of the VOR direction, from a normal compensatory rightward eye movement (in the dark), when the head turns left, to a reversed response with a leftward eye movement, when the head moves left. At the end of the VOR phase reversal training the OKR was probed again and compared to the OKR before training, to examine OKR gain increase. VOR gain increase was evoked by subjecting mice to out of phase drum and table stimulation at 1.0 Hz (both with an amplitude of 1.6°). A CCD camera was fixed to the turntable in order to monitor the eyes of the mice. Eye movements were recorded with eye-tracking software (ETL-200, ISCAN systems, Burlington, NA, USA). For eye illumination during the experiments, two infrared emitters (output 600 mW, dispersion angle 7°, peak wavelength 880 nm) were fixed to the table and a third emitter, which produced the tracked corneal reflection, was mounted to the camera and aligned horizontally with the optical axis of the camera. Eye movements were calibrated by moving the camera left-right (peak-to-peak 20°) during periods that the eye did not move (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stahl, 2004</xref>). Gain and phase values of eye movements were calculated using custom-made Matlab routines (MathWorks, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MSchonewille/iMove">https://github.com/MSchonewille/iMove</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schonewille, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Eyeblink conditioning</title><p>For all procedures on eyeblink conditioning we refer to the study done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boele et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>pcp2<sup>Cre</sup>;TRPC3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, aged 16–25 weeks (ages roughly matched), were anesthetized with an isoflurane/oxygen mixture and surgically placed a so-called pedestal on the skull. After a 2–3 days’ recovery, mice were head-fixed and suspended over a foam cylindrical treadmill on which they were allowed to walk freely. Before each session starting, a minuscule magnet (1.5 × 0.7×0.5 mm) was placed on the left lower eyelid with superglue (cyanoacrylate) and an NVE GMR magnetometer was positioned above the left upper eyelid. With this magnetic distance measurement technique (MDMT), we measured the exact positions of each individual mouse eyelid by analyzing the range from optimal closure to complete aperture. The CS was a green LED light (CS duration 280 ms, LED diameter 5 mm) placed 10 cm in front of the mouse’s head. The US consisted of a weak air-puff applied to the eye (30 psi, 30 ms duration), which was controlled by an API MPPI-3 pressure injector, and delivered via a 27.5-gauge needle that was perpendicularly positioned at 0.5–1 cm from the center of the left cornea. The training consisted of 3 daily habituation sessions, one baseline measurement, 3 blocks of 5 daily acquisition sessions (each block was separated by 2 days of rest). During the habituation sessions, mice were placed in the setup for 30–45 min, during which the air puff needle (for US delivery) and green LED (for CS delivery) were positioned properly but no stimuli were presented. On the day of acquisition session 1, each animal first received 20 CS-only trials as a baseline measure, to establish that the CS did not elicit any reflexive eyelid closure. During each daily acquisition session, every animal received in total 200 paired CS-US trials, 20 US only trials, and 20 CS only trials. These trials were presented in 20 blocks, each block consisted of 1 US only trial, 10 paired CS-US trials, and 1 CS only trial. Trials within the block were randomly distributed, but the CS only trial was always preceded by at least two paired CS-US trials. The interval between the onset of CS and that of US was set at 250 ms. All experiments were performed at approximately the same time of day by the same experimenter. Individual eyeblink traces were analyzed with Blink 2.0 software (Neurasmus, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neurasmus.nl">www.neurasmus.nl</ext-link>, Rotterdam, Netherlands). Trials with significant activity in the 500 ms pre-CS period (&gt;7*IQR) were regarded as invalid for further analysis. Valid trials were further normalized by aligning the 500 ms pre-CS baselines and calibrating the signal so that the size of a full blink was 1. In valid normalized trials, all eyelid movements larger than 0.1 and with a latency to CR onset between 50–250 ms and a latency to CR peak of 100–250 ms (both relative to CS onset) were considered as conditioned responses (CRs). For CS only trials in the probe session we used the exact same criteria except that the latency to CR peak time was set at 100–500 ms after CS onset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Erasmus ladder</title><p>Mice aged 11–16 weeks were subjected to the Erasmus Ladder (Noldus, Wageningen, Netherlands). As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vinueza Veloz et al., 2015</xref>), the Erasmus Ladder is a fully automated system consisting of a horizontal ladder between two shelter boxes. The ladder has 2 × 37 rungs for the left and right side. Rungs are placed 15 mm apart, with alternate rungs in a descended position, so as to create an alternating stepping pattern with 30 mm gaps. All rungs are equipped with touch sensors, which are activated when subject to a pressure corresponding to more than four grams. The sensors are continuously monitored to record the position and the walking pattern of the mouse. A single crossing of the Erasmus Ladder is recorded as a trial. In this study, each mouse underwent a daily session consisting of 42 trials, for five consecutive days. Motor performance was measured by counting step durations and percentages during a trial, including short steps (steps from one high rung to the next high rung), long steps (skipping one high rung), jumps (skipping two high rungs), lower steps (a step forward steps, but the paw is placed on a low rung), back steps (a step backward steps from one high rung to the previous high rung). All data were collected and processed by ErasmusLadder 2.0 software (Noldus, Wageningen, Netherlands).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All values are shown as mean ± s.d., unless stated otherwise. To determine means, variance and perform statistical analysis, in the electrophysiological experiments the number of cells and in the behavioral experiment the number of mice were taken as the number of replicates. Apart from the requirements for inclusion in the final datasets as stated in the separate sections for each experimental technique above, data was excluded only when the signal to noise ratio was insufficient to warrant reliable analysis. For behavioral experiments group sizes were estimated a priori using sample size calculations based on minimal relevant differences and expected variation in control cells or mice. To study compensatory eye movements the numbers are based on the VOR phase reversal. A power analysis based on repeated measures ANOVA with α = 0.05, β = 0.20, minimal effect size f of 0.50 (Δ = 30°, SD 30°, seven measurements), indicated a minimum of 11 mice per group, which were obtained (n = 11/13 for controls/mutants). For eyeblink conditioning, these numbers are based on the percentage of conditioned responses and were: α = 0.05, β = 0.20, minimal effect size f of 0.42 (Δ = 25%, SD 30%. 15 repeats), resulting in a minimum of 14 mice per group, which were obtained (n = 15/15 for controls/mutants). For electrophysiological recordings the power analysis was based on previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), which gave a minimum group size of 10 PCs per group (α = 0.05, β = 0.20, Δ = 18.1 Hz, SD 14.0 Hz, based on Student’s <italic>t-</italic>test) for in vitro experiments and 6 PCs per group (α = 0.05, β = 0.20, Δ = 35.3 Hz, SD 17.8 Hz) for in vivo experiments, which were obtained in all experiments (all n ≥ 10 for in vitro, all n ≥ 12 for in vivo). Inter-group comparisons were done by two-tailed Student's <italic>t-</italic>test. ANOVA for repeated measures was used to analyze eye movement and Erasmus ladder behavioral data; linear mixed-effect model analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boele et al., 2018</xref>) (established in R version 1.1.442) was used to analyze eyeblink conditioning data. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 software. Data was considered statistically significant if p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We kindly thank Laura Post for mouse breeding; Nadia Khosravinia for help with behavior experiment; Yarmo Mackenbach for aid with editing the movie; Joshua J White and Dick Jaarsma for discussions and comments on the manuscript.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TRPC3 is essential for functional heterogeneity of cerebellar Purkinje cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor, Jennifer Raymond as the Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Roy V Sillitoe (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The cerebellum is organized into a series of domains that are classically defined by cell lineage, neuronal birthdate, gene expression, and afferent terminal field topography. The authors previously extended on these data by showing that cerebellar domains can also be defined as functional modules with distinct Purkinje cell firing properties. In this current manuscript, the authors go on to test whether TRPC3 molecular function is required for Purkinje cell functional heterogeneity. Using mouse genetics and electrophysiology in slice and in vivo, they demonstrate that TRPC3 indeed has an impact on Purkinje cell modules, but predominantly those defined as being zebrin II negative.</p><p>This is a very interesting paper that tackles a concept that is emerging as a central theme in cerebellar function. The results suggest that Z- and Z+ modules contribute to different behavioral functions, rather than contributing together in complementary ways to a similar or single behavior. This finding is likely to have significant impact on the fields understanding of these modules. It will greatly influence the design and direction of future experimental approaches aimed at understanding the behaviorally relevant neural signals these distinct regions of the cerebellum encode.</p><p>The data are high quality and the methods are expansive. The authors employ a powerful combination of anatomy, in vitro and in vivo physiology and behavior, and the use multiple approaches for perturbing TRPC3 including gain- and loss-of-function. Overall, this is an excellent manuscript. Addressing several concerns listed below would help to strengthen the overall interpretation of the experiments conducted, and the reviewers thought that these could be addressed in a reasonable time frame.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Quantification of the correlation between expression of TRPC3 and zebrin.</p><p>The anatomy is critical, and the reviewers found this to be the weakest part of the manuscript. Zebrin identity is used throughout much of the manuscript as a proxy for TRPC3 expression: Z+ is considered TRPC3- and Z- is TRPC3+. However, the evidence for these proteins' relationship is weak and based solely on non-quantified histology (Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Although the band-like expression pattern of Zebrin is clear, the expression of TRPC3 seems more homogenous, particularly in the hemispheres and anterior vermis, and there seems to be substantial TRPC3 signal in Z+ bands. The authors should consider whether the novel, and sophisticated iDISCO and light sheet microscopy approach really contributes over traditional methods. Most importantly, the relative amounts of TRPC3 and Zebrin in should be quantified.</p><p>Figure 1 D is not referenced in the text. Although the authors say that TRPC3 levels are higher in the anterior cerebellum (mainly Z-) and lower is the posterior cerebellum (mainly Z+), the immunoblots show a stronger band of TRPC3 in the posterior region. Can the authors explain? The same applies for panels D and E of Figure 2—figure supplement 1, where these immunoblots are shown again.</p><p>Much of the work done is based another indirect proxy: lobule identity. Lobule identity corresponds to average Zebrin content and not on actual Zebrin identity: lobule X → Z+ and lobules I-III → Z-. For example, all recordings of Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 are based on lobules X and I-III as proxies for Z+ and Z- PC modules, while trying to characterize the role of TRPC3 – so a lot rests on the claim that TRPC3 expresses in a pattern complementary to Zebrin bands. There is no figure where the amount of TRPC3 and Zebrin are quantified in the lobules used as proxies throughout the paper.</p><p>2) Some of the physiology suggests that TRPC3 affects Z+ as well as Z- regions. These results should be better acknowledged and discussed.</p><p>Figure 5: The authors say that manipulation of TRPC3 activity affected mainly Z- PCs (subsection “TRPC3 mutations selectively affect the activity in Z– olivocerebellar modules”). However, there were considerable effects in some of the Z+ PCs as well, namely in the gain of function mutants and in the tamoxifen animals. This suggests (again) that complementary expression patterns of Zebrin/TRPC3 might not be as clear as the authors state, or that there's some contamination of PC from Z+ and Z- bands. Conclusions should be adjusted accordingly</p><p>3) Some of the results suggest TRPC3 only partially accounts for the differences between Z+ and Z- functional differences; conclusions about the role of TRPC3 should be toned down accordingly.</p><p>The title would suggest that without TRPC3 you should not have Purkinje cell functional heterogeneity. This is not really the case. This is especially true since the authors say, &quot;These results argue against a direct link between simple spike firing rate and TRPC3 levels and support….&quot;</p><p>TRPC3 expression complements Zebrin bands in (some of) the vermis. However, in the hemispheres, where the expression of TRPC3 does not seem to follow the same pattern, there are still Z+ and Z- bands, with Purkinje cells with distinct physiological properties.</p><p>In the L7-TRPC3KO SS firing rate is decreased in Z- bands but still higher than Z+ bands (both in vitro (Figure 2) and in vivo (Figure 3), suggesting that other proteins (besides TRPC3) are playing a role.</p><p>Figure 4 A-D: The results are basically the same as in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 but now recording from PCs of visually identified bands, which strengthens the results. However, this time SS firing in Z- bands without TRPC3 is as low as in Z+ bands (as desired, presumably). Do the authors think this 'discrepancy' comes from the possibility of, when recording 'blind', mixing some Z+ and Z- PCs? Perhaps the authors could try to plot the data from the two mouse lines together and check if all datapoints fall within one cloud or if some clusters emerge, highlighting potential outliers and suggesting that some of non-visually identified PCs (putative Z- and Z+) have been misidentified.</p><p>In Figure 4H we see again that SS in the absence of TRPC3 is decreased but still higher than SS in Z+ band – is this incomplete shift in SS due to a partial effect of tamoxifen or is it evidence that TRPC3 does not account for everything?</p><p>4) TRPC3 and zebrin expression should be quantified in the behaviorally relevant cerebellar regions.</p><p>Zebrin and TRPC3 protein levels must be quantified for the VOR and eyeblink regions. Otherwise, the authors are overstating the role for TRPC3 in behavior, with only indirect evidence for the amount of TRPC3 in the regions/cells relevant for the behavior. The electrophysiology done throughout the paper was not done in these regions.</p><p>The authors show no behavioral effect on VOR and a mild eyeblink conditioning deficit. Given these mostly negative results, have the authors tried, for the behavioral tests, to use the acute (tamoxifen) mutants to rule out concerns about compensatory mechanisms?</p><p>5) Validation is needed for many of the reagents, including the TRPC3 antibody, L7CreER mouse, and general characterization of the weight, locomotion, and ataxia of the mouse lines.</p><p>Using L7-Cre mice to express a transgene or create a knockout of a floxed gene is not perfect. First, retinal bipolar cells are known to express L7. Second, it has been reported that the L7-Cre mouse version used here (Barski, 2000) is more permissive than more recent strains, that is, expression of proteins under the L7 promotor have been observed anecdotally by multiple laboratories in other neurons within the cerebellum including molecular layer interneurons. Although the authors illustrate in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 that some UBCs still express TRPC3, the image suggests that there may be a significant reduction in number. It would be good to quantify this expression to ensure that other neuron types are not also effected. There is no characterization of the L7CreER mouse. What is the recombination efficiency? Is it truly selective for Purkinje cells? Finally, the authors should address the possibility that their genetic manipulation led to perturbed function of retinal bipolar cells, as these cells are also known to express TRPC3 along with L7. This is of particular importance as they use light as a visual cue within both behavioral paradigms. A control for this potential confound should be considered, or logical rationale provided for why it is not necessary.</p><p>Figure 4F.

The authors state that prior TRPC3 antibodies were of poor quality, and that the novel antibody they use from Cell Signaling is better.

Additionally, the authors say in subsection “Animals”, that TRPC3 mutants are ataxic.

Zebrin identity is used throughout much of the manuscript as a proxy for TRPC3 expression: Z+ is considered TRPC3- and Z- is TRPC3+. However, the evidence for these proteins' relationship is weak and based solely on non-quantified histology (Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Although the band-like expression pattern of Zebrin is clear, the expression of TRPC3 seems more homogenous, particularly in the hemispheres and anterior vermis, and there seems to be substantial TRPC3 signal in Z+ bands. The authors should consider whether the novel, and sophisticated iDISCO and light sheet microscopy approach really contributes over traditional methods. Most importantly, the relative amounts of TRPC3 and Zebrin in should be quantified.</p><p>The reviewers are absolutely correct in stating that the expression pattern of TRPC3 is not simply complementary to that of Zebrin and that TRPC3+ is not Z- and vice versa. This is not the message we aim to convey. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) data indicate that TRPC3 is present in all Purkinje cell with a more clear banding pattern in the vermis, complementary to Zebrin, and -as the reviewers correctly note- a more homogenous expression in the hemispheres. Hence, the main message of our manuscript is that TRPC3 is a major contributor to the differences between Z+ and Z- Purkinje cells, but this is not solely based on its expression pattern. We believe that there are two contributors to the Zebrin-related specific effects of TRPC3 functioning: (1) the expression pattern of TRPC3, which is indeed mostly complementary in the vermis, but less so in the hemispheres (now quantified in the new figure 1), and (2) the expression pattern of the receptor that drives TRPC3 activation, i.e. mGluR1b, which is clearly complementary to Zebrin (Mateos, 2001). These contributing factors are now more clearly stated (see e.g., in the Discussion section). Moreover, to visualize the expression patterns more clearly, we have now re-organized Figure 1 and included a quantification of the expression pattern of TRPC3 and Zebrin (Figure 1C-D and Figure 1—figure supplement 2). This analysis helps us to visualize that the banding in the vermis is complementary. Moreover, in the hemispheres there is evidence for complementary expression in some places and for more homogenous expression of TRPC3 in others. A similar quantification was performed for the cerebellar regions controlling the behavioral tasks of eye movement adaptation and eyeblink conditioning (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B). Finally, the iDisco cleared and light-sheet imaged TRPC3 staining in the whole brain has been removed from Figure 1. We do prefer to keep this analysis as part of the manuscript, because the TRPC3 staining works better in this method. We have now annotated it and added a comparison to a cerebellar section with a Zebrin-like staining (EAAT4), side by side, to facilitate a direct comparison (Video 1).</p><p>b) Figure 1 D is not referenced in the text. Although the authors say that TRPC3 levels are higher in the anterior cerebellum (mainly Z-) and lower is the posterior cerebellum (mainly Z+), the immunoblots show a stronger band of TRPC3 in the posterior region. Can the authors explain? The same applies for panels D and E of Figure 2—figure supplement 1, where these immunoblots are shown again.</p><p>We understand that this was not very clear. It is important to note that the experiment in former Figure 1D was designed to determine the subcellular location of TRPC3 in both anterior and posterior cerebellar tissue and is not suited to quantitively compare TRPC3 levels between cerebellar regions. We have now added additional samples to the quantification of the western blot (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), which confirm the previous difference. Taken together with the stainings, these results indicate that TRPC3 levels are higher in the anterior than in the posterior cerebellum. We refer to the immunoblots aimed at confirming the subcellular localization of TRPC3 in the main text (subsection “TRPC3 differentially controls the physiological properties of PCs in vitro<italic>”</italic>). As part of the requested additions and re-arrangement of Figure 1, the figure panel with the immunoblot has been removed there and is now only presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-D.</p><p>c) Much of the work done is based another indirect proxy: lobule identity. Lobule identity corresponds to average Zebrin content and not on actual Zebrin identity: lobule X → Z+ and lobules I-III → Z-. For example, all recordings of Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 are based on lobules X and I-III as proxies for Z+ and Z- PC modules, while trying to characterize the role of TRPC3 – so a lot rests on the claim that TRPC3 expresses in a pattern complementary to Zebrin bands. There is no figure where the amount of TRPC3 and Zebrin are quantified in the lobules used as proxies throughout the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this point; we frankly agree. The western blot results for TRPC3 depicted in the original Figure 2—figure supplement 1 were performed on tissue from lobules I-III for Z- and lobules X and part of IX for Z+. As also discussed in response to point 1a., our aim was to determine the contribution of TRPC3 to Z+ and Z– PCs and hence we chose these lobules based on the Zebrin II identity of their Purkinje cells, not their TRPC3 levels. The expression of Zebrin II in these lobules has been extensively documented (e.g. Brochu et al., 1990; Sugihara and Quy, 2007). This is now more clearly stated in the main text (subsection “TRPC3 differentially controls the physiological properties of PCs in vitro<italic>”</italic>) and visualized in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Video 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2a) Some of the physiology suggests that TRPC3 affects Z+ as well as Z- regions.

This is now explained in the discussion (see Discussion section). In addition, we now discuss the differential consequences of TPRC3 mutations on complex spike rates in the Z- and Z+ bands in the inducible and non-inducible mice in more detail (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Figure 5: The authors say that manipulation of TRPC3 activity affected mainly Z- PCs (subsection “TRPC3 mutations selectively affect the activity in Z– olivocerebellar modules”).

Conclusions should be adjusted accordingly</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in the response to the previous comment, the effects in the gain of function mutants can be attributed directly to the global nature of this mutation, affecting other cells than Purkinje cells.</p><p>There were no changes in the parameters of the Z+ Purkinje cells in mice with tamoxifen induced deletion of TRPC3, so we assume the reviewer is referring to the effect on Z+ complex spike rate in the targeted recording experiment. This change is indeed more puzzling. We agree that the expression pattern of Zebrin and TRPC3 are not perfectly complementary, as discussed above. However, the recordings the reviewer is referring to were made in the vermis, where the complementary expression is most prominent (see new figure 1C-D). It could be that in this particular area the relative contribution of TRPC3 is larger. To make clear that the complementary pattern is not perfect we discussed the ins and outs of this issue more extensively and we modified the text accordingly (subsection “Specific expression pattern and subcellular localization of TRPC3 in the mouse brain” and the Discussion sections).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3a) Some of the results suggest TRPC3 only partially accounts for the differences between Z+ and Z- functional differences; conclusions about the role of TRPC3 should be toned down accordingly.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that TRPC3 by itself does not explain all the differences observed between Z+ and Z- Purkinje cells. This was also not the message we were aiming to convey and was the reason we included the second paragraph of the original discussion. In the new manuscript, we have made several changes to further clarify this point in the discussion (see Discussion section) and made additional changes to convey this message (see also the responses to related comment 3b, 3d and 3e below). Most importantly here, we have changed the title and last line of the abstract to more carefully describe our findings.</p><p>b) The title would suggest that without TRPC3 you should not have Purkinje cell functional heterogeneity. This is not really the case. This is especially true since the authors say, &quot;These results argue against a direct link between simple spike firing rate and TRPC3 levels and support….&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The original title stated that TRPC3 is essential for functional heterogeneity in Purkinje cells. We believe this is correct in the sense that our data indicate that TRPC3 specifically has a major influence on spiking activity in Z- Purkinje cells. The reviewer correctly states that TRPC3 by itself does not explain the complete difference between Z+ and Z- Purkinje cells. To address this, we have re-phrased our title to: “TRPC3 is a major contributor to the cellular heterogeneity of cerebellar Purkinje cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) TRPC3 expression complements Zebrin bands in (some of) the vermis. However, in the hemispheres, where the expression of TRPC3 does not seem to follow the same pattern, there are still Z+ and Z- bands, with Purkinje cells with distinct physiological properties.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. In this manuscript we provide evidence that TRPC3 is a major contributor to the difference in physiological properties. The reviewer is correct in stating that other factors presumably contribute to the difference in firing rate, and probably other potential differences too.</p><p>We now more clearly state that we believe that the difference between Z-and Z+ is the result of the expression level of TRPC3, which is not completely complementary, as well as the expression pattern of its driver, mGluR1b (Mateos et al., 2001), which is completely complementary to that of Zebrin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To address this issue we have quantified the expression of TRPC3 and Zebrin in several cerebellar regions, with new panels in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1, as well as Figure S8B for the regions related to the tested behaviors. In addition, the factors contributing to differential TRPC3 function are now addressed in more detail in the second paragraph of the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>d) In the L7-TRPC3KO SS firing rate is decreased in Z- bands but still higher than Z+ bands (both</italic> in vitro <italic>(Figure 2) and</italic> in vivo <italic>(Figure 3), suggesting that other proteins (besides TRPC3) are playing a role.</italic> </p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is indeed correct, and we apologize for not stating this as clearly as needed. To make this point even more clearly, we have now included lines in the Results section, in addition to the changes made to the title, Abstract and Discussion section, mentioned above.</p><p>e) Figure 4 A-D: The results are basically the same as in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 but now recording from PCs of visually identified bands, which strengthens the results. However, this time SS firing in Z- bands without TRPC3 is as low as in Z+ bands (as desired, presumably). Do the authors think this 'discrepancy' comes from the possibility of, when recording 'blind', mixing some Z+ and Z- PCs? Perhaps the authors could try to plot the data from the two mouse lines together and check if all datapoints fall within one cloud or if some clusters emerge, highlighting potential outliers and suggesting that some of non-visually identified PCs (putative Z- and Z+) have been misidentified.</p><p>This is an interesting point. We believe that there are two possible explanations for the different results obtained using targeted recordings compared to the blind recordings in vivo: (1) As the reviewer indicated, the recorded populations in this experiments are more ‘pure’, i.e. their Z+ or Z- identity is confirmed. This in contrast to the in vivo recordings performed blindly in lobules I-III and X, which potentially include cells with the opposite identity. However, lobule X contains virtually exclusively Z+ Purkinje cells and in lobules I-III it is estimated that &gt;95% of the Purkinje cells is Z-. We generated the suggested plots, but found no evidence for clusters. It should be noted that (1) all firing rates in the superficial, imaging experiments reach lower levels than those in blind, deeper recordings, which probably due to the recordings conditions. Previous work demonstrated that PCs directly under exposed cerebellar surface fire simple spikes at lower rates, see Zhou et al., 2015. (2) The contribution of TRPC3 to the firing rate of Z- Purkinje cells is larger in the areas targeted using the imaging approach, the superficial parts of lobules V and VI and regions in the adjacent hemispheres. This notion is now added in subsection “TRPC3-related effects correlate with zebrin expression and are independent of development”. Taken together our results indicate that TRPC3 is responsible for a major part of the difference but cannot exclude the possibility that in some regions TRPC3 is essential for the entire difference. The fact that TRPC3 is not responsible for the entire difference is now clearly stated in the results (see 3d) and more extensively addressed in the Discussion section.</p><p>f) In Figure 4H we see again that SS in the absence of TRPC3 is decreased but still higher than SS in Z+ band – is this incomplete shift in SS due to a partial effect of tamoxifen or is it evidence that TRPC3 does not account for everything?</p></disp-quote><p>The effects of tamoxifen were verified using immunohistochemistry and 4 weeks after injections. TRPC3 was no longer detectable in Purkinje cells. Based on this result, as well as the experiments in the normal L7-TRPC3ko mice, we conclude that TRPC3 indeed does not account for the complete difference in firing rate between Z+ and Z- Purkinje cells, at least not in all areas of the cerebellum (see 3e). To be more clear on this matter, we have adjusted the title, abstract, related Results sections and discussion (see also points 3a-b,d-e).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4a) TRPC3 and zebrin expression should be quantified in the behaviorally relevant cerebellar regions.</p><p>Zebrin and TRPC3 protein levels must be quantified for the VOR and eyeblink regions. Otherwise, the authors are overstating the role for TRPC3 in behavior, with only indirect evidence for the amount of TRPC3 in the regions/cells relevant for the behavior. The electrophysiology done throughout the paper was not done in these regions.</p></disp-quote><p>This analysis has been performed and is now included in Figure 6—figure supplement 2B, using the same approach as in Figure 1. We can only use immunohistochemistry as both regions, but particularly the eyeblink region, are too small to analyze in western blot. In the behaviorally relevant cerebellar regions, including the flocculus, the paravermal region between lobules IV-V, VI, and the hemispheral parts of IV-V and Sim, the expression of TRPC3 is largely complementary to that of Zebrin. This is in line with what we observed in the vermis. We want to stress that the immunohistochemistry and western blot results indicate that TRPC3 is also present in Z+ PCs, but in lower quantities. This can be taken as evidence supporting the notion that it is not the amount of TRPC3 per se that is responsible for the selective effects in Z- Purkinje cells. Instead, it supports the concept of TRPC3 having a differential function based on the differences in expression levels <underline>and</underline> the differences in the pathway leading to TRPC3 activation, e.g. through mGluR1b. This is now more clearly stated in the Discussion section, molecular pathway discussed in the following paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors show no behavioral effect on VOR and a mild eyeblink conditioning deficit. Given these mostly negative results, have the authors tried, for the behavioral tests, to use the acute (tamoxifen) mutants to rule out concerns about compensatory mechanisms?</p></disp-quote><p>We are confident that compensatory mechanisms occur. Frankly, we have never found any mutant in which they did not occur. Compensation is part of biological systems and the more time you allow for it to occur, the more prominent it will be. One of the main points in the current study is that despite these compensatory mechanisms, there still is a difference between the Z+ controlled VOR learning (no deficit) and the Z– controlled eyeblink conditioning (mild but significant deficits despite compensation). These findings are in line with the differential expression patterns and functioning of TRPC3. We have now better explained this in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5a) Validation is needed for many of the reagents, including the TRPC3 antibody, L7CreER mouse, and general characterization of the weight, locomotion, and ataxia of the mouse lines.</p></disp-quote><p>The TRPC3 antibody is validated by the presence of a band at the correct size in western blot and the absence of staining in Purkinje cells of the L7-TRPC3ko and the L7-TRPC3cko mice (versus the presence of the TRPC3 staining in the UBCs and inferior olive as positive control). This is now included in the first paragraph of the Results section and in the Materials and methods section. For the L7CreER mice we have now included a crossing with a reporter line to demonstrate the extent and selectivity of this line to drive Cre expression in Purkinje cells, see Figure 6—figure supplement 1F. The general characterization of both mutant mouse lines has been published before (L7-TRPC3ko: Hartmann et al., 2008; TRPC3-Mwk: Becker et al., 2009; Sekerkova et al., 2013). For the behavioral experiments we opted not to include the gain-of-function Moonwalker mice, as this is a global mutant with effects and even neurodegeneration in other cell types, resulting in a ataxic phenotype (see references above). The locomotion phenotype of the loss-of-function mutation of TRPC3 mice was tested before (in a global deletion) and only a slightly wider gait was found. Here we further expand this analysis by testing their performance on the Erasmus Ladder and found that this difference in hindlimb position did not affect their ability or speed in this locomotion task, indicating that these mice have minimal to no signs of ataxia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Using L7-Cre mice to express a transgene or create a knockout of a floxed gene is not perfect. First, retinal bipolar cells are known to express L7. Second, it has been reported that the L7-Cre mouse version used here (Barski, 2000) is more permissive than more recent strains, that is, expression of proteins under the L7 promotor have been observed anecdotally by multiple laboratories in other neurons within the cerebellum including molecular layer interneurons. Although the authors illustrate in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 that some UBCs still express TRPC3, the image suggests that there may be a significant reduction in number. It would be good to quantify this expression to ensure that other neuron types are not also effected. There is no characterization of the L7CreER mouse. What is the recombination efficiency? Is it truly selective for Purkinje cells? Finally, the authors should address the possibility that their genetic manipulation led to perturbed function of retinal bipolar cells, as these cells are also known to express TRPC3 along with L7. This is of particular importance as they use light as a visual cue within both behavioral paradigms. A control for this potential confound should be considered, or logical rationale provided for why it is not necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We can appreciate the concerns of the reviewers regarding the use of this L7-Cre line. Regarding the first point, the L7 promotor has indeed been reported to be expressed in retinal bipolar cells. However, as part of the analysis of compensatory eye move, we tested the optokinetic response of L7-TRPC3ko mice. Over a range of stimulus frequencies we found no difference in gain or phase, indicating that these mice do not have any visual impairments. This is in line with our experiences in numerous other mouse lines, where no effects on visual abilities were observed. Additional evidence supporting this claim could be taken from the fact that eyeblink conditioning is these mice is delayed but not completely blocked. For the ectopic expression of TRPC3 in other cerebellar cell types the only concerns are indeed the UBCs, as all other types, including molecular layer interneurons, do not express TRPC3. We understand the remark of the reviewer regarding the apparent reduction in number of TRPC3 positive UBCs in the L7-TRPC3ko mice. Visual inspection of several sections of different mice did not give any reason to assume a change. Instead, we found that in the original panel in Figure S2 the optical section was thicker for the control images than for the L7-TRPC3ko mice (this could, in hindsight, also be noticed by the intensity of the zebrin/aldolase C and calbindin images). The original image for the L7-TRPC3ko mouse in Figure 2—figure supplement 1F has been replaced by a more representative example with similar optical thickness (now in Figure 2—figure supplement 2F). It should be note that changes in UBC numbers would putatively affect eye movement adaptation more than eyeblink conditioning, hence even if there was a loss of UBCs, this could not explain the behavioral phenotype was found. The L7CreER line is remarkably efficient and selective. We have now added panel F to Figure 6—figure supplement 1, to show the results of a crossing with a reporter line and administering the same 5 injections of tamoxifen. We reach virtually complete recombination efficiency, exclusively in cerebellar Purkinje cells. This is confirmed by the absence of TRPC3 staining in the immunohistochemical analysis that was and is presented in Figure 4F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Figure 4F. A western blot quantifying TRPC3 and really be sure the manipulation worked would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a western blot would make it possible to quantify the absence of TRPC3, but unfortunately the time allotted for the resubmission did not allow to breed mice, inject in adults, sacrifice four weeks later and perform the western blot. However, the results of immunohistochemical analysis of TRPC3 are in line with western blots on TRPC3 in the L7-TRPC3ko mice and the immunoblots for L7-TRPC3cko indicates that the levels of TRPC3 are similar to those in L7-TRPC3ko mice. Also, the successful deletion of TRPC3 is supported by the effect on simple spike firing rate in vivo, which is similar to that in mice with the constitutive L7-Cre.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Introduction. The authors state that prior TRPC3 antibodies were of poor quality, and that the novel antibody they use from Cell Signaling is better. It is unclear why the prior antibodies were poor, and no experimental or even observational justification is provided for why this new antibody is better.</p></disp-quote><p>The aim of this statement was to clarify why the patterned expression of TRPC3 we found could potentially previously have been missed. We agree that we cannot explain this further or do the proper comparison. As this is not directly relevant to our study, this statement has been removed and replaced by a statement on the antibody validation, as requested above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Some general characterization of the multiple mouse lines is important. including weight (the size of the animals might have an impact on the Erasmus ladder performance) and level of locomotor activity (decreased levels of locomotion could account for the mild phenotype the authors saw in the eyeblink conditioning assay (Albergaria et al., 2018). Additionally, the authors say in subsection “Animals”, that TRPC3 mutants are ataxic. Were the L7-TRPC3KO also ataxic?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that general features including weight and activity levels are relevant to the behavioral tests we performed. With respect to the general features, in should be noted that both lines have been previously published on: The TRPC3-Mwk mutation is featured by e.g. neurodegeneration and ataxia, and severely impacts behavior (Becker et al., 2009). Hence, we did not include these mice in any of the behavioral tests. The complete, global loss of TRPC3 has minimal to no effects on the mentioned parameters (Hartmann et al., 2008). The Purkinje cell specific knockouts (L7-TRPC3ko) mice did not show any overt changes in weight or locomotion capabilities upon visual inspection, thus we did not consistently weigh these mice. In a small sample we tested now we found no evidence for a difference in weight either (L7-TRPC3ko: 28.8 ± 5.7 g vs. controls: 27.6 ± 4.5 g; mean ± s.d., n = 3 vs. 6, adult 3-4 months old mice, equal m/f ratio). The locomotion activity of L7-TRPC3ko mice was tested in the Erasmus Ladder experiment and no significant differences were observed in the key parameters. If anything, the trend was for mutant mice to make more long steps and less short steps, which would be opposite from decreased locomotion that would lead to impaired eyeblink conditioning. This option is now included in the main text (Results section). In short, L7-TRPC3ko mice cannot be individually distinguished from control mice in any way, and as a group are only different from controls when tested in eyeblink conditioning. These remarks regarding the locomotion and weight of the mutant mice are now included in the Results section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
