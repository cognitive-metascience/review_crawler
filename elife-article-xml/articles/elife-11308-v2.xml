Using a signal-detection theory-based model, we found that the standard deviation in their internal estimate of flash number scaled linearly with the number of flashes.

Humans and other animals tend to respond correctly on some trials and incorrectly on others. For over a century, this variability has been used to study the basis of decision-making. Most behavioral models assume that random fluctuations or 'noise' in the decision-making process is the primary source of variability and errors. However, the nature of this noise is unclear and the subject of intense scrutiny.</p><p>To investigate the sources of the behavioral variability during decision-making, Scott, Constantinople et al. trained rats to perform a visual 'accumulation of evidence' task. The animals counted flashes of light that appeared on either their left or their right. Up to 15 flashes occurred on each side, in a random order, and the rats then received a reward if they selected the side that the greatest number of flashes had occurred on. The rats chose correctly on many occasions but not on every single one.</p><p>Using a computer-controlled rat training facility or 'rat academy', Scott, Constantinople et al. collected hundreds of thousands of behavioral trials from over a dozen rats. This large dataset provided the statistical power necessary to test the assumptions of leading models of behavioral variability during decision-making, and revealed that noise grew more rapidly with the number of flashes than previously predicted. This finding explained patterns of behavior that previous models struggled with, most notably the fact that individuals make errors even on the easiest trials. The analysis also revealed that animals maintain two separate running totals – one of stimuli on the left and another of stimuli on the right – rather than a single tally of the difference between the two.</p><p>Scott, Constantinople et al. further demonstrated that rats could be trained to perform this task using a new system that enables functional brain imaging. The next step is to repeat these experiments while simultaneously recording brain activity to study the neural circuits that underlie decision-making and its variability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11308.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11308.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>accumulation of evidence</kwd><kwd>head restraint</kwd><kwd>drift diffusion model</kwd><kwd>signal detection theory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F32NS78913</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>Ben B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellow</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Constantinople</surname><given-names>Christine M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS082956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tank</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name><name><surname>Brody</surname><given-names>Carlos D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01NS090541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tank</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name><name><surname>Brody</surname><given-names>Carlos D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brody</surname><given-names>Carlos D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Statistical analysis of evidence-based decisions reveals new insights into the source of behavioral variability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Subjects performing perceptual decision-making tasks display a large amount of trial-to-trial behavioral variability. Determining the sources of this variability could provide insight into the neural mechanisms of decision-making and produce more accurate predictions of behavior. It has been proposed that behavioral variability is caused in part by noise accruing during the process of evidence accumulation. This noise may have a variety of origins depending on the behavioral task. It can be inherent in the natural world, produced by the signal detection limits of sensory organs themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlow and Levick, 1969</xref>), or it may reflect the variability of neural responses in the brain at different stages of processing. Previous studies have attempted to trace the sources of noise using a combination of behavioral and neurophysiological approaches.</p><p>At the behavioral level, many models of the evidence accumulation process are known as ‘drift-diffusion’ models (DDMs), because a major component of the noise is modeled as diffusion noise in the accumulator, i.e., noise that is independent for each time point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogacz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith and Ratcliff, 2004</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zariwala et al., 2013</xref>). A recent study by Brunton and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>) developed an accumulation of evidence task, which they modeled with a DDM-like process, to isolate different sources of noise. In their task, evidence was delivered in randomly timed but precisely known pulses: two randomly generated streams of discrete auditory clicks were presented from left and right speakers, and subjects (rats and humans) were trained to indicate the side with the greater number of clicks. The precise timing of the stimuli combined with large numbers of behavioral trials enabled fitting of a detailed and statistically powerful behavioral model. The results suggested that in most subjects the diffusion noise in the accumulator was essentially zero (noiseless), and the behavioral variability was best explained by noise that was added with each pulse of evidence. However, it was assumed that each pulse introduced independent noise. This implied that although time-locked to the stimulus, the noise associated with the stimulus was diffusion-like, and the standard deviation of the total stimulus-induced noise scaled as the square root of the number of pulses. Overall, the model was qualitatively consistent with the widely-assumed diffusion-like noise in the evidence accumulation process. However, similar to other reports, diffusion-like noise alone was unable to fully predict behavioral variability, and specifically failed to account for errors on the easiest trials. Following common practice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al. (2013)</xref> included an additional noise parameter, termed lapse rate, which described variability that did not depend on the stimulus or trial duration. The need for the lapse rate term suggests the existence of additional sources of noise that are not diffusion-like.</p><p>To better characterize sources of noise during perceptual decision-making, here we developed a visual analogue of the Brunton et al. accumulation of evidence task with two key features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erlich et al., 2013</xref>, SFN, abstract). First, rats could perform the task during voluntary head-restraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Girman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kampff et al., 2010</xref>, SFN, abstract), allowing for the potential of cellular resolution imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scott et al., 2013</xref>) and perturbation in future studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rickgauer et al., 2014</xref>). Second, the sensory stimuli were designed to attempt to isolate internally generated noise by minimizing noise inherited from the stimulus. In our task, rats were presented with two series of brief (10 ms), pseudorandomly timed LED flashes to the left and right visual hemifields. Following the form of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al. (2013)</xref> task, the side with the greater total number of flashes indicated the location of a water reward. However, whereas the acoustics of the behavior chamber could distort localization of auditory stimuli, here our visual stimuli were presented from well-separated LEDs positioned to the left and right visual hemifields, suggesting that the rats would have no difficulty distinguishing the left versus right origin of each flash. Additionally, low numbers of flashes were presented in well-separated time bins.</p><p>Behavioral analyses indicated that rats solved the task by accumulating all available evidence, and that flash-associated noise was the predominant source of behavioral variability. We implemented a signal detection theory-based model to evaluate the assumption that noise in the accumulator value was diffusion-like, i.e. that noise was independent for each flash and the noise (standard deviation) of the accumulator value scaled as the square root of the number of flashes. The signal detection theory-based model was designed to find the scaling relationship between noise in the accumulator value and number of flashes that best described the data. Surprisingly, model fits revealed that the noise in the subjects’ numerical estimates scaled linearly with the number of flashes presented, not as the square root. This relationship, called scalar variability, has previously been observed in tasks that require subjects to estimate the duration of a stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gibbon, 1977</xref>) or count the number of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallistel and Gelman, 2000</xref>). Moreover, a behavioral model implementing scalar variability predicted imperfect behavioral performance on the easiest trials, without the need for a non-zero ‘lapse rate’ parameter. Linear scaling of the standard deviation of the noise with the number of flashes reveals a source of noise that does not treat individual pulses independently. Therefore, the noise is not diffusion-like; unlike a lapse rate it depends on total number of evidence pulses; and it is introduced after single-flash sensory processing. We suggest that taking into account this form of noise will be a critical factor for understanding variability in decision-making behaviors.</p><p>An orthogonal approach for measuring noise in the accumulation process is to relate the variability of neuronal responses to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shadlen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen and Newsome, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mazurek et al., 2003</xref>). Ideally, this approach would include recordings from multiple neurons across brain regions and precise neural circuit manipulations. To this end, we developed a version of our task that rats could perform during voluntary head restraint. Voluntary head restraint was developed as an alternative to forced head restraint in which the initiation and termination of the restraint period are under the control of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Girman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">1985</xref>; A.R. Kampff et al., 2010, SFN, abstract). Recently we reported that rats can be trained to perform voluntary head restraint in a high-throughput semi-automated behavioral facility and described a voluntary head restraint system that provides the stability needed for <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular resolution imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scott et al., 2013</xref>). Here we show that performance of head restrained rats was essentially identical to the performance of rats trained on the unrestrained version of the task. These results demonstrate that rats can perform complex cognitive behaviors during voluntary head restraint and provide a platform for characterizing noise during decision-making across multiple brain regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In our rat visual accumulation of evidence task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), subjects initiate a trial by inserting their nose into the center port of a three-port operant conditioning chamber. Subjects must keep their nose in the center port (fixation) for 1–8 s while a series of brief (10 ms) flashes are presented by LEDs to the left and right visual hemifields. Between 0 and 15 flashes are presented independently to each hemifield with a randomized number and timing of flashes on each side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Trial durations and number of presented flashes are independently varied on a trial-by-trial basis. Following an auditory go cue that signals the end of fixation, subjects receive water reward (typically 25 μL) for orienting to a nose port on the side that had more flashes.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11308.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Visual accumulation of evidence task, unrestrained version.</title> <p>(A) Task schematic.

Rats progressed through a series of stages in which they learned (1) to associate light with reward, (2) to maintain nose in center fixation for increasingly long durations and (3) to compare the number of flashes on each side to predict the rewarded location. The procedural code used for training can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brodylab.org/code/flash-code">http://brodylab.org/code/flash-code</ext-link>. Rats progressed through the training stages in 3500 trials. Fully trained rats performed a combined 525,073 trials at 91% for the easiest trials and 70% correct overall. Moreover rats were sensitive to the difference in the number of flashes including differences of a single flash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Errors in behavioral choice increase with number of flashes, not trial duration</title><p>Accumulation of evidence involves two processes: maintaining a memory of the evidence and adding new evidence to that memory. To assess whether noise (and thus behavioral variability) was more closely associated with the memory of the accumulator or with incoming sensory evidence, we initially fit the Brunton et al. model to our visual task data. This produced results consistent with those found for Brunton et al.’s auditory task, including near-zero estimates of accumulator memory noise (i.e., a predominant role for incoming sensory evidence noise), and long accumulation time constants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, further analysis described below led us to question Brunton et al.’s assumption of independent noise across pulses of sensory evidence. We therefore took a model-free approach to estimate whether noise was more closely associated with the memory of the accumulator or with incoming sensory evidence. When trial duration and flash difference were held constant, errors increased with total number of flashes presented, suggesting that noise increased with each flash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Next, we sought to directly compare the effects of flashes and time on behavioral performance (% correct). First, looking across trials with identical differences in flash number (fixed |#R-#L| = ΔF) but with varying total flash number (#R+#L=ΣF) , we calculated the fraction of correct responses as a function of ΣF, relative to the average performance (Δ Performance; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). With the difference in flashes ΔF thus controlled for, we found that trials with greater numbers of flashes showed a substantial decrease in performance. Linear regression suggested that each additional flash decreased performance by 1.14% (+/-0.1%). With an average of 4 flashes presented per second, increasing total flashes at a fixed flash difference thus produced an average decrement in performance of 4.56% per second. Then, to estimate the effect of time on performance, we calculated Δ performance across trials with both identical flash differences (ΔF) and identical total flash number ΣF), but with different overall trial duration. This analysis, which controls for the number of flashes, revealed that the purely time-dependent decrement in performance was only 0.037% (+/-. 77%) for each second of trial duration. These results suggest that error rates depend far more strongly on the number of flashes than on trial duration. We found this both for the group data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and for individual rats as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11308.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Error rate increases with number of flashes, not trial duration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) For trials of fixed duration and fixed difference in number of flashes (Δ<bold>-</bold>flashes, colored lines), behavioral performance decreased with more flashes.

Colored arrows indicate the timing of left (blue) and right (red) flashes. σ<sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup> parameterizes the noise added with each flash, σ<sub>a</sub><sup>2</sup> parameterizes the noise added at each time point, τ (or 1/λ) parameterizes the memory time constant of <italic>a(<italic>t</italic>)</italic>. λ&lt;0 suggests that the memory decays to <italic>a</italic> = 0 with time, λ&gt;0 suggests that the magnitude of <italic>a(<italic>t</italic>)</italic> increases over time. <italic>B</italic> parameterizes sticky bounds: if <italic>a(<italic>t</italic>)</italic> ever reaches +/-<italic>B,</italic> integration stops and the animal is committed to that decision (go right/go left, respectively). There are a few other terms in the model that are not represented in the schematic. A bias term represents an offset of <italic>a(t)</italic> at the beginning of each trial. A lapse rate parameterizes the percent of trials on which the animal behaves randomly. φ and τ<sub>φ</sub> parameterize sensory adaptation dynamics. After a flash, φ is a constant that scales the effect of the flash; it recovers to an unadapted/facilitated magnitude with time constant τ<sub>φ</sub>. φ &gt;1 indicates that successive flashes facilitate; φ &lt;1 indicates that they depress. Fits to those parameters are not shown here, because we found that the inter-flash-intervals presented here were sufficiently long to minimize any adaptation/facilitation effects of subsequent flashes. Light gray lines indicate alternative runs of the model on the same trial. (B) Model fits of flash-associated noise (σ<sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>; blue circles) and noise associated with time (σ<sub>a</sub><sup>2</sup>; red circles). To evaluate these parameters in comparable units, σ<sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup> was divided by the average number of flashes per second for each rat. For each subject, noise associated with time (σ<sub>a</sub><sup>2</sup>) is close to zero, whereas noise correlated with flashes (σ<sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>) is predominant, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). (C) The drift in the accumulator’s memory is parameterized by λ. A leaky integrator would have negative values of λ, an impulsive integrator would have positive values. The time constant of the integrator, τ, is 1/λ. For many, but not all, of the rats, the time constant is close to or greater than 2 s ( λ &lt;= 0.5). (D) The bound value for all except two rats is larger than the maximum number of flashes (on one side) that each rat experienced. This suggests that rats accumulated/used all of the flashes to inform their decision. (E) The bias term for the each rat.

However, two popular alternative models, called scalar variability and subitizing, have been proposed in which noise scales differently with evidence. In the scalar variability model, which has been used to describe both time estimation and counting, the standard deviation of the estimate shows a linear relationship with the quantity represented. The subitizing model predicts that the numerical representation of the first few numbers, up to three or four, is essentially noiseless, and after five its standard deviation grows linearly with the number of flashes. Subitizing has been proposed in tasks in which stimuli are presented simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trick and Pylyshyn, 1994</xref>) and also sequentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camos and Tillmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">von Glasersfeld, 1982</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the amount of noise associated with different numbers of flashes, we used a signal detection theory-based framework that abstracted away the sequential nature of the stimulus presentation, and focused instead on the total number of flashes on each side, and noise associated with those totals, as the key determinants of the animal’s decisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In this approach, the subjects’ estimate of the number of flashes on one side is modeled as a random variable drawn from a Gaussian distribution.

To test the prediction that performance should be constant for trials with a fixed ratio r, we compared behavioral performance on trials with constant ratios of flashes on the rewarded and unrewarded sides. Supporting scalar variability, both the data and best-fit signal detection theory-based model predictions exhibited roughly constant performance for trials with fixed ratios of flashes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, however, behavior deviated from scalar variability, especially for trials with very low number of flashes. For these trials, there was an improvement in performance with additional flashes, even though the ratio of flashes was fixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), which is not predicted by pure scalar variability. Nevertheless, this deviation from scalar variability was well predicted by the model parameters of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.

We probed three independent questions, the combined answers to which produced eight different models: (1) Is performance best fit by dual accumulators or by a single accumulator? (2) Is performance best fit by gradual accrual of noise throughout stimulus presentation, or by noise that depends only on the final value of the integrator? And finally, as in the previous section, (3) Is variability best fit as standard deviation being linear in flash number, or by variance being linear in flash number?

Alternatively, it is possible that rats could be treating each flash as a distinct event, independent of its duration, and integrating the number of flashes. To test which strategy the rats used, we performed an additional experiment in which we trained a second cohort of rats (n=7) on a new version of the task. As before, rats were rewarded for orienting to the side with the greater number of flashes, but in this version the durations of each flash and inter-flash interval were randomly jittered (see Materials and methods). Flash duration was drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 10 ms and standard deviation of 1.5 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Because LED duration is correlated with number of flashes on most trials, it is difficult to evaluate whether animals use flash duration or flash number on most trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). However, on trials in which there was no difference in the number of flashes (Δflashes = 0), the jittering of flash duration led to the generation of some trials with a difference in the duration presented from the right or left LEDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Since, for example, 20 ms of light is the equivalent of a difference of two flashes, we reasoned that on these trials, if the subjects were integrating light duration, they would be more likely to orient to the side with longer LED durations, and a regression line fit to the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> should have a positive slope. Conversely, if they were integrating discrete flash number, they should not exhibit a preference to the side with longer flash duration, and a regression line fit to the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> should have a slope of zero. Consistent with integrating flash number, we found that on trials with 0 Δflashes, rats did not exhibit a preference for the side with longer flash durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>).

Therefore we developed a version of the visual accumulation of evidence task that could be performed during voluntary head-restraint.</p><p>In the head-restrained version of the task, subjects initiate a behavioral trial by guiding a surgically implanted titanium headplate into a custom headport mounted on one wall of an operant training chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <italic>left</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>). The trial begins when the leading edge of the headplate contacts two miniature snap action switches (contact sensors) mounted on the headport. Voltage-controlled pneumatic pistons then deploy to immobilize the headplate and, using the principles of kinematic mounts, register the head to within a few microns. During the restraint period, which lasts 2–3 s, head-restrained animals are presented with up to six flashes on each side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <italic>middle</italic>). After a brief (500 ms) delay, subjects are released from restraint, and can obtain water reward by orienting to one of two side ports mounted to the wall flanking the headport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Head-restrained subjects can also choose to terminate the restraint period early by operating a release switch located on the floor of the chamber. Trials that are terminated early result in a brief timeout (~2 s) in which no reward can be obtained and no trial can be initiated.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11308.024</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Head-restrained and unrestrained rats exhibit comparable task performance.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Schematic of the accumulation of evidence task during head restraint.

The initial stages of training were performed in a high-throughput facility, while acclimation to the pistons and data collection from fully trained animals were performed in a separate facility with a single dedicated behavioral chamber. Rats completed the initial stages of training in similar time to the unrestrained rats. However, a portion of rats (~40%) were slower to acclimate to the pistons than the remainder of their cohort and were excluded from further study.</p><p>Behavioral analysis revealed comparable performance between voluntarily head-restrained and unrestrained rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). Fitting the accumulator model produced model parameters in the head-restrained subjects that was similar to the best fit parameters for the unrestrained rats: negligible accumulator noise, predominant flash-associated noise, accumulation time constants longer than the trial duration and bounds higher than the number of possible flashes. Fitting the signal detection theory-based model revealed similar scaling of noise between restrained and unrestrained versions of the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). We computed the ‘psychophysical reverse correlation’ to further assess whether the rats exhibited long accumulation time constants (see Materials and methods). For each time bin, we computed the probability that there was an excess flash in that bin on the side to which the subjects subsequently oriented. This analysis indicated that flashes in each time bin contribute equally to subjects’ decisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This was true for both voluntarily head-restrained and unrestrained rats.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we developed a visual accumulation of evidence task to study the sources of noise that contribute to behavioral variability. Subjects were presented with two simultaneous trains of randomly timed flashes, one train on their left, and the other on their right, and were rewarded for orienting towards the side with the greater total number of flashes. Behavioral analyses, including reverse correlation, indicated that rats used flashes presented throughout the entire trial to guide their decision, consistent with a strategy of accumulating evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We used a signal detection theory framework to estimate the noise associated with each pulse of evidence (flash). This analysis showed that noise (standard deviation) in the subjects’ numerical estimates scaled linearly with the number of flashes presented, indicating that noise per flash is not independent across flashes. We find that noise is also independent of total stimulus duration, and is perhaps added to the decision variable after the accumulation process. Our behavioral modeling further suggests the existence of two separate accumulators in this binary decision task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The noise scaling we found is similar to scalar variability described in the numerical cognition literature, and appears to be the major source of variability in our subjects’ behavior. Yet it is not diffusion-like and is therefore not well-described by the majority of current ‘drift-diffusion modeling’ (DDM) approaches for accumulation of evidence in decision-making. Incorporating this scalar variability noise will likely be critical for understanding variability in decision-making behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that rats can be trained to perform this task during voluntary head restraint, which opens up new experimental avenues for uncovering the circuit mechanisms that generate behavioral variability during decision-making.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Performance of cognitive behaviors during voluntary head restraint</title><p>Head-restraint is an experimental tool widely used in psychology and neuroscience to immobilize the head of a subject. The technique is typically employed in behavioral experiments to facilitate reliable presentation of sensory stimuli to the head or face and precisely control the subjects’ movements, and in neurophysiological experiments to minimize motion between the brain and recording apparatus. However, it can take some species, notably rats and primates, weeks to acclimate to forced head restraint. Moreover forced head restraint requires skilled experimenter intervention and is difficult to incorporate into automated training procedures. Voluntary head restraint has been proposed to reduce the stress normally associated with forced head restraint and facilitate training on sophisticated behavioral tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scott et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show that rats are able to perform a complex cognitive task, involving both numerical representation and integration of evidence, while voluntarily head-restrained. This provides a foundation for identifying and characterizing the neural circuit mechanisms of accumulation of evidence and numerical representation in future studies using <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular resolution imaging and perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rickgauer et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sources of noise in accumulation of evidence tasks</title><p>The behavioral task described here exhibited a number of features that enabled detailed characterization of noise during accumulation of evidence. The visual stimuli presented in this study were: (1) low in number; (2) presented reliably to left and right visual hemifields; (3) presented from well-separated light sources in front of the rat’s face; (4) presented at sufficient intervals to avoid adaptation or facilitation between successive stimuli. All of these features attempted to minimize sources of noise other than noise in the subjects’ internal estimates. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kiani et al., 2013</xref>), we found that behavioral variability was not affected by the trial duration but was strongly correlated with the number of flashes presented.</p><p>However, we identified a number of additional sources of noise. First, rats exhibit a modest side bias due to reward history occurring up to three trials in the past (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In dynamic foraging tasks, strategies that incorporate trial history (such as win-stay, lose-switch strategies) often maximize rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corrado et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herrnstein, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugrue et al., 2004</xref>). However, in the visual accumulation of evidence task, the rewarded side is assigned independently on each trial, so trial history adds noise to the decision process. The influence of trial history on subsequent decisions has been observed in a number of other studies, suggesting that it is a general source of behavioral variability that should be incorporated into accumulation of evidence models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gold et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We also found that the standard deviation in the accumulated estimate scaled linearly with the number of flashes. This type of noise scaling, called scalar variability, was consistent across the range of stimuli presented (1-15 flashes, with minor deviations at the lowest number of flashes) suggesting that the subjects did not use a subitizing approach, i.e., they did not use rapid accurate counting for numbers less than five. We applied our analysis to a closely related previous auditory task that, as in our current visual task, also delivered sensory evidence in discrete pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>). We found that our conclusions also applied to the auditory data, with the standard deviation of the noise after <italic>N</italic> flashes well-described by σ<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>= <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. Our observation that performance in the auditory task improves with increased integration times is qualitatively consistent with data from tasks in which evidence is delivered in a continuous stream rather than in discrete pulses. This leads us to suggest that scalar variability should be an important consideration in the analysis of data from continuous tasks. But whether or not scalar variability is the dominant form of noise in continuous stream tasks, as it was in the pulsatile tasks analyzed here, remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for neural mechanisms of perceptual decision-making</title><p>The primary focus of this work has been to provide a quantitative description of behavior during accumulation of evidence and to evaluate the sources of behavioral variability. However, an important distinction should be made between quantitative models of behavior and mechanistic models of the underlying neural processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marr, 1982</xref>). Our results do not suggest an underlying neural mechanism, however they do place important constraints on such mechanistic models. One such constraint is scalar variability, which has been observed in a wide variety of tasks requiring animals to estimate magnitudes (such as time or number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallistel and Gelman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gibbon, 1977</xref>). Two possible neural mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. The first is that the brain represents magnitude on a logarithmic scale with constant noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fechner, 1860</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dehaene and Changeux, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meck and Church, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nieder and Dehaene, 2009</xref>). Neurophysiological recordings, particularly in sensory systems, have provided support for this mechanism. For example, neurons in the rodent somatosensory cortex exhibit firing rates that scale logarithmically with frequency of tactile stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kleinfeld et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, neurons in primate parietal cortex appear to encode numerosity on a nonlinear scale (power law or logarithmic; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nieder and Miller, 2003</xref>). The second possibility is that the brain represents magnitude on a linear scale with noise that is proportional to the magnitude. The results described here did not allow us to differentiate between these two models, and indeed, both models make identical psychophysical predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dehaene, 2001</xref>). However, how they would be instantiated in the brain is quite different. For the logarithmic case, the signal diminishes with the quantity being represented, but noise added at each time point is independent. For the linear case, the signal is constant (implying near perfect summation of signals), but noise scales linearly with the magnitude being estimated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Relation to accumulation of evidence models</title><p>Sequential sampling models of accumulation of evidence represent the decision process as the movement of one or more latent decision variables towards a criterion value. Such models have been useful to study a wide range of decision processes. One key advantage is that they provide a moment-by-moment estimate of the decision variable on each trial. This time-varying estimate can be compared to the observed neuronal dynamics, allowing analysis of the correlation between cellular firing rates and the subject’s internal representation of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest three modifications that could improve the accuracy of sequential sampling models of accumulation of evidence. First we found that reward and error trials introduce a bias that persists up to three trials into the future. Second we found that standard deviation in the decision variable increased linearly with the total number of flashes. Note that this observation is inconsistent with the common assumption made in drift diffusion models, that noise is added independent of time and the value of the decision variable. Third, the data was better fit by models that accumulate left and right flashes separately than by models that accumulate a single decision variable. The existence of two accumulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ratcliff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>) has been previously observed in the vertebrate brain, for example the oculomotor system in the goldfish contains two lateralized accumulators that integrate transient motor commands to maintain a memory of gaze position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aksay et al., 2007</xref>), and is consistent with electrophysiological recordings in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bollimunta and Ditterich, 2012</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the future, it will be interesting to develop a reaction-time version of the task, in which subjects are allowed to determine the time during which they observe the stimulus. This would allow testing predictions from recent pulse-accumulation models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Simen et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Noise as a mechanism of generalization during perceptual learning</title><p>Variability in behavior and neuronal networks has been proposed to result, in part, from biophysical constraints of the nervous system. In some systems, however, noise is thought to serve an important functional role. For example it has been proposed that random fluctuations in neuronal membrane potential contributes to contrast invariance in the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, during motor learning, noise is actively introduced into highly reliable systems to create the behavioral variability required for trial and error learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olveczky et al., 2005</xref>). An interesting question is whether noise also facilitates learning in perceptual tasks. One potential function of noise in the estimate of flash number is that it could allow animals, which have been trained on a reduced stimulus set, to generalize, and perform correctly on trials with numbers of flashes they have never encountered. For example, if rats were only trained on trials with 5 and 6 flashes, because of the variability of their estimate of 5 and 6 flashes, on a portion of those trials they will have effectively perceived 7 and 8 flashes, and could learn the correct response to those trials by trial and error. Thus noise may allow the observer to experience a larger range of stimuli than they actually encountered, enabling generalization.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>High-throughput operant conditioning combined with detailed, quantitative analysis of behavioral variability allowed us to characterize the process of evidence accumulation in rats. This analysis revealed that animals’ choices were likely derived from a circuit with multiple accumulators and that decisions were influenced by noise from multiple sources. The major source of noise displayed ‘scalar variability<bold>’</bold> in the sense that its standard deviation scaled linearly with the number of pulses of evidence. This observation is inconsistent with the assumption made by most previous models of accumulation for decision-making, namely that the primary noise source is diffusion-like, added to the accumulator independent of time or accumulator value. Our observation is instead consistent with previous models of numerical cognition, and suggests that evidence accumulation and numerical cognition may be subserved by similar or related circuits and neural mechanisms. We speculate that noise that obeys scalar variability could be an important component in models of accumulation of decision-making evidence generally. Finally, the observation that voluntarily head-restrained rats exhibit similar behavioral performance to unrestrained rats, and can be trained to perform complex decision-making tasks, suggests the possibility of using cellular resolution optical imaging and perturbation technologies to characterize the neural substrates of cognition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal subjects</title><p>Animal use procedures were approved by the Princeton University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; Protocols #1837 and #1853) and carried out in accordance with National Institutes of Health standards.

Unrestrained rats experienced up to 15 bins, whereas head-fixed rats experienced up to 6 bins. For a given trial, each of the two LEDs had a fixed generative probability of producing a flash in each bin. In the final training stage for the unrestrained rats, the generative probabilities for the high-probability LED and low-probability LED ranged from 70-80% and 20-30%, respectively. For restrained rats, the generative probabilities were 70% and 30%. However, the rats were rewarded based on the number of flashes that were actually presented, not on the underlying generative probabilities. In other words, in the rare event that the LED designated ‘high-probability’ happened to produce fewer flashes than the LED designated ‘low-probability’, the animal was rewarded for orienting to the side that had more flashes. The flashes were 10 ms in duration (except for an experimental group in which the flash durations were jittered; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and they occurred in the first 10 ms of each cue bin. For the unrestrained rats, the inter-flash intervals ranged from 240 ms (two flashes in subsequent bins) to 3.45 s (two flashes separated by 13 bins; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the head-fixed rats, the inter-flash intervals ranged from 240 ms to 1.24 s. In a subset of experiments, inter-flash intervals and flash durations were jittered. In these experiments, flash durations were drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 10 ms, and standard deviation of 1.5 ms. Inter-flash intervals were drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 250 ms and standard deviation of either 25 or 50 ms.</p><p>In the unrestrained version of the task, there was a 500 ms pre-cue period before the beginning of the cue period.

In a small subset of trials, the post-cue period was drawn from a broader distribution ranging up to 6.5 s, but those trials represent a minority of the dataset (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the head-fixed version of the task, the pre-cue period was 1 s in duration, to allow time for the pistons to actuate and fix the headplate in place.

Each behavioral trial consisted of a sequence of states in which different actuators—for example, opening of a solenoid valve for water reward—could be triggered.

The difference of those Gaussians predicts the subjects’ performance: correct trials occur when the difference of Gaussians is positive (i.e. the random variable drawn from the distribution representing the larger number is in fact larger than the random variable drawn from the distribution representing the smaller number).

First, for each model, we computed a distribution of bootstrapped r<sup>2</sup> values by resampling the behavioral trials with replacement, performing the fitting procedure, and computing the r<sup>2</sup> value, on 1000 iterations. For pairwise comparisons, (for example, between the scalar variability (SV) and linear variance (LV) models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), the null hypothesis was that the r<sup>2</sup> values for each distribution derive from a common distribution. To test this hypothesis, we combined the bootstrapped r<sup>2</sup> values from the SV and LV models into a single distribution, and from that combined distribution, created two arbitrary distributions of fake SV and LV r<sup>2</sup> values, and computed the average of those arbitrary distributions. We repeated this procedure for many (100, 1000, and 10000) iterations to compute a distribution of arbitrary SV and LV r<sup>2</sup> values and consequently, the difference of those arbitrary distributions, which represents the null hypothesis. We treated the area under the null distribution corresponding to the difference between the true SV and LV r<sup>2</sup> distributions as the p-value. This procedure yielded identical results with 100, 1000, and 10000 permutations. It was performed for the model comparisons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, as well as for evaluation of the SV vs. LV models for the auditory (clicks) data.</p><p>To compare the different versions of the signal detection theory-based model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), for example single accumulator version vs two accumulator version or two accumulator version vs. the two accumulator time-varying version, we used a bootstrapping approach. One hundred surrogate datasets were created by selecting behavioral trials at random with replacement from the original dataset. The signal detection theory-based model was then fit to each surrogate dataset, and the log likelihood for the best-fit parameters was recorded. This gave us a distribution of log likelihoods for each version of the model. We then performed the nonparametric permutation test described above on the distributions of log likelihoods to make pairwise comparisons between the best-fit model and all other models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Klaus Osorio and Jovanna Teran for assistance with behavioral training and animal husbandry.

In particular, the reviewers thought that the use of a decision paradigm in which the exact information provided to an animal on each trial can be precisely controlled is a powerful means to study the mechanisms underlying decision making. This property indeed allowed the authors to analyze the decision-making process in a greater detail. The authors conclude that the standard deviation (SD) of the internal estimates grows linearly with the number of flashes (i.e. features Weber scaling), which violates the linear scaling in variance (rather than SD) commonly assumed by evidence accumulation models (including the one used in Brunton et al.

We have revised the current manuscript to address this issue using the following approaches:</p><p>A) The critical features used in our signal detection theory (SDT) model are that diffusion noise in the inter-pulse interval is near-zero, and that pulses from throughout the entire stimulus interval contribute roughly equally to the animal’s decision. We have performed additional model-free approaches to specifically support these claims (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) without reference to the Brunton et al. model, and we have rewritten the text to make it clear that our conclusions are based primarily on model-free analyses, and do not require the DDF model.</p><p>B) We have rewritten the text to place less emphasis on the DDF model from Brunton et al., and as above, to make it clear that the SDT model and its conclusions do not depend on the Brunton et al. model. As the reviewers point out, one of the main messages of our paper is that the Brunton et al. model made some unjustified assumptions, so it makes no sense to depend on it.</p><p>We nevertheless still include, in the supplementary material, the results of applying the Brunton et al. model to our visual task data, so as to facilitate direct comparison between analyses of our task and the related previous auditory pulses task of Brunton et al. (It is interesting to note that the Brunton et al. fits for our visual task are qualitatively consistent with the fits to the previous auditory task – i.e., that model alone is not sufficient to distinguish qualitative differences between the two tasks.) Similarly, we report the results of applying our SDT model to both the visual task data and the auditory task data.</p><p>It is also interesting to note that, although imperfect, the interpretations that can be drawn from the Brunton et al. DDF model are consistent with the model-free analyses on which the paper now rests. We hope that readers interested in drift diffusion-like models of decision making will find the aspects of the DDF model that are robust across studies – as well as its shortcomings – informative.</p><p> <italic>2) The authors should perform model comparisons more quantitatively e.g. using AIC/BIC. The reviewers raised the issue that unlike what is stated in the text, the models might have different numbers of parameters. Please clarify. Also, model comparisons should be done at the level of individual animals as well as populations.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out: they are quite right, in our original submission we did indeed compare models that had different numbers of parameters but failed to use metrics that penalize model complexity, such as AIC. The question of which specific penalization to use for comparing non-nested models with different parameters (AIC, BIC, DIC, “empirical bayes” etc) is a subject of ongoing debate within the machine learning literature. The reviewers’ comment prompted us to perform a new analysis, which we feel is far simpler and does not suffer from the complications of statistical model comparison for non-nested models. We simplified our models so that all of the 8 model variants that we compare have exactly the same number of parameters (only 2), with similar structures for the two parameters across all the 8 models. This approach made comparison across models much more straightforward, and allowed us to compare log likelihoods directly. The results of this new comparison are described in our Results section and in our revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We also include a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) that compares the different models for each individual animal.</p><p> <italic>3) The reviewers thought that some of the assumptions such as zero drift during inter-pulse intervals are not justified.</italic> </p><p>As we understood it, the reviewers’ suggestion here is that a flash might create a long-lasting input to the accumulator (i.e., non-zero drift during inter-pulse intervals), whereas we assumed zero drift during inter-pulse intervals. It is worth noting that if a pulse created a short-lasting non- zero drift (e.g., on the order of tens of milliseconds), our results would remain essentially the same, because all analyses and results depend on the integrated effect of each pulse. The important question is thus with respect to long-lasting non-zero drift.</p><p>The longer a non-zero post-pulse drift, the greater its cumulative impact on the accumulator. Thus we would expect decisions to be biased toward the side with the greatest cumulative post-pulse time. To examine whether our assumption of zero drift during inter-pulse intervals was reasonable, we implemented a regression model with two parameters: cumulative post-pulse interval duration and difference in flash number (plus a third parameters, for a constant term). Long-lasting post-pulse drift would produce a significant positive regression weight for the cumulative post-pulse duration. Instead, the model revealed that the rats’ choices were better explained by differences in flash number on each trial. More specifically, the regression coefficient for the difference in flash number was. 25 +/- .0038, compared to -.06 +/- .0036 for cumulative post-pulse interval duration (and. 02 +/- .0012 for the bias/constant term). We concluded that nonzero drift during the inter-pulse intervals did not appreciably contribute to the rats’ behavior.</p><p> <italic>4) The authors should show more results regarding the variability between animals.</italic> </p><p>We thank the authors for this suggestion. We have included twelve additional supplementary figures to address this issue. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> illustrates the psychometric performance of each individual rat. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> plots the best-fit model parameters to the drift diffusion-like model from Brunton et al.

We have also included additional analyses of each rat that performed the auditory (clicks) version of this task. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> plots the fits of the SDT model for each rat from the clicks task, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref> plots the result of a permutation test for each clicks rat comparing the goodness-of-fit of scalar variability versus linear variance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref> plot the chronometric curve of each rat, as well as the signal-detection theory model prediction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> compares model performance of all eight models described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> for each rat in the visual version of the task. We have referenced these analyses in the main text and included appropriate supplementary figure legends.</p><p> <italic>5) How bootstrap methods were applied needs to be explained more explicitly. If the analyses were run such that the number of resampling affects the significance level, then the statistical results (p-value) do not appear to be valid. Please clarify.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We have recomputed significance using a nonparametric permutation test, so that the p-value is not affected by amount of resampling, which we confirmed by observing that the procedure yielded the same results when performed with 100, or 1000, or 10,000 permutations.</p><p>In more detail, when comparing the distribution of goodness of fit values (R2) for the scalar variability (SV) and linear variance (LV) models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, the null hypothesis is that the R2 values for each distribution derive from a common distribution. [To clarify: the distribution of bootstrapped R2 values were obtained by resampling from the behavioral trials with replacement, performing the fitting procedure, and computing the R2 value, on 1000 iterations.] To test the null hypothesis, we combined the bootstrapped R2 values from the SV and LV models into a single distribution, and from that combined distribution, created two arbitrary distributions of fake SV and LV R2 values, and computed the average of those arbitrary distributions. We repeated this procedure for many iterations to compute a distribution of arbitrary SV and LV R2 values and consequently, the difference of those arbitrary distributions, which represents the null hypothesis. The area of the null distribution corresponding to the difference between the true SV and LV R2 distributions is the p-value. As pointed out above, the procedure yielded identical results with 100, 1000, and 10000 permutations. It was performed for the model comparisons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, as well as for evaluation of the SV vs. LV models for the auditory (clicks) data. Additionally, to evaluate the models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, this permutation test was performed on the distributions of bootstrapped likelihoods for each model. There is a new section of the Methods section that describes the bootstrapping and permutation procedures in full (see Methods: Model comparison).</p><p> <italic>6) The model, as well as the data, seems to suggest that scaling of the numbers of pulses by the same factor will lead to identical discriminability. This property seems important. Please clarify whether this is true in the model as well as the data.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this very interesting analysis: they are indeed correct that it is an important property, and it led us to some further analyses that, among other things, helped to better understand the comparison between our visual task and the auditory task of Brunton et al.</p><p>First, we have included a new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) confirming that, as predicted by the reviewers, scaling the number of pulses on both sides by the same factor leads to nearly identical performance. This is true in both the data and in the signal-detection theory model predictions. (The signal detection theory model does predict some deviations from scalar variability, at very low numbers of flashes. These are also observed in the data, as predicted, and are also now described in the main text).</p><p>Second, we observed that perfect scalar variability would imply that for the auditory task of Brunton et al., performance should not increase for longer stimulus durations; yet in the data itself, performance does clearly increase. When fitting the auditory data with the SDT model, we found that a linear relationship between noise standard deviation and number of pulses still applied (as in scalar variability), but with a significant non-zero offset k0, i.e., σN = k0 + kN. This non-zero k0 can account for the observed improvement in performance over time in the auditory data, and contrasts with data from the visual task, for which k0 ≈ 0 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>Both of these are important further analyses that followed from the reviewers’ observations and that we think readers will find interesting. In particular, these analyses allowed us to strengthen comparisons between the current visual data and the previous auditory data, and they establish that the linear relationship σN = k0 + kN is not specific to the visual sensory modality.</p><p>The new main text discussing these points can be found in the section Results: “Subjects’ estimates of flash number exhibit scalar variability”.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
