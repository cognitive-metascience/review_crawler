We present crystallographic and biochemical analyses of Btk, which together reveal molecular details of its autoinhibition and activation. Autoinhibited Btk adopts a compact conformation like that of inactive c-Src and c-Abl. A lipid-binding PH-TH module, unique to Tec kinases, acts in conjunction with the SH2 and SH3 domains to stabilize the inactive conformation. In addition to the expected activation of Btk by membranes containing phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), we found that inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>), a soluble signaling molecule found in both animal and plant cells, also activates Btk. This activation is a consequence of a transient PH-TH dimerization induced by IP<sub>6</sub>, which promotes transphosphorylation of the kinase domains. Sequence comparisons with other Tec-family kinases suggest that activation by IP<sub>6</sub> is unique to Btk.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06074.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06074.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06074.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human immune system is our defense against a variety of intruders, including bacteria, viruses, and other microbes, and provides our body with long-lasting protection against these invaders. B-cells—one type of immune cell—produce proteins called antibodies that can recognize microbes from previous invasions. This allows other immune cells to find the intruders and destroy them more efficiently.</p><p>People suffering from a genetic disease called X-linked agammaglobulinemia have fewer fully mature B-cells than most people and are extremely susceptible to bacterial infections. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding an enzyme called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), which is involved in B-cell development. This enzyme is usually kept inactive until the B-cells are needed, but the molecular mechanism of this restraint remains to be discovered.</p><p>Wang et al. have used X-ray crystallography and biochemistry to produce a three-dimensional atomic model of the Btk enzyme in its inactive form. The model and functional studies reveal that when the Btk enzyme is inactive, it folds up into a compact shape. Within the enzyme, a ‘PH-TH module’ and two other domains work together to stabilize this folded-up form.</p><p>Although earlier studies indicated that the Btk enzyme becomes activated only when it is recruited to cell membranes, Wang et al. found that a small molecule called IP<sub>6</sub> (short for inositol hexakisphosphate) can activate the Btk enzyme even in the absence of a membrane. This molecule recognizes a previously unnoticed binding site on the PH-TH module, and causes the PH-TH module in the inactive Btk enzyme to bind briefly to the PH-TH modules in other Btk enzymes. This brief binding event is an important step in the process that activates the enzyme. IP<sub>6</sub> might also be involved in recruiting the Btk enzyme to the cell membrane in B cells, but this proposal needs to be tested experimentally. The details of the BTK activation mechanism reported by Wang et al. could prove useful to researchers developing new treatments for immunodeficiency diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06074.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06074.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>B-cell signalling</kwd><kwd>tyrosine kinase</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute (CRI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Qi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO1 AI091580</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuriyan</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A key B-cell tyrosine kinase that adopts an autoinhibited conformation, and can be activated by either membrane recruitment or soluble inositol hexakisphosphates in solution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Activation of B- and T-lymphocytes relies on a chain of tyrosine phosphorylation events initiated by B-cell and T-cell receptors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cambier et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weiss and Littman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kurosaki, 2011</xref>). These phosphorylation-dependent signals are generated by three kinds of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, linked to the receptor by membrane co-localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dal Porto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kurosaki, 2011</xref>). Src-family kinases (principally Lyn and Fyn in B-cells, Lck and Fyn in T-cells), resident at the plasma membrane, respond first to receptor activation. They phosphorylate pairs of tyrosine residues in ITAM motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of activated receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mócsai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), which in turn recruit the tandem-SH2 domain tyrosine kinases Syk (in B-cells) and ZAP-70 (in T-cells). Membrane localization of Syk or ZAP-70 leads to the recruitment and activation of Tec-family tyrosine kinases, Btk (in B-cells) and Itk (in T-cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreotti et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Btk is present in all hematopoietic cells, except for T-cells and natural killer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsukada et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lindvall et al., 2005</xref>). It is also part of several other receptor-mediated signaling networks, including those initiated by Toll-like receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jefferies et al., 2003</xref>), Fc receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kawakami et al., 1994</xref>), and G-protein coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsukada et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bence et al., 1997</xref>). Btk is critical for the generation of calcium flux in response to receptor activation, because it activates phospholipase C-γ2 (PLC-γ2), which produces the second messengers diaceylglycerol (DAG) and inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>). Btk dysfunction is the cause of X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a severe disease of primary immunodeficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsukada et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>The Tec family kinases have a lipid-interaction module attached to the N terminus of a Src-like module (i.e., concatenation of an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain and a tyrosine kinase domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Like the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl, the Tec kinases lack a C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation site that in Src kinases engages the SH2 domain in an autoinhibitory interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sicheri et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagar et al., 2003</xref>). The lipid-interaction module of the Tec kinases is an extended plekstrin homology (PH) domain fused to a Tec homology (TH) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyvönen and Saraste, 1997</xref>). The PH-TH binds PIP<sub>3</sub> in membranes, or the soluble head group of PIP<sub>3</sub>, inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP<sub>4</sub>), in solution. A flexible linker connects the PH-TH module to the Src-like module; its length varies from 26 residues in Itk, the Tec family kinase in T-cells, to 45 residues in Btk.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06074.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of the Src-like module of Btk.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain architectures of Btk, c-Abl, and c-Src.

B-cell activation leads to rapid phosphorylation of Tyr 551 in the kinase domain and Tyr 223 in the SH3 domain of Btk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rawlings et al., 1996</xref>). Tyr 551 corresponds to the canonical phosphorylation site in the activation loop of tyrosine kinases; as expected, its phosphorylation increases Btk catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rawlings et al., 1996</xref>). Phosphorylation of Tyr 223 has been reported to have no apparent influence on Btk catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Middendorp et al., 2003</xref>). It lies within the peptide-binding groove of the SH3 domain, and its phosphorylation alters SH3 domain selectivity among binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morrogh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Middendorp et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Binding of a Tec-kinase PH domain to the membrane lipid PIP<sub>3</sub>, produced as a consequence of receptor activation, provides a simple control mechanism for switching on the kinase. Membrane recruitment triggers trans-autophosphorylation, through increased local concentration, or trans-phosphorylation by membrane-bound Src-family kinases, thereby activating the Tec kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rawlings et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>We present here an analysis of two crystal structures of Btk, which jointly provide molecular details of its autoinhibition. One structure is of the Src-like module, in an assembled and inactive conformation, resembling those of inactive c-Abl and of the Src kinases c-Src and Hck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sicheri et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagar et al., 2003</xref>). The other is of a Btk construct that lacks the SH3 and SH2 modules and that links the PH-TH module directly to the kinase domain. We find that the PH-TH module stabilizes the inactive conformation of the kinase by interacting with the N lobe. The inactive conformation of Btk is thus a compact one, in which the PH-TH module cooperates with the SH2 and SH3 domains to maintain an inactive structure. Several structures of isolated domains of Btk have been determined previously, as summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, which also lists structures of fragments of other Tec family kinases.</p><p>We also report a set of findings that reveal an unanticipated role for the PH-TH module in activating the kinase domain. We find that inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>), a soluble signaling molecule ubiquitous in animal and plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Szwergold et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vallejo et al., 1987</xref>), can activate Btk strongly. We have determined a crystal structure of the PH-TH module of Btk bound to IP<sub>6</sub> and identified a previously undetected binding site on the PH-TH module, distinct from the canonical PIP<sub>3</sub>/IP<sub>4</sub> site. The new site is critical for activation by IP<sub>6</sub>.</p><p>We show that Btk activation by IP<sub>6</sub> is a consequence of a transient, IP<sub>6</sub>-induced PH-TH dimerization, which promotes transphosphorylation of the kinase domains. The possibility that PH dimerization might be important for Btk activation was first proposed by Saraste and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyvönen and Saraste, 1997</xref>), and we now show that the dimer interface identified previously is essential for IP<sub>6</sub>-dependent Btk activation. IP<sub>6</sub>-triggered transient dimerization of the PH domain may provide a membrane-independent mechanism for activating Btk in the nucleus or cytoplasm or may have a role in feedback stimulation of Btk that has been activated by PIP<sub>3</sub> at the membrane. The prior model for Btk activation involved only a PIP<sub>3</sub>-dependent membrane recruitment as the key step in switching on the kinase. The ability of IP<sub>6</sub> to activate Btk points to an as yet unappreciated complexity to the activation mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural analysis of Btk</title><p>We have determined four crystal structures as part of this work.

determined the structure of a construct of mouse Btk spanning residues 214 to 659, which starts just before the SH3 domain and ends at the C terminus of full-length Btk. The structure resembles those described previously for autoinhibited, Src-like, non-receptor tyrosine kinases, with the SH2-kinase linker sandwiched between the SH3 domain and the small domain of the kinase (the N lobe of the kinase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The crystal structure has two molecules of Btk in the asymmetric unit, intertwined as a domain-swapped dimer in which each SH2 domain has pieces from two molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The domain-swapped SH2 domain packs against the large domain of the kinase (the C lobe of the kinase), but Btk lacks a Src-like C-terminal tail to stabilize this interaction.</p><p>The sequence identity between Btk and c-Abl is 42%, 31%, and 46% in the SH3, SH2, and kinase domains, respectively; for Btk and c-Src, it is 44%, 29%, and 40%. Superposition of the C lobes of the Btk and c-Abl kinase domains gives an approximately 20° relative rotation of their SH3 domains; superposition of the SH3 domains, a relative rotation of about 15° for their SH2 domains. Similar results are obtained for a comparison to c-Src. Coupling between the SH3 and SH2 domains may therefore be somewhat different in these kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>The structure of the SH3 domain of Btk is nearly identical to those determined previously using NMR (the r.m.s. deviation for 53 Cα atoms is 0.9 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tzeng et al., 2000</xref>), except for the expected differences seen at the N and C termini. When compared with the other autoinhibited SH3-SH2-kinase structures (c-Src, Hck, c-Abl), the conserved features of the SH3/linker interaction in Btk are the polyproline type-II helix conformation adopted by residues 383–387 in the SH2-kinase linker, including the proline at position 385, and the overall hydrophobic character of the peptide-binding pocket on the SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The tryptophan sidechain in the center of this pocket donates a hydrogen bond to a backbone carbonyl of the linker, as in most other SH3-ligand complexes. A cluster of hydrophobic sidechains extends from the binding pocket and the SH3 ‘RT loop’, across the SH2-kinase linker segment, to the β2-β3 loop and strand β4 of the kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Binding of exogenous protein ligands to the Btk SH3 domain would disassemble the Src-like inactive conformation, as seen for the Src family kinase Hck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moarefi et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Diffuse electron density for the SH2 domain at every stage of our structure determination shows that this part of the polypeptide chain occupies a range of positions and adopts multiple local conformations. The domain itself has a marginally stable internal structure, as shown by the domain swap, and it is probably imperfectly locked in place. The SH2 βA/αA loop lies between kinase-domain helices αB and αF. Density features for this loop are relatively sharp, and the rest of the domain may pivot somewhat about its contact with the C lobe.</p><p>The domain swap occurs in the same location within the SH2 domain as a domain swap seen in a Grb2 SH2-domain crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schiering et al., 2000</xref>). The SH2 domain opens up at a position within the subsidiary β-sheet, so that helix B of one polypeptide chain packs against the main β-sheet of the other and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This exchange occurs in solution for Btk, as only the dimeric species crystallizes. The similar domain swap seen in two SH2 domains not closely related in their specificity or functions suggest that other SH2 domains may also have the same bipartite character.</p><p>There is no evidence that a domain-swapped dimer (or, indeed, any stable dimer) is a functional state of intact Btk, and so it is likely that the assembled state involves a single polypeptide chain, rather than two inter-folded chains. The relatively high concentration of purified protein could have promoted dimer formation in our preparations. In the case of Grb2, the structure of the intact protein, a monomer in solution, shows no domain swap, and loss of contacts between the deleted N- and C-terminal SH3 domains can account for destabilization of the central SH2 when it is prepared as an isolated domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maignan et al., 1995</xref>). For Btk, the PH-TH module might stabilize the Src-like module.</p><p>The unphosphorylated activation loop of Btk folds into the mouth of the catalytic cleft, blocking part of the substrate-binding site, and helix αC lies at the margin of the N lobe, preventing formation of a Glu-Lys salt bridge conserved in all catalytically active protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The activation loop of Btk is in a conformation seen in the structure of a Btk kinase domain-inhibitor complex (PDB: 3OCS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Paolo et al., 2011</xref>]), and in autoinhibited c-Src (the r.m.s. deviation from c-Src is 2.3 Å for the 24 α-carbons of the activation loop), but the cleft between the two lobes of the kinase is substantially more open in Btk than in c-Src. Helix αC is also displaced from the catalytic cleft, as in inactive c-Src or cyclin-dependent kinases. The segment of the activation loop that contacts the N lobe shifts with it, with respect to c-Src as a reference, by up to 3 Å, away from the C lobe.</p><p>A network of polar interactions present in the autoinhibited forms of c-Src and Hck is also present in the Btk conformation in our crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Glu 445, which would buttress Lys 430 in the active conformation, interacts instead with Arg 544 and Tyr 545. Arg 544 stacks in turn on Arg 520, clamping the latter against the phenyl ring of Phe 574. Each of these arginines also appears to have an amino–aromatic interaction: Arg 544 with Phe 517 and Arg 520 with Phe 574. In the active conformation of Btk, the same two arginines are expected (based on the structure of the active Lck kinase domain, PDB: 3LCK; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamaguchi and Hendrickson, 1996</xref>]) to engage in salt bridges with a phosphorylated Tyr 551. Activation thus entails a shuffling of salt-bridge and polar hydrogen-bond partners, described in the case of Src kinases as an ‘electrostatic switch’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ozkirimli and Post, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banavali and Roux, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, the inactive conformation is stabilized by interactions made by the SH2-kinase linker. Leu 390 of the linker (corresponding to Trp 260 in c-Src) is sandwiched between residues Trp 421 and Tyr 461 in the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The hydrophobic packing between Trp 421 and Leu 390 would not be possible in the active conformation of the kinase domain.</p><p>The structure just described demonstrates that the SH3-SH2 domain in a Tec-family member can assemble into a regulatory clamp, just as it does in other Src-like kinases. In the crystal structures of c-Src, Hck, and c-Abl, a latch is present—either in the form of a phosphorylated C-terminal tail (c-Src, Hck) or a myristoyl group bound in a pocket on the C lobe of the kinase domain (c-Abl). In both cases, the latch secures the SH2-domain/C lobe contact, precisely the interface that appears to be poorly formed in our Btk crystals. As we show below, the latch in Btk is provided by the PH-TH module.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structure of a PH-TH-kinase construct of Btk</title><p>We expressed a ‘PH-TH-kinase’ construct of bovine Btk that contains the PH-TH module connected to the kinase domain by the 13-residue SH2-kinase linker.

We also determined the structure of the isolated Btk kinase domain with the six mutations described above and found by comparing it to wild-type Btk that the mutations do not introduce major perturbations in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Details of expression, purification, crystallization, and structure determination are in the ‘Materials and methods’.</p><p>The PH-TH module contacts the kinase N lobe.

In Akt1, the PH domain sits in front of the catalytic cleft of the kinase, blocking peptide substrate binding. In Btk, the PH-kinase interface does not directly occlude the active site. The interface combines a set of hydrophobic contacts with a hydrogen-bond network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In particular, Tyr 134 at the C terminus of helix α2 of the PH-TH packs into a groove between Trp 395 at the linker-kinase junction and helix αC in the kinase N lobe. We expect these interactions to stabilize the inactive conformation of the kinase, by hindering the shift in helix αC that accompanies kinase activation. Experiments confirming these expectations are described below, in the section on ‘Autoinhibition’.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A structural model for full-length Btk</title><p>We combined the two structures just described to build a model for full-length Btk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The SH2 domain shifted by ∼6 Å, with a roughly 10° rotation that brought it closer to the C lobe of the kinase domain and closer to its position in the inactive forms of c-Src, Hck, and c-Abl. Some adjustment of the SH2 domain in these simulations was expected, as the domain swap in the crystals probably perturbed the domain to some extent, and the starting structure for the simulations was therefore itself an approximation.</p><p>In simulations of the PH-TH-kinase construct, the interface with the kinase domain remained intact, but the PH-TH module wobbled back and forth through a rotation of about 20° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The averaged r.m.s. deviation between the crystal structure and structures from the end of the trajectories, aligned on the kinase domain, was ∼4 Å for the PH-TH module. The PH-TH module pivots about an apparent anchor point at the C terminus of helix α2, at the center of the autoinhibitory contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The fluctuations in the PH-TH orientation generate transient structures in which there would be essentially no clashes between the SH3 domain and the PH-TH module in the merged structures. We initiated multiple MD trajectories from such a composite model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The inhibitory interactions between each of the regulatory modules and the kinase domain were preserved, but various intra-domain rearrangements occurred during the course of these trajectories. The overall conformation of Btk at the end of the trajectories is very similar to the initial structure. The averaged r.m.s. deviations of the PH-TH module and the SH3 domain between the crystal structures and the end of trajectories, aligned on the Src-like module of the kinase, were ∼4 Å and ∼2.5 Å, respectively. The former is comparable to the value found in simulations of the PH-TH-kinase, but the latter is larger than in simulations of the Src-like module, probably because the SH3 domain reorients with respect to the kinase domain. The SH3 rotation results in a polar interface between SH3 and PH-TH, with good electrostatic complementarity, which preserves the interactions between the SH3 domain, the linker and the N lobe of the kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

We avoided the heterogenous phosphorylation that accompanies expression in eukaryotic cells by using bovine Btk expressed in bacteria, which gives a pure, unphosphorylated product with good yield. Bovine Btk is 98.8% identical to human Btk in sequence, with only eight amino-acid differences over the entire protein. The mass of the bacterially expressed full-length Btk (76,379 Da), as determined by mass spectrometry, is consistent with the calculated molecular weight (76,381.2 Da).</p><p>Incubation with ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> initiates autophosphorylation, leading in turn to increased catalytic activity. We monitored activation in two ways. First, we monitored the phosphorylation by Btk of a peptide substrate derived from PLC-γ2, using a continuous kinase-coupled colorimetric assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Second, we followed accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Btk by immunoblotting with a non-specific, anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, EMD Millipore) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The results of the two assays are in good agreement.</p><p>The kinase domain of Btk has low catalytic activity and autophosphorylates very slowly, like the c-Abl kinase domain and unlike those of the Src family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). For example, there is no detectable change over 90 min in the level of phosphorylation of the Btk kinase domain at 4 μM concentration. Inclusion of the SH2 domain and the SH2-kinase linker (but not the SH3 domain or the PH-TH module) increases Btk autophosphorylation substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We have not studied how the SH2 domain increases activity, but we note that in c-Abl, the SH2 domain docks onto the N lobe of the kinase domain and stabilizes the active conformation and that activation by the SH2 domain is also seen in Csk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sondhi and Cole, 1999</xref>) and c-Fes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nagar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Filippakopoulos et al., 2008</xref>). The apparent linear array of domains detected by small-angle x-ray scattering from a partially phosphorylated form of full-length Btk might represent the activated rather than the inactive form, in a conformation similar to that of activated c-Abl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Márquez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nagar et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The autoactivation rate of the complete Src-like module of Btk is lower than that of the SH2-kinase module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), as expected from the joint clamping effect of the SH3 and SH2 domains. Based on contacts seen in the crystal structure of the Src-like module of Btk, we introduced (separately) two mutations, Y223A and Y268A, into full-length Btk. These SH3-domain residues pack against Pro 385 in the SH2-kinase linker, and their phosphorylation (or mutation to alanine) would destabilize the autoinhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The autoactivation rates of both mutants are indeed about sixfold greater than that of the unmutated enzyme and comparable to that of the SH2-kinase module (the rate of activation is estimated from the slope of activity vs time, and is only a rough measure because of non-linearity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). An analogous interaction regulates c-Abl activation: phosphorylation of Tyr 89, in the SH3-kinase interface, is necessary for full activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brasher and Van Etten, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Mutations expected to disrupt the PH-TH-kinase interface likewise increase the autoactivation rate of full-length Btk, consistent with our inferences from examining the interface between the PH-TH and the kinase N lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

The purpose of these studies was to see whether interactions with the soluble headgroups might activate Btk independent of membrane localization, as is the case with Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calleja et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). The soluble headgroup of PIP<sub>3</sub> is IP<sub>4,</sub> and so this was included in our study, as were several other inositol phosphates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). IP<sub>4</sub> itself has no effect on the rate of Btk activation in solution, demonstrating that the role of PIP<sub>3</sub> is to recruit Btk to the membrane without necessarily triggering an allosteric effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Activation of Btk by IP<sub>6</sub> in solution</title><p>We tested the effect of 10 other inositol phosphates on the activity of Btk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Quite unexpectedly, we discovered that inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>) promotes Btk autophosphorylation strongly at 2 μM protein concentration, substantially enhancing Btk catalytic activity within the first 5 min after addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We also saw a milder activation with certain inositol pentakisphosphates (IP<sub>5</sub>), but these required higher protein concentration and longer times for appreciable autophosphorylation than did IP<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>The EC<sub>50</sub> value for IP<sub>6</sub> activation is around 20 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), in the range of the physiological concentration of IP<sub>6</sub> in cells, which is 10 μM–80 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irvine and Schell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shears, 2001</xref>). In the presence of a saturating concentration of IP<sub>6</sub> (100 μM), full-length Btk is activated within the first 5 min of reaction time, in contrast to the 30 min and 120 min that are required for the activation of the SH2-kinase module and full-length Btk, respectively, in the absence of IP<sub>6</sub> or PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>). Once fully activated, the catalytic rates of various Btk constructs are the same with or without IP<sub>6</sub> addition, suggesting that the effect of IP<sub>6</sub> is to change the rate of autophosphorylation, and that it does not affect the catalytic machinery directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>By comparing constructs, we determined which domains in Btk are responsible for the IP<sub>6</sub> response. Activation by IP<sub>6</sub> required only the PH-TH module and not the SH3 and SH2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). A PH-TH-kinase construct that contained the PH-TH-SH3 linker and the SH2-kinase linker (with a total linker length of 45 residues) had the same response to IP<sub>6</sub> as did full-length Btk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). PH-TH-kinase constructs with shorter linkers also responded to IP<sub>6</sub>. The shortest linker necessary for activation contained only 13 residues from the SH2-kinase linker; we used this construct to determine the crystal structure described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The catalytic activity of the fully activated PH-TH-kinase construct was about threefold lower than that of full-length Btk. This lower activity can be explained by the absence of the SH2 domain.</p><p>IP<sub>6</sub> has no effect on activation of the isolated kinase domain of Btk, suggesting that it is not a direct allosteric activator of the enzyme. The protein kinase CK2 is activated by IP<sub>6</sub>, which binds to the kinase domain and dislodges an inhibitory interaction between CK2 and the protein Nopp140 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). It seems unlikely that IP<sub>6</sub> works by displacing an inhibitory interaction between the kinase and the PH-TH module, because the Src-like module (lacking the PH-TH module) activates only slightly faster than full-length Btk in the absence of IP<sub>6</sub>. Nevertheless, in order to test this possibility, we introduced two mutations (Y133E and R134E) at the PH-TH-kinase interface that are expected to disrupt the inhibitory docking of the PH-TH module on the kinase domain. Full-length Btk bearing these two mutations retains activation by IP<sub>6</sub>, showing that IP<sub>6</sub> does not act by dislodging the interactions seen in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The canonical lipid-binding pocket of the PH-TH module is not critical for IP<sub>6</sub>-mediated Btk activation</title><p>The structure of the PH-TH-kinase construct does not provide direct clues about how IP<sub>6</sub> might activate Btk.

The loop between strands β1 and β2, which is important for IP<sub>4</sub> binding, is largely disordered in our structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). There are fewer interactions at the canonical site between the PH-TH module and IP<sub>6</sub> than seen for IP<sub>4</sub>, consistent with the relative affinities of the two ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>The two other IP<sub>6</sub> molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit are bound at a peripheral site. This site is on the surface formed by an elongated β hairpin involving strands β3 and β4 of each PH-TH module. This site has not been seen in any other PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lemmon, 2008</xref>); it differs from the two well-characterized lipid-binding sites in the PH domains of Pleckstrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferguson et al., 1995</xref>) and β-spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hyvönen et al., 1995</xref>). As in the canonical binding site, interactions between IP<sub>6</sub> and the peripheral site are predominantly electrostatistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Unlike the canonical site, which has a well-defined groove within which the inositol phosphates are bound, the peripheral site is relatively flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>A feature of the crystallographic lattice is that IP<sub>6</sub> bound at the peripheral site is sandwiched between two PH-TH modules, interacting with the peripheral sites on both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). The majority of interactions are with one subunit. Residues Arg 49, Lys 52, Lys 36, and Tyr 40 at the peripheral binding site of one subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>) coordinate phosphate groups at the 1, 2, 3, and 4 positions of the myo-inositol ring. A subset of these residues, Lys 52 and Lys 36, on the other PH-TH module interact from the opposite side of the myo-inositol ring with the phosphate group at position 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The bridging interactions provided by IP<sub>6</sub> generate an open-ended chain of PH-TH dimers in the crystal lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Based on the limited interactions across this crystallographic interface, we do not believe that this open-ended chain is relevant to the function of Btk.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>The peripheral binding site is critical for IP<sub>6</sub>-mediated Btk activation</title><p>We mutated Arg 49 and Lys 52, in the peripheral binding site of the PH-TH module, to serine in full-length Btk.

In ITC experiments, we saw no detectable binding when we added IP<sub>6</sub> to a PH-TH module with mutations at both the canonical and the peripheral sites, further confirming that the residual binding of IP<sub>6</sub> to the IP<sub>4</sub>-binding deficient mutant is at the peripheral binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>The disposition of the IP<sub>6</sub> molecule can be determined unambiguously from the electron density because the phosphate group at the 2 position juts out from the plane of the myo-inositol ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). IP<sub>6</sub> at the peripheral binding site interacts with the primary PH-TH module to which it is bound through the phosphates at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. None of the inositol phosphates used in our experiments, other than IP<sub>6</sub>, can fully satisfy this criterion, which may underlie the specificity of the PH-TH module for IP<sub>6</sub>. Two isomers of IP<sub>5</sub>, I(2,3,4,5,6)P<sub>5</sub> and I(1,2,3,5,6)P<sub>5,</sub> have a mildly activating effect on Btk; they are more effective than I(1,3,4,5,6)P<sub>5</sub>.

A good example of such a kinase is c-Abl. Indeed, in chronic myelogenous leukemia, a chromosomal translocation results in fusion of a coiled-coil oligomerization domain with c-Abl, leading to hyper-activation of the BCR-Abl fusion protein by autophosphorylation. Several other fusion variants involving c-Abl, in which different oligomerization domains are present, are associated with hematological malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Braekeleer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We generated a PH-TH-Abl fusion construct in which the PH-TH module of Btk is fused to the SH2-kinase module of c-Abl.

The autophosphorylation rate of the PH-TH-Abl mutant in the presence of IP<sub>6</sub> was much lower than that of the IP<sub>6</sub>-bound wild-type protein, further evidence for the importance of the Saraste dimer interface in IP<sub>6</sub>-mediated activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p><p>The Btk and c-Abl kinase domains are 46% identical in sequence, but most of the surface residues are different. We infer that, except for its enzymatic activity, the interaction properties of the Btk kinase domain are not important for the IP<sub>6</sub> response.

A simple calculation shows that even a modest increase in a small dimer population can lead to a sharp change in the rate of activation because the reaction is autocatalytic.

The peripheral binding site for IP<sub>6</sub> is adjacent to the β3-β4 hairpin that folds in and closes the dimer interface in the simulation.

One key finding is that the Src-like module of Btk adopts a compact and autoinhibited form that resembles the autoinhibited structures of the Src kinases and c-Abl, in which the SH3 domain binds to the SH2-kinase linker and holds the kinase domain in an inactive conformation. Our structure of the PH-TH-kinase construct of Btk shows that the PH-TH module stablizes the inactive conformation of the kinase domain, as well as the assembled conformation of the Src-like module of Btk.</p><p>A second, and quite unexpected, finding is that IP<sub>6</sub> can activate Btk strongly by binding to a newly identified site on the PH domain, probably by promoting transient dimerization of the PH-TH module. Because IP<sub>6</sub> synthesis requires the precursor molecule IP<sub>3</sub>, which is itself produced as a result of Btk activation, a transient elevation of IP<sub>6</sub> may create a positive feedback loop for Btk activation, either on the membrane or in the cytoplasm. Formation of the Saraste dimer interface is compatible with the simultaneous engagement of PIP<sub>3</sub> by both PH domains in the dimer, raising the possibility that IP<sub>6</sub> can stimulate dimerization of membrane-tethered Btk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). IP<sub>6</sub> binding to the peripheral binding site may also enhance PIP<sub>3</sub> affinity in the canonical binding site and sensitize Btk to PIP<sub>3</sub> levels. The linker connecting the PH-TH unit to the SH3 domain promotes dimerization of Btk by interacting with the SH3 domain of a second molecule, providing an additional mechanism for Btk dimerization at high local concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laederach et al., 2002</xref>). High levels of IP<sub>6</sub> may down-regulate the amount of Btk on membranes by competing for PIP<sub>3</sub> binding in the canonical binding site, as proposed for Akt1 regulation by IP<sub>7</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chakraborty et al., 2010</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06074.023</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Models of Btk autoinhibition and activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The PH-TH module stabilizes the assembled conformation of the Src-like module of Btk in its inactive conformation.

The regulation of tyrosine kinases by soluble second messengers has not received much attention in the past. Our discovery that IP<sub>6</sub> activates Btk, along with the known effect of IP<sub>4</sub> on Itk, points to the importance of further studies on these and soluble effectors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>Insect cell expression, purification, and characterization of mouse Btk</title><p>DNA for mouse Btk (residues 214 to 659; the Src-like module) was used to prepare baculovirus.

In all refinement runs in which the SH2 domain was present, an initial temperature factor was refined for the entire SH2 domain, and then the SH2 domain was fixed.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and two other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Qi Wang et al concerns a comprehensive biochemical analysis of the regulation of Btk (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) and its unexpected activation by IP<sub>6</sub>. Btk is of broad interest in immune signaling and as a drug target. This paper enlightens the community about several very interesting and important features regarding Btk regulation: 1) The kinase domain is held in an inhibited state by the SH2 and SH3 domains in a manner analogous to Src (and Abl);</p><p>2) Unique to Btk, its PH domain participates directly through the kinase N-lobe with the SH2 and SH3 domain to suppress the kinase domain;</p><p>3) Vesicle bound PIP<sub>3</sub> can activate Btk by inducing dimerization;</p><p>4) Soluble IP<sub>6</sub> can activate Btk by binding a non-canonical surface of the PH domain and promoting dimerization.</p><p>The comprehensive model of Btk regulation described in this manuscript derives from several high-resolution crystal structures, enzymologic analysis of autophosphorylation as well as peptide phosphorylation in the presence of various activators, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular dynamics simulations. The discovery of IP<sub>6</sub> regulation is perhaps the most special aspect of the manuscript and should generate substantial interest in the tyrosine kinase and pleckstrin homology domain fields. While the authors rightly cite Huang et al, <underline>Science (2007)</underline>,which reports that soluble IP<sub>4</sub> can activate ITK tyrosine kinase, our read of this study is that it minimally characterizes this putative activation, which in vitro was quite marginal. In summary, the current manuscript is an excellent fit for <italic>eLife</italic>. We ask the authors to consider the comments below.</p><p>There is no mention in the Introduction of the prior Btk structures reported. A search of the PDB reveals that there are over 30 structures of various Btk domains in active and inactive states. It would be helpful to the reader to briefly summarize the known Btk domain structures and include a statement indicating that although the structures of the individual Btk domains are established, the relationships between the kinase domain and the SH2, SH3 and PH-TH domains were not known prior to the current manuscript.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The role of IP<sub>6</sub> as a glue holding neighboring PH domains together is somewhat reminiscent of a related role for soluble IP<sub>4</sub>/6 in stabilizing HDAC/corepressor complexes (CJ Millard et al, Mol Cell 51, 57-67,2013). The authors may wish to compare the Btk and corepressor inositol phosphate-containing structures and comment on the relationship if appropriate.</p><p>We were unable to find the specific peptide sequence of the kinase substrate or its concentration in the Methods. While not absolutely essential, it would also be informative to know what the Km of the peptide is and whether this changes in different states of Btk activation. If there were Km differences among particular Btk conformational states, for example IP<sub>6</sub> rather than PIP<sub>3</sub> activation, this could give rise to different cellular signaling outputs.</p><p>In their full-length Btk model, the SH3 domain and the PH domain appear to make electrostaic interactions with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Do the authors predict that this surface is modulated by IP<sub>6</sub> or PIP<sub>3</sub> binding? Likewise, is there any reason to think that ligation of the SH3 domain by external ligands impacts this SH3/PH interaction?</p><p>Although the authors show that PIP<sub>3</sub>-derived IP<sub>4</sub> binds more tightly to the Btk PH domain than IP<sub>6</sub> (Kd of 30 nM vs. 250 nM), it is interesting to consider that high concentrations (&gt;20 µM) of soluble IP<sub>6</sub> could conceivably compete Btk off of the PIP<sub>3</sub> containing membrane. Thus, one way to consider the importance of the Btk allosteric binding site for IP<sub>6</sub> is that it is needed to prevent down-regulation by competition of IP<sub>6</sub> for PIP<sub>3</sub> at the PIP<sub>3</sub> binding site. If true, Btk membrane binding may be an overstated facet of its regulation, as the authors also suggest. It will be fascinating in future studies to investigate selective mutants in vivo to dissect the relative contributions of PIP<sub>3</sub> and IP<sub>6</sub> in signaling.</p><p>Alternatively, just as IP<sub>6</sub> might stimulate dimerization of membrane-tethered Btk, as suggested in the Conclusions, might it not also enhance the affinity (avidity) of Btk for PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing membranes by promoting dimerization? This would have the effect of 'sensitizing' Btk to PIP<sub>3</sub> levels, and could be important. Such an effect of IP<sub>6</sub> (or IP<sub>7</sub> or IP<sub>8</sub>) could also/alternatively counteract inhibition of PH domain function by competition at the canonical site (as suggested by Chakraborty et al for Akt: Cell 143, 897). It might thus selectively 'spare' Btk from such inhibition?</p><p>In the beginning of the Results and Discussion section, the authors describe the difference in the angles for the kinase SH3 domain with respect to other kinases and they explain the differences in orientation of the SH2 and SH3 domains, saying: “Coupling between the SH3 and SH2 domains may therefore be somewhat different in these kinases.” Although this may be true, it is also possible that there is not a fixed orientation in solution between the different domains and the differences reflect different arrangements captured by the crystals. The authors also say that: ”diffuse electron density for the SH2 shows that this part of the polypeptide chain occupies a range of positions and adopts multiple conformations“. This statement seems to support such an idea.</p><p>Also in the Results and Discussion section, the authors say that: “… nearly identical to those determined previously using NMR”. They should include RMSD for the C-alphas that were aligned.</p><p>This sentence, in the same section of the text: “The domain swap occurs in the same location within the SH2 domain as a similar swap seen in a Grb2 SH2-domain crystal structure.” From the drawing this similarity is not so apparent. They use the same helix against the same beta sheet, but the orientation of the two monomers appears different. In Grb2 the helices are essentially parallel to the beta-sheet whereas in Btk, these helices seem to be perpendicular.</p><p>The authors say that it is unlikely “that a domain-swapped dimer” is physically important. That being the case, the authors may wish to consider reducing the overall discussion about domain swapping.</p><p>In the Results and Discussion, it says that “r.m.s. deviation from c-Src is 2.3 Å for the 24 α-carbons”. This seems to be a rather large deviation for so few carbons.</p><p>In that same section of the article, the authors call an Arg-Phe interaction an “amino-aromatic interaction”. Is this actually amino (cation)-aromatic pair, or is it a π-type (Pi-type) interaction between the guadinium of the Arg and the aromatic ring of the Phe?</p><p>In the subsection “Structure of a PH-TH-kinase construct of Btk”, it says: “The PH-TH module contacts the kinase N-lobe. The interface differs from the one found in Akt1”. Is this because they are intrinsically different or because of the deletion of the SH2 and SH3 domains? Some comment on this could be helpful.</p><p>Subsection headed “A structural model for full-length Btk”: it is not very clear what the cause is, but the deviations between the crystallographic structures and the ones at the end of the trajectories appear to be large. It is not very clear what these trajectories were probing and what the implications are for their having departed so significantly from the original structures?</p><p>The manuscript says, in the “Activation of Btk by IP<sub>6</sub> in solution” section: “but these required higher protein concentration and longer times for appreciable autophosphylation than did IP<sub>6</sub>IP6.” Looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> the Coomassie-blue for some of the IP<sub>5</sub> doesn't show higher protein concentration.</p><p>Subsection headed “The canonical lipid-binding pocket of the PH-TH module is not critical for IP<sub>6</sub>-mediated Btk activation”: when the authors note that R28C/N24E abolishes IP<sub>4</sub> binding and weakens IP<sub>6</sub> binding by 20-40-fold using ITC, they appear to conclude that the residual binding is solely due to the separate IP<sub>6</sub> site. Is it possible that the double mutant still allows for IP<sub>6</sub> binding to the IP<sub>4</sub> site? Perhaps the authors can clarify this section a bit more.</p><p>Subsection headed “Structure of the IP<sub>6</sub>-bound PH-TH module”: it is not said, although one can assume, that the dimers are two-fold symmetric. If that is the case it is not very clear whether or not the open-ended chain is a consequence of the crystal lattice rather than being biologically relevant. Therefore, the binding site that is formed by two molecules in the context of the open-ended chain of dimers may not be present in solution. The authors appear to imply that the IP<sub>6</sub> interaction site is mostly determined by one of the chains. If that were the case and IP<sub>6</sub> binds to that site even in the absence of the dimer-formed open-ended chain, then shouldn't one have observed a more complex stoichiometry in the ITC experiments (which shows an n∼1)? More explanation here could be helpful.</p><p>The section on IP<sub>6</sub> regulation is fairly lengthy given the degree of speculation. The authors could consider condensing this.</p><p>In the beginning of the Results and Discussion, it could be helpful to include a short introduction indicating which structures were determined as part of this work, to what resolution, and a reference to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>It would be interesting to know whether the orientation of the IP<sub>6</sub> in the peripheral site is well defined or not.

We don’t think that IP<sub>6</sub> or PIP<sub>3</sub> binding will directly disassemble the inactive conformation of Btk, because both binding sites are located distal to the interface between the PH-TH module and the Src-like module. We have clarified this by marking both binding sites in our cartoon illustrations in all figures and have added corresponding sentences in the Results section.

The relatively large deviation arises from the pivoting motions of the molecule during molecule dynamic simulations, and the use of only the C lobe of the kinase to align these structures, which amplified the deviations. The overall conformation of Btk at the end of the trajectories is actually very similar to the initial structure. We have now explained this in the Result section, and state that the rms deviation between the initial and final structures is only 2.3 Å when the alignment is done on the entire Src-like module.</p><p><italic>The manuscript says, in the “Activation of Btk by IP</italic><sub><italic>6</italic></sub> <italic>in solution” section: “but these required higher protein concentration and longer times for appreciable autophosphylation than did IP</italic><sub><italic>6</italic></sub><italic>.” Looking at</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref> <italic>the Coomassie-blue for some of the IP</italic><sub><italic>5</italic></sub> <italic>doesn't show higher protein concentration</italic>.</p><p>Perhaps the confusion here arises because the results of two different experiments (two different gels) are shown in Panel 5B. The top gel in this panel has lower protein concentration (2 μM Btk), shorter reaction time (5 minutes) and shorter exposure time. The bottom gel has higher Btk concentration (4 μM Btk), longer reaction time (10 minutes) and the gel has been exposed for a longer time.

We make two assumptions in this scheme: first, that IP<sub>6</sub> binding increases the on-rate of dimer formation of Btk by a factor of 10, and that once Btk is phosphorylated, the catalytic rate constant for transautophosphorylation increases by a factor of 10. Using physically reasonable values for the on and off rates and the catalytic rates we show that a small increase in on-rate for Btk dimer formation leads to a dramatic increase in the rate of autophosphorylation, even though the concentration of Btk is two orders of magnitude below the value of the dissociation constant. We think that this simple calculation helps explain an observation that might otherwise be counter-intuitive to some readers, which is that IP<sub>6</sub> can activate Btk at Btk concentrations that are well below the dissociation constant for dimerization. Text referring to this new figure is in the last paragraph of “Fusing the Btk PH-TH module to the catalytic module of c-Abl promotes autophosphorylation of c-Abl in the prescence of IP<sub>6</sub>”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
