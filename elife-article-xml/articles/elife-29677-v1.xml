pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29677.001</object-id><p>Local regulation of synaptic efficacy is thought to be important for proper networking of neurons and memory formation. Dysregulation of global translation influences long-term memory in mice, but the relevance of the regulation specific for local translation by RNA granules remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate roles of RNG105/caprin1 in long-term memory formation. RNG105 deletion in mice impaired synaptic strength and structural plasticity in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, RNG105-deficient mice displayed unprecedentedly severe defects in long-term memory formation in spatial and contextual learning tasks. Genome-wide profiling of mRNA distribution in the hippocampus revealed an underlying mechanism: RNG105 deficiency impaired the asymmetric somato-dendritic localization of mRNAs. Particularly, RNG105 deficiency reduced the dendritic localization of mRNAs encoding regulators of AMPAR surface expression, which was consistent with attenuated homeostatic AMPAR scaling in dendrites and reduced synaptic strength. Thus, RNG105 has an essential role, as a key regulator of dendritic mRNA localization, in long-term memory formation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29677.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Messages pass from one nerve cell to the next across gaps called synapses. The first neuron releases chemical signals from the end of its long, thin nerve fiber. The second receives the message at receptors on branching structures known as dendrites. Each connection has a corresponding bump called a dendritic spine. As animals learn, these can grow larger, strengthening the connection. This is the basis of how memories form.</p><p>To strengthen a synapse, the cell must transport the materials to the dendritic spine. The cell makes copies of the genetic instructions to strengthen the synapse in the form of messenger RNA (often shortened to mRNA). But, this happens in the body of the cell, a long way from the dendrites themselves. The mRNA travels from the cell body to the dendrites in collections of molecules referred to as ‘RNA granules’.</p><p>One of the key components of the RNA granule system is a protein called RNG105/caprin1. Now, Nakayama, Ohashi et al. have engineered mice to delete the gene for RNG105/caprin1, revealing its effect on memory. Mice lacking RNG105/caprin1 struggled to make long-term memories. Unlike their normal counterparts, these mutant mice did not become accustomed to new environments or objects. They also found it more challenging to learn the position of a hidden platform in a water-based maze. Lastly, over time, the mutant mice forgot to be fearful of a dark chamber where they had received a small electric shock.</p><p>Memories form in a part of the brain called the hippocampus and the dendritic spines in this region were smaller in mice lacking RNG105/caprin1. Furthermore, when the nerve cells from this part of the brain were grown in Petri dishes, they did not respond normally to stimulation. The dendritic spines of normal cells increased in size, but those on the cells lacking RNG105/caprin1 got smaller compared to normal cells.</p><p>A closer look revealed that the distribution of mRNA in brain cells from mice lacking RNG105/caprin1 differed from that of normal mice. Some pieces of genetic information failed to make it from the cell body to the dendrites. This included mRNA involved in making regulators of a component of dendritic spines called the AMPA receptor. The AMPA receptor detects the chemical messenger, glutamate, and is crucial for memory formation.</p><p>These findings further our understanding of long-term memory and open the way for future research into human disease. Mutations in RNA granule components, including RNG105/caprin1, have links to conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Further investigation could reveal new targets for drug treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA granule</kwd><kwd>mRNA localization</kwd><kwd>long-term memory</kwd><kwd>RNG105/caprin1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas (Molecular Brain Science)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakimura</surname><given-names>Kenji</given-names></name><name><surname>Shiina</surname><given-names>Nobuyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI Grant Number 16K07361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shiina</surname><given-names>Nobuyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI Grant Number 16J07985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohashi</surname><given-names>Rie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shiina</surname><given-names>Nobuyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Daiko Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shiina</surname><given-names>Nobuyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Toyoaki Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shiina</surname><given-names>Nobuyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The formation of long-term memory in mice requires an element of RNA granules that localizes messenger RNAs to dendrites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The formation of long-term memory, but not short-term memory, requires protein translation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bramham and Wells, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2009</xref>). Gene knockout and administration of drugs for global translational regulators influence, that is, enhance or impair, long-term memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2009</xref>).

This local translation is involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and functions, and mediated by dendritic mRNA transport by ‘RNA granules’, membrane-less macromolecular assemblies of mRNAs, ribosomes, and RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiebler and Bassell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kedersha et al., 2013</xref>). Some components of RNA granules have been reported to be associated with brain functions in disease, for example, fragile X mental retardation by FMRP deficiency and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with aggregation of FUS/TLS and TDP-43 in RNA granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lenzken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Santos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2013</xref>). However, little influence on long-term memory formation of knockout in mice for RNA granule components, for example, FMRP, CPEB, Staufen1, Pumilio-2, and G3BP1, has left inconclusive the primary question whether regulation of local translation is required for long-term memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Consortium TD-BFX, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger-Sweeney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vessey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siemen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>RNA granule protein 105 (RNG105, also known as caprin1) is a major RNA-binding protein in RNA granules. RNG105 promotes the assembly of RNA granules and is responsible for the transport of its binding mRNAs in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shiina et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kedersha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shiina et al., 2010</xref>). Knockdown and knockout (KO) of RNG105 in cultured neurons causes a reduction in the synaptic connections on dendrites and the density of neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shiina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010</xref>).

These studies suggested the involvement of RNG105 in higher-order brain functions. However, RNG105 homozygous KO mice are neonatally lethal because of respiratory failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shiina et al., 2010</xref>), which has hampered the analysis of the physiological impact of severe RNG105 deficiency on learning and memory in adult mice.</p><p>Here, we generated RNG105 conditional deletion mice using the Cre/loxP system. The conditional deletion mice (<italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup>) were viable, and subjected to in vivo analyses of synaptic function, behavioral tests for learning and memory, and genome-wide profiling of somato-dendritic localization of mRNAs in the hippocampus. The results demonstrated that RNG105 was an essential element of RNA granules for establishing long-term memory, and suggested RNG105-mediated dendritic localization of mRNAs as an underlying mechanism for AMPA receptor (AMPAR) scaling, synaptic strength and plasticity, and long-term memory formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of RNG105 conditional deletion mice</title><p>To investigate physiological functions of RNG105 in adult mice, we generated RNG105 conditional deletion mice by crossing floxed <italic>Rng105</italic> mice and <italic>Camk2a-Cre</italic> transgenic mice for gene deletion in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>).

Major categories of D-mRNAs were ‘regulation of Arf protein signal transduction’, which included GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) of small G protein ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf), and ‘structural constituent of ribosomes’ which included ribosomal subunit proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4A,B</xref>).

By contrast, GluR2 surface expression in dendrites was not much reduced by RNG105 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B,D</xref>), which could be due to the increase in <italic>Gria2</italic> mRNA localization to dendrites by RNG105 deficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5A</xref>) and/or different surface expression pathways of a fraction of GluR2 from that of GluR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka and Hirano, 2012</xref>).</p><p>We further conducted biotin labeling of cell surface proteins of cultured neurons followed by immunoblot measurement for GluR1 and GluR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The upper band, but not the lower band, bound to avidin agarose beads, indicating that the upper band was biotin-labeled and mobility-shifted surface GluR1/2, whereas the lower band was non-labeled intracellular GluR1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A−C</xref>). Because the upper band was also detected in control lysates without biotinylation, the band was considered to contain a non-specific protein(s) as well as biotinylated GluR1/2.</p><p>The most obvious difference between TTX/APV-treated and untreated neurons was the less amount of the lower GluR1 band in TTX/APV-treated neurons from <italic>Rng105</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, but not from <italic>Rng105</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, which suggested that TTX/APV treatment reduced intracellular GluR1 in <italic>Rng105</italic><sup>+/+</sup> neurons, but not in <italic>Rng105</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Then we quantified the intensity of the lower band in the cell lysate and the upper band in the avidin agarose-bound fraction, and calculated the ratio of surface to intracellular GluR1 and GluR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). The ratio of surface/intracellular GluR1 was increased in TTX/APV-treated neurons compared to untreated neurons from <italic>Rng105</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice. Compared to <italic>Rng105</italic><sup>+/+</sup> neurons, the ratio of surface/intracellular GluR1 was lower and was not significantly increased by TTX/APV treatment in <italic>Rng105</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

This weaker band intensity in <italic>Rng105</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons made it difficult to identify differences in the surface/intracellular ratio between the genotypes at a glance, but when twice the volume of samples from <italic>Rng105</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons was loaded on gels, the difference in the surface/intracellular ratio between the genotypes was obvious: the intensity of the lower GluR1 bands was higher, whereas that of the upper GluR1 bands was lower, in <italic>Rng105</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons than in <italic>Rng105</italic><sup>+/+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>, bottom panel). As for GluR2, although statistical significance was not detected, the surface/intracellular ratio of GluR2 tended to be increased by TTX/APV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These results were consistent with the results of the immunofluorescence imaging of GluR1 and GluR2. Taken together, these results indicated that RNG105 impacts on homeostatic scaling of AMPARs in dendrites, which is coupled to basal synaptic function and also influences synaptic strength in activated state.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Translation in neurons is required for long-term memory formation, but the relevance of the regulation of mRNA transport and local translation to long-term memory formation has remained unclear. This study demonstrated essential roles of an RNA granule protein RNG105 in the regulation of synaptic strength, structural plasticity of spines, and long-term memory formation. The loss of synaptic strength and long-term memory in <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice was likely attributed to reduced dendritic localization of mRNAs, which included mRNAs for various regulators of AMPAR surface expression and retention to postsynapses. Consistently, AMPAR homeostatic scaling in dendrites was impaired by RNG105 deficiency, which was related to the decreased setting level of fEPSP amplitude in the steady state. The decreased setting level of fEPSP may reduce excitatory transmission in neurons even after LTP induction, because of unchanged (not upregulated) LTP efficiency in RNG105-deficient mice, which will impair long-term memory formation. Together, this study revealed physiological roles of RNG105 in mice, and suggested cellular mechanisms linking RNA granule functions with long-term memory formation.</p><p>Studies on learning and memory in KO mice of other RNA granule components, for example, FMRP, Pumilio2, CPEB1, Staufen1, G3BP1, and GLD-2 have been reported. However, these KO mice did not show apparent influence on long-term memory formation in the Morris water maze or contextual fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Consortium TD-BFX, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger-Sweeney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vessey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siemen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mansur et al., 2016</xref>). Although KO mice of Ataxin-2, another RNA granule component, showed impaired contextual fear conditioning, their long-term memory in the Morris water maze was normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huynh et al., 2009</xref>). These studies have left unanswered whether RNA granules are involved in long-term memory formation. Compared with these KO mice, RNG105 conditional deletion mice displayed remarkable impairment of long-term memory formation. The different phenotypes between RNG105 conditional deletion mice and the other KO mice of RNA granule components may be attributed to the existence and non-existence of alternative factors. Pumilio1 and 2, Staufen1 and 2, and G3BP1 and 2 are paralogs, and the paralog proteins have redundant functions and target an overlapping set of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kedde et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galgano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park and Maquat, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsuki et al., 2013</xref>). CPEB1 has three paralogs, CPEB2−4, which are not functionally redundant with CPEB1 because they do not bind to the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) sequence. However, mRNA polyadenylation by CPEB1 may be redundant with other polyadenylation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Villalba et al., 2011</xref>). FMRP (FMR1) has two paralogs, FXR1 and FXR2. FMR1 and FXR2 function cooperatively and the phenotype of single KO of each gene in mice was less severe than that of double KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). These studies suggest that KO of single genes could be compensated by alternative factors and/or not completely impair the cooperative activity of the factors involved.</p><p>Another explanation for the different phenotypes between RNG105 conditional deletion mice and the other KO mice may be that the RNA granule components other than RNG105 are not essential for long-term memory formation. However, this is not unlikely because, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mutants of FMRP, Staufen, Pumilio, CPEB1 (Orb), GLD-2 (Wispy), Ataxin-2 (Atx2), and DDX6 (Me31B) have been reported to show defects in long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolduc et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubnau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kwak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sudhakaran et al., 2014</xref>). The long-term memory deficits in <italic>Drosophila</italic> may be because alternative paralogs of these RNA granule components do not exist in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In addition, because family proteins are less in <italic>Drosophila</italic> than in mice in general, proteins encoded by target mRNAs of RNA granule components could have less alternative family proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> than in mice. Thus, mutations in single genes could lead to severer defects in long-term memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>In contrast to the RNA granule components described above, RNG105 may not have alternatives. Although RNG105 (caprin1) has a paralog, RNG140 (caprin2), in mice, RNG105 and RNG140 are localized to different kinds of RNA granules, and knockdown phenotypes of RNG105 and RNG140 in cultured neurons were not compensated by each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010</xref>). In addition, because RNG105 targets (affects the localization of) more than a thousand mRNAs, the probability may be large that mRNAs encoding long-term memory-related factors and their alternative factors are simultaneously affected by RNG105 deficiency. Thus, RNG105 deficiency may have large impact on the function of RNA granules and therefore the formation of long-term memory.</p><p>This study applied for the first time the technique of the somato-dendritic mRNA identification with RNA-seq to mutant animals. The RNA-seq revealed that the loss of RNG105 reduced the asymmetric somato-dendritic localization of mRNAs in vivo. Furthermore, the RNA-seq identified multiple mRNAs whose dendritic localization was reduced by RNG105 deficiency, which included mRNAs encoding regulators of the cell surface expression and postsynaptic retention of AMPARs, for example, Arf regulator mRNAs. In addition, the identified mRNAs included those encoding Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase subunit isoforms and K<sup>+</sup> channel subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5B</xref>), which was consistent with the previous in vitro study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shiina et al., 2010</xref>). Proteins encoded by these mRNAs are involved in the control of membrane potential, and thereby may be associated with fEPSP amplitude and epileptic-like EPSP. Furthermore, the identified mRNAs included those encoding regulators of Ras, Rho, and the PI3 kinase and Rac pathway proteins, involved in actin reorganization and spine formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nishiyama and Yasuda, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sala and Segal, 2014</xref>), which may be associated with the impaired structural plasticity of spines in RNG105-deficient mice. mRNAs for ribosomal subunit proteins were the major dendritic mRNAs and also reported in the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cajigas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ainsley et al., 2014</xref>). However, whether locally translated ribosomal proteins are involved in ribosome biogenesis or in other biological processes, which could be associated with RNG105-deficient phenotypes, remains elusive. Thus, RNG105-dependent dendritic mRNAs included various mRNAs whose encoded proteins are involved in AMPAR localization, membrane potential control, and actin reorganization. Even if the reduction of each mRNA in dendrites could have a small influence on synaptic functions, integration of the reduction of these mRNAs could have a large impact on it.</p><p>RNG105 deficiency reduced homeostatic scaling of AMPARs and steady-state fEPSP, and also spine structural plasticity and fEPSP amplitude after LTP induction. These lines of evidence indicate that RNG105 is critical for synaptic functions both in the homeostatic phase and during LTP, which is consistent with the involvement of translational regulation in both the processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nishiyama and Yasuda, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cajigas et al., 2010</xref>). Although fEPSP amplitude after LTP induction was small, LTP appeared intact in <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice. This could be because translation may not be inhibited although the material (mRNA) is reduced in the dendrites of <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice, which enables the delivery of locally synthesized proteins, even if at a low level, to synapses in the late phase of LTP. Another, though not mutually exclusive, explanation is that translation deficiency may not necessarily cause the decline of LTP in the late phase, but limit the absolute amplitude of EPSP to a certain level in the late phase of LTP. The mechanism of the EPSP limitation is likely coupled with spine size reduction because spine size is tightly correlated with AMPAR expression level in the spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kopec et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsuzaki et al., 2001</xref>). If EPSP amplitude is above the limit in the early-phase LTP, EPSP will decline in the late phase, whereas if EPSP amplitude is already low in the early phase, EPSP will be retained in the late phase. In <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice, translation deficiency and spine size reduction in dendrites could limit the absolute amplitude of EPSP. However, because the basal EPSP amplitude of <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice is low, EPSP amplitude after LTP induction could not reach the limit level even if LTP occurs normally. As a result, LTP may appear to be sustained in the late phase, but because of the low absolute amplitude of EPSP, long-term memory may be affected. A similar phenotype to <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice, that is, long-term memory deficits with low steady-state EPSP and intact LTP, has been reported in other mice such as aged mice, prion-infected mice, chronic stressed mice, and Rett syndrome model (MeCP2-null) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke and Barnes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mallucci et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kallarackal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dani and Nelson, 2009</xref>). In these mice, similarly to <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice, impaired long-term memory formation may be attributed to reduced excitatory transmission in neurons.</p><p>There are increasing number of evidence that RNA granules are associated with mental disorder and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the primary question whether RNA granules are required for the formation of long-term memory has been unclear. This study demonstrated that an element of RNA granules, RNG105/caprin1, was required for long-term memory formation, and dendritic localization of mRNAs as an underlying mechanism for AMPAR-dependent synaptic strength and long-term-memory formation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal care, experiments and behavioral testing procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institutes of Natural Sciences, and performed in accordance with the guidelines from the National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Niigata University and the Science Council of Japan.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generation of RNG105 conditional deletion mice</title><p>To generate a <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked (floxed) <italic>Rng105</italic> construct, we isolated the <italic>Rng105/caprin1</italic> gene by PCR from a genomic DNA library of C57BL/6 mice.

Transverse 400 µm thickness hippocampal slices were prepared using a vibratome RPO7 (D.S.K, Kyoto, Japan) and high-sucrose cutting solution (the formulations of all solutions are described below), and maintained in ACSF at room temperature for at least 2 hr. A bipolar stimulation electrode was placed in the CA1 SR region to stimulate CA3 Schaffer collateral fibers. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded using a capillary glass electrode (Harvard Apparatus, Massachusetts, MA, USA) filled with ACSF placed in the CA1 SR after a 0.05 Hz test pulse generated by a pulse generator Master-8 (A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel) equipped with an isolator ISO-Flex (A.M.P.I.). For LTP recording and theta-burst stimulation, 50% maximum stimulus intensity was used. LTP was induced by theta-burst stimulation (Four trains with 10 s intervals between trains; each train had five bursts separated by 200 ms and included four pulses delivered at 100 Hz).

The open field test was conducted in a round apparatus (85 cm in diameter with a 40 cm wall) with concentric circles and radial lines drawn on the floor, which divided the floor into 25 blocks. A mouse, naive to the apparatus, was placed in the center of the field and allowed to explore for 5 min. The total number of line crossings was recorded as an index of exploratory activity.

A mouse was automatically monitored using a SCANET system (Melquest). The mouse was placed into the light chamber, and 5 s later, the door was opened. The mouse was allowed to move freely between the two chambers for 5 min. Distance traveled, time spent in each chamber, and the number of transition between the chambers were measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Novel object recognition test</title><p>To habituate to the test environment, mice were placed in a chamber (43 × 43 × 29.5 cm) and allowed to explore freely for 1.5 hr on four consecutive days.

First, the mouse was subjected to visible platform test. In this test, a black platform (6 cm in diameter) was placed 0.5 cm above the water surface. A mouse was placed in the pool and the escape latency to the platform was measured. If the mouse found the platform within a 1 min time limit, the mouse was allowed to stay on the platform for 30 s. If not, the mouse was guided to the platform before staying on the platform for 30 s. Mice were given six trials per day for five consecutive days. The location of the platform and the start position were changed randomly in each trial.</p><p>Next, the mice were subjected to a hidden platform test, in which a clear platform (6 cm in diameter) was placed 1 cm below the water surface. The water was clouded with non-toxic white paint (Sakura Color Products, Osaka, Japan). Spatial cues (four different plane figures) were attached on the interior wall of the tank above the water surface. The test was conducted in the same way as in the visible platform test with a 2 min time limit. The start position was changed randomly, but the location of the platform was fixed. The mice were given six trials per day for 10 consecutive days.</p><p>One day after the last trial of the hidden platform task, the mice were subjected to a probe test. The platform was removed from the pool and the swimming path of the mouse was tracked for 1 min using a computer-based video tracking system ANY-Maze (Stoeling, Wood Dale, IL, USA).

One day before the training day, to habituate to the test environment, the mouse was allowed to freely explore both chambers for 30 min with the door opened. On the training day, the mouse was placed in the light chamber and allowed to freely explore the chambers for 15 min after the door opened, and the time spent in the dark chamber during the first 5 min was measured (Pre-FS). After that, when the mouse entered the dark chamber, the door was closed and foot shock (0.5 mA, 1 s duration, 4 times with 1 min intervals) was delivered. After the foot shock, the mouse was returned to its home cage. The mouse was replaced in the light chamber at 5 min, 1 day, and 1 week after the foot shock and allowed to freely explore the chambers for 5 min after the door opened, and the time spent in the dark chamber was measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Contextual fear conditioning test (context freezing)</title><p>A mouse was placed in a test chamber (15 × 15 × 15 cm, the dark chamber of LDK-M with the door closed) and allowed to explore freely for 30 s.

Coronal sections (500 µm thick) were sliced in ice-cold sterile PBS using the vibratome VT1200S, and transferred into ice-cold sterile PBS. Brain slices were stained with 1 µg/mL DAPI for 10 min at 4°C. Stratum pyramidale (SP) and stratum radiatum (SR) in the hippocampal CA1 region were microdissected manually using glass capillaries (G-1, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) with the use of a stereomicroscope. Glass capillaries were made using a needle puller (model PB-7, Narishige). The borders between the stratum oriens (SO) and SP, and between the SP and SR were cut to isolate the SP, and the border between SP and SR, and between SR and stratum lacnosum-moleculare (SLM) were cut to isolate the SR. To avoid contamination of SR with the soma of pyramidal neurons, the isolated SR was checked to confirm it did not contain a high-density DAPI-positive nucleic layer (SP) with the use of an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX83, Olympus) with a 40 × objective lens. To obtain sufficient amount of RNA for RNA-seq, left and right hippocampi from three mice were dissected and collected into one sample tube. Triplicate samples were prepared for RNA-seq analysis.

After being stored on ice for 5 min, the sample was centrifuged for 15 min (21,900 × g, 4°C), and about 240 µL of the aqueous phase containing RNA was collected in a new tube. The sample was centrifuged for 15 min (21,900 × g, 4°C) again and the aqueous phase was collected into a new tube. To remove phenol and chloroform from the sample, 240 µL diethyl ether was added to the sample and vortexed for 1 min. After the sample was centrifuged for 1 min (21,900 × g, 4°C), the upper phase was removed. This diethyl ether treatment was performed three times. Then, 25 µL 3 M sodium acetate and 250 µL 2-propanol were added to the sample and mixed, and then RNA was precipitated on ice for 30 min. After the sample was centrifuged for 15 min (21,900 × g, 4°C), the supernatant was removed.

Then, 25 µL phenol-chloroform mixture was added, and the sample was vortexed for 30 s. After the sample was centrifuged for 10 min (21,900 × g, 4°C), upper phase was collected. Phenol and chloroform were removed from the sample by diethyl ether treatment as described above. Then, 2.5 µL 3 M sodium acetate and 62.5 µL 100% ethanol were added to the sample and mixed, and then RNA was precipitated at −20°C for 30 min. After the sample was centrifuged for 20 min (21,900 × g, 4°C), the supernatant was removed. The RNA precipitate was washed with 150 µL 70% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in 10 µL RNase-free water.

After the neurons were washed in Neurobasal-A medium, they were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 25°C. Fixed neurons were blocked for 30 min in 10% FCS in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich), and incubated with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit and mouse IgG antibodies (1:400, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 10% FCS in DMEM for 3 hr at 25°C to label cell surface GluR1 and GluR2. After neurons were washed in PBS, they were fixed again and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min.

Because GluR1 and GluR2 were detected in a punctate manner, they were quantified by counting the number and measuring the fluorescence intensity of the puncta in dendrites. To count the number of GluR1 and GluR2 puncta, the images were converted into binary images by selecting dendritic regions and using the MaxEntropy threshold algorithm in ImageJ software. The number of GluR1 and GluR2 puncta in dendrites was counted using the magic wand tool and analysis tool in Adobe Photoshop software. To count total GluR1 and GluR2 puncta, the binary images of before and after permeabilization were merged and used. To measure the fluorescence intensity of GluR1 and GluR2 puncta in dendrites, the binary image and original image were layered in Adobe Photoshop software. ROIs were selected in the binary layer using the magic wand tool, and fluorescence intensity in the ROIs in the original layer was calculated by multiplying mean pixel intensity by area of the ROIs. The sum of fluorescence intensity was normalized by dendrite length and by the intensity of GluR1 and GluR2 in the soma. GluR1 and GluR2 intensity in the soma was calculated using the layered images by multiplying mean pixel intensity by area of ROIs in the soma and normalized by the area of the soma.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Mani Ramaswami, also served as the Reviewing Editor. The evaluation was overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors create and analyze mouse mutants deficient in the RNG105/ Caprin1 protein, which has previously been shown to be a shared component of stress granules and neuronal RNA granules. The work examines the histological, electrophysiological, and cognitive impact of the selective perturbation of RNG105 gene from the forebrain. The study uses cell culture, ex vivo slice preparations, and in vivo murine behavioral studies to approach the experimental questions of the study. Because RNG105 is involved in mRNA transport, the study concludes with a comprehensive characterization of mRNA identification in somato-dendritic compartments. To do this, the authors isolated mRNAs from stratum pyramidale (SP) and stratum radiatum (SR) and then performed RNA-Seq analysis on the isolated mRNAs. These molecular analyses constitute the clearest and most exciting features of this study, providing direct and compelling evidence that RNG105-mediates the intracellular localization specific cohorts of mRNA.</p><p>Additional arguments and observations link this function of Caprin1 to long-term memory (LTM). Loss of RNG105 also results in significant changes to dendritic spine formation, reduced excitatory synaptic transmission, and robust LTM deficits. The authors also observe that in their final experiment that activity regulated AMPA receptor trafficking is specifically perturbed in the Caprin1 mutant mouse.</p><p>Overall the study is interesting, providing data potentially linking Caprin1 function to mRNA transport and providing evidence for a causal role of such transport in neural plasticity and LTM. However, the analysis and discussion of several experiments and issues would benefit from increased depth and rigor. Several issues need to be addressed before it is ready for publication.</p><p>1) The conditional allele is not a null. Thus, it should not be referred to as a conditional KO mouse, but rather as conditional exon 5-6 deletion. This is not only a didactic point, but also one that should be explicitly acknowledged in the interpretation of the data. This is also significant because heterozygous nulls can have phenotypes – so perhaps a homozygous weak allele mimics the heterozygous null? It would be useful if the authors briefly explained why they did not create a conditional null (a complete ORF deletion) in the first place.</p><p>2) The text should mention what the presumed function may be of the protein-synthesis dependent dendritic volume expansion observed after 15 minutes of stimulation? It is important to explain how and whether this may relate to memory formation, particularly if this process is not required for normal late-LTP.</p><p>3) The electrophysiological results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> have some problematic interpretations.</p><p>First, the Results section states that no PPD phenotype for KO was observed yet, significant results are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> (which appear substantiated by both the traces in 4C and the data in 4D). Can the authors please clarify this?</p><p>Second, it is difficult compare LTP across preparations where input/output (I/O) differ. Because the KO mice have ~50% reduction in response and LTP is a direct function of the input, the authors need to correct for differences in I/O comparing LTP across genotypes.</p><p>There is no description provided here of the input strength (% of max fEPSP) used for tetanic brain stimulation (TBS). Typically, the stimulus is delivered at 30-50% of the maximum fEPSP for each genotype, it is unclear what was used here. The graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> shows comparable LTP induction post-TBS between WT and KO. There is some text in the last paragraph of the subsection “RNG105 cKO reduces synaptic responses to stimulation” that seems to address the confound here but, it is unclear how the data was processed to arrive at the graph seen in 4F. Does the Y-axis label &quot;% of baseline&quot; refer to the percent of genotype baseline? If so, then this is not ideal because the input/output responses from KO slices is reduced. The convention is to show% of baseline control, which in this case is the WT littermate. This should be clarified because it is very likely that the KO mice do exhibit LTP abnormalities that are masked by this non-standard analysis. Theta burst is a very strong LTM-inducing protocol so these experiments could be masking differences that may be observed with weaker LTP-inducing protocols. If an alternative conclusion is reached, then it could resolve the somewhat confusing dichotomy between observations on late LTP (normal) and &quot;long-term memory,&quot; (defective) in RNG105 mutants.</p><p>4) There are some caveats to the interpretation of behavioral and memory tests that should be addressed.</p><p>a) The finding that motor learning is normal in RNG105 mutants is consistent with the finding that conditional excision of exon-5 and 6 is less efficient in the cerebellum. But it is equally consistent with the idea that RNG105 is simply not required for this form of learning and memory. This should be acknowledged.</p><p>b) The finding that RNG105 mutants show defects in habituation to their environments is interesting.

Some discussion to this point would be helpful. Also, there are several papers analysing functions of other granule proteins (e.g. Gld-2, Atx2, Staufen, Pumilio, DDX6/Me31B) on long-term memory that are not cited or discussed, in particular from <italic>Drosophila</italic> work.</p><p>10) FMRP mutants in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have been reported to have specific defects in long-term memory.

Thus, it should not be referred to as a conditional KO mouse, but rather as conditional exon 5-6 deletion. This is not only a didactic point, but also one that should be explicitly acknowledged in the interpretation of the data. This is also significant because heterozygous nulls can have phenotypes – so perhaps a homozygous weak allele mimics the heterozygous null? It would be useful if the authors briefly explained why they did not create a conditional null (a complete ORF deletion) in the first place.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. RNG105 cKO mice have been referred to as <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice in the revised manuscript. In addition, &quot;knockout&quot; has been changed to &quot;deletion&quot;. It is technically impossible to produce a recombinant clone deleting all coding exons, just with a one-time homologous recombination, when the length between two loxPs is too long. To generate RNG105/caprin1 conditional deletion mice, we deleted exons 5−6 alone. However, we consider this deletion would be sufficient to produce cKO mice because of the following reasons. In <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice, frame shift occurs in the exon 5−6-deleted mRNA, which will produce truncated RNG105 protein lacking most of the functional domains ranging from the N-terminal coiled-coil domain to the C-terminal RG-rich domain (a.a. 123−707) (Shiina et al., 2005). In addition, this kind of mRNAs harboring nonsense mutation become unstable and degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), resulting in hardly any production of truncated peptide. In fact, in the hippocampus where Cre was highly expressed, expression of all <italic>Rng105</italic> exon transcripts was reduced to the comparable level to that of exon 5−6 transcripts as judged by RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, a polyclonal anti-RNG105 antibody, which recognized truncated RNG105 protein encoded by exons 1−4, did not detect any truncated form of RNG105 in the cerebrum of <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We have added these new supplement data and descriptions in the text (subsection “Generation of RNG105 conditional deletion mice”, first and last paragraphs). These results supported the notion that <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice are cKO mice. Consequently, <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> was not a weak allele, as shown in the behavioral analyses: <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice showed much severer deficits in spatial memory than RNG105 heterozygous null mice which showed normal spatial memory except for reversal learning (Ohashi et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The text should mention what the presumed function may be of the protein-synthesis dependent dendritic volume expansion observed after 15 minutes of stimulation? It is important to explain how and whether this may relate to memory formation, particularly if this process is not required for normal late-LTP.</p></disp-quote><p>Dendritic spine volume is tightly correlated with AMPAR expression level and EPSC in the spine (Kopec et al., J. Neurosci., 2007; Matsuzaki et al., Nat. Neurosci., 2001). In addition, spine volume expansion is dependent on translation. Therefore, spine volume expansion is believed to be associated with translation-dependent late-phase LTP and long-term memory formation. However, in the present study, we observed normal late-phase LTP without spine volume expansion. From these results, we have modified the accepted notion and proposed a hypothesis that spine volume expansion may increase the limit of absolute amplitude of EPSP. This hypothesis is described in the following paragraph: &quot;Another, though not mutually exclusive, explanation is that translation deficiency may not necessarily cause the decline of LTP in the late phase, but limit the absolute amplitude of EPSP to a certain level in the late phase of LTP.

Typically, the stimulus is delivered at 30-50% of the maximum fEPSP for each genotype, it is unclear what was used here. The graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> shows comparable LTP induction post-TBS between WT and KO. There is some text in the last paragraph of the subsection “RNG105 cKO reduces synaptic responses to stimulation” that seems to address the confound here but, it is unclear how the data was processed to arrive at the graph seen in 4F. Does the Y-axis label &quot;% of baseline&quot; refer to the percent of genotype baseline? If so, then this is not ideal because the input/output responses from KO slices is reduced. The convention is to show% of baseline control, which in this case is the WT littermate. This should be clarified because it is very likely that the KO mice do exhibit LTP abnormalities that are masked by this non-standard analysis. Theta burst is a very strong LTM-inducing protocol so these experiments could be masking differences that may be observed with weaker LTP-inducing protocols. If an alternative conclusion is reached, then it could resolve the somewhat confusing dichotomy between observations on late LTP (normal) and &quot;long-term memory,&quot; (defective) in RNG105 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this comment. The input strength was 50% maximum of fEPSP, and we have added the sentence &quot;For LTP recording and theta-burst stimulation, 50% maximum stimulus intensity was used&quot; in Materials and methods. In the initial manuscript, &quot;% of baseline&quot; referred to the percent of each genotype baseline. We believe this is a standard method to compare the extent of synaptic plasticity of genotypes, because of measuring the change in the synaptic efficiency after theta-burst stimulation from the baseline of 50% stimulation of functional synapses in each genotype. However, we agree with the reviewers' comments that it is ideal to rescale the Y-axis for <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice in order to show the difference in synaptic transmission between the genotypes. As described above, the baseline fEPSP slope for <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice was set at 45.1% of that for <italic>Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>.

We consider this type of LTP abnormality, i.e., reduced amplitude and slope of EPSP with normal LTP efficiency and normal late-phase LTP, may be a cause of long-term memory deficits, as also reported in other mice (Discussion, sixth paragraph). Please also refer to our answer to the comment 2 in which we proposed a hypothesis of how this type of LTP abnormality is associated with translation deficiency, spine volume reduction, and impaired long-term memory formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are some caveats to the interpretation of behavioral and memory tests that should be addressed.</p><p>a) The finding that motor learning is normal in RNG105 mutants is consistent with the finding that conditional excision of exon-5 and 6 is less efficient in the cerebellum.

We have analyzed the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> using two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The ANOVA analysis indicated that the activity of <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice was greater than that of the other genotypes, but this was because of greater activity of <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice in the trial 3 (p = 8.17E-4, one-way ANOVA, cf.

Taking into account of the statistical significance in the interaction between genotypes and trials, the relative greater activity of <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice than the other genotypes in the trial 3 was not because of their intrinsic activity, but because repeated trials influenced differently on the activity between <italic>Camk2a-Cre;Rng105</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice and the other genotype mice.

We have deleted this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors correctly identify a major departure from their findings from similar studies that also examined RNA constituents but did not find major impairments in LTM. However, the authors do not attempt to speculate on why this might be. This is especially important because some of these previous studies examine RNA granule components such as Ataxin-2 that have actually been shown to be required to RNA granule formation. Some discussion to this point would be helpful. Also, there are several papers analysing functions of other granule proteins (e.g. Gld-2, Atx2, Staufen, Pumilio, DDX6/Me31B) on long-term memory that are not cited or discussed, in particular from Drosophila work.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this comment. We have mentioned knockout mice for GLD-2 and Ataxin-2 in the revised manuscript (Discussion, second paragraph). Although a previous report demonstrated that knockdown of Ataxin-2 in cultured cells markedly reduced the number and size of RNA (stress) granules (Nonhoff et al., Mol. Biol. Cell, 2006), a recent report demonstrated that knockdown of Ataxin-2 in cultured cells only delayed the maturation of stress granules (Becker et al., Nature, 2017). Therefore, we have not discussed about the requirement of Ataxin-2 and RNA granule formation in the revised manuscript. We have cited and discussed the effects of mutations of RNA granule components in mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic> as follows:</p><p>&quot;The different phenotypes between RNG105 conditional deletion mice and the other KO mice of RNA granule components may be attributed to the existence and non-existence of alternative factors. […] Thus, RNG105 deficiency may have large impact on the function of RNA granules and therefore the formation of long-term memory&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) FMRP mutants in Drosophila have been reported to have specific defects in long-term memory. Could the different observation in mammals be due to the existence of alternative isoforms? How many isoforms of RNG105 and G3BP exist in rodents and how much could or do their functions overlap in vivo? This issue should be broadly considered in the Discussion as moderating caveat to the mutant analysis described.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this comment. As the reviewer suggested, we consider the different effects of RNA granule mutants on long-term memory between mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic> may be attributed to the existence and non-existence of alternative isoforms and/or cooperative activity of the isoforms. We have added discussion about the effects of mutants of RNA granule components possessing and not possessing alternative factors on long-term memory in mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic> as described above in the answer to the comment 9.</p><p>Mice have two RNG/caprin isoforms (RNG105/caprin1 and RNG140/caprin2) and two G3BP isoforms (G3BP1 and G3BP2). G3BP1 and G3BP2 appear to have redundant functions because stress granule formation in double knockdown cells was much more impaired than in single knockdown cells (Matsuki et al., Genes Cells, 2013). In contrast, RNG105 and RNG140 may not functionally overlap, because they are localized to different kinds of RNA granules, and knockdown phenotypes of RNG105 and RNG140 in cultured neurons were not compensated by each other (Shiina and Tokunaga, J. Biol. Chem., 2010). We consider this difference in the existence of alternative factors may underlie the difference in long-term memory formation. Again, please refer to our reply to the comment 9.</p></body></sub-article></article>
