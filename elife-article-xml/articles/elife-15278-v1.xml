How the brain computes these transformations is currently unclear. We investigated three key areas of the macaque cortical grasping circuit with microelectrode arrays and found cooperative but anatomically separated visual and motor processes. The parietal area AIP operated primarily in a visual mode. Its neuronal population revealed a specialization for shape processing, even for abstract geometries, and processed object features ultimately important for grasping. Premotor area F5 acted as a hub that shared the visual coding of AIP only temporarily and switched to highly dominant motor signals towards movement planning and execution. We visualize these non-discrete premotor signals that drive the primary motor cortex M1 to reflect the movement of the grasping hand. Our results reveal visual and motor features encoded in the grasping circuit and their communication to achieve transformation for grasping.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15278.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15278.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15278.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In order to grasp and manipulate objects, our brains have to transform information about an object (such as its size, shape and position) into commands about movement that are sent to our hands. Previous work suggests that in primates (including humans and monkeys), this transformation is coordinated in three key brain areas: the parietal cortex, the premotor cortex and the motor cortex. But exactly how these transformations are computed is still not clear.</p><p>Schaffelhofer and Scherberger attempted to find out how this transformation happens by recording the electrical activity from different brain areas as monkeys reached out to grasp different objects. The specific brain areas studied were the anterior intraparietal (AIP) area of the parietal cortex, a part of the premotor cortex known as F5, and the region of the motor cortex that controls hand movements. The exact movement made by the monkeys’ hands was also recorded.</p><p>Analysing the recorded brain activity revealed that the three brain regions worked together to transform information about an object into commands for the hand, although each region also had its own specific, separate role in this process. Neurons in the AIP area of the parietal cortex mostly dealt with visual information about the object. These neurons specialized in processing information about the shape of an object, including information that was ultimately important for grasping it. In contrast, the premotor area F5 represented visual information about the object only briefly, quickly switching to representing information about the upcoming movement as it was planned and carried out. Finally, the neurons in the primary motor cortex were only active during the actual hand movement, and their activity strongly reflected the action of hand as it grasped the object.</p><p>Overall, the results presented by Schaffelhofer and Scherberger suggest that grasping movements are generated from visual information about the object via AIP and F5 neurons communicating with each other. The strong links between the premotor and motor cortex also suggest that a common network related to movement executes and refines the prepared plan of movement. Further investigations are now needed to reveal how such networks process the information they receive.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15278.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15278.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>parietal cortex</kwd><kwd>premotor cortex</kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor transformation</kwd><kwd>parallel recording</kwd><kwd>hand grasping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaffelhofer</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHE 1575/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherberger</surname><given-names>Hansjörg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BCCN-II, 01GQ1005C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherberger</surname><given-names>Hansjörg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-611687 (NEBIAS)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherberger</surname><given-names>Hansjörg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cortical grasping circuit separates but shares visual and motor processes to transform object attributes into appropriate hand movements.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Grasping objects of different shapes and sizes appears trivial in daily life. We can distinguish between thousands of objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biederman, 1987</xref>) and shape our hands according to their geometry in order to hold and manipulate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Napier, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smeets and Brenner, 1999</xref>). Although such operations seem to be effortless, their underlying neuronal mechanisms are highly complex and require extensive computational resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>). The cortical grasping network needs to translate high-dimensional visual information of an object into multidimensional motor signals that control the complex biomechanics of the hand.</p><p>In the primate brain, these processes are linked to the anterior intraparietal (AIP), the ventral premotor (F5), and the primary motor cortex (M1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brochier and Umilta, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castiello, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davare et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nelissen and Vanduffel, 2011</xref>). Within this network, AIP provides access to the dorsal visual stream that processes vision for action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Culham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodale et al., 1994</xref>). In fact, neurons in AIP were shown to strongly respond to the presentation of graspable objects or 3D contours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taira et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Theys et al., 2012b</xref>), but could also encode specific grip types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baumann et al., 2009</xref>). This grasp-relevant information processed in AIP is exchanged with F5 via dense reciprocal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerbella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luppino et al., 1999</xref>). Accordingly, deactivation of AIP or F5 causes severe deficits in pre-shaping the hand while approaching an object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fogassi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallese et al., 1994</xref>). In contrast to AIP, concurrent electrophysiological studies suggest that F5 is primarily encoding objects in motor terms and is storing context-specific grip type information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fluet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Raos et al., 2006</xref>). Connections of the dorsal subdivision of F5 (F5p) to the spinal cord and to M1 provide further evidence for the important role of F5 for grasp movement preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dum and Strick, 2005</xref>).</p><p>These electrophysiological and anatomical observations lead to our current understanding of the fronto-parietal network as the main circuitry for translating object attributes into motor commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeannerod et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</xref>). In detail, it has been suggested that visual features extracted in AIP activate motor prototypes in F5, which store hand configurations according to an object’s geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</xref>). However, the detailed neural mechanisms of these processes remained unclear.</p><p>To create a deeper understanding of how visual information is transformed into motor commands, a precise identification and differentiation of visual and motor processes within the grasping network is required. Previous important grasping studies classified visual-dominant, visual-motor or motor-dominant neurons primarily on the phase of their activation [for AIP see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murata et al. (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakata et al. (1995)</xref>, for F5 see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Raos et al. (2006)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Theys et al. (2012a)</xref>], but they could not discriminate between neural coding of visual features of objects or motor features of the hand.</p><p>A differentiation between visual and motor coding is challenging for multiple reasons. First, the fronto-parietal network is multimodal and can reflect sensory and motor signals simultaneously. Second, visual and motor descriptions of objects and the hand are multidimensional due to the complexity of object geometry and hand physiology. Investigations at the neural level therefore necessitate multidimensional observations from many neurons. Third, the visual and motor spaces are highly linked to each other since the form of an object often defines the shape of the grasping hand. Disassociating both neuronal representations therefore requires highly variable visual stimuli and motor responses.</p><p>In this study, we took a multidimensional approach to identify and separate visual and motor processes in the grasping network of AIP, F5, and M1. We recorded large populations of neurons simultaneously from the entire network and compared their modulation patters to the visual attributes of highly diverse objects and the kinematic features recorded from the grasping hand. Our data revealed distinct roles of the grasping network in translating visual object attributes (AIP) into planning (F5) and execution signals (M1) and allowed visualizing the propagation of these features for grasping.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Two macaque monkeys grasped a large set of 49 objects causing highly variable visual stimuli and motor responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) performed on these distance measures confirmed the findings of the CDA and revealed a clear clustering according to object shape during visual presentation of the object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) that widely persisted during movement execution, although with significantly shorter neural distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). 100% and 91% of the objects shared their cluster with other objects of the same shape during the cue and grasp epoch, respectively. Importantly, consistent results were observed in both monkeys when performing HCA across all recording sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>, see Materials and methods).</p><p>The large number of objects presented in one recording session required separating the 48 objects on different turntables (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), often objects of similar shape. This separation created small offsets already in the fixation epoch, but at very low modulations. An extreme case is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>. This might raise concerns on whether coding in AIP was really due to object shape, or rather to the object presentation order (different turntables presented sequentially). However, shape-wise clustering in AIP cannot be explained by the task design for the following reasons: (1) The offsets in the fixation epoch were very small in comparison to the visual modulations observed in AIP when the objects were presented (e.g., see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). (2) The set of 'mixed' objects – presented and grasped in the same block – clustered with other objects of the same shape (e.g. ring in mixed block clusters with other ring objects). Together, this demonstrates clear shape processing in AIP.</p><p>The AIP population also encoded the size of objects, but differentiated this geometrical feature at clearly lower neural modulations compared to object shape. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref> and supplements, the majority of objects were located closest to objects of similar size, but with significantly shorter neural distances in comparison to shape features. The secondary role of size was surprising, since object size has significant influence on the aperture of the grasping hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jakobson and Goodale, 1991</xref>).</p><p>To further test the specialisation for shape processing, we tested a mixed set of objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), causing highly variable visual stimuli and motor responses, against an abstract object set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) that we have specifically designed to cause different visual stimuli but the same grip. In theory, a purely visual area should differentiate both sets of shapes, since they both provide different visual stimuli. In contrast, an exclusive motor area should not show modulations for the abstract objects because they require the same grip. Strikingly, the AIP population responded highly similar to the presentation (cue epoch) of mixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) and abstract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>) objects (t-test, p&gt;0.05; 35% vs. 35% and 20% vs. 17% comparing mixed and abstract objects in monkey Z and M, respectively). Thus, the equal responses to both object sets strongly supports the specialisation of AIP in processing object shapes.</p><p>Importantly, AIP remained the most tuned area when the monkeys planned and grasped the abstract objects, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>. However, the number of significantly tuned cells decreased during these epochs in comparison to the responses evoked by the mixed objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This reduced selectivity could indicate either motor or visual transformations that are both required for grasping: First, the abstract objects were grasped with the same hand configuration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Unmodulated activity could therefore reflect the same motor affordance across the six abstract objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</xref>). Second, the abstract objects have different shapes, but have the graspable handle in common that shares the same geometrical dimensions across all six objects (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). A uniform modulation could therefore also represent visual processes that reduce the objects to its parts relevant for grasping (i.e. the same geometries of the handle across the six abstract objects). Considering that the same AIP population separated the complete object set primarily on their geometrical features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>) would suggest visual rather than motor transformations explaining uniform modulations.</p><p>We found further indicators for this hypothesis when focusing on objects that caused, in contrast to the abstract objects, equal visual stimuli but different motor responses. To create such a scenario, monkeys were trained to perform power or precision grips on the same object, the handle (condition 00 and 01). Although both conditions were located most distantly in the kinematic or joint-angle (J-) space in both monkeys (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>), they were located closest to each other in the N-space of AIP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>), clearly implying a visual representation of the handle. Statistical analysis revealed, however, that both conditions (00, 01) slightly increased their neural distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) towards planning and movement execution, as expressed by an average of 21% and 16% of significantly tuned AIP neurons in monkey Z and M (ANOVA tested in grasp epoch, p&lt;0.01). These observations suggest a visual representation of the handle and a further differentiation of its parts that are relevant for grasping.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15278.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Motor planning and execution in F5.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Example neuron of F5, responding to all 50 task conditions (colour code as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

The F5 population was strongly activated in the motor epochs when the mixed objects were grasped differently (up to 47% and 45% tuned neurons in monkey Z and M resp., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), and it was strikingly unmodulated when the abstract objects were grasped similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Likewise, the M1 population responded uniformly for similar grips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), but it was modulated very strongly when different hand configurations were applied (up to 67% and 61% in monkey Z an M resp, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p>During movement planning, M1 showed no or minimal preparation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>), whereas F5 revealed a multimodal role: in the cue epoch, the tuned F5 population substantially decreased from 28% to 18% in monkey Z, and from 13% to 4% in monkey M, when comparing abstract with mixed objects. This is in strong contrast to AIP, which demonstrated equal population responses for both type of object sets. The reduced F5 modulation suggests early motor processes starting shortly after object presentation. However, 18% and 4% (Monkey Z and M resp.) of all F5 neurons remained their modulation when the monkeys observed the abstract geometries. Thus, at least some F5 cells coded objects in purely visual terms.</p><p>It is notable, that we found significantly different contributions in motor preparation between the F5 recording sites. The visual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–f</xref>) and visuomotor modulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–c</xref>) prior to movement primarily originated from the ventral recording array, corresponding to the F5a subdivision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerbella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Theys et al., 2012a</xref>). In fact, 76% of the visual (abstract objects) and 72% of visuomotor tuned neurons (mixed objects) recorded from F5 were detected on the ventral site (ANOVA p&lt;0.01, all sessions, tested in cue epoch), in line with previously reported enhanced decoding capabilities of planning signals from ventral F5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schaffelhofer et al., 2015a</xref>).

Neurons were modulated by hand grasping actions and typically showed the strongest MD during motor execution.

Dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, CDA) were performed to express the high dimensional kinematic (J-space) and neural space (N-space) in a low dimensional fashion.

In accordance with the low-dimensional representation, abstract forms, small objects, as well as the big rings and cylinders created individual clusters in the J-space and were located close to each other. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, these motor characteristics were rudimentarily marked in F5 already during motor preparation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, coloured boxes). These clusters that emerged during motor planning persisted to a large extent during motor execution, but increased their relative distance to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), in line with the higher MD of single F5 neurons during grasp execution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). HCA performed on the averaged population response across all recording sessions (see Materials and methods) confirmed in both animals the motor characteristics of simultaneously recorded populations in single sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>).</p><p>As discussed above, premotor preparation activity primarily originated from the ventral F5 array. Thus, the modulations observed prior to movement execution, such as observed in the CDA and hierarchical clustering, are mainly based on the ventral recording site. In contrast, both arrays significantly supported movement execution. The different modalities in both recording sites are in line with the architectonically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belmalih et al., 2009</xref>) and connectionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerbella et al., 2011</xref>) distinct subdivisions F5a and F5p, which largely correspond to the ventral and dorsal recording array, respectively. Distinct connections of F5a with SII, AIP and other subdivision of F5 (but not to M1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerbella et al., 2011</xref>) suggest an integration of visual, motor and context specific information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Theys et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, connections of F5p to the hand area of M1 and to the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borra et al., 2010</xref>) suggest a rather direct contribution to hand movement control. Taken together, the multimodal preparation signals, including visual and motor contribution, and the distinct motor feature coding towards planning and execution, supports the key role of F5 for visuomotor transformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Feature coding in area M1</title><p>In agreement with the general population response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), single neurons of M1 were almost exclusively modulated during movement execution and showed minimal modulations during preparatory epochs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Umilta et al., 2007</xref>), as also indicated by the example neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–b</xref>.

In accordance with the previous analysis, M1 demonstrated the highest similarity to the J-space (averaged value across 10 recording sessions for monkey M: 0.48, for monkey Z: 0.59), followed by F5 (monkey M: 0.61; monkey Z: 0.65) and AIP (monkey M: 0.75; monkey Z: 0.75).

We show that the cortical grasping network differentiates visual from motor processes to achieve this transformation. Area AIP revealed a strong visual role and a specialisation for processing object shapes.

The encoded motor features of F5 showed striking similarities with M1 thereby suggesting a strong collaboration of both areas during hand and movement control.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Recording sites and relation to anatomical connections</title><p>We targeted the cortical grasping circuit with FMAs implanted under anatomical considerations. AIP, an end-stage area of the dorsal visual stream, receives input from parietal visual areas (e.g., LIP, CIP, and V6a) as well as from the inferior temporal cortex (e.g., areas TEa and TEm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>). AIP further connects to pre-motor F5 via dense reciprocal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerbella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luppino et al., 1999</xref>). In agreement with these known connections, we observed strong visuomotor responses in AIP and F5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Another significant connection links F5 with the hand area of M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dum and Strick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kraskov et al., 2011</xref>). As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rathelot and Strick (2009)</xref>, neurons of M1, in particular in the bank of the central sulcus, form direct connections to <bold>α</bold>-motor neurons in the spinal cord that drive the distal hand muscles. In line with these observations, the majority of M1-neurons demonstrated significant modulations during hand movement control despite highly constant reaching components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Together, strong grasp modulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and their intercommunication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) confirmed the correct positioning of the electrode arrays and the importance of all areas for visuomotor processing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Visual processing for grasping</title><p>While it is known that area AIP and F5 strongly respond to the presentation of objects and to the variation of their dimensions (e.g. shape, orientation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baumann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murata et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taira et al., 1990</xref>) it was unclear whether these modulations reflect visual or motor processes. For example, responses to object presentation can either reflect object attributes or instant motor representations as we have shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murata et al., 1997</xref>). By design, our task created associations as well as dissociations between objects and their afforded hand configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>) in order to disentangle these normally highly linked parameters.</p><p>The AIP population demonstrated a distinct visual separation of objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3e</xref>), which was largely unrelated to the observed motor characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>), even when grasping in complete darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The predominant criterion for object separation was object shape, even for abstract geometries that required the same grip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–f</xref>). These findings are in agreement with anatomical connections of AIP to the inferior temporal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borra et al., 2008</xref>) that codes perceived shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Logothetis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanaka, 1996</xref>). Object size was expressed in the population but played, surprisingly, only a secondary role in AIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These smaller neural distances with respect to size are remarkable, in particular since this feature is highly relevant for controlling hand aperture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jakobson and Goodale, 1991</xref>). A possible explanation for this effect could be the higher computational effort (more neurons) required for processing shape in comparison to size.</p><p>AIP also widely maintained its coding for visual object properties during movement execution in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), although with significantly smaller neural distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>). We hypothesize that AIP serves as working memory and not only extracts, but also maintains visual object information required for motor planning and execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</xref>). We emphasize that visual coding at the population level does not preclude motor coding of some individual cells, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murata et al., 1997</xref>). Rather, the evidence of bidirectional connections to F5 suggests that subpopulations exist in AIP that reflect feedback of motor signals.</p><p>Despite AIP’s primary visual coding, we observed a distinctive coding in the N-space when the same objects were grasped differently (e.g., handle and cylinders in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref>). These modulations could reflect either motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fagg and Arbib, 1998</xref>) or visual transformations required for grasping. In fact, when grasping an object, both processes are required: the visual selection of (focus on) object parts and the selection of a corresponding hand configuration. Several indicators in our data suggest visual rather than motor transformations in AIP: First, the population separated the entire set of objects in visual terms, but differentiated same objects when grasped differently. Second, the separation of the same object when grasped differently, originated from one object shape cluster. In line with these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baumann et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrated that AIP planning activity depends on the previous visual knowledge of an object (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in their paper). Presenting an object (the same handle as we used) caused a strong visual activation in the AIP population that got separated when a grip type (precision or power grip) was instructed subsequently. In contrast, instructing the grip type before object presentation did not lead to a substantial population response and caused significant modulations only after the object was presented. These differentiation schemes support our hypothesis of visual rather than motor transformations in AIP.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Motor planning and execution</title><p>Grasping requires the transformation of visual descriptions of an object into adequate motor commands.

Due to the large number of objects tested, we could demonstrate for the first time that the F5 population does not reflect stereotypical grip types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</xref>), but represents a continuum of many hand configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), highly similar to M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, motor characteristics in the N-Space of F5 could be observed not only in motor execution epochs, but also during motor preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5b</xref>). In contrast to AIP, the F5 population showed already in the cue epoch a reduced tuning for abstract objects requiring the same grip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 3d–e</xref>). This suggests a rapid appearance of grip features in F5 shortly after object presentation. However, F5 also contained a small subgroup of neurons that represented pure visual information during the cue epoch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The vast majority of these cells have been recorded from the ventral array, i.e., they originate from the F5a subdivision. In line, electrophysiological investigations of area F5a demonstrated selectivity for 3D shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Theys et al., 2012a</xref>). We suggest that these neurons receive direct visual input from AIP and might be crucially involved in the activation of stored motor plans. Similar modulation patterns in AIP and F5 during object presentation suggest the communication of visual properties to premotor cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). The presence of multimodal signals as well as the proximity of specialized sub areas for visual input and motor output suggest a central role of F5 for visuomotor transformation.</p><p>In contrast to F5, the hand area of primary motor cortex (M1) showed an almost exclusive role for motor execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saleh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Umilta et al., 2007</xref>).

Objects were of different shapes and sizes including <italic>rings</italic> (diameter of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 mm), <italic>cubes</italic> (length of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 mm), <italic>spheres</italic> (diameter of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 mm), <italic>horizontal cylinders</italic> (diameter of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 mm, equal length), <italic>vertical cylinders</italic> (diameter: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 mm, equal height), and <italic>bars</italic> (depth of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 mm, equal height and width). Furthermore, a <italic>mixed</italic> turntable held objects of different shapes of average size. Important for this study, a special turntable was holding objects of <italic>abstract forms</italic>, which differed largely visually but required identical hand configurations for grasping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Both monkeys were also trained to grasp a single object, a handle, either with a precision grip or a power grip. This extended our task by two more conditions (to a total of 50) that evoked similar visual, but different motor responses. In 20 recording sessions (10 per animal), each condition was repeated at least 10 times.</p><p>Precision and power grips applied on the handle as well as grasping and lifting the 3D-objects were detected with photoelectric barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schaffelhofer et al., 2015a</xref>). The turntable position was controlled with a step motor. Furthermore, the monkey’s eye position was monitored with an optical eye tracking system (model AA-EL-200; ISCAN Inc.). All behavioural and task-relevant parameters were controlled using a custom-written control software implemented in LabVIEW Realtime (National Instruments, Austin, TX).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Task paradigm</title><p>Monkeys were trained to grasp 49 objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) in a delayed grasp-and-hold task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). While sitting in the dark the monkeys could initiate a trial (self-paced) by placing their grasping hand (left hand in monkey Z, right hand in monkey M) onto a rest sensor that enabled a fixation LED close to the object. Looking at (fixating) this spot for a variable time (fixation epoch, duration: 500–800 ms) activated a spot light that illuminated the graspable object (cue epoch: 700 ms). After the light was turned off the monkeys had to withhold movement execution (planning epoch: 600–1000 ms) until the fixation LED blinked for 100 ms. After this, the monkeys released the rest sensor, reached for and grasped the object (movement epoch), and briefly lifted it up (hold epoch: 500 ms). The monkeys had to fixate the LED throughout the task (max. deviation: ~5 deg of visual angle). In trials where the handle was grasped, one of two additional LEDs was presented during the cue epoch, which indicated to perform either a precision grip (yellow LED) or a power grip (green LED). All correctly executed trials were rewarded with a liquid reward (juice) and monkeys could initiate the next trial after a short delay. Error trials were immediately aborted without reward and excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Kinematics recording</title><p>Finger, hand, and arm kinematics of the acting hand were tracked with an instrumented glove for small primates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,c</xref>). Seven magnetic sensor coils (model WAVE, Northern Digital) were placed onto the fingernails, the hand’s dorsum as well as the wrist to compute the centres of 18 individual joints in 3D space, including thumb, digits, wrist, elbow and shoulder. The method and its underlying computational model have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schaffelhofer and Scherberger, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Recorded joint trajectories were then used to drive a 3D-musculoskeletal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schaffelhofer et al., 2015b</xref>), which was adjusted to the specific anatomy of each monkey. The model was implemented in OpenSim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delp et al., 2007</xref>) and allowed extracting a total of 27 DOF [see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schaffelhofer et al. (2015b)</xref> for detailed list of DOF]. All extracted joint angles from the model were low-pass filtered (Kaiser window, finite impulse response filter, passband cutoff: 5–20 Hz), downsampled to 50 Hz and used to describe the hand configuration in a 27-dimensional joint space (J-space).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Single and multiunit activity was recorded simultaneously using floating microelectrode arrays (FMA, Microprobe Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA). In each monkey we recorded from in total 192 channels of 6 individual arrays implanted into the cortical areas AIP, F5, and M1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–g</xref>). In each array, the lengths of the electrodes increased towards the sulcus and ranged from 1.5 (1<sup>st</sup> row) to 7.1 mm (4<sup>th</sup> row). In area F5, one array was placed in the posterior bank of the inferior arcuate sulcus approximately targeting F5a (longer electrodes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Theys et al., 2012a</xref>) and approaching the F5 convexity (F5c; shorter electrodes). The second and more dorsally located array was positioned to target F5p. In AIP, the arrays were implanted into the end of the posterior intraparietal sulcus at the level of area PF and more dorsally at the level of area PFG. In M1, both arrays were placed into the hand area of M1 into the anterior bank of the central sulcus at the level of the spur of the arcuate sulcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rathelot and Strick, 2009</xref>). See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schaffelhofer et al. (2015a)</xref> for details on surgical procedures. Neural activity was recorded at full bandwidth with a sampling frequency of 24 kHz and a resolution of 16 bits (model: RZ2 Biosignal Processor; Tucker Davis Technologies, FL, USA). Neural data was synchronously stored to disk together with the behavioural and kinematic data. Raw recordings were filtered offline (bandpass cutoff: 0.3––7 kHz) before spikes were detected (threshold: 3.5x std) and extracted. Spike sorting was processed in two steps: First, we applied super-paramagnetic clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Quiroga et al., 2004</xref>) and then revised the results by visual inspection using Offline sorter (Plexon, TX, USA) to detect and remove neuronal drift and artefacts. No other pre-selection was applied and single and multiunit activity have been analysed together.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Firing rate and modulation depth</title><p>Firing rate plots were created in order to visualize the activity of example neurons across time. For this, spike rates were smoothed with a Gaussian Kernel (σ = 50 ms) over time and then averaged across trials of the same condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baumann et al., 2009</xref>). To illustrate the response of a specific condition we used the colour code as introduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>. Furthermore, we visualized the modulation depth (MD) of example neurons in specific epochs of interest. The MD between two conditions was defined as their absolute difference in average firing rate. This measure was computed for all possible pairs of conditions and visualized as a colour-map. In addition, we performed multi-comparison tests to check whether the differences in firing rate between conditions were significant (ANOVA, Tukey-Kramer criterion, p&lt;0.01; ≥10 trials/condition, ≥500 trials/session, Matlab functions: anova1, multcompare).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Sliding ANOVA population analysis</title><p>To investigate the population activity during the course of the trial, we tested for significant tuning at multiple time points t using a 1-way ANOVA. Similar to the visualization of firing rates, we first smoothed all spike trains with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 50 ms) and then performed a sliding ANOVA in time steps of 1 ms (p&lt;0.01; no multi-comparison correction, ≥10 trials/condition). Sliding ANOVA results were then averaged across all recording sessions to visualize results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Due to the variable length of the planning epoch, trials were first aligned to the cue-onset and then to the grasp-onset event. Abstract shapes were introduced at a later stage of the project (included in 12 recording sessions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), whereas all other conditions were tested in all 20 recording sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Please note: Irregular grips were detected in the J-space and excluded for the sliding ANOVA analysis of the abstract shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Only 17 trials in 12 recording sessions were excluded to guarantee equal hand configurations for statistical analysis.</p><p>To calculate the visual response times of an area of interest (i.e. AIP and F5) we measured the time between cue onset and 75% of the population’s peak activity. Response times were averaged across recording sessions for each animal and tested for significant differences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Dimensionality reduction</title><p>To compare and visualize the simultaneously recorded high-dimensional data (J- and N-space), we applied dimensionality reduction methods. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to express the data variability of the J-space in a compact, lower-dimensional fashion. This approach was demonstrated to be optimal for describing hand shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pesyna et al., 2011</xref>). As an input for PCA, we computed for each trial and DOF the mean joint angle during the hold epoch (in degrees). This let for each trial to a 27-dimensional joint position vector in J-space that robustly described the monkey’s average hand configuration during the hold epoch, and across all trials to an input matrix of dimension: trials x DOF.</p><p>For exploring the N-space (neuronal population space), we applied canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). Similar to PCA, CDA creates a new transform of the original dataset spanned by linear combinations of the original variables. Whereas PCA creates the new coordinate system in a way that maximizes the total variance, CDA transforms the data in order to maximize the separation of groups (here: task conditions). The first axis in the new transform (first canonical variable) therefore reflects the linear combination of original variables that show the most significant F-statistic in a one-way analysis of variance. The second canonical variable is orthogonal to the first one and has maximum separation within the remaining dimensions.</p><p>We performed CDA based on the population's mean firing rates of a specific task epoch of interest (e.g., grasp epoch) relative to baseline activity. This means, a population matrix consists of entries that correspond to the mean firing rate of individual neurons for all trials in a certain time interval (dimensions: trials x number of neurons). In contrast to other dimensionality reduction methods, CDA considers only variances of the signal related to conditional differences. Due to this advantage, noise or condition-irrelevant modulations get suppressed.</p><p>For a fair comparison, all dimensionality reduction results presented for the individual areas originated from the same recording session per monkey (e.g. AIP, F5 and M1 populations shown from monkey Z or M) and were therefore recorded simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Procrustes analysis</title><p>Procrustes analysis (PCRA) can be used to test similarities or differences between multidimensional datasets of different measures and scales. In the context of this study, PCRA was used to evaluate the resemblance between the J- and the N-space (firing rates). For this, we reduced both representations to their highest common dimension (i.e., 27 DOF of hand and arm) using the dimensionality reduction methods explained above (i.e., CDA for N-space). This produced datasets of identical number of trials (e.g., 600) and dimensions (e.g., 27). Then PCRA was used to translate and rotate the space of interest (e.g., N-space of M1, F5, or AIP) in a way that minimized the sum of squared distances (SSD) to the corresponding points in the reference space (e.g., J-space) (Matlab function: procrustes). The resulting transform was used to visualize and quantify the amount of similarity to the reference space (J-space). As a numerical measure of similarity, the sum of squared distances between the new transform and the reference frame was computed and normalized by the sum of squared distances between points of the reference space to their dimensional means (Matlab function: procrustes). This similarity measure is a non-negative number with values near 0 implying a high similarity between the multidimensional spaces and values approaching (or exceeding) 1 implying strong dissimilarity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>Hierarchical cluster analysis</title><p>To illustrate and compare the many conditions of our task in an untransformed, full-dimensional way, we performed hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). We first computed the Mahalanobis distances between the population activities (N-space) of all possible pairs of task conditions in an epoch of interest (Matlab function: manova1). This resulting distance matrix (e.g., for 50 x 50 conditions) was used to create an agglomerative hierarchical cluster tree based on the average linkage criterion (Matlab function: manovacluster), presenting the cluster solutions of an individual recording session as dendrograms (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref> for AIP of animal Z). Additionally, we averaged the Mahalanobis distance matrices of all individual session to build dendrograms expressing the N-space of an animal across all recording sessions (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for AIP of animal Z).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Feature code correlation</title><p>For correlating the dynamic feature communicated within the grasping network we (1) binned the spiking activity of each individual neuron (bin width = 10 ms), (2) smoothed the firing rates with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 300 ms) and (3) aligned the firing vectors to both cue and grasp onset. Within each of the resulting bins we then (4) computed the Euclidean distance between all possible pairs of trials in the N-space. This leads, separately for each area AIP, F5 and M1, to a distance matrix of the size <italic>m<sup>2</sup></italic>, where m is the number of trials that represents the neural population difference across different trials and trial conditions. Pairs of such matrices from AIP, F5, and M1 were then (5) correlated for every time bin (Spearman’s correlation coefficient), which led to a correlation function across time for each pair of areas (AIP-F5, AIP-M1, and F5-M1). This correlation function represents for every time in the task the similarity of the encoded features between both areas. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref> visualizes these distance matrices and the resulting correlation function over the time.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank M Sartori, M Dörge, K Menz, R Ahlert, N Nazarenus, and L Burchardt for assistance and MM Fabiszak, M Hepp-Reymond, and W Freiwald for helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Monkey handling also followed the recommendations of the Weatherall Report of good animal practice. Animals were pairhoused in a spacious cage (well exceeding legal requirements) and were maintained on a 12-hour on/off lighting schedule. Housing procedures included an environmental enrichment program with access to toys, swings, and hidden treats (e.g., seeds in sawdust). Monkeys had visual and auditory contact to other monkeys. They were fed on a diet of enriched biscuits and fruits. Daily access to fluids was controlled during training and experimental periods to promote behavioral motivation. All surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize post-surgical pain or suffering.

Simultaneous recordings in these areas from arrays of electrodes were performed. The animals were trained on an excellent grasping task that used a variety of 3D objects and dissociated the different parts of a grasping task into its component parts (e.g. visual, motor planning, motor action). In addition to the use of sophisticated behavioral and recording protocols, the authors also used a glove to quantitatively measure kinematic aspects of grasping movements. The complex data from multiple areas and recording channels as well as movement parameters were analyzed in sophisticated ways to permit novel insight into the transformation of visual signals in areas AIP and F5 to motor planning and action in F5 and M1. I'll leave the detailed critique to the expert reviewer. In focusing on a larger picture in this particular area, I found this paper outstanding in all respects.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) The main limit of this beautiful work is the assumption that area F5 is anatomo-functionally unitary. Recent literature not considered in this work shows that F5 is neither architectonically (Belmalih et al. 2009) nor connectionally (Gerbella et al. 2011) homogeneous: the ventral and anterior part of F5 (called F5a, where the most lateral arrays in the present study have been implanted), hosts 3D-shape-selective and &quot;visual-dominant&quot; neurons (Theys et al. 2012), commonly found also in AIP (Theys et al. 2013) but not in the dorsal part of F5 (i.e. F5p, see Bonini et al. 2014). Furthermore, while in the introduction the authors generally talk about &quot;connections of F5 to the spinal cord and M1&quot;, this is true virtually only for F5p (Borra et al. 2010). Considering altogether data recorded from different F5 subdivisions was acceptable in the authors' previous paper (Schaffelhofer et al. 2015, J Neurosci), as its goal was to decode hand configurations, but not here, where the authors want to elucidate the functioning of the cortical grasping network.</p><p>2) Strictly related to this issue, the electrodes length is unknown. From the authors' previous works (Schaffelhoefer et al. 2015a and Townsend et al. 2011) I infer that &quot;electrode length ranged from 1.5 to 7.1 mm&quot;, with the longest electrodes toward the sulcus. Thus, the more superficial electrodes of the lateral arrays certainly sampled F5c motor activity, likely related to mouth and hand movements, (see Graziano et al. 1997 and Maranesi et al. 2012), while the deepest electrodes most likely sampled F5p/a visuomotor activity. Please clarify.</p><p>3) &quot;Data have been analysed from 20 recording sessions (10 per animal)…&quot;. I don't understand how many (single and multi) units have been used for the analyses. It seems that a total of about 202 (units)*10 (sessions)=2020 and 355*10=3550 &quot;units&quot; have been considered in the two animals, respectively: with chronic recording this approach would certainly imply some resampling of the same &quot;units&quot; across sessions, increasing their number but reducing the variability of their discharge. At the same time, the authors stated in the Materials and methods section that &quot;all dimensionality reduction results presented for the individual areas originated from the same recording session per monkey&quot;, which actually sounds fair, but in contrast with the previous consideration. Please clarify.</p><p>4) I recommend using the same y-axis scales for plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 (b and d</xref>). Nevertheless, it is clear that the tuning profile of AIP does not change when abstract or mixed sets of objects are used (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and d</xref>): I totally understand the authors' reasoning, but they will acknowledge that all the abstract objects share an elongated shape, while those of the mixed set are much more variable. Thus, the lack of difference in the AIP tuning profile between the two sets is strange and should be better explained/discussed. For example, could it be due to receptive fields properties of AIP neurons (see Romero et al. 2014; Romero and Janssen 2016)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Altogether, I consider the work exceptional. The data make new and important contributions to understanding the cortical mechanisms underlying grasp control. By concurrently recording and characterising the relationships between limb kinematics and neural activity from AIP, F5, and M1 while monkeys viewed and grasped a wide range of objects, the scope of the current investigation is unparalleled in the current primate neurophysiological literature. Also outstanding are the beautiful data visualisation methods that the authors advance here.</p><p>I have a few suggestions, however, detailed below. My hope is that the authors will find these comments constructive.</p><p><italic>A) Main concerns:</italic></p><p>(A-1) The role of AIP</p><p>I'm having some difficulty understanding the authors’ stance on the role of AIP. I believe they are arguing that their data suggest that AIP is encoding object properties in visual terms, and not in motoric terms. They suggest that the results of their CDA show that AIP encodes objects according to shape in visual space, independent of the way they are grasped.</p><p>My interpretation of their stance is that AIP activity does not reflect action possibilities in sensorimotor terms – but rather reflects the 'flagging' of visual features relevant for actions, but NOT (yet) represented as spatiomotor plans.</p><p>If this is indeed their stance, I see this as a significant departure from prior conceptualizations (Jeannerod et al., 1995).</p><p>However, I remain confused about this argument, both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) conceptually, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) with respect to how some aspects of their data can be viewed as consistent these claims.</p><p>1) Conceptually. The authors talk about &quot;object affordances&quot; as different from &quot;motor affordances&quot;.</p><p>To me, affordances = action possibilities; they are sensory representations of the external environment that are inseparably linked to the motor apparatus and capabilities of the perceiving animal. In other words, affordances are, according to my understanding, inextricably motor.</p><p>What does it mean to &quot;extract object affordances relevant for grasping&quot;, but to not at the same time encode those same objects according to the spatiomotor properties required for their manual interaction?</p><p>They state: &quot;…suggest encoding of object affordances rather than motor affordances&quot;.</p><p>I urge the authors to better clarify what is meant by object vs. motor affordances.</p><p>2) Data. Some aspects of AIP data suggest encoding related to motoric features.</p><p>a) Shift for same object – big horizontal cylinders – when grasped from below vs. above.</p><p>b) Significant differentiation of conditions 00 vs. 01.</p><p>c) Motor similarity measures – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> – presumably a measure of.75 for AIP is different than a measure of &quot;1&quot; – and thus, does suggest some correspondence between N- and J-space encoding in AIP</p><p>d) Also, there interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> vs. d – &quot;…observed encoding of abstract objects in AIP can be explained exclusively by object shape.&quot;</p><p>Is it not possible that these data may reflect the fact that abstract versus mixed object set have more graspable parts – a greater number of possible actions –, and AIP encoding is sensitive to these differences?</p><p>This account could be considered consistent with the authors’ interpretations regarding the evidence for reduced tuning in AIP over time for abstract shapes: &quot;…reduction of 3D shapes to the relevant parts for grasping…&quot;.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>While the authors seem to argue for a strict separation in roles between AIP and F5 – visual vs. motor, respectively – I see the data as more likely evidence for a continuum – a graded difference – visual prevalence in AIP, with motor encoding vs. motoric prevalence in F5, with visual encoding.</p><p>I suggest that the authors clarify their stance, and/or temper their arguments.</p><p><italic>B) Intermediate concerns</italic></p><p>B-1) in the Introduction, the authors state that prior work did not dissociate between visual and motor features. At first, I thought this was inconsistent with the work of Sakata and colleagues – describing visual dominant, visuomotor, and motor dominant cell types. I think some discussion of this work upfront, including how the current approach critically differs, would be helpful.</p><p>B-2) Introduction – last paragraph – it isn't clear to me what the authors mean to say here, without first reading the rest of the paper. I think this section could be made clearer.</p><p>B-3) I'm not sure I understand their explanation of the shape-specificity prior to fixation. Please try to make this clearer.</p><p>B-4) At first I thought I missed something – it seemed as though AIP was not looked at in terms of J- and N-space encoding in the same way that F5 and M1 were. However, later it is clear that they did analyse AIP in the same way. Why not also show these data, as they do for F5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) and M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>)?</p><p>B-5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> – it is unclear to me why they plot J-space for the hold epoch and N-space for the grasp epoch; why not show results from the same epochs?</p><p>B-6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> – and the authors' discussion of the driving influence of F5 on M1 activity – how do these findings relate to (Umilta et al., 2007; Spinks et al., 2008)? I think these studies should be explicitly discussed.</p><p>Also, is it not surprising to find so little evidence for correspondence between AIP and F5 during planning?</p><p>How does the relationship between AIP and F5 that the authors suggest according to their new results compare with prior accounts – e.g. Jeannerod et al., 1995; Fagg and Arbib, 1998?</p><p>How do the authors interpret the increased AIP-M1 correspondence during grasp and hold?</p><p>B-7) What do the authors mean by the statement regarding M1 on p.26 &quot;…its neuronal population has never been studied explicitly&quot;? What about, for e.g., the work of Umilta et al., 2007; Spinks et al., 2008?</p><p>References:</p><p>Fagg AH, Arbib MA (1998) Modeling parietal-premotor interactions in primate control of grasping.

Recent literature not considered in this work shows that F5 is neither architectonically (Belmalih et al. 2009) nor connectionally (Gerbella et al. 2011) homogeneous: the ventral and anterior part of F5 (called F5a, where the most lateral arrays in the present study have been implanted), hosts 3D-shape-selective and &quot;visual-dominant&quot; neurons (Theys et al. 2012), commonly found also in AIP (Theys et al. 2013) but not in the dorsal part of F5 (i.e. F5p, see Bonini et al. 2014).

However, the technique has the disadvantage of static electrode positions (non-moveable). In other words, a large number of channels are required for acquiring a sufficient sample size of modulated neurons. Primarily for this reason, we have merged the recording sites within area F5 (F5p and F5a). However, we agree of course that F5 consists of specialized sub regions that we have now analyzed and visualized separately (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 c,f</xref>). Specifically, we mapped all identified visual and visuomotor neurons in each of the six electrode arrays. As expected, we found significant differences between the F5 subdivisions consistent with the current literature and your comments. In contrast to F5a, F5p did not (monkey M) or only minimally (monkey Z) contribute to movement planning, but instead was modulated during movement execution.</p><p>Beside the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,f</xref>, we changed the following parts of the manuscript:</p><p>Introduction, second paragraph:</p><p>“Connections of the dorsal subdivision of F5 (F5p) to the spinal cord and to M1 provide further evidence of the area’s important role in grasp movement preparation (Borra et al., 2010; Dum and Strick, 2005).“</p><p>Motor planning and execution, last paragraph:</p><p>“It is notable, that we found significantly different contributions in motor preparation between the F5 recording sites. The visual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e-f</xref>) and visuomotor modulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b-c</xref>) prior to movement primarily originated from the ventral recording array, corresponding to the F5a subdivision (Gerbella et al., 2011; Theys et al., 2012a). In fact, 76% of the visual (abstract objects) and 72% of visuomotor tuned neurons (mixed objects) recorded from F5 were detected on the ventral site (ANOVA p&lt;0.01, all sessions, tested in cue epoch), in line with previously reported enhanced decoding capabilities of planning signals from ventral F5 (Schaffelhofer et al., 2015a). In contrast, the dorsal F5 array, corresponding to F5p, mainly contributed during movement execution by a four-fold increase of its tuned population with respect to the cue epoch.”</p><p>Feature coding in area F5, last paragraph:</p><p>“As discussed above, premotor preparation activity primarily originated from the ventral F5 array. Thus, the modulations observed prior to movement execution, such as observed in the CDA and hierarchical clustering, mainly based on the ventral recording site. In contrast, both arrays significantly supported movement execution. The different modalities in both recording sites are in line with the architectonical (Belmalih et al., 2009) and connectionally (Borra et al., 2010; Gerbella et al., 2011) distinct subdivisions F5a and F5p, which largely correspond to the ventral and dorsal recording array, respectively. Distinct connections of F5a with SII, AIP and other subdivision of F5 (but not to M1) (Gerbella et al., 2011) suggest an integration of visual, motor and context specific information (Theys et al., 2013). On the other hand, connections of F5p to the hand area of M1 and to the spinal cord (Borra et al., 2010) suggest a rather direct contribution to hand movement control. Taken together, the multimodal preparation signals with visual and motor contribution and the distinct motor feature coding towards planning and execution supports the important role of F5 in visuomotor transformation.”</p><p><italic>2) Strictly related to this issue, the electrodes length is unknown. From the authors' previous works (Schaffelhoefer et al. 2015a and Townsend et al. 2011) I infer that &quot;electrode length ranged from 1.5 to 7.1 mm&quot;, with the longest electrodes toward the sulcus. Thus, the more superficial electrodes of the lateral arrays certainly sampled F5c motor activity, likely related to mouth and hand movements, (see Graziano et al. 1997 and Maranesi et al. 2012), while the deepest electrodes most likely sampled F5p/a visuomotor activity. Please clarify.</italic></p><p>Thank you for reading the manuscript so carefully. We have now added the electrode length in the following sections:</p><p>Legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: “…(f) Electrode placement in monkey Z (right hemisphere). Each array consisted of 2 ground and 2 reference electrodes (black), as well as 32 recording channels (white) aligned in a 4x9 matrix. Electrode length for each row increased towards the sulcus from 1.5 – 7.1 mm. (g) Same for monkey M (left hemisphere)…”.</p><p>[Please note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f-g</xref> has been adapted accordingly to illustrate individual channels]</p><p>Chapter “Electrophysiological recordings”:</p><p>“In each array, the lengths of the electrodes increased towards the sulcus and ranged from 1.5 (1<sup>st</sup> row) to 7.1mm (4<sup>th</sup> row). In area F5, one array was placed in the posterior bank of the inferior arcuate sulcus approximately targeting F5a (longer electrodes)(Theys et al., 2012) and approaching the F5 convexity (F5c; shorter electrodes). The second and more dorsally located array was positioned to target F5p. In AIP, the arrays were implanted into the end of the posterior intraparietal sulcus at the level of area PF and more dorsally at the level of area PFG. In M1, both arrays were placed into the hand area of M1 into the anterior bank of the central sulcus at the level of the spur of the arcuate sulcus (Rathelot and Strick, 2009)”.</p><p>We believe that the updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and the corresponding updates in the text now provide full details of the location of the implanted electrodes.</p><p> <italic>3) &quot;Data have been analysed from 20 recording sessions (10 per animal)…&quot;. I don't understand how many (single and multi) units have been used for the analyses. It seems that a total of about 202 (units)*10 (sessions)=2020 and 355*10=3550 &quot;units&quot; have been considered in the two animals, respectively: with chronic recording this approach would certainly imply some resampling of the same &quot;units&quot; across sessions, increasing their number but reducing the variability of their discharge. At the same time, the authors stated in the Materials and methods section that &quot;all dimensionality reduction results presented for the individual areas originated from the same recording session per monkey&quot;, which actually sounds fair, but in contrast with the previous consideration. Please clarify.</italic> </p><p>Yes, we recorded in average 202 and 355 neurons from monkey Z and M, respectively (10 sessions per animal, see Results, paragraph 3). The reason we have not stated the summed number of neurons across sessions is exactly because of the resampling of neurons (due to the day-to-day stability of electrodes with respect to their position). The high unit counts you mentioned are correct (591 AIP + 677 M1 + 753 F5 cells = 2021 cells in animal Z, and 892 AIP, 1507 M1 and 1146 F5 cells = 3545 in animal M) but could potentially give the reader the incorrect impression about the sum of <italic>unique</italic>neurons and we therefore avoided them. Thus, to provide the fairest unit counts, we stated the average cell count per session and averaged analysis results accordingly (see Figure. 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>For results that reflect individual sessions, we have added the number of included cells to each individual Figure (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, and 6 and their corresponding supplements). For the single session analysis, we have explicitly mentioned “all dimensionality reduction results are from the same recording session” to make clear that we did not select the “best” representations we could find within 10 sessions for each of the individual areas (AIP, F5 and M1), but instead presented populations from the same recording session. This step should increase the comparability of results between individual areas.</p><p>Moreover, we have made clear that single and multi-units have been analyzed together. See chapter “Electrophysiological recordings”, last sentence: “No other pre-selection was applied and single and multiunit activity have been analysed together.”</p><p>The manuscript now provides detailed information for each analysis with respect to unit count.</p><p>Somewhat related to your comment, we also solved a question that has been important to us. We added a variation of the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) in order to express the coding of task conditions across recording sessions (in addition to individual sessions). For this, we measured the Mahalanobis distance between each pair of group means (e.g., between condition 00 and 11) resulting in a 50 x 50 distance matrix. These matrices, observed from each individual session, were averaged across all recording sessions and then used as a basis for an across-session HCA. The resulting dendrograms are now shown as supplemental figures in addition to the results of individual example sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 —figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5 —figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6 —figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). The following sections of the manuscript were altered:</p><p>Chapter “Hierarchical Cluster Analysis”, end of chapter:</p><p>“Additionally, we averaged the Mahalanobis distance matrices of all individual session to build dendrograms expressing the N-space of an animal across all recording sessions (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 —figure supplement 1</xref> for AIP of animal Z).”</p><p>Chapter “Vision for hand action”, end of paragraph 3:</p><p>“Importantly, consistent results were observed in both monkeys when performing HCA across all recording sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 —figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>, see Materials and methods).”</p><p>Chapter “Feature coding in area F5”, end of paragraph 7:</p><p>“HCA performed on the averaged population response across all recording sessions (see Materials and methods) confirmed in both animals the motor characteristics of simultaneously recorded populations in single sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5 —figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>).</p><p>Chapter “Feature coding in area M1”, last paragraph:</p><p>“The similarity of J- and N-space of M1 was not only visible in the first two components, but was also quantified across all dimensions in the hierarchical cluster trees of the simultaneously recorded M1 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 d,f</xref>) and when averaging the population response across all recording sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6 —figure supplement 1</xref>-2 for monkey M and Z, resp.).”</p><p> <italic>4) I recommend using the same y-axis scales for plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">figure 3 (b and d</xref>). Nevertheless, it is clear that the tuning profile of AIP does not change when abstract or mixed sets of objects are used (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and d</xref>): I totally understand the authors' reasoning, but they will acknowledge that all the abstract objects share an elongated shape, while those of the mixed set are much more variable. Thus, the lack of difference in the AIP tuning profile between the two sets is strange and should be better explained/discussed. For example, could it be due to receptive fields properties of AIP neurons (see Romero et al. 2014; Romero and Janssen 2016)?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We updated the y-axis scales according to your suggestion.</p><p>The similar quantitative responses (in terms of percentage of significantly tuned neurons) for the abstract and mixed shapes, in our opinion, are not strange but strikingly extend our findings from the complete object set. We understand that a higher variation in object shape could have affected the number of tuned cells, in stark contrast to the observed minor differences presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. However, monkeys viewed the objects from the side, which substantially reduced the apparent visual uniformity of the abstract object set (less elongated profiles). Furthermore, we report in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the percentage of significantly tuned neurons, and not, for example, the average tuning strength (e.g., the difference between the strongest and weakest response in each object set), which might have been a more sensitive measure for detecting absolute tuning differences between both object sets.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Altogether, I consider the work exceptional. The data make new and important contributions to understanding the cortical mechanisms underlying grasp control. By concurrently recording and characterising the relationships between limb kinematics and neural activity from AIP, F5, and M1 while monkeys viewed and grasped a wide range of objects, the scope of the current investigation is unparalleled in the current primate neurophysiological literature. Also outstanding are the beautiful data visualisation methods that the authors advance here.</italic> </p><p> <italic>I have a few suggestions, however, detailed below. My hope is that the authors will find these comments constructive.</italic> </p><p> <italic>A) Main concerns:</italic></p><p> <italic>(A-1) The role of AIP</italic> </p><p> <italic>I'm having some difficulty understanding the authors’ stance on the role of AIP. I believe they are arguing that their data suggest that AIP is encoding object properties in visual terms, and not in motoric terms. They suggest that the results of their CDA show that AIP encodes objects according to shape in visual space, independent of the way they are grasped.</italic> </p><p> <italic>My interpretation of their stance is that AIP activity does not reflect action possibilities in sensorimotor terms – but rather reflects the 'flagging' of visual features relevant for actions, but NOT (yet) represented as spatiomotor plans.</italic> </p><p> <italic>If this is indeed their stance, I see this as a significant departure from prior conceptualizations (Jeannerod et al., 1995).</italic> </p><p><italic>However, I remain confused about this argument, both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) conceptually, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) with respect to how some aspects of their data can be viewed as consistent these claims.</italic></p><p>Thank you for your detailed thoughts that we found very constructive. Following your comments, we have clarified the interpretation/summary of AIP throughout the manuscript and highlighted the corresponding sections in green (see section “Vision for action”, paragraph 3 and 6, “Discussion”, paragraph 5-7). We hope that these revisions improve the general understanding of the AIP results and their interpretation. Here we first summarize our stance and then address point-by point your questions regarding concept and data:</p><p>Grasping an object in different ways does not only require different motor plans, but also differentiated visual descriptions of the object. For example, when grasping a coffee cup, we need to create a geometrical description of the cup and an additional visual selection of its object parts (e.g., the handle) that we intend to grasp (e.g., perform a hook grip). Our data suggests that AIP is a dynamical visual area that might be responsible for differentiating and selecting these objects parts in a visual (geometrical) rather than in a motor space.</p><p> <italic>1) Conceptually. The authors talk about &quot;object affordances&quot; as different from &quot;motor affordances&quot;.</italic> </p><p> <italic>To me, affordances = action possibilities; they are sensory representations of the external environment that are inseparably linked to the motor apparatus and capabilities of the perceiving animal. In other words, affordances are, according to my understanding, inextricably motor.</italic> </p><p> <italic>What does it mean to &quot;extract object affordances relevant for grasping&quot;, but to not at the same time encode those same objects according to the spatiomotor properties required for their manual interaction?</italic> </p><p> <italic>They state: &quot;…suggest encoding of object affordances rather than motor affordances&quot;.</italic> </p><p><italic>I urge the authors to better clarify what is meant by object vs. motor affordances.</italic></p><p>Your comment is directly related to comment (d) of Reviewer #2. With object affordances we intended to express the visual extraction of object features of an object part relevant for grasping. To avoid confusion, we replaced “object affordances” with “object features” throughout the manuscript.</p><p> <italic>2) Data.

However, in our opinion, this standpoint does not reflect the global view on our data. For the following reasons we interpret the observed modulations in AIP as a visual rather than a motoric differentiation:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In both animals, the AIP population separated objects primarily on visual object attributes at the session- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and multi-session level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 —figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>): objects clustered primarily based on visual attributes, such as shape and size, although they were grasped in highly different fashions. In contrast, motor attributes were rarely found.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Differences with respect to the selected grip type were only apparent when <italic>the same</italic> object was grasped differently (e.g., handle box, horizontal cylinder), whereas all other objects maintained their shape clusters. In contrast, motor feature coding, as observed in F5 and M1, would separate all objects in motor terms (not only those that offer different object parts). This could indicate visual rather than motor processes for grasping.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The separation of such conditions (handle, cylinder) originated from the same shape cluster (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>) also suggesting visual rather than motor transformations.</p></list-item></list><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15278.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Visualization of (<bold>a</bold>) reduced and (<bold>b</bold>) complete population show perfectly overlapping clusters of small (black triangles, 51-54) and large cylinders (red triangles, 55-56) in the early cue phase (100 ms after cue onset).</title><p>These conditions start separating over time as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,f</xref>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15278.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15278.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15278-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>In d), the reviewer suggested that abstract objects might have more graspable parts, and hence a larger number of possible actions, than objects of the mixed set. However, we regard this as rather unlikely. Neither the grasp variability of both animals nor the visual aspect of the objects justifies the conclusion that abstract objects have more graspable parts. In fact, we specifically designed the abstract set such that objects have many different visual parts, but only one graspable part, which both animals also uniformly selected.</p><p>However, we agree with Reviewer #3 that the visual and motor space cannot be separated completely, as we have discussed previously (Schaffelhofer et al. 2015). For example, coming from the motor side, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c-d</xref> shows the separation of objects based on the recorded hand kinematics. Although this is a pure motor representation of objects, some shapes tend to cluster together, such as the vertical cylinders or the cubes, due to the design of the objects that shape the hand. In other words, even a pure motor representation creates similarities with the visual space and vice versa.</p><p>Taken together, and in agreement with reviewer #3, the differences between AIP and F5 can only be described as graded ones, with visual prevalence in AIP and motoric prevalence in F5. While we maintain our general interpretation of the AIP results, we tempered our arguments, as suggested. Both, visual and motor separation of objects is now discussed in the Results and Discussion section (we highlighted all text edits in the manuscript with respect to this comment in green).</p><p>“Vision for hand action”, paragraph 3:</p><p>“Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) performed on these distance measures confirmed the findings of the CDA and revealed a clear clustering according to object shape during visual presentation of the object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) that widely remained during movement execution, although with significantly shorter neural distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).”</p><p>“Vision for hand action”, paragraph 7:</p><p>“This reduced selectivity could indicate either motor or visual transformations that are both required for grasping: First, the abstract objects were grasped with the same hand configuration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). […] Together, these observations suggest a visual rather than motor representation in AIP.”</p><p>“Discussion – Visual processing for grasping”, paragraph 3 and 4:</p><p>“We emphasize that visual coding at the population level does not preclude motor coding of some individual cells, as suggested previously (Murata et al., 1997). Rather, the evidence of bidirectional connections to F5 suggests that subpopulations in AIP exist that reflect feedback motor signals from F5.”</p><p>“These modulations could reflect either motor (Fagg and Arbib, 1998) or visual transformations required for grasping. […] These differentiation schemes support our hypothesis of visual rather than motor transformations in AIP.”</p><p><italic>B) Intermediate concerns</italic> </p><p><italic>B-1) in the Introduction, the authors state that prior work did not dissociate between visual and motor features. At first, I thought this was inconsistent with the work of Sakata and colleagues – describing visual dominant, visuomotor, and motor dominant cell types. I think some discussion of this work upfront, including how the current approach critically differs, would be helpful.</italic></p><p>Previous approaches separated neurons into visual, visuomotor and motor cells primarily based on their responses to objects in light or dark condition (activation or no activation). According to Sakata and co-workers, Motor dominant cells become activated during grasping and holding in both light and dark. They do not fire during object fixation. Visual-motor neurons discharge stronger during grasping in light than in the dark. Visual-dominant neurons discharge during object fixation and when grasping in light. Thus, the epoch of activation has been the main criteria for classification.</p><p>Our work took a significantly different approach by comparing the coding (modulation patterns) of neurons and of neuronal populations with respect to highly variable objects and the measured hand kinematics in order to separate visual from motor processes. Our work demonstrated that activations in visual epochs can reflect motor processing, whereas grasp modulation can reflect object geometries.</p><p>We followed your suggestion and entirely revised paragraph 4-6 of the Introduction:</p><p>“To create a deeper understanding of how visual information is transformed into motor commands, a precise identification and differentiation of visual and motor processes within the grasping network is required. […] Our data revealed distinct roles of the grasping network in translating visual object attributes (AIP) into planning (F5) and execution signals (M1) and allowed visualizing the propagation of these features for grasping. “</p><p> <italic>B-2) Introduction – last paragraph – it isn't clear to me what the authors mean to say here, without first reading the rest of the paper. I think this section could be made clearer.</italic> </p><p>We revised the last paragraph accordingly (see above). We believe, that the concept and intention of our experiments are now better explained.</p><p><italic>B-3) I'm not sure I understand their explanation of the shape-specificity prior to fixation. Please try to make this clearer.</italic></p><p>Shape-specificity during the fixation epoch is likely due to our block design, in which we presented objects of similar shape on the same turntable. This fact is a small detail, however it could raise concerns on whether coding in AIP was really due to object shape, or rather to the object presentation order (different turntables presented sequentially). We revised our arguments to make this clearer:</p><p>“The large number of objects presented in one recording session required separating the 48 objects on different turntables (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), often objects of similar shape. This separation created small offsets already in the fixation epoch, but at very low modulations. An extreme case is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>. This might raise concerns on whether coding in AIP was really due to object shape, or rather to the object presentation order (different turntables presented sequentially). However, shape-wise clustering in AIP cannot be explained by the task design for the following reasons: (1) The offsets in the fixation epoch were very small in comparison to the visual modulations observed in AIP when the objects were presented (e.g., see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). (2) The set of “mixed” objects – presented and grasped in the same block – clustered with other objects of the same shape (e.g. ring in mixed block clusters with other ring objects). Together, this demonstrates clear shape processing in AIP.”</p><p><italic>B-4) At first I thought I missed something – it seemed as though AIP was not looked at in terms of J- and N-space encoding in the same way that F5 and M1 were. However, later it is clear that they did analyse AIP in the same way. Why not also show these data, as they do for F5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) and M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>)?</italic></p><p>For the complete N-space the AIP, F5, and M1 populations were analyzed and visualized in the same way. In the reduced space the areas were visualized differently to represent the full dimensional space (hierarchical clustering) best. That is, showing the object separation of AIP in 3D to reveal the object-shape clusters best, whereas F5 and M1 populations were shown in 2D and aligned (rotated) to the J-space (with PCRA) to allow direct comparison of both representations next to each other. We believe that this kind of visualization reflects and explains the full-dimensional results best.</p><p><italic>B-5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> – it is unclear to me why they plot J-space for the hold epoch and N-space for the grasp epoch; why not show results from the same epochs?</italic></p><p>Premotor area F5 provided higher modulations (separation of conditions) in the grasping epoch, when the hand was approaching the object. This is also shown and discussed in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">video 5</xref>, where you can see F5 expressions earlier than in M1. We therefore selected this epoch in area F5 to represent motor execution. However, all epochs, including the hold epoch, are shown below in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>.</p><p><italic>B-6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> – and the authors' discussion of the driving influence of F5 on M1 activity – how do these findings relate to (Umilta et al., 2007; Spinks et al., 2008)? I think these studies should be explicitly discussed.</italic></p><p>We find both studies most helpful. Umilta et al. and Spinks et al. report similarity between F5 and AIP with respect to grasp coding at the LFP and single unit level in support of our feature code correlation results. We now discuss and reference their work in the following sections:</p><p>Chapter “Feature coding in area M1”, first paragraph:</p><p>“In agreement with the general population response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), single neurons of M1 were almost exclusively modulated during movement execution and showed minimal modulations during preparatory epochs (Umilita et al. 2007), as also indicated by the example neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a-b</xref>.”</p><p>“Discussion”, last paragraph:</p><p>“The high similarity of the F5 and M1 population during movement execution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref> vs. 6e, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>) is in agreement with findings of similar coding schemes between both areas in spiking (Umilta et al., 2007) and β-band LFP activity (Spinks et al., 2008).”</p><p> <italic>Also, is it not surprising to find so little evidence for correspondence between AIP and F5 during planning?</italic></p><p>The applied analysis reflects the coding similarity between both areas, not their physical connectivity. In other words, when two areas share the same feature coding with respect to the 50 conditions the correlation coefficient increases. In fact, the correlation analysis results, although exploring the data with an entirely different method, match the identified visual and motor coding (and their proportion) from the population analysis. In detail, only an F5 subpopulation coded objects in visual terms, and therefore similar with respect to AIP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This explains the relatively low feature-communication peaks between both areas, and demonstrates that the coding of objects is represented strongly differently in AIP and F5 during large parts of the task, although both areas are highly modulated by these objects. Please note that we would expect significantly higher feature communication between AIP and F5 when precisely targeting the F5a subdivision, which holds predominantly visual-dominant neurons, in comparison to F5p (Theys et al. 2012), and directly receives information from AIP (Gerbella et al. 2010).</p><p>In response to your comment, we added the following sentences to chapter “Results/Feature code correlation”:</p><p>“These results are consistent with the proportion of F5 visual cells identified in animal Z and M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which only temporarily shared the visual coding with AIP. Interestingly, F5 and AIP demonstrated minimal similarities during movement planning, which could support the different encoding of visual and motor features described on the population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).”</p><p><italic>How does the relationship between AIP and F5 that the authors suggest according to their new results compare with prior accounts – e.g. Jeannerod et al., 1995; Fagg and Arbib, 1998?</italic></p><p>Existing models of the grasping network share the same basic interpretation of the F5-AIP network as the main circuit for visuomotor transformation (Jeannerod et al., 1995, Fagg and Arbib, 1998, Rizzolati et Luppino, 2001). In support, our data provides important electrophysiological evidence that object features are indeed transformed into motor representations between both areas.</p><p>Previous models were, however, uncertain on how and where visual information is exactly translated into motor commands and whether both areas perform both visual and motor computations. Fagg et Arbib (1998) and Rizzolatti et Luppino (2001) consider grasp transforms already in AIP. They propose that AIP is using the visual input to generate multiple affordances passed to F5, which selects the final grip type.</p><p>Our data suggest a slightly different information flow in which visual and motor processes are organized more separately. In this understanding, AIP is responsible for providing object properties to F5 (F5a) thereby activating motor solutions that, in return to AIP, help further extracting geometrical features relevant for grasping. F5 with its connection to visual input (F5a) and motor output (F5p), could be the main hub for coordinating visual feature extraction with AIP and motor planning and subsequent execution with M1.</p><p>We believe that our edits in response to this reviewer’s comment a) (see above) addresses this question.</p><p> <italic>How do the authors interpret the increased AIP-M1 correspondence during grasp and hold?</italic> </p><p>This comment is related to comment (1b)-d. As discussed above, visual representations of objects and motor features of the hand cannot be entirely disassociated, because the object geometries define the shape of the grasping hand. Even pure motor representations, such as the recorded hand kinematics, can therefore share similarities with an object space. When M1 changes from a mostly unmodulated (planning) to a highly modulated state (grasp epoch) the similarity to an object space increases. In other words, we interpret the increase of similarity as a result of the highly increased modulations in M1.</p><p> <italic>B-7) What do the authors mean by the statement regarding M1 on p.26 &quot;…its neuronal population has never been studied explicitly&quot;? What about, for e.g., the work of Umilta et al., 2007; Spinks et al., 2008?</italic> </p><p>We tempered this statement: “Although the motor relevance of the hand area of M1 has been described extensively with electrophysiological (Schieber, 1991; Schieber and Poliakov, 1998; Spinks et al., 2008; Umilta et al., 2007) and anatomical methods (Dum and Strick, 2005; Rathelot and Strick, 2009), it has been unclear how versatile hand configurations are encoded at the population level.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
