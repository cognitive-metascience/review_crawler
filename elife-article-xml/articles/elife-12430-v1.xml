information transfer encoded by macromolecules. Here, we identified RNF10 as a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger. RNF10 is activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment and elicits discrete changes at the transcriptional level. RNF10 is enriched at the excitatory synapse where it associates with the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs and induction of long term potentiation (LTP) lead to the translocation of RNF10 from dendritic segments and dendritic spines to the nucleus. In particular, we provide evidence for importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus. Notably, RNF10 silencing prevents the maintenance of LTP as well as LTP-dependent structural modifications of dendritic spines.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12430.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12430.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12430.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Brain activity depends on the communication between neurons. This process takes place at the junctions between neurons, which are known as synapses, and typically involves one of the cells releasing a chemical messenger that binds to receptors on the other cell. The binding triggers a cascade of events inside the recipient cell, including the production of new receptors and their insertion into the cell membrane. These changes strengthen the synapse and are thought to be one of the ways in which the brain establishes and maintains memories.</p><p>However, in order to induce these changes at the synapse, neurons must be able to activate the genes that encode their component parts. These genes are present inside the cell nucleus, which is located some distance away from the synapse. Studies have shown that signals can be sent from the nucleus to the synapse and vice versa, enabling the two parts of the cell to exchange information. Synapses that communicate using a chemical called glutamate have been particularly well studied; but it still remains unclear how the activation of receptors at these “glutamatergic synapses” is linked to activation of genes inside the nucleus at the molecular level.</p><p>Dinamarca, Guzzetti et al. have now discovered that this process at glutamatergic synapses involves the movement of a protein messenger to the nucleus. Specifically, activation at synapses of a particularly common subtype of receptor, called NMDA, causes a protein called Ring Finger protein 10 (or RNF10 for short) to move from the synapse to the nucleus. To leave the synapse, RNF10 first has to bind to proteins called importins, which transport RNF10 into the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, RNF10 binds to another protein that interacts with the DNA to start the production of new synaptic proteins.</p><p>Further work is required to identify the molecular mechanisms that trigger RNF10 to leave the synapse. In addition, future studies should evaluate the levels and activity of RNF10 in brain disorders in which synapses are known to function abnormally.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12430.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12430.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>NMDA receptors</kwd><kwd>dendritic spines</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>rattus</kwd><kwd>importins</kwd><kwd>synaptonuclear messengers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cariplo Foundation, Italy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiLuca</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiLuca</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Italian Ministry of Research and University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gardoni</surname><given-names>Fabrizio</given-names></name><name><surname>DiLuca</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A protein called RNF10 relays messages from synapses to neuron cell nuclei, and is responsible for long-lasting modifications of dendritic spines as observed after activation of synaptic glutamate receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding how local synaptic events are translated into changes in gene expression is a crucial question in neuroscience. Synapses and nuclei are efficiently connected by bidirectional communication routes that enable transfer of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fainzilber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panayotis et al., 2015</xref>) and regulate the transcription of genes associated with long-term structural changes of neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karpova et al., 2012</xref>). NMDAR activation plays a key role in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardingham and Bading, 2010</xref>). NMDARs are heteromeric ionotropic channels that are essential for excitatory neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanz-Clemente et al., 2013</xref>). NMDARs differ in their subunit composition and, in the forebrain, they can be either di- or tri-heteromeric tetramers consisting of two GluN1 and either one or two GluN2A or GluN2B subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>). GluN2A-containing NMDARs are mainly localized at the postsynaptic membrane, at the core of the postsynaptic density (PSD), while the GluN2B-containing NMDARs are also prominently present at extrasynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardingham and Bading, 2010</xref>). In addition, numerous reports have indicated that GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDARs may play different roles in the modulation of synaptic plasticity and in central nervous system (CNS) disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>). These differences in receptor function are probably linked to the cytoplasmic C-tail of the two subunits, which are fairly different and contain specific motifs that bind to PSD-associated scaffolding proteins and to proteins involved in the downstream signal transduction of receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanz-Clemente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is generally accepted that rises in synaptic, somatic and nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> rapidly regulate gene expression by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bading, 2013</xref>). Recent work showed that following a fast genomic response to sustained rises in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a considerably slower process that depends on the nuclear import of proteins released from synapses couples local synaptic events to more specific gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jordan and Kreutz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ch'ng and Martin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karpova et al., 2012</xref>). The classical active nuclear import pathway involves the binding of importin α isoforms to nuclear localization signal (NLS) bearing cargo proteins. Interestingly, neuronal importins are present at synapses in association with NMDARs and the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dieterich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeffrey et al., 2009</xref>) and they are able to translocate to the nucleus in response to NMDAR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dieterich et al., 2008</xref>). Proteomic studies have identified many proteins in purified synaptosomes that contain a NLS domain, and in the past 10 years, an impressive number of potential synaptonuclear messenger proteins have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ch'ng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karpova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaushik et al., 2014</xref>). Many of these proteins contain a bona fide NLS and, in some cases, their binding with importin α was shown to be essential for long-distance transport as importin α can serve as an adaptor for nuclear trafficking of cargo in association with a dynein motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karpova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ch'ng et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In recent studies, it was shown that Jacob, a Caldendrin-binding protein abundantly expressed in limbic brain and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dieterich et al., 2008</xref>), encodes and transduces the synaptic and extrasynaptic origin of GluN2B-containing NMDAR signals to the nucleus and elicits the divergent transcriptional responses after activation of these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dieterich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karpova et al., 2013</xref>). These findings point to the fascinating possibility that specific NMDAR signals are encoded at synaptic sites and decoded in the nucleus by long-distance trafficking of protein messengers.</p><p>Here, we identified Ring Finger protein 10 (RNF10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seki et al., 2000</xref>) as a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger, localized at the PSD and specifically associated to the cytoplasmic tail of GluN2A but not GluN2B subunit of NMDARs. After stimulation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs, RNF10 binds to importin α1 for nuclear long-distance transport. Notably, we show that long-term potentiation (LTP) induces nuclear translocation of RNF10, its interaction with the transcription factor Meox2 and the modulation of gene expression. Most interestingly, RNF10-regulated gene expression appears to feed back to synaptic function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNF10 is a neuronal synaptic protein</title><p>In order to identify new binding partners for GluN2A, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal domain (aa 839–1461, without the aa 1462–1464 PDZ-binding sequence) as bait.

In Schwann cells, RNF10 has a function in the transcriptional regulation of myelin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoshikawa et al., 2008</xref>). However, very little is known about the neuronal function of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoshikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malik et al., 2013</xref>). Using specific glial (GFAP) and neuronal (MAP2) markers, we confirmed that RNF10 is expressed in both glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, in neurons RNF10 displayed a nuclear and somatodendritic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, transfected GFP-RNF10 displayed a prominent co-localization with PSD-95 and GluN2A at the dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, analysis of endogenous RNF10 in <italic>DIV14</italic> primary hippocampal neurons showed clustered RNF10 immunolabeling along dendrites and most puncta co-localized with GluN2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, left panels) and PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right panels). PSDs from the rat hippocampus were purified to confirm the subcellular distribution of RNF10 by a biochemical approach. Subcellular fractionation demonstrated that RNF10 is associated with synaptic fractions and that it is prominently present in PSD fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Finally, immunofluorescence analysis of the CA1 region of the adult rat hippocampus revealed the presence of an intense signal for RNF10 in the soma and nuclei together with a punctate staining along MAP2-positive dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12430.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNF10 subcellular distribution in neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>,<bold>B</bold>) Mixed primary hippocampal cultures (<italic>DIV14</italic>) immunolabeled with antibodies for RNF10 (red), glial marker GFAP (A; green) or the neuronal marker MAP2 (B; green), and Dapi (blue) to stain the nucleus; scale bar: 20 μm.

Based on this consideration, we first evaluated whether calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) could modulate GluN2A/RNF10 interaction. Using a pull-down assay we found that the presence of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (2 mM) in the buffer significantly reduced GluN2A binding to GST-RNF10 FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; -37.8% ± 6.2%; p&lt;0.01).

To understand the role of RNF10 in neurons, we silenced RNF10 expression by using a short hairpin (sh) RNF10 knock-down or a scramble sequence (as control) in primary hippocampal cultures. We tested three different sequences of RNF10 shRNA (shRNF10; see Materials and methods); shRNF10 that led to the highest level of RNF10 downregulation (&gt;90%; TRCN0000041128) was selected and used in all experiments. Confocal imaging of hippocampal neurons transfected with shRNF10 or scramble plasmids demonstrated a significant effect of RNF10 knock-down on dendritic spine morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>). In particular, RNF10 silencing produced a significant reduction in dendritic spine density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) without any effect on dendritic spine length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) or dendritic spine head width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). For a more detailed morphological analysis, dendritic spines were categorized according to their shape (mushroom, thin and stubby) using a validated classification method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourne and Harris, 2008</xref>). However, no effect of shRNF10 in the proportion of dendritic spine subtypes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Notably, the effect of RNF10 silencing on dendritic spine density was fully rescued by co-expressing a wild-type human variant of RNF10 resistant to shRNA (see Materials and methods; flag-RNF10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of RNF10 per se had no effect on dendritic spine morphology (data not shown). We then verified whether the loss of spines following RNF10 protein knock-down was correlated with an altered expression of the main components of the excitatory synapse.

As expected, RNF10 silencing produced a significant reduction of RNF10 protein level compared to dissociated neurons and slices treated with scramble construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Most importantly, RNF10 silencing resulted in a significant decrease of GluN2A, PSD-95 and the GluA1 subunit of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) protein levels in the total cell homogenate of pLKO-shRNF10-infected dissociated neurons and organotypic slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12430.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>RNF10 silencing induces molecular and morphological modifications of the glutamatergic synapse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images of primary hippocampal neurons (<italic>DIV14</italic>) transfected at <italic>DIV7</italic> with pGIPZ-scramble, shRNF10 and shRNF10 plus flagRNF10 and immunolabeled for GFP (green); scale bar: 5 μm.

We demonstrate that RNF10 is highly expressed in the nucleus as well as at synapses, where it is part of the NMDAR complex and directly interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs. RNF10 dissociates from the NMDAR complex in an activity-dependent manner and we provide compelling evidence for the importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus.</p><p>The intracellular C-terminal domain of GluN2A contains several target sequences for downstream signaling and scaffolding molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanz-Clemente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). Among others, RNF10 and CaM share the same GluN2A binding region (aa 991–1029; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajaj et al., 2014</xref>). Our results indicate a preferential formation of RNF10/GluN2A complex in resting conditions that is disrupted in favor of CaM/GluN2A complex following synaptic activity-dependent calcium influx. Overall, our data show that RNF10 binding to GluN2A plays a key role for RNF10 anchoring at the excitatory synapse but also interfere with the formation of CaM/NMDAR complex. Moreover, the presence of RNF10 in close proximity to the receptor channel allows for a rapid calcium-dependent dissociation of RNF10/GluN2A complex following NMDAR activation and for the subsequent formation of RNF10/importin complex.</p><p>Here, we show that interaction of RNF10 with importin α1 represents a key step for its nuclear translocation. However, we also describe that RNF10 can interact with the majority of importin α isoforms including the importin α5 previously described to be associated with the NMDAR complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeffrey et al., 2009</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that synaptonuclear trafficking of RNF10 is involved in the control of gene expression, which is necessary for LTP-type synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. Very few studies are available addressing the role of RNF10 in the CNS, and they mainly address its association with the transcription factor Meox2, which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoshikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malik et al., 2013</xref>). A very recent study performed in P19 carcinoma cell line and in mouse cerebellar granule cells suggests that RNF10 acts as a positive regulator of neuronal differentiation, as its knockdown reduced the number of cells expressing early and late neuronal markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malik et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, microarray, subsequent real-time PCR and western blotting analysis allowed us to find, among others, novel RNF10 target genes known to be involved in the regulation of the excitatory synapse function and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vogt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michaluk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramakers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pavlowsky et al., 2012</xref>). RNF10 silencing induced a dramatic up-regulation of MMP9 expression and a concomitant reduction of Arhgef6, ArhGap4 and Ophn1 levels. Intriguingly, all these genes are mutated or dysregulated in intellectual disability syndromes in humans and/or in the corresponding mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vogt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michaluk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramakers et al., 2012</xref>), which are characterized by various alterations in dendritic spines, thus suggesting a key role in synaptic effects observed following RNF10 silencing. In this view, modulation of RNF10 expression in hippocampal neurons demonstrated its relevant role in regulating dendritic spine morphology under resting conditions as well as following activity-dependent plasticity. In particular, RNF10 silencing leads to a significant decrease in spine density that is fully rescued by co-transfection of shRNA-resistant RNF10 construct. As a direct consequence of this dramatic morphological event, we also observe a concomitant reduction in the expression of proteins almost exclusively localized at the excitatory PSD, such as PSD-95, AMPARs GluA1 subunit and NMDARs GluN2A subunit. Notably, overexpression of the RNF10(1–611) construct unable to translocate to nucleus leads to a significant reduction in PSD-95 positive puncta along dendrites. This result strongly indicates that an impaired RNF10-mediated synaptonuclear signaling and not a reduction of RNF10 synaptic levels is responsible for the reduction of dendritic spine density observed following RNF10 silencing.</p><p>The present and other studies indicate that NMDAR complex is likely a very rich source of protein messengers that are capable of trafficking to the nucleus. Most important, the present study provides convincing evidence that different NMDAR signals will indeed induce the nuclear import of different messengers. Several reports have documented that NMDARs activation leads to a differential modulation of nuclear gene expression, depending upon their localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardingham and Bading, 2010</xref>). In general, activation of synaptic NMDARs promotes the expression of synaptic plasticity-related genes, whereas activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs has been correlated to CNS pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardingham and Bading, 2010</xref>). The protein messenger Jacob, following long-distance transport and nuclear import, can encode and transduce the synaptic and extrasynaptic origin of GluN2B NMDAR signals to the nucleus and might dock a NMDA-receptor-derived signalosome to nuclear target sites in a stimulus-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karpova et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, here we show that activation of synaptic but not extrasynaptic NMDARs leads to an increase in RNF10 nuclear localization. Similarly to what was previously described for Jacob (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behnisch et al., 2011</xref>), we observe that RNF10 moves to the nucleus after induction of LTP but not LTD, modulating the expression of Meox2 target genes. However, in contrast to Jacob, inhibition of GluN2A- but not GluN2B-containing NMDARs is sufficient to block RNF10 trafficking to the nucleus, its interaction with the transcription factor Meox2 and the expression of the Meox2 target gene p21<sup>WAF1/cip1</sup>. Another intriguing finding includes the observation that the transcription factor CREB2 also known as ATF4 transits to the nucleus only after induction of NMDAR-dependent cLTD but not cLTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lai et al., 2008</xref>). Transcriptional regulators at synaptic sites like CRTC1 can also be phosphorylated by synaptic signals in a complex manner and translocation of CRTC1 to the nucleus might link specific types of stimuli to specific changes in gene expression.</p><p>Overall our data together with the findings from other recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaushik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rishal and Fainzilber, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panayotis et al., 2015</xref>), suggest that <italic>synapse-to-nucleus</italic> protein transport provide specific ways to inform the nucleus about very different types of synaptic activity. In this context, RNF10 represents a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger responsible for long-lasting re-shaping of dendritic spines as observed after specific synaptic stimuli and required for postsynaptic modifications needed to convey LTP induction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Purification of post-synaptic densities, triton insoluble postsynaptic fractions and crude nuclear fractions</title><p>Post-synaptic densities (PSDs) from rat hippocampus were isolated as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardoni et al., 1998</xref>).

Primary and secondary antibodies were applied in 5% BSA in PBS-C.M. Cells were chosen randomly for quantification from different coverslips. Fluorescence images were acquired by using Zeiss Confocal LSM510 Meta system with a sequential acquisition setting at 1024x1024 pixels resolution; for each image two up to four 0.5μm sections were acquired and a z projection was obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Malinverno et al., 2010</xref>). All images were acquired standing the signals within the linear range in order to perform a reliable quantification (avoiding the presence of any saturated pixel) and to compare appropriately all experimental conditions. For analysis of dendritic spine morphology, primary hippocampal neurons were transfected with GFP-containing constructs at <italic>DIV7</italic>. Cells were fixed and immunolabeled for GFP at <italic>DIV14</italic>. The SP5 CLSM system (Leica-Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) equipped with Diode (405 nm), Argon (488 nm) and Diode Pumped Solid State (561 nm) lasers was used for time-lapse imaging of RNF10 fused to tdEOS. Images were taken with HCX APO L20x/1.00W objective (Leica, Germany). Along the z-axis at list 10 optical sections with focus depth of 300–400 nm were taken in order to cover the complete volume of imaged neurons. Quick change 18 mm Chamber with Field Stimulation (RC-49MFS, Warner Instruments) was used for mounting coverslips with living overexpressing RFN10-tdEOS neurons in Neurobasal medium (Gibco) on the microscope stage. Master-8/U 8-channel programmable pulse generator (Science Products) was used to generate timing and two channels were synchronized to produce complex patterns of pulses (1 ms pulse duration) with inter pulse interval of 20 ms. To eliminate the distortion and thereby to achieve a rectangular pulse permitting accurate measurement, the constant-current stimulus isolation unit (SIU-102, Warner Instruments) was used in the output of a stimulus generator. The LTP was induced by applying current pulses 18s@50 Hz via field stimulation electrode. Response of cultured hippocampal neurons on field synaptic stimulation was verified by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging with Fluo-4-AM (1 µM) (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Miniature EPSCs were recorded on <italic>DIV14</italic> hippocampal neurons at room temperature, at a holding potential of -60 mV.

Data obtained by pull-down assays were normalized on the amount of GST fusion protein. The data from all quantifications were analyzed using Graphpad Prism software and levels and values were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Co-localization analysis was performed using Zeiss AIM4.2 software. Statistical evaluations were performed by Student <italic>t</italic> test or Pearson correlations or, as appropriate, by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s or Tukey's as a post-hoc test.

The set contained three vectors (the TRC IDs: TRCN0000041128, mature antisense TTCAGGTTGATCTTCTTAGGG; TRCN0000041131, mature antisense TTTCTGTGAATTGGAGCGACG; and TRCN0000041132, mature antisense ATACCCAGCAATCTCTACCAC), all of them were validated by real-time PCR on rat hippocampal primary cultures. Vector TRCN0000041128 showed the highest level of RNF10 downregulation (&gt;90%, data not shown) and was used in all further experiments (designated as shRNF10). To knock down rat GluN2A gene expression, a set of 4 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vectors in pGFP-V-RS was purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). The sequences were as follows: A-gacagcactcctatgataacattctggac; B-tctaccagcaggactggtcacagaacaac; C-tgcgagccagatgacaaccacctcagcat; D-agtagaggtggctgtcagcactgaatcca. A scrambled control from Origene (Rockville, MD) was also used as a negative control. Sequence called B showed the best knockdown and was therefore used for further experiments.</p><p>For the testing and validation of sh-resistant form of RNF10, rat primary hippocampal cultures were transfected with GFP (Ctrl), rat-shRNF10, RFP-humRNF10, and rat-shRNF10 + TRP-humRNF10. Total RNA was extracted with Tryzol 48 hr after transfection, retrotranscribed (Improm II, Promega) and analyzed by quantitative PCR using primers that specifically amplify rat RNF10 or human RNF10. Transfection with rat-shRNF10 resulted in three fold decrease of endogenous RNF10 mRNA, whereas transfection with human RFP tagged RNF10 resulted in 45-fold increase in mRNA for human RNF10, the level which was not affected by rat-shRNF10 co-transfection. Interestingly, the overexpression of human RNF10 in rat hippocampal cells abolished effect of shRNF10 on levels of endogenous RNF10 mRNA. The specificity of rat-shRNF10-mediated knock down was further tested using human neuroblastoma line SY-S5Y5. No effect on both endogenous and everexpressed RNF10 was observed after transfection with rat-shRNF10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Viral constructs</title><p>Cloning of pLV-RNF10-EGFP. The cloning of this construct was accomplished in two steps. First, EGFP was amplified from the pRRLSIN.cPPT.hCMV-EGFP.WPRE (pLV-EGFP) plasmid to create in frame sequence with XbaI-SalI sites at 5’ of EGFP and XhoI sites at 3’ of EGFP using primers: forward 5’-aagcttTCTAGAgaattcGTCGACATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGA; reverse 5’- aagcttCTCGAGTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT. Amplificate was digested with XbaI and XhoI enzymes and ligated in XbaI-SalI digested pLV vector creating the intermediate pLV-(XS)EGFP bearing XbaI-SalI cassette at 5’ of EGFP. After the sequence was confirmed by sequencing, human RNF10 was excised from pCMV-Tag4-RNF10 plasmid by XbaI and SalI and ligated in XbaI/SalI digested pLV-(XS)EGFP yielding pLV-RNF10-EGFP plasmid.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Production of viral particles</title><p>For production of lentiviral particles 2 mln of HEK293T producing cells were plated on 100 mm plates (Costar, Milan, Italy) in complete medium (DMEM, Cat. D5671; 2 mM Glutamine; 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma); 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Immunological Sciences, Milano, Italy). For overexpression of RNF10, the day after plating the cells were transfected with 3μg pL-shRNF10 or pGIPZ-scr and with 2.5 μg psPAX2 and 0.75 μg pMD2.G retroviral packaging constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) in 7 ml of complete medium. For RNF10 silencing, the cells were transfected with 3 μg pLV-RNF10-EGFP, and with 2 μg pMDLg/pRRE, 0.75 μg pRSV-REV, 11 μg pMD2.G lentiviral packaging constructs. 48 hr after transfection culture medium was collected, filtered through 0.45 μm PVDF filter and precipitated with polyethylene glycol (PEG; 5x PEG solution contained: 200 g PEG, Sigma Cat. 89510, 12 g NaCl in 2 mM Tris pH 7.5) overnight. Precipitates were then collected by centrifugation at 1500 xg for 30 min at 4°C, resuspended in cold HEPES balanced salt solution (HBSS, Sigma), aliquoted and snap frozen. Aliquots were kept at -80°C. Each viral batch was tittered by serial dilution infections of rat hippocampal primary cells by means of real-time PCR (for RNF10 silencing) using primers for rat RNF10 (to evaluate efficacy of downregulation): forward 5’-GAACAAGAGACAGGGCAGGT, reverse 5’-GACAGAGGGGTCAGCAGAAA. For experiments, a viral titer was used yielding &gt; 80% of RNF10 downregulation. Virus for overexpression was tittered by FACS, and a titer yielding &gt; 80% EGFP positive cells was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Yeast two hybrid (Y2H) screening</title><p>Y2H was conducted according to the manufacture procedure guidelines using the Mate &amp; Plate™ Library - Mouse Brain (Normalized) (cat # 630488, TakaraBio/Clontech Europe, France). Briefly, the GluN2A(839–1461) C-tail (bait) was cloned in the pGBKT7 plasmid and transformed in the AH109 haploid yeast strain (MATa). This was mated overnight with the Mouse Brain normalized library (prays) cloned in pGADT7 transformed in Y187 haploid yeast strain (MATα). Yeast were plated after 24 on selective plate, allowing only the growth of diploid where a protein interaction between the bait and pray protein occurred (absence of Leucine, Adenine, Tryptophan and Histidine). Then the diploid where tested by a colorimetric assay (α-gal) to avoid the presence of false positive. Plasmids (21 positive clones) were extracted from the yeast and sequenced. Five genes were identified following sequencing, one of those being RNF10.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by: FP7-PEOPLE-ITN-2008 #238608 (SYMBAD) to MDL; Fondazione CARIPLO (grant number 0795-2013) to MDL and AAG; FIRB Accordi di Programma RBAP11HSZS to MDL; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-13-JSV4-0005-01, SYNcity], Région Languedoc-Roussillon (Chercheur d’Avenir) to JP; PRIN2010-2011 2010AHHP5H to FaG; PRIN2010-2011 2010PWNJXK to MDL and PLC; DFG (SFB779 TPB8 / Kr1879/5-1/6-1) and FP7 MC-ITN NPlast to MRK; CBBS to AK and MRK.</p><p>We thank Dr. Richard Huganir (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) for the GFP-GluN2A construct and Dr. Toru Ogata (The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan) for the rat RNF10 cDNA.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Eunjoon Kim, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another is Johannes Hall.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports the novel role of ring finger protein 10 (RNF10) in the regulation of NMDAR-dependent signaling between synapses and the nucleus. In support of this idea, the authors show that RNF10 is present at synaptic sites and directly interacts with GluN2A. RNF10 knockdown induces reductions in spine density and some synaptic proteins. Activation of synaptic NMDARs induces synaptonuclear translocation of RNF10 through NLS2-dependent interactions with importin α proteins. In addition, LTP-inducing stimuli also induce synaptonuclear RNF10 translocation, leading to the interaction of RNF10 and a transcriptional regulator Meox2, and regulation of the expression of RNF10 target genes.</p><p>These are original findings of high interest. It is especially remarkable that RNF10 knockdown not only reduces spine density but also total GluN2A, GluA1, and PSD-95 protein levels. In the future, it seems worthwhile to explore regulation of the transcription of these proteins by RNF10 in more detail. Also notable is the contrast between RNF10 and Jacob, another synaptonuclear shuttle protein as discovered earlier by some of the authors, which associates with GluN2B rather than GluN2A, with RNF10 shuttling induced by activation of GluN2A- and not GluN2B-containing NMDARs whereas Jacob shuttling requires the opposite. Contrasting the differential behaviors of those two proteins is an especially nice aspect of this manuscript.</p><p>However, the below issues should be thoroughly addressed before a final decision can be rendered.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that RNF10 knockdown decreases spine density and levels of certain synaptic proteins. Measuring how RNF10 knockdown affects mEPSCs and mIPSCs would strengthen the conclusions. A rescue condition should be included. Ideally, this experiment should be done using cultured slices or virus-infected brain slices rather than dissociated neurons to increase the relevance of the results to more intact circuits.</p><p>2) It is unclear how RNF10 dissociates from GluN2A by NMDAR activation. If any mechanism were involved, would it be also involved in the enhanced interaction between RNF10 and importins/Meox2? These mechanisms should be explored to some extent or discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12430.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) The authors show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that RNF10 knockdown decreases spine density and levels of certain synaptic proteins.

Ideally, this experiment should be done using cultured slices or virus-infected brain slices rather than dissociated neurons to increase the relevance of the results to more intact circuits.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that an evaluation of RNF10 function in more intact circuits is of great relevance. Accordingly, we have received very recently from KOMP Repository the RNF10 ko mice (RNF10<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup>) for in vivo<italic>/</italic>ex vivo studies that will represent the ideal follow up of the present manuscript.</p><p>In order to increase the relevance of results obtained in dissociated neurons we replicated the western blotting analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> also from organotypic hippocampal slices infected with pLKO-shRNF10 lentivirus or scramble sequence as a control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> of the revised version of the manuscript, RNF10 silencing resulted in a significant decrease of GluN2A, PSD-95 and GluA1 protein levels in the total cell homogenate of both pLKO-shRNF10-infected dissociated neurons and organotypic slices. Similarly, we also show that RNF10 silencing lead to a significant reduction of the expression of OphN1 expression in experiments performed both in organotypic slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>) and dissociate neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10H</xref>).</p><p>Following the reviewers’ indications, electrophysiological experiments have been repeated with the addition of a rescue condition, namely the co-transfection of a sh-resistant form of RNF10 (Flag-RNF10). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> of the revised version of the manuscript, the effect of RNF10 silencing on mEPSCs frequency was fully rescued by co-expressing Flag-RNF10 resistant to shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A, C</xref>). Furthermore, co-transfection of FlagRNF10 fully rescued a physiological long-lasting increase of the amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>) and frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>) of mEPSCs as observed following induction of LTP.</p><p><italic>2) It is unclear how RNF10 dissociates from GluN2A by NMDAR activation. If any mechanism were involved, would it be also involved in the enhanced interaction between RNF10 and importins/Meox2? These mechanisms should be explored to some extent or discussed.</italic></p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-H</xref> of the revised version of the manuscript we have performed additional experiments to address this important issue. Firstly, we have prepared novel GST-GluN2A fusion proteins to identify more precisely the GluN2A domain involved in the interaction with RNF10. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> we found that GluN2A(991-1049) is needed for the binding to RNF10. This GluN2A intracellular domain contains the GluN2A(991-1029) domain that has been recently identified as an atypical high affinity calcium/calmodulin binding site (Bajaj G, et al., 2014, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 444: 588-94). Notably, the formation of GluN2A/calmodulin complex was strictly dependent to the presence of calcium. In agreement with these results, here we show by in vitro pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-G</xref>) and co-IP from transfected COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) that incubation with calcium/calmodulin leads to a complete disruption of the GluN2A/RNF10 complex. Overall, these new experiments indicate the existence of a competition between RNF10 and calmodulin for the binding to GluN2A that can take place following NMDA receptor activation and consequent calcium influx.</p></body></sub-article></article>
