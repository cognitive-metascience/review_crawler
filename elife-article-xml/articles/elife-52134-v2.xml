NSCs in the dentate gyrus (DG(have enigmatic elaborated apical cellular processes that are associated with BVs. Whether this contact serves as a mechanism for delivering circulating molecules is not known. Here we uncovered a previously unrecognized communication route allowing exclusive direct access of blood-borne substances to hippocampal NSCs. BBB-impermeable fluorescent tracer injected transcardially to mice is selectively uptaken by DG NSCs within a minute, via the vessel-associated apical processes. These processes, measured &gt;30 nm in diameter, establish direct membrane-to-membrane contact with endothelial cells in specialized areas of irregular endothelial basement membrane and enriched with vesicular activity. Doxorubicin, a brain-impermeable chemotherapeutic agent, is also readily and selectively uptaken by NSCs and reduces their proliferation, which might explain its problematic anti-neurogenic or cognitive side-effect. The newly-discovered NSC-BV communication route explains how circulatory neurogenic mediators are 'sensed' by NSCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>blood-brain-barrier</kwd><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd><kwd>adult neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>neurovascular unit</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>chemobrain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>322692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Licht</surname><given-names>Tamar</given-names></name><name><surname>Grunewald</surname><given-names>Myriam</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Saran</given-names></name><name><surname>Keshet</surname><given-names>Eli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1882/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sasson</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Batia</given-names></name><name><surname>Ben-Zvi</surname><given-names>Ayal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2402/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sasson</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Batia</given-names></name><name><surname>Ben-Zvi</surname><given-names>Ayal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neural stem cells in the dentate gyrus have unique cytoplasmic processes that promote privileged access to circulating factors by a unique contact point with an endothelial cell.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) serve as a source for new neurons in both the developing and adult brain. In the adult rodent brain, NSCs are confined into two locales, namely the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the DG of the hippocampus. NSCs within the DG proliferate and differentiate into granule cells (GCs) eventually integrating into the existing network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Praag et al., 2002</xref>). DG NSCs [also known as radial-glia-like cells (RGLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonaguidi et al., 2011</xref>) are distinguished by a unique, tree-like morphology with soma embedded in the subgranular zone (SGZ), a major shaft extending through the adjacent granule cell layer (GCL) and terminating in a dense network of fine cytoplasmic processes spreading in the inner molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gebara et al., 2016</xref>). The functional role of these terminal shafts (if any) has remained obscure.</p><p>Stem cell functioning in general, and of RGLs in particular, relies on microenvironmental support by various cellular and extracellular components, collectively referred to as the ‘stem cell niche’. Blood vessels (BVs) are considered an integral, indispensable component of stem cell niches, including NSC niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Licht and Keshet, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schildge et al., 2014</xref>). BV may impact stem cell performance by two different modes: via locally released blood-borne substances or via paracrinically acting factors elaborated by the endothelium ('angiocrine factors')(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rafii et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Adult hippocampal RGLs are mostly quiescent but undergo several rounds of cell division upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Encinas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pilz et al., 2018</xref>). Neurogenic rates are greatly affected by systemic cues, exemplified by exercise-enhanced neurogenesis shown to be mediated by systemic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fabel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moon et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, heterochronic parabiosis experiments have demonstrated reciprocal influences on neurogenic rates mediated by systemic factors such as CCl11 or GDF11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katsimpardi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Villeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Villeda and Wyss-Coray, 2013</xref>). Because hippocampal BVs (including those of the DG where RGLs reside) are thought to have a fully-functional BBB, the question arises how are circulating substances accessible to the brain parenchyma without a loss of BBB function?</p><p>Both SVZ-resident type B NSCs and DG-resident RGLs were shown to be intimately associated with BVs. In the SVZ, NSCs send a cellular process that wraps a capillary in the nearby striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lacar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Licht and Keshet, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mirzadeh et al., 2008</xref>). In the DG, RGLs are physically associated with BVs at both the soma side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Filippov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Licht and Keshet, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Palmer et al., 2000</xref>) and the apical side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Licht and Keshet, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Licht et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moss et al., 2016</xref>). However, the functional significance of RGL-BV engagements is not well understood. Here we examined the proposition that these RGL processes might serve as a focal conduit through which blood-borne substances can be directly transferred to RGLs in a fully-functional BBB milieu, thereby providing a mechanistic explanation of how can NSCs 'sense' circulating neurogenic mediators. Additionally, we show that systemically-injected doxorubicin (a BBB-impermeable DNA-intercalating agent used for non-cerebral tumors) can be uptaken by RGLs and provide a direct anti-mitotic mechanism for its anti-neurogenic effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RGL processes contact endothelial cells in basement membrane-reduced zones</title><p>The proposition that the thin processes extended by RGLs can serve as a bridge for transferring blood substances to RGL cell bodies requires that RGL-BV contact points are not separated by pericytes or by a basement membrane (BM) in which endothelial cells are usually invested and also constitutes an important component of the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thomsen et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies that used Nestin-GFP to label RGLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Filippov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moss et al., 2016</xref>) were limited by the fact that mural pericytes are also labeled by this reporter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nakazato et al., 2017</xref>), which makes perivascular pericytes and RGLs indistinguishable at the electron microscopy (EM) level.

Soma of DAB-labeled RGLs in the SGZ were readily discernible by their DAB dark grains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). At the inner molecular layer in the vicinity of those soma, we identified capillaries that are tightly wrapped by extra-fine (as thin as 30 nm in diameter) RGL processes labeled with DAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–g</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fine apical processes of RGLs enfold capillary BVs in the inner molecular layer.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) 3D reconstruction of the DG of Nestin-GFP mouse co-stained with CD31 for blood vessels.

This component was found to thoroughly encircle DG capillaries of the hilus and outer molecular layer. Strikingly, however, observing endothelial-RGL processes contact points in the inner molecular layer revealed that engagement with BVs takes place in endothelial surfaces distinguished by irregular BM structures (absence of a classical BM appearance), thus allowing for possible direct membrane-to-membrane contact without the barrier imposed by the BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Based on TEM images, we quantified BM coverage at RGL contact points in comparison to areas devoid of RGL and found a significant difference (Fig, 2 c).

While inaccessibility of this small molecule (543 Da) to the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ohnishi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Treat et al., 2007</xref>) has precluded its use for treating brain tumors, its use against other tumors is often associated with significant cognitive impairment, also known as ‘chemo brain’ (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">El-Agamy et al., 2019</xref>). Findings in rodents showing that dox have a dramatic negative effect on DG neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Janelsins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kitamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2018</xref>) prompted us to examine whether this seemingly paradoxical situation could be explained by direct selective uptake of systemically-administered dox by RGLs. To this end, an experimental protocol similar to the one used for following tracer trafficking was used, except that dox (6 mg/kg) replaced dextran injection. Here we took advantage of the fact that dox have the same fluorescent properties as commonly used red fluorophores thereby enabling its direct visualization in cell nuclei in PFA-fixed brain sections. The fact that systemically-injected dox does not cross to brain parenchyma was validated by showing that in all brain regions known to have a functional BBB, dox was detected only in endothelial cell nuclei (exemplified for the cortex and CA1 region of the hippocampus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), whereas in areas in which the BBB is inactive, dox-labeled nuclei were also readily detected outside the vasculature (shown for the choroid plexus and the median eminence of the hypothalamus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). An outstanding exception was dox uptake by RGLs, evidenced by significant labeling of RGL nuclei within 1–2 min from its injection into the circulation of nestin-GFP mice where co-labeling with GFP confirmed the RGL identity of dox-uptaking cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b and c</xref>). We next examined whether dox (being an anti-mitotic agent) has a negative effect on RGL proliferation. For this purpose, we injected dox at the dose of 5 mg/kg into the peritoneal cavity of Nestin-GFP mice (three injections, every other day) followed by three injections of BrdU (50 mg/kg, every 12 hr) to tag proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Notably, this chronic dox application (in comparison with the previously-used intracardial injection) does not allow for its detection in cell nuclei. Dox treatment did not have an effect on the total numbers of Nestin+ RGL population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>, right), as the majority of those cells are not proliferating. We immunostained for both the proliferation marker Ki67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>) and for BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>) to detect the proliferating RGL populations. In both cases, the numbers of proliferating RGLs have decreased significantly following dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b and c</xref>). We, therefore, suggest a direct antimitotic effect of dox as a presumable explanation for reduced neurogenesis reported in rodents treated with dox and as a possible factor in the ‘chemo-brain’ side effect of cancer patients.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Doxorubicin has limited permeability through BBB capillaries but is being uptaken by RGLs.</title><p>Doxorubicin (200 µg) was injected into the left heart ventricle of Nestin-GFP mice.

Circulatory molecules were shown to increase (or decrease) neurogenesis include specific cytokines whose circulatory levels change with age, as well as blood components accumulating in plasma following physical exercise and shown to upregulate DG neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castellano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fabel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leiter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ozek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Villeda et al., 2014</xref>).

Previously, we and others have shown that cytoplasmic processes extended by RGLs make direct contacts with nearby BVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Licht and Keshet, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Licht et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moss et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, we showed that VEGF-promoted BV rejuvenation leads to remodeling of the terminal RGL arbor and engagement with even more remote capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Licht et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, the functional significance of these physical RGL-BV associations has remained unknown until now.</p><p>We show, using EM imaging, that the fine processes of RGLs in the DG make direct contact with the membrane of nearby endothelial cell in the inner molecular layer. This contact takes place in areas with modified/reduced endothelial BM, as shown by both EM imaging and immunofluorescence/super-resolution microscopy. We also highlighted endothelial vesicular activity at the engagement points. While BBB vasculature is known to be poor in vesicular activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Zvi et al., 2014</xref>), these findings suggest that this unique connection may allow for systemic molecules to be delivered via vesicular transcytosis directly to the membrane of RGLs. Further studies are required to verify how the transfer of molecules takes place and whether this process is discriminative with regards to specific molecules.</p><p>Indiscriminative uptake may explain apparent RGL vulnerabilities to otherwise BBB-impermeable molecules. A notable, clinically-relevant example is that of the BBB-impermeable chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. A major side effect of dox is a debilitating cognitive decline affecting a considerable fraction of treated cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">El-Agamy et al., 2019</xref>) and animal studies have shown that treatment with dox is manifested in impeded neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Janelsins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kitamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rendeiro et al., 2016</xref>). However, it has been difficult to reconcile the adverse cerebral side effects of dox with the fact that it is a substrate for p-glycoprotein pumps and is not available to the brain. Our finding that systemically-injected dox is readily and efficiently uptaken by DG RGLs provides a more compelling explanation to this seeming paradox than previous suggestions arguing an indirect mechanism mediated by secondary molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Janelsins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kitamura et al., 2015</xref>). We show here that the treatment by dox decreases proliferating RGL numbers thus suggesting a cell-autonomous anti-mitotic mechanism.</p><p>We conclude that this unique NVU pathway may serve as a gateway for molecules that need to bypass the barrier or a ‘hole in the fence’ allowing for penetration of molecules that should not enter the brain. We believe that the new mode of delivery of systemic molecules to RGLs uncovered by this study, not only provides a mechanistic explanation to systemic influences on adult hippocampal neurogenesis but may also provide new means of interventional modulations of this important process.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Hippocampal neural stem cells facilitate access from circulation via apical cytoplasmic processes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Chenghua Gu (Reviewer #1); Christer Betsholtz (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The data in this report demonstrate a unique and novel type of connection between neural stem cells of the brain's dentate gyrus and vascular endothelial cells of capillaries that feed this area. The data show that these contact sites function to actively deliver blood-borne molecules to the dentate gyrus cells. The chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin is shown to be taken up specifically by dentate gyrus cells, and this leads to their reduced proliferation. These data, thus, explain why doxorubicin has cognitive side effects in spite of the fact that it should not pass the normal blood-brain barrier. These are significant novel discoveries of pathophysiological and physiological relevance. This manuscript opens new understanding of how systemic factors regulate dentate gyrus cell function in wanted and unwanted ways.</p><p>The reviewers noted the following concerns that must be thoroughly addressed.</p><p>1) The increase of transcytotic vesicles at the touching points of endothelial cells and neural stem cells is not convincingly shown. A tracer that is detectable by EM, such as HRP, should be injected into circulation to demonstrate tracer uptake by transcytotic vesicles and neural stem cells. The transcytotic vesicles in endothelial cells in touch or not in touch with neural stem cells should be quantified. EM quality should be improved.</p><p>2) The authors should quantify vesicle density in Figure 3 and confirm that these vesicles are related to transcytosis (clathrin or caveolar), and not incidental (e.g., lysosomes, Golgi vesicles).</p><p>3) Basement membrane coverage of endothelial cells in touch or not in touch with neural stem cells needs to be quantified. The authors should quantify their TEM images to strengthen their claims about a thinned BM at the BV-RGL interface. The absence of a BM is not clear in Figure 2B, especially in the top-left image where a BM appears to continuously move upwards even at the BV-RGL interface, and in Figure 3. Moreover, Figure 2I-N of prior work from Moss, et al., 2016, appear to show a BM at the BV-RGL interface.</p><p>4) Is the BM similarly thinned at BV areas covered by pericytes and astrocytes-or is this specific to RGLs? And is a BM similarly lacking in the BV-NSC interface in the SVZ? This would support specificity of BM thinning at the BV-RGL interface and thus claims regarding its role in the uptake of circulatory factors.</p><p>5) The authors suggest that the BV-RGL interface is a &quot;fully functional BBB&quot; but that rapid uptake of injected dextrans and doxorubicin is mediated by a thinned BM at the BV-RGL interface. The literature would suggest that a fully functional BBB precludes the uptake of such factors by the brain endothelial cells, upstream of access to the BM. This has been found with dextrans, HRP, and endogenous plasma proteins. Please address this discrepancy. For example, the authors could replicate established experiments on these particular BVs to determine if they are indeed fully functional, such as looking for HRP+ vesicles in endothelial cells by TEM (e.g., Ben-Zvi et al., 2014, Figure 5) and staining for endogenous plasma protein uptake (e.g., PMID 28441414, Figure 6). Relatedly, functional brain BVs are also marked by &quot;extremely low rates of transcellular vesicular transport&quot; (Ben-Zvi et al., 2014). The authors are asked to reconcile this with their findings in Figure 3.</p><p>6) The authors should tone down their conclusion or provide direct evidence for their claim that doxorubicin uptake by RGLs reduces their proliferation: do doxorubicin+ RGLs display less Ki67 and BrdU signal compared to doxorubicin- RGLs? Because doxorubicin fluoresces red, this should be visible in existing tissue slices from Figure 7B.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Hippocampal neural stem cells facilitate access from circulation via apical cytoplasmic processes&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

It is unclear whether there are general differences of basement membrane coverage within different brain regions.

This appears to be a crucial piece of data (as it was also demanded by more than one reviewer) to verify increased transcytotic activity (in a spatially very confined region). Would a double labeling of RGLs and HRP by DAB be possible? The labeled structures appear in different cells and are morphologically distinguishable. Alternatively, could this quantification be done by determining the region based on the absence of basement membrane?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52134.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The reviewers noted the following concerns that must be thoroughly addressed.</p><p>1) The increase of transcytotic vesicles at the touching points of endothelial cells and neural stem cells is not convincingly shown.

These are presented in new Figure 4. We were able to demonstrate cytoplasmic and abluminal HRP-filled vesicles. These detection methods, however, are not sensitive enough to label HRP accumulation in non-endothelial cells. Additionally, since the same specimen cannot be labeled with DAB to both injected HRP and to RFP in stem cells, we could not pinpoint the specific location of BV-NSC contact in HRP-injected specimens.</p><p>In RFP-labeled TEM images, we quantified the density of vesicular-like structures at contact points (in comparison with areas with no NSC contact) and found a significantly higher density. These vesicular-like structures were determined as circular organelles of 60-100nm. We also quantified the densities of these structures in NSC-BV contact points with or without evident basement membrane and found a significantly higher number in areas without evident BM. All of these results appear in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Basement membrane coverage of endothelial cells in touch or not in touch with neural stem cells needs to be quantified.

We found that in BV with no contacts, the majority of the abluminal aspect is surrounded by evident BM. At contact points, however, some areas do have a BM but the majority have not. These quantifications are presented in new Figure 2. Indeed, since these BM-reduced contacts are seemingly formed at specific points and not all through the NSC arm, Moss et al. presented an example of contacts that include a basement membrane (as we also do, see Figure 2C).</p><p>Figure 2B (left) was enlarged to better highlight the BM. The new image in Figure 4A better shows reduced BM at the contact points with two RGLs.</p><p>We added confocal and super-resolution microscopy images to further establish the finding of reduced BM components at contact points. New Figure 3 shows laminin immunostaining and uses both high magnification confocal images and STORM microscopy. New Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows reduced Collagen IV staining at contact points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is the BM similarly thinned at BV areas covered by pericytes and astrocytes-or is this specific to RGLs?

We have indicated in the revised manuscript (Figure 2A legends) that the BM is not thinned in contact points with pericytes and astrocytes. The pericytic contact point is characterized by a double layer of BM surrounding both the EC and the pericyte. In astrocytic endfeet (that accompany the majority of cerebral capillaries), the BM is clearly evident. Example for both is seen in Figure 2A.</p><p>We were unable to characterize the SVZ NSC-BV contact points in TEM as these contacts are rare and localized to the medial striatum near the lateral ventricles. However, we could neither identify the 10Kd tracer accumulation in SVZ NSC (see Figure 5A), therefore we believe that the case of the SVZ could be different. SVZ stem cells are also in contact with the CSF in ventricles (Mirzadeh et al., 2008) and most likely receive inputs by this route.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors suggest that the BV-RGL interface is a &quot;fully functional BBB&quot; but that rapid uptake of injected dextrans and doxorubicin is mediated by a thinned BM at the BV-RGL interface. The literature would suggest that a fully functional BBB precludes the uptake of such factors by the brain endothelial cells, upstream of access to the BM.

Relatedly, functional brain BVs are also marked by &quot;extremely low rates of transcellular vesicular transport&quot; (Ben-Zvi et al., 2014). The authors are asked to reconcile this with their findings in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that the terminology we used might not be accurate enough. We believe that BV-RGL contact points are characterized not only by thinned BM (Figure 2) but also by a higher vesicular activity (Figure 4). Therefore, while the majority of endothelial cells in the region indeed exhibit fully functional BBB properties, endothelial cells in contact with RGL (or even only sub-cellular sections of these cells) facilitate ‘non-barrier’ functions. In Figure 4, we now present HRP+ vesicles in endothelial cells. The density of vesicles at endothelial cells of the inner molecular layer is much higher than those published for capillaries elsewhere in the brain (e.g. Ben-Zvi et al., 2014).</p><p>Relevant text related to this issue was changed to better illustrate the exact hypothesis. We highlighted in the last two paragraphs of Introduction and the first paragraph of the Discussion that the hippocampus is thought to have a fully functioning BBB milieu while we found a sub-region in which the BBB is altered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should tone down their conclusion or provide direct evidence for their claim that doxorubicin uptake by RGLs reduces their proliferation: do doxorubicin+ RGLs display less Ki67 and BrdU signal compared to doxorubicin- RGLs? Because doxorubicin fluoresces red, this should be visible in existing tissue slices from Figure 7B.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a correct observation However, the protocol for doxorubicin labeling of stem cells is an acute intracardial injection. Since the chest is open, the mouse is sacrificed within 2 minutes and therefore the effect on stem cell proliferation cannot be measured. In contrast, the long-term doxorubicin exposure in the second setting used for NSC proliferation inhibition is three IP injections of doxorubicin, every other day. The doses reaching the brain in this protocol are not sufficient to be detected by fluorescence. We believe that doxorubicin accumulates equally in all NSC but affect only those who are engaged in proliferation. We added a text explaining this technical difference in dox protocols in the Results section. We also toned down this phrase in the Discussion and explained that dox potentially inhibit cell proliferation due to its penetrance to stem cells and maybe not solely by secondary mediators.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The newly introduced data in Figure 3 has been quantified by comparing blood vessels in the DG with blood vessels in cortex.

The data are presented in new Figure 3H-N, thereby also increasing the numbers of RGL-associated capillaries analyzed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2B top left panel shows a continuous basement membrane between EC and RGL.

The new image includes examples of HRP-filled vesicles near a vague BM structure (presented in Figure 4E). For comparison, we included a representative image of HRP-filledcapillary lumen aligned with an astrocyte end-feet with a clear BM and no vesicular activity (Figure 4F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is unfortunate that the authors could not quantify tracer filled vesicles at RGL-BV contact points in comparison with non-contact points.

Alternatively, could this quantification be done by determining the region based on the absence of basement membrane?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this important point, we followed the reviewer's suggestion to try a novel approach of double labeling for both RGLs termini and transcytotic endothelial vesicles with DAB (Immuno-EM with anti-RFP and secondary HRP conjugated antibody for RGL and HRP injected as tracer for vesicles). We have to admit that we found this approach technically challenging and not a trivial combination of the two protocols: Using Immuno-EM requires a very low fixative concentration, not ideal for achieving high-quality EM images. Moreover, immunostaining brain slices with anti-RFP antibody involves washing steps which interferes with the detection of HRP in BVs lumen. Nevertheless, we preformed the requested quantification based on HRP traces at the endothelial luminal surface and in vesicles. While not ideal, we believe the data indeed support the notion of increased transcytotic activity. These results are presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-D.</p></body></sub-article></article>
