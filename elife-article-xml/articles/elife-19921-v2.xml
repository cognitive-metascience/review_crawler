We show that two Notch modifiers, <italic>Lfng</italic> and <italic>Mfng,</italic> are transiently expressed precisely at the neural boundary of the organ of Corti. Cre-Lox fate mapping shows this region gives rise to inner hair cells and their associated inner phalangeal cells.

This phenotype is mimicked by other mouse mutants or pharmacological treatments that lower but not abolish Notch signaling. However, strong disruption of Notch signaling causes a very different result, generating many ectopic hair cells at the expense of inner phalangeal cells. Our results show that Notch signaling is finely calibrated in the cochlea to produce precisely tuned levels of signaling that first set the boundary of the organ of Corti and later regulate hair cell development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19921.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19921.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>inner ear</kwd><kwd>cochlea</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>hair cell</kwd><kwd>Fringe</kwd><kwd>lateral inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH DC006185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Groves</surname><given-names>Andrew K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cochlea deploys two Fringe proteins at exactly the same time and position to regulate a novel mode of Notch signaling that sets the boundary of the organ of Corti, the ear's hearing organ.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian cochlear duct is a sound transducer of exquisite mechanical sensitivity. Its sensory organ, the organ of Corti, contains mechanosensory inner and outer hair cells, surrounded by different types of supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basch et al., 2016</xref>). The organ of Corti is bounded by two populations of non-sensory epithelium, the inner and outer sulci. These three domains of the cochlear duct are induced in response to a gradient of canonical BMP signaling established by the expression of BMP4 in the future outer sulcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ohyama et al., 2010</xref>). High levels of BMP signaling promote outer sulcus differentiation, low or absent BMP signaling leads to formation of the inner sulcus, while intermediate levels of BMP signaling position the cochlear prosensory domain which will differentiate into the organ of Corti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ohyama et al., 2010</xref>). Inner hair cells, which are the first cells to differentiate in the organ of Corti, arise at the boundary of the prosensory domain and the future inner sulcus, also known as Kölliker’s organ, in response to inducing signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Groves and Fekete, 2012</xref>). Recent work has identified several candidate signals that initiate hair cell development, including the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, that promote hair cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacques et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jansson et al., 2015</xref>) and other signals, such as Shh, that hold hair cell differentiation in abeyance until they are down-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tateya et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A central question in understanding the mechanism of signaling gradients is how a continuously changing, ‘analogue’ gradient of signaling is translated into a small number of distinct, ‘digital’ domains, and how the boundaries between these domains are established. The Notch signaling pathway has been implicated in the establishment of boundaries between developmental territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artavanis-Tsakonas and Muskavitch, 2010</xref>). For example, a zone of Notch signaling is established between the dorsal and ventral halves of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker, 2007</xref>). Here, the dorsal half of the imaginal disc expresses Notch, the glycosyltransferase enzyme Fringe and the Notch ligands Delta and Serrate, while the ventral territory expresses only Delta and Notch. Fringe proteins modify Notch receptors and ligands to increase the level of Notch signaling by Delta ligands and to attenuate Notch signaling by Serrate ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rana and Haltiwanger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, the action of Fringe in the wing imaginal disc serves to attenuate Serrate-Notch signaling in the dorsal region of the disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rana and Haltiwanger, 2011</xref>), but permits a sharp boundary of Notch signaling at the boundary between dorsal and ventral halves in response to Serrate and Delta signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fortini, 2000</xref>). The situation in vertebrates is complicated by the presence of multiple Delta homologues (Dll1, 3 and 4) and two Serrate homologues, Jag1 and Jag2. Current evidence suggests that Fringe modification of Notch receptors tends to <italic>enhance</italic> signaling by Dll1 and Dll4 ligands and <italic>attenuate</italic> signaling by Jag1 and Jag2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We found that two Fringe genes, <italic>Lfng</italic> and <italic>Mfng</italic>, have an extremely dynamic expression pattern in the cochlea as the progenitor cells of the organ of Corti - the so-called prosensory domain – begin to differentiate into hair cells and supporting cells. Strikingly, we find these two genes are expressed transiently precisely where inner hair cells will differentiate, at the boundary between the prosensory domain and the non-sensory region of the cochlear duct known as Kölliker’s organ. <italic>Lfng</italic> and <italic>Mfng</italic> expression subsequently diverge as hair cells and their surrounding supporting cells differentiate. Our observations suggest that Notch signaling may act to first position the boundary between the future organ of Corti and Kölliker’s organ, and then subsequently regulate the correct formation of inner hair cells and their neighboring supporting cells. To test this, we systematically inactivated <italic>Lfng</italic> and <italic>Mfng,</italic> Notch receptors, Notch ligands, and other regulators of the Notch pathway in the developing cochlea. We find Notch signaling controls two sets of decisions at the edge of the organ of Corti. The first decision restricts the first differentiating inner hair cells and their associated supporting cells, the inner phalangeal cells, to the boundary with Kölliker’s organ. We find this fate decision is regulated by Fringe activity, requires low levels of Notch signaling and is extremely sensitive to changes in signaling strength. The second decision regulates the proportion of hair cells and supporting cells through previously characterized forms of lateral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewis, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kiernan, 2013</xref>). This fate decision does not require Fringe activity, requires higher levels of Notch signaling, and is much less sensitive to small changes in signaling strength. Our results suggest that qualitatively different forms of Notch signaling regulate different fate decisions during organ of Corti development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lunatic Fringe and Manic Fringe converge at the future inner hair cell region and are required to regulate inner hair cell and inner phalangeal cell differentiation</title><p>Previous studies reported that <italic>Lunatic Fringe</italic> (<italic>Lfng</italic>) is expressed in the cochlea in Kölliker’s organ with the Notch ligand <italic>Jag1</italic> before the formation of the first inner hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morsli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Murata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ohyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basch et al., 2011</xref>).

Jag1 is initially expressed in Kölliker’s organ with Lfng at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ohyama et al., 2010</xref>), and the expression of both genes then shifts into the differentiating prosensory domain and ultimately to supporting cells over the next 48 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morsli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Murata et al., 2006</xref>).

To test this, we performed a fate mapping experiment with Lfng-CreER transgenic mice generated with the same bacterial artificial chromosome used to produce the Lfng-GFP transgenic line . We mated Lfng-CreER transgenic mice with Ai3 ROSA Cre reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>) and administered a single dose of tamoxifen at E14. Since approximately 6–12 hr typically elapse between tamoxifen administration and the onset of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gridley and Groves, 2014</xref>), this time point allows us to map the fate of Lfng-expressing cells in the apical and middle regions of the cochlea that we observe at the prosensory domain border. Mice were sacrificed four days later at E18.5, and sections and whole mounts of the cochlea were stained for the presence of hair cells, pillar cells and the EGFP reporter. In the most apical regions of the cochlea, we observed most EGFP-labeled cells in Kölliker’s organ and very few in the inner hair cell region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with the expression of Lfng in this region between E12 and E14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morsli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ohyama et al., 2010</xref>).

However, we observed very little labeling of other organ of Corti cell types in apical or middle turn regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), suggesting that the strongly Lfng-expressing cells we observed at the border of the prosensory domain at E14-15 are progenitors of both inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells. In basal regions of the cochlea, we now observed many labeled Deiters’ cells, some labeled inner pillar cells as well as labeled inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These results are consistent with the onset of expression of Lfng in all supporting cell types except outer pillar cells in the basal region of the cochlea at E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also occasionally saw labeled outer hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), suggesting that some Deiters’ cell progenitors may differentiate into hair cells as Notch-mediated lateral inhibition establishes the precise pattern of hair cells and supporting cells in the organ of Corti.

To do this, we examined two mouse mutants that displayed a partial loss of Notch signaling in the cochlea. Pofut1 is an O-fucosyltransferase that adds fucose moieties to Notch receptors and ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takeuchi and Haltiwanger, 2010</xref>), and whose activity generates the O-fucose substrate that is necessary for further N-glycosylation of Notch receptors by Fringe proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shi and Stanley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shi et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Pofut1</italic> null mutant mice die between E9.5 and E10.5 with an axial phenotype reminiscent of a Notch loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shi and Stanley, 2003</xref>), although different tissues can display differential sensitivities to loss of <italic>Pofut1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schuster-Gossler et al., 2009</xref>). Conditional deletion of <italic>Pofut1</italic> in the cochlea with <italic>Pax2-Cre</italic> transgenic mice leads to a reduction, but not a complete loss of Notch signaling, as revealed by the presence of cleaved Notch1-intracellular protein in the nuclei of <italic>Pofut1</italic> mutant supporting cells and the enhancement of the <italic>Pofut1</italic> mutant phenotype by additional Notch inhibition with gamma secretase inhibitors in organ culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). This incomplete loss of Notch signaling suggests that at least some Notch receptors lacking O-fucose glycans can still be chaperoned to the surface of progenitor cells in the <italic>Pofut1</italic> mutant cochlea. <italic>Pofut1</italic> conditional mutant mice also exhibited both supernumerary inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), suggesting that this phenotype can be caused by a general reduction in Notch signaling. To confirm this, we also examined transgenic mice carrying a Cre-inducible dominant-negative form of MAML1, a nuclear co-factor responsible for the formation of transcriptional complexes between the Notch intracellular domain and the RBPJ co-factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kovall, 2008</xref>).

Indeed, previous studies have observed a small amount of prolonged proliferation of cochlear progenitors in Notch pathway mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kiernan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tateya et al., 2011</xref>). To distinguish between these possibilities, we administered EdU to pregnant female mice three times a day between E14.5 and E17.5 and collected embryos for analysis at E18.5. We performed these experiments in wild type, <italic>Pofut1</italic> and <italic>dnMAML1</italic> conditional mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We did not observe any significant differences in EdU labeling of outer hair cells, Deiters’ cells, pillar cells, inner hair cells or inner phalangeal cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We observed a modest but significant increase in EdU incorporation in <italic>dnMAML1</italic> border cells immediately adjacent to inner phalangeal cells (66 versus 59 labeled cells; p=0.014). To test at what stage the supernumerary inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells arose in Notch pathway mutants, we examined <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression at the leading edge of hair cell differentiation in the apex of wild type and <italic>Pofut1</italic> mutant cochleas at E15.5.

It was first proposed to regulate the production of cochleo-vestibular ganglion neurons, and later of hair cells and supporting cells by lateral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewis, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haddon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewis 1998</xref>). Notch signaling can also regulate the production of sensory patches though inductive signaling between Jag1 and Notch, leading to the up-regulation of Sox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eddison et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hartman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neves et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we identify a new and unexpected role for Notch signaling in the ear: the positioning of inner hair cells and their associated inner phalangeal cells at the boundary of Kölliker’s organ and the prosensory domain. We show that this developmental decision is exquisitely sensitive to changes in Notch signaling. We observed a striking duplication of both inner hair cells <italic>and</italic> inner phalangeal cells in five different mutant mouse models and two organ culture systems that lower, but do not eliminate, Notch signaling in the cochlea. Unlike previous studies of Notch signaling in the cochlea, these phenotypes do not resemble defects in Notch-mediated lateral inhibition that is known to occur between hair cells and supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kiernan, 2013</xref>). Only in conditions where Notch signaling is greatly reduced - such as in <italic>Notch1</italic> mutants or at high doses of Notch blocking antibodies or gamma secretase inhibitors – do we see a conversion of duplicated inner phalangeal cells into inner hair cells, suggestive of a failure of lateral inhibition between hair cells and supporting cells. Our data, together with the careful analysis of Notch1 activation in the developing cochlea performed by Murata and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Murata et al., 2006</xref>) lead us to propose a new model for the development of the organ of Corti that involves two phases of Notch signaling. Because hair cell differentiation proceeds in a basal-apical direction over a period of several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2013</xref>), we discuss the timing of these events with respect to the basal region of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19921.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of Notch function during boundary formation between the prosensory domain and Kölliker’s organ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>): Between E11 and E13, cells in the cochlear primordium express both Lfng and Jag1 in the presumptive Kölliker’s organ (KO) and prosensory domain (Pro).

We propose that starting at approximately E13, the cochlear duct receives hair cell-inducing signals that reach a peak spanning the boundary of Kölliker’s organ and the prosensory domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). There is no consensus as to the identity of these signals; they may be positively acting signals such as Wnts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacques et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jansson et al., 2015</xref>) or may reflect the withdrawal of inhibitors of hair cell induction, such as Shh, which is expressed in the neurons invading the cochlear duct in this region and is cleared from the neurons in the same basal-apical gradient as hair cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tateya et al., 2013</xref>).

This single column of differentiating hair cell progenitors sends Notch signals to its neighbors in Kölliker’s organ that prevent them from responding to hair cell-inducing signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

How can we explain this result?</p><p>Previous studies suggest that when Notch ligands and receptors are present in the same cell, they attenuate each other’s activity, a phenomenon known as <italic>cis-</italic>inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">del Alamo and Schweisguth, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">del Álamo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>).

Loss of <italic>Lfng</italic> and <italic>Mfng</italic> is predicted to cause more cis-inhibition between Notch1 and Jag1 and Jag2, and less <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition between Notch1 and Dll1. As a result of these combined changes, this column of cells will deliver less total Notch signal in <italic>Lfng/Mfng</italic> double mutants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and thus the adjacent cell column in Kölliker’s organ also differentiates into inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells.

Although this phenotype can be observed in a number of previous studies in which Notch signaling was reduced or particular Notch ligands or Notch targets were mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lanford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zine et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kiernan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tateya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdolazimi et al., 2016</xref>), the duplication of inner phalangeal cells in these studies was not identified due to the lack of specific markers for these cells. It may be necessary to re-evaluate these phenotypes in light of the present study.</p><p>Our model can also explain why mutation of <italic>Lfng</italic> alone is able to rescue the inner hair cell phenotype, but not the outer hair cell phenotype of <italic>Jag2</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>). Since Lfng normally enhances <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition between Delta ligands and Notch receptors expressed in the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>), we predict that loss of <italic>Lfng</italic> would partially relieve <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition of Dll1 expressed at the boundary and allow it to deliver more Notch signal to compensate for the loss of <italic>Jag2.</italic> We predict that <italic>Mfng</italic> mutants would rescue <italic>Jag2</italic> mutant mice in a similar manner. Although <italic>Fringe</italic> genes are often expressed in overlapping patterns, no obvious synergy has been reported in the brain, axial skeleton, limbs or cranial nerves for mutants in multiple family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moran et al., 2009</xref>). However, an interaction between <italic>Lfng, Rfng</italic> and <italic>Mfng</italic> has been observed in the maturation of marginal zone B cell precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Song et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that in at least some cases, the combined effects of these three enzymes on Notch signaling in either <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> cannot be achieved by either alone.</p><p>We found no strong evidence for the supernumerary inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells being caused by an increase in proliferation. Our EdU labeling comparisons between wild type, <italic>Pofut1</italic> and dnMAML1 mutant mice showed no significant increase in labeling of inner phalangeal cells, inner hair cells or any other organ of Corti cell type. A previous study described significant increases in proliferation in the progenitors of pillar cells, Deiters’ cells and Hensen’s cells in <italic>Dll1<sup>+/−</sup>;Jag2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Dll1<sup>hyp/−</sup>;Jag2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutant embryos, but not single mutants for either ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kiernan et al., 2005</xref>). We infer from this that the reduction in Notch signaling in all our Notch pathway mutants (with the exception of <italic>Notch1</italic> conditional mutants) is insufficient to trigger aberrant proliferation, and that our phenotype is due solely to a disruption in the boundary between the prosensory domain and Kölliker’s organ.</p><p>It is now well established that the strength of Notch signaling in vertebrates can vary according to both the identity and post-translational modification of the activated Notch receptor and the identity of the activating ligand (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamamoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Van de Walle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Petrovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gama-Norton et al., 2015</xref>). The developing organ of Corti is an excellent system to study the strength of Notch signaling, as its stereotyped pattern of hair cells and different supporting cell types allows extremely small irregularities in cell numbers to be detected easily. Our data provide an example of how rapid dynamic changes in both Notch ligands (Jag1, Jag2, and Dll1) and regulatory Fringe proteins at the boundary of the organ of Corti can quickly transition between Notch signaling states that set the boundary (moderate Notch signaling; regulated by Fringe proteins) and then distinguish between hair cells and supporting cells (high Notch signaling; no requirement for Fringe proteins). Moreover, our observation that the early phase of Notch signaling is extremely sensitive to changes in signaling strength suggests that the Hes or Hey genes activated in this phase will have mostly low-affinity binding sites for the Rbpj transcriptional activator in their promoters. Indeed, low levels of Notch activation and Hes/Hey gene expression are observed at this boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Murata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tateya et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>Hes5</italic>, whose promoter contains low-affinity Rbpj binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ong et al., 2006</xref>), is up-regulated at the boundary of Kölliker’s organ as hair cells differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tateya et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Hes5</italic> mutant mice develop supernumerary inner hair cells and supporting cells at the onset of hair cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zine et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Our results provide additional evidence for the notion that organ of Corti development is an iterative process proceeding in the neural-abneural direction, with inner hair cells and their associated supporting cells differentiating first, which then release inducing signals such as Fgf8 that then drive the differentiation of the adjacent cells into pillar cells. It is likely that these short-range signals interact with and modify other patterning signals in the cochlear duct, such as FGF10 and FGF20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Urness et al., 2015</xref>), although signals that promote specific cell fates in the outer hair cell region, such as outer hair cells and Deiters’ cells, remain to be identified. We do not know the nature of signals that limit the size of the organ of Corti on the abneural side of the cochlear duct, but given the proximity of a strong source of BMP4 in the future outer sulcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morsli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ohyama et al., 2010</xref>), it is likely that this factor may play a role. Nevertheless, our data reveal how the deployment of the Notch pathway-modifying enzymes Lfng and Mfng at the boundary of the future organ of Corti modulate levels of Notch signaling to restrict hair cell-inducing signals to a precise location at this boundary. Since Lfng and Mfng expression subsequently diverge, with Mfng restricted to hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2015</xref>) and Lfng restricted to supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>), it will be of interest to determine whether these enzymes continue to play any role in modulating Notch signaling in the mature organ of Corti.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>Double homozygous <italic>Lfng</italic> and <italic>Mfng</italic> mutant embryos were generated by crossing <italic>Mfng</italic> homozygous mutant mice (B6(FVB)-<italic>Mfng<sup>tm1.1Cfg</sup></italic>/Mmucd; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5615604">MGI:5615604</ext-link>) obtained from the Functional Glycomics Consortium; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.functionalglycomics.org">http://www.functionalglycomics.org</ext-link> and available at the MMRRC, stock number 031948-UCD) with heterozygous <italic>Lfng</italic> mice (B6;129S1-<italic>Lfng<sup>tm1Grid</sup></italic>/J; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:010619">IMSR_JAX:010619</ext-link>) from the Jackson Laboratory (stock number 010619), and crossing the resulting compound mutant offspring.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Tanya Whitfield, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Fernando Giraldez (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an interesting study that addresses the role of Fringe family proteins in regulating Notch signalling in the developing organ of Corti of the mammalian inner ear. Notch signalling is known to pattern the organ of Corti, and Fringe proteins are also known for their role in fine-tuning Notch signalling in other systems. The new finding here is that regulation of Notch signalling by Fringe plays a role in the generation of inner hair cells and their associated supporting cells, the inner phalangeal cells, in the cochlear duct. A surprising result is that a partial loss of Notch signalling results in both supernumerary hair cells and supernumerary supporting cells. This differs from the classical model for lateral inhibition in the developing cochlea, where a disruption of Notch signalling is predicted to result in supernumerary hair cells at the expense of supporting cells. The data are clear and well-presented, with careful and appropriate quantitation, use of controls and statistical analysis.</p><p>All three reviewers were positive towards the work and found it interesting, novel and potentially important. They praise the careful approach and high quality of the data presented. However, there was consensus that the manuscript needed revision in places, especially with respect to the focus on cis-inhibition. The revisions must therefore include:</p><p>1) Improved clarity of the explanations of cis-inhibition, and the relative roles of Fng proteins and DSL ligands in regulating Notch activity.</p><p>2) The argument that levels of Notch activity differ in different cell types and regions of the cochlear duct is critical to the model. Further experimental support for the claim that Notch signalling activity levels differ both over time and in different cell types in the developing cochlear duct is required (see comments from reviewers 2 and 3).</p><p>3) Further experimental support for cis-inhibition and the effects of Fng on cis-inhibition in the developing cochlear duct is required. If this cannot be provided, the argument for cis-inhibition should be presented as an untested model and the overall focus on cis-inhibition in the manuscript should be toned down.</p><p>4) Strengthen the claim that Lfng marks developing inner hair cells, as suggested by reviewer 3.</p><p>5) Addressing additional comments in the following reviews is at the authors' discretion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) The authors show that they can phenocopy the Fng mutant phenotype with the Jag2 mutant. The information presented in the Introduction indicates that Fng acts differentially on Dl-N and Jag/Ser-N interactions, whereas in the first paragraph of the subsection “Reduction in Notch signaling leads to the formation of supernumerary inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells”, it is stated that Fng can potentiate signalling through Notch from both Dll1 and Jag2. It would therefore be interesting to know whether a Dll1 phenotype also phenocopies the Fng and Jag2 results. I appreciate that this may be beyond the scope of the current study, but would the authors predict a similar or a different result?</p><p>2) If Fng proteins are required for precision fine-tuning of Notch signalling, why is the system so robust to perturbations in one or the other Fng, and a phenotype is only seen when the functions of both genes are lost?</p><p>3) I am not really sure why the authors propose that their findings argue for a new role for Notch (Discussion, first paragraph); an interpretation could be that this is just another illustration of lateral induction, albeit in a restricted zone of the cochlea. Can the authors provide more information as to why they do not think this is the case?</p><p>4) Is extension of the cochlea normal? Are there more cells overall, or are they packed in a different way due to altered shape of the organ?</p><p>5) In trying to get to grips with the terminology here, I find that the terms 'lateral inhibition' (involving activation of Notch signalling) and 'cis-inhibition' (involving attenuation of Notch signalling) are potentially confusing/ambiguous and difficult to follow.</p><p>For example, the following statement is made in the Introduction: 'In vertebrates, Lfng and Mfng proteins regulate receptor-ligand interactions in cis in the same way as they do in trans: they increase cis-inhibition between Notch and Δ ligands, while attenuating cis-inhibition between Notch and Serrate/Jagged ligands (LeBon et al. 2014)'.</p><p>The wording 'in the same way' here is confusing, because it appears to be the opposite to the information given in the second paragraph of the Introduction, where it is stated that Fng proteins increase the level of Notch signalling by Δ. If Fng increases cis-inhibition between N and Dl (later in the aforementioned paragraph), given the information presented, that should lead to a decrease in Notch signalling activity in the Notch-expressing cell.</p><p>Likewise, the statement that Fng proteins 'attenuate Notch signaling by Serrate/Jagged ligands' (Introduction, second paragraph) appears to be contradictory to that later in the aforementioned paragraph where Fng proteins function by 'attenuating cis-inhibition between Notch and Serrate/Jagged ligands' (which in other words would potentiate Notch signalling via Ser/Jag).</p><p>I appreciate that the terms 'lateral inhibition' and 'cis-inhibition' are now entrenched in the literature, but I, for one, find the explanations above contradictory and feel that more clarification is needed. If the authors can make sure that their text is completely unambiguous that would be helpful.</p><p>6) I don't see how the descriptions of Fng activity in the Introduction (second paragraph) are illustrated in the summary diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). If Fng potentiates Dl-N cis-inhibitory interaction, but attenuates Jag-N cis-inhibitory interaction, the dotted arrow from Fng to Jag-N in the green cell should be drawn as an inhibitory line (-|), not an arrow, and the cis-inhibitory interactions between Dl and N should be stronger (thicker lines) in the green cell than those in the white cell, whereas the diagram shows the opposite. These apparent discrepancies make it hard to follow the argument.</p><p>7) In the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the statement 'As a result, these cells do not respond to hair cell-inducing signals' seems to contradict the sentence at the beginning of the section describing panel B, which states that these cells are responding to hair cell-inducing signals, and have been shaded green to indicate this. If the sentence refers to the neighbouring cells, the 'these' is ambiguous, and the sentence does not follow logically from the previous one. If the authors mean that the green cells have responded to hair cell-inducing signals, but have not yet received instruction to undergo final differentiation into hair cells (as in C), this needs clarifying further.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper by Basch et al. is a very interesting analysis of the function of Fringe proteins in hair cell patterning in the ear. The main and certainly interesting aspect of the work is the disclosure of a very specific function of Fng proteins in cochlear development and the exploration of their association with Notch signalling. The experiments are extremely careful and beautifully presented, and there is no doubt about the consistency of the various phenotypes and treatments. Data are of high quality and involve a variety of approaches including lineage tracing, phenotypic analysis, organ culture, etc., all making it a robust piece of work. The authors propose an interesting model that involves Notch activity levels and cis- and trans- modes of ligand operation to accommodate the results and with those of the literature. However, it is here where the work requires some improvement.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that the expression of Lfng and Mfng are restricted to sensory patch. Although the expression patterns are overlapping, they are quite dissimilar. This suggests that modulation of Notch is different in the two cell types. Could it be that Lfng and Mfng have different effects on different ligands? Is it possible that Lfng maintains a low and constant Notch activity and Mfng favours Dll signalling?</p><p>No doubt about the specificity of the combination of Lfng+Mfng for the correct development of the inner row. However, the correlation with Notch signalling levels remains obscure. Lfng+Mfng phenotype gives an expanded inner cell row, and this is paralleled by the loss of Jag2, but also of Jag1. Jag1 is expressed all throughout prosensory development and in supporting cells, but Jag2 is expressed along with Dll1 only in hair cells. How this is matched?</p><p>2) Lineage tracing. Those are interesting experiments and show that almost the complete sensory epithelium derives from Lfng expressing progenitors (probably also from Jag1-positive ones). However, genetic tracing shows the common origin of the sensory epithelium, but not much about the restricted expression. In this view, the genetic tracing of Manic cells would have been of interest, because it seems that the uniqueness of the effects may come from the co-expression.</p><p>3) Fng LOF is mimicked by low Notch. That is the main line of the argument along the paper. But from here, I would expect the authors to consider how this could happen by showing the effects of Fng on ligands or on Notch activity would have been informative. Neither it is clear to me whether the levels of Notch affect the expression of modulators or vice versa. We do not really know how Notch operates outside lateral inhibition and all possibilities should remain open.</p><p>4) As to the levels of Notch activation, indeed, the observations fit well with the Murata paper. But nevertheless, the different conditions generated by the experiments in the paper open some questions about what are the levels of Notch in the different regions of the sensory epithelium. In this sense, conditions are not strictly comparable. Mfng and Lfng show overlapping but different expression domains, and in MAM and Pofut CKO or DAPT experiments, the decrease of Notch is ubiquitous. Can this be assessed specifically for Fng mutants? Please comment on that.</p><p>5) The data in the bar diagrams of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> indicate that there is an inverse correlation between Notch activity, Hes/Hey expression and the production of hair cells. And it shows the differential sensitivity of inner and outer hair cells to Notch. This is in good correspondence with MAMl and Pofut experiments. But what about in Fng mutants? It would have been interesting to see Hes/Hey levels in Fng mutants.</p><p>6) Cis-inhibition: The experiments say little about cis-inhibition. &quot;Lfng activity attenuates Jag1-Notch signaling between cells (Hicks et al. 2000; Rana and Haltiwanger 2011) and promotes Jag1-Notch cis-inhibition in the same cell, with the result…&quot; I am not sure how the second sentence follows the first and, moreover, whether it is a general true at all. Is there a good evidence for cis-inhibition in ear sensory cells? The results from Daudet's lab indicate rather the opposite for Dll1.</p><p>The argument on cis-inhibition continues in the second and third paragraphs of the Discussion, quoting LeBon 2014 as if an ear paper…: &quot;we hypothesize that this column of cells only delivers a moderate level of Notch signaling, due to active cis-inhibition between the Notch ligands and Notch receptors that can occur in the same cell&quot;. However, the experiments do not provide any evidence of that occurring in the ear…</p><p>In summary, the results are indeed sound and of general interest, but as to the model, it is unclear that the function of Fng on Notch and cis-inhibition are sufficiently substantiated. Leaving aside cis-inhibition, which actually I see out of the paper, the model still needs a link between Fng, ligands and Notch in the cochlea. Something that may give a hint of what are the effects of Fng on Notch, Notch ligands or Fng. The main evidence for the model is correlative, the parallel between phenotypes. The main question, in my view, is what is the connection between both.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The organ of Corti is characterized by strikingly precise rows of hair cells, although how this precision is established is not known. This manuscript by Basch et al., proposes a novel form of Notch signaling that sets up the boundary of the initial row of inner hair cells, in which Fringe proteins, modulators of Notch signaling, are an essential component. The authors show that Lfng and Mng are initially precisely positioned at the location of the first inner hair cell row. In their absence, multiple rows form, along with a duplication of supporting cells. By comparing the results of minor reductions in Notch signaling to more robust loss of Notch, the authors suggest that establishment of the initial row of hair cells is inherently different in that it requires lower levels of Notch signaling, and is therefore more susceptible to mild reductions in Notch signaling. Overall the data is well-performed and presented, and the authors analyze quite a number of different Notch mutants to determine differences. The authors put forward an interesting hypothesis as to why the hair cell genesis is initially restricted to a single row. However, it is not clearly established that a lower level of Notch signaling is required for boundary formation – while milder defects in Notch signaling may first lead to an expansion of the sensory domain, it may be that the non-sensory regions (or supporting cells outside the hair cell regions) are simply more sensitive to loss of Notch signaling, and thus boundary formation is lost first.</p><p>The authors suggest that cis-inhibition mediated by Lfng and Mfng expression results in moderate levels of Notch activation in nearby Kolliker's cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and that this is important for setting up the boundary. However, in this case the prediction would be that deleting both fringes would lead to higher levels of Notch, as cis-inhibition would be largely relieved. However, this does not seem to be the case, as new hair cells develop, suggesting Notch activity is reduced in their absence. Since the model indicates that moderate levels of Notch activity are important for setting up this boundary, it would be important to show directly how levels of Notch are regulated at the boundary.</p><p>It is not clear that severe loss of Notch signaling shows an inherently different phenotype than milder forms. Is it not more likely that the severe loss obscures the initial milder phenotype? After all, there is a dramatic loss of boundary formation in the severe cases of loss of Notch signaling. While additional supporting cells are present in the milder cases, these may be induced by the excess hair cells, which themselves also convert to hair cells in the case of more severe reductions in Notch.</p><p>If the regulation of inner hair cell formation to a single row is not via lateral inhibition, what type of signaling is it? It would seem that even at the proposed lower levels the cell expressing the ligand is inhibiting nearby cells (in Kolliker's organ) from adopting the hair cell fate, and therefore this would fit the definition of lateral inhibition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>The authors show that Lfng likely initially marks the inner hair cell using fate-mapping, although given that they have reporters for both Lfng and Atoh1-it seems relatively straightforward to show that these both overlap during differentiation, further strengthening the hypothesis that Lfng and Mfng mark the inner hair cell boundary. It would also be interesting to look at the onset of these factors-Does Lfng mark the inner hair cell prior to Atoh1? Or vice versa?</p><p>The suggestion that Lfng modulates Jag1 levels initially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) has not been demonstrated previously-is there any evidence of this from the Lfng loss of function? If not this part of the model should be modified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19921.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] All three reviewers were positive towards the work and found it interesting, novel and potentially important.

We had spent a number of years characterizing the cochlear phenotypes of a number of different Notch mutants. In mutant after mutant, we kept observing a duplication of inner hair cells AND inner phalangeal cells, which did not fit in with the standard lateral inhibition model of Notch signaling that distinguishes between hair cells and supporting cells. The common thread in all our mutants was that they reduced, but did not completely abolish, Notch signaling. We were also able to confirm this phenotype in culture by quantitatively reducing Notch signaling with small doses of different Notch inhibitors.</p><p>Our results are consistent with a model in which a column of differentiating progenitor cells that express Atoh1, Jag1, Jag2 and Dll1 is induced at the boundary of the future organ of Corti. This column of cells sends a Notch signal to the adjacent cells in Kölliker’s organ and stops them adopting the same Atoh1+ fate. Thus, deleting Notch ligands, or genes that are required for receiving Notch signals reduces this inhibitory signal and causes a second column of cells to form, duplicating both the inner hair cells and the inner phalangeal cells.</p><p>In the course of this work, we realized that this column of boundary cells was transiently marked by expression of Lfng and Mfng. We verified this by fate mapping with our Lfng-CreER mice. When we examined Lfng/Mfng double knockouts, we observed the same duplication phenotype seen in all our other Notch pathway mutants. We have now also examined activated Notch protein levels and find reduced Notch signaling in these double mutants. Our Lfng and Mfng expression data and double knockout results are therefore consistent with Lfng and Mfng acting in this column of cells to promote Notch signaling from this column to adjacent cells. The question is: how do they do this?</p><p>In principle, there are two mechanisms by which Fringe proteins can regulate the amount of Notch signal delivered by a cell. One is direct glycosylation of Notch ligands by Fringe, rather than Notch receptors. Although this has been shown to occur in vitro, there is very little published data on the biological relevance of these modifications, and what data there is suggests that Fringe modification of the ligands is not necessary for their function. The second mechanism is the regulation of cis-inhibition by Fringe proteins between Notch receptors and ligands in the same cell, which reduces the activity of both receptor and ligand. The best evidence for cis-inhibition and the role of Fringe proteins in this mechanism comes from <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics and cell line studies rather than from in vivo vertebrate studies, but the phenomenon is nevertheless well accepted in the literature.</p><p>There is no reliable marker to detect cis-inhibition, as it is simply an attenuation of Notch signaling under certain circumstances. We therefore stress that we are invoking cis-inhibition as an <italic>explanation</italic> for our experimental data, rather than observing it directly. We are happy to consider other explanations if the reviewers can suggest some, but cis-inhibition is the best explanation we have for the Lfng/Mfng double mutant phenotype at present. We have tried to explain the phenomenon of cis-inhibition more clearly in the revised manuscript. We have also included more data on the amount of Notch signaling seen in Lfng/Mfng mutants to support our explanation. Finally, in recognition of the fact that much of our data on loss of function mutants does not involve Fringe activity directly, we have revised the title of the paper to focus more on Notch signaling and less on Fringe function.</p><p><italic>2) The argument that levels of Notch activity differ in different cell types and regions of the cochlear duct is critical to the model. Further experimental support for the claim that Notch signalling activity levels differ both over time and in different cell types in the developing cochlear duct is required (see comments from reviewers 2 and 3).</italic></p><p>We have now added data showing how levels of Notch signaling change in Lfng;Mfng double knockouts and how this is reflected by changes in cell fate only at the border of the organ of Corti. We hope that this data, together with the demonstration from multiple mouse knockouts and culture experiments that different regions of the cochlea are differentially affected by reduction of Notch signaling demonstrates that Notch activity differs in different regions of the cochlea.</p><p><italic>3) Further experimental support for cis-inhibition and the effects of Fng on cis-inhibition in the developing cochlear duct is required. If this cannot be provided, the argument for cis-inhibition should be presented as an untested model and the overall focus on cis-inhibition in the manuscript should be toned down.</italic></p><p>As mentioned above, we have now reduced our emphasis of this phenomenon in the revision and have clarified our explanation of its effect on Notch signaling as it relates to the Lfng/Mfng phenotype. We would emphasize that there is no <italic>specific method</italic> of detecting cis-inhibition, other than observing changes in the strength of Notch signaling after manipulations that are predicted to increase or reduce cis-inhibition. We have now provided more data on Notch signaling strength in Lfng/Mfng mutants in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) Strengthen the claim that Lfng marks developing inner hair cells, as suggested by reviewer 3.</italic></p><p>We have shown that Lfng, Atoh1 and Mfng co-localize transiently in the cochlea and that some Lfng-expressing cells go on to form inner hair cells by using Lfng-CreER mice. These events happen before more mature hair cell markers (such as Myosin7a) are expressed, and so we feel this is the best data we can propose in support of this argument. We discuss this issue further in our response to reviewer 3, below.</p><p><italic>5) Addressing additional comments in the following reviews is at the authors' discretion.</italic></p><p>We have added responses to all the comments from the reviewers below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors show that they can phenocopy the Fng mutant phenotype with the Jag2 mutant. The information presented in the Introduction indicates that Fng acts differentially on Dl-N and Jag/Ser-N interactions, whereas in the first paragraph of the subsection “Reduction in Notch signaling leads to the formation of supernumerary inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells”, it is stated that Fng can potentiate signalling through Notch from both Dll1 and Jag2. It would therefore be interesting to know whether a Dll1 phenotype also phenocopies the Fng and Jag2 results. I appreciate that this may be beyond the scope of the current study, but would the authors predict a similar or a different result?</italic></p><p>We have revised the manuscript to try and resolve this confusion. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fringe literature suggests that in most cases characterized to date, Fringe modifications potentiate Δ signaling and attenuate Serrate signaling. In vertebrates, the situation is a more complicated, as there are two Serrate homologues, Jag1 and Jag2 and multiple Δ ligands. Current evidence strongly suggests that Jag1 acts like Serrate in flies: Fringe modification tends to attenuate Jag1 signaling. This was shown most recently and in greatest detail by a recent cell line study in <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>LeBon et al., “Fringe proteins modulate Notch-ligand cis and trans interactions to specify signaling states”. <italic>eLife</italic>. 2014 Sep 25;3:e02950.</p><p>However, there are almost no published data on the effects of Fringe proteins on Jag2 signaling. As the reviewer mentions, we found one study that suggests Lunatic Fringe <italic>potentiates</italic> Jag2 signaling in a similar manner to Δ ligands rather than attenuating it as is the case for Jag1:</p><p>Van de Walle et al., “Jagged2 acts as a Δ-like Notch ligand during early hematopoietic cell fate decisions”. Blood. 2011;117(17):4449-59.</p><p>Although we cited this for the sake of completeness, the potentiation of Jag2 signaling by Lfng observed by the authors in this study, although statistically significant, was extremely small – an increase in signaling of just 1.15 times. We have therefore decided to remove this citation from the paper. Moreover, unpublished data recently communicated to us by the Elowitz lab (the authors of the 2014 <italic>eLife</italic> paper above) suggests that Lfng and Mfng modification of Notch receptors attenuates both Jag1 and Jag2 signaling. We have therefore revised the manuscript to reflect the best available evidence; namely that Fringe proteins potentiate Δ signaling and attenuate Jagged signaling.</p><p>The published work of Kiernan et al. (2005) looking at Dll1 nulls and hypomorphs, and Brooker et al. (2006) looking at Dll1 conditional mutants in the ear suggest that loss of Dll1 will cause a similar phenotype to what we observe in Jag2 mutants. However, as the reviewer notes, we do not have access to the Dll1 conditional allele, and so we cannot perform this study in a timely fashion. Nevertheless, we agree that it is an excellent experiment, and we have included our prediction about the Dll1 conditional phenotype in the revision.</p><p><italic>2) If Fng proteins are required for precision fine-tuning of Notch signalling, why is the system so robust to perturbations in one or the other Fng, and a phenotype is only seen when the functions of both genes are lost?</italic></p><p>Our data on the expression of Lfng and Mfng shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> suggests that Mfng appears in hair cell progenitors at approximately the same time as Atoh1. Lfng, on the other hand is much more dynamic – it is expressed first in the GER/Kolliker’s organ, then localizes to the same Atoh1-expressing cells as Mfng at the boundary of the organ of Corti, and finally ends up in supporting cells. Thus, there is only one time and place at which the expression of these two Fringe proteins occurs in the same cell type – exactly at the boundary of the organ of Corti as the first Atoh1-expressing hair cell progenitors. It is here that we observe the phenotype reported in our paper. We therefore believe that Lfng and Mfng have redundant functions at this boundary, such that loss of either Fringe gene does not alter the patterning of the boundary.</p><p>We do not know why knockouts of either gene alone show no obvious patterning phenotype in other regions of the organ of Corti, but presumably this is because changing Notch signaling by small amounts has no effect elsewhere. That said, it should be noted that we have not examined adult Lfng or Mfng mutant mice, and it is possible that they have subtle phenotypes, such as premature hair cell loss or abnormal hearing thresholds. We have tried to emphasize these points better in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We noted in the text that work by Gridley and Kelley (2000) shows that mutation of Lfng can rescue the inner hair cell phenotype of Jag2 mutants, but not the outer hair cell phenotype. This again reinforces the unique sensitivity of the boundary region to Notch signaling. Our results predict that Mfng mutants would rescue Jag2 mutants in a similar manner to Lfng mutants, and we have added this prediction to the text.</p><p><italic>3) I am not really sure why the authors propose that their findings argue for a new role for Notch (Discussion, first paragraph); an interpretation could be that this is just another illustration of lateral induction, albeit in a restricted zone of the cochlea. Can the authors provide more information as to why they do not think this is the case?</italic></p><p>The reason we believe the column of future inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells is inhibiting their neighbors though the Notch pathway is that when we <italic>reduce</italic> but not abolish Notch signaling, either by deleting Notch ligands or Notch signaling partners we see an extra row of inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells. This seems to represent an inhibitory, rather than an inductive interaction.</p><p><italic>4) Is extension of the cochlea normal? Are there more cells overall, or are they packed in a different way due to altered shape of the organ?</italic></p><p>We have observed no significant differences in cochlear length in any of our mutants. We do see more organ of Corti cells in all our mutants, but this is due to the extra row of inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells seen when we reduce Notch signaling. We also observe some lateral inhibition defects in the Notch mutants that change the proportion of hair cells and supporting cells, some of which have been previously published (e.g. Jag1 heterozygotes and Jag2 nulls).</p><p><italic>5) In trying to get to grips with the terminology here, I find that the terms 'lateral inhibition' (involving activation of Notch signalling) and 'cis-inhibition' (involving attenuation of Notch signalling) are potentially confusing/ambiguous and difficult to follow.</italic></p><p><italic>For example, the following statement is made in the Introduction: 'In vertebrates, Lfng and Mfng proteins regulate receptor-ligand interactions in cis in the same way as they do in trans: they increase cis-inhibition between Notch and Δ ligands, while attenuating cis-inhibition between Notch and Serrate/Jagged ligands (LeBon et al. 2014)'.</italic></p><p><italic>The wording 'in the same way' here is confusing, because it appears to be the opposite to the information given in the second paragraph of the Introduction, where it is stated that Fng proteins increase the level of Notch signalling by Δ. If Fng increases cis-inhibition between N and Dl (later in the aforementioned paragraph), given the information presented, that should lead to a decrease in Notch signalling activity in the Notch-expressing cell.</italic></p><p><italic>Likewise, the statement that Fng proteins 'attenuate Notch signaling by Serrate/Jagged ligands' (Introduction, second paragraph) appears to be contradictory to that later in the aforementioned paragraph where Fng proteins function by 'attenuating cis-inhibition between Notch and Serrate/Jagged ligands' (which in other words would potentiate Notch signalling via Ser/Jag).</italic></p><p><italic>I appreciate that the terms 'lateral inhibition' and 'cis-inhibition' are now entrenched in the literature, but I, for one, find the explanations above contradictory and feel that more clarification is needed. If the authors can make sure that their text is completely unambiguous that would be helpful.</italic></p><p>To clarify one point for the reviewer (in the opening sentence of point 5), lateral inhibition is the inhibition of <italic>cell fate</italic> that is delivered from one cell to a neighbor. Thus, neurons deploy Notch ligands to inhibit neural progenitors from adopting a neuronal fate, hair cells deploy Notch ligands to inhibit supporting cells from adopting a hair cell fate and so forth. Cis-inhibition, on the other hand, is a <italic>protein-protein interaction</italic> that occurs when a Notch receptor and a ligand are expressed in the same cell and interact with each other. This interaction reduces the amount of free receptor and ligand in the cell, thus lowering the ability of the cell to both send and receive Notch signals. The amount of cis-inhibition that occurs between receptors and ligands in a cell can be regulated by Fringe: Fringe enhances the interaction between Δ and Notch in the same cell (and thus increases cis-inhibition), but decreases the interaction between Jag1/2 and Notch in the same cell (and thus decreases cis-inhibition).</p><p>As the reviewer points out, the concept and terminology of cis-inhibition are now embedded in the literature for better or worse. Nevertheless, we are sympathetic to the potential for confusion and have rewritten these parts of the manuscript to try to clarify this issue.</p><p><italic>6) I don't see how the descriptions of Fng activity in the Introduction (second paragraph) are illustrated in the summary diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). If Fng potentiates Dl-N cis-inhibitory interaction, but attenuates Jag-N cis-inhibitory interaction, the dotted arrow from Fng to Jag-N in the green cell should be drawn as an inhibitory line (-|), not an arrow, and the cis-inhibitory interactions between Dl and N should be stronger (thicker lines) in the green cell than those in the white cell, whereas the diagram shows the opposite. These apparent discrepancies make it hard to follow the argument.</italic></p><p>As mentioned in point 1 above, we have now tried to clarify what is known about the effects of Fringe on Jag1, Jag2 and Dll1 and we have revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> accordingly. We hope the revision makes this clearer.</p><p><italic>7) In the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the statement 'As a result, these cells do not respond to hair cell-inducing signals' seems to contradict the sentence at the beginning of the section describing panel B, which states that these cells are responding to hair cell-inducing signals, and have been shaded green to indicate this. If the sentence refers to the neighbouring cells, the 'these' is ambiguous, and the sentence does not follow logically from the previous one. If the authors mean that the green cells have responded to hair cell-inducing signals, but have not yet received instruction to undergo final differentiation into hair cells (as in C), this needs clarifying further.</italic></p><p>We have modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in response to comments from the reviewers, and we have also revised the legend and description of the figure to make it clearer. We have also added another figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) to try and better explain the mutant phenotypes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>The paper by Basch et al. is a very interesting analysis of the function of Fringe proteins in hair cell patterning in the ear. The main and certainly interesting aspect of the work is the disclosure of a very specific function of Fng proteins in cochlear development and the exploration of their association with Notch signalling. The experiments are extremely careful and beautifully presented, and there is no doubt about the consistency of the various phenotypes and treatments. Data are of high quality and involve a variety of approaches including lineage tracing, phenotypic analysis, organ culture, etc., all making it a robust piece of work. The authors propose an interesting model that involves Notch activity levels and cis- and trans- modes of ligand operation to accommodate the results and with those of the literature. However, it is here where the work requires some improvement.</italic></p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that the expression of Lfng and Mfng are restricted to sensory patch. Although the expression patterns are overlapping, they are quite dissimilar. This suggests that modulation of Notch is different in the two cell types. Could it be that Lfng and Mfng have different effects on different ligands? Is it possible that Lfng maintains a low and constant Notch activity and Mfng favours Dll signalling?</italic></p><p>To date, the only strong <italic>quantitative</italic> evidence for the function of Fringe modifications on Notch signaling comes from cell line culture systems, such as the one used by the Elowitz group in their 2014 <italic>eLife</italic> paper. In that paper, they found no difference between the effect of Lfng and Mfng on Notch signaling, although they did find that Rfng behaved a little differently to the other two Fringe proteins. Moreover, there are only a few documented cases – including our study – where multiple Fringe knockouts have a more severe phenotype than Lfng alone. So, while it is <italic>possible</italic> that Lfng and Mfng have different but related functions in the cochlea, the tools and markers we currently have at our disposal cannot reveal this.</p><p><italic>No doubt about the specificity of the combination of Lfng+Mfng for the correct development of the inner row. However, the correlation with Notch signalling levels remains obscure. Lfng+Mfng phenotype gives an expanded inner cell row, and this is paralleled by the loss of Jag2, but also of Jag1. Jag1 is expressed all throughout prosensory development and in supporting cells, but Jag2 is expressed along with Dll1 only in hair cells. How this is matched?</italic></p><p>Our claim in the manuscript is that the newly differentiating Atoh1+ progenitors at the edge of the organ of Corti signal to their neighbors in Kölliker’s organ and prevents them from adopting the same fate. Our data shows that reducing the amount of Notch signaling delivered by these Atoh1+ cells or received by the Kölliker’s organ cells by even a small amount causes the adjacent Kölliker’s organ cells to adopt an Atoh1+ progenitor fate. We show this small reduction can be achieved in multiple ways, including by removing one copy of Jag1. In these cases, the genes we are knocking out are expressed broadly, but the effects are confined to the future inner hair cell region. Our conclusion is that this region is most sensitive to changes in Notch signaling.</p><p><italic>2) Lineage tracing. Those are interesting experiments and show that almost the complete sensory epithelium derives from Lfng expressing progenitors (probably also from Jag1-positive ones). However, genetic tracing shows the common origin of the sensory epithelium, but not much about the restricted expression. In this view, the genetic tracing of Manic cells would have been of interest, because it seems that the uniqueness of the effects may come from the co-expression.</italic></p><p>We agree that Mfng-Cre mice would have been a more specific way to show that inner phalangeal cells and inner hair cells derived from a common Mfng-expressing progenitor. However, those mice are not available to our knowledge, and we instead used Lfng-CreER mice that were developed in our lab for other purposes (such as mapping the fates of the early Lfng+ neurosensory domain, and for modifying genes in postnatal Lfng+ supporting cells). Although the Lfng expression pattern is very dynamic, by labeling between E13-E14, we were able to demonstrate that Lfng is expressed in the early Atoh1+ progenitors that give rise to both inner phalangeal cells and inner hair cells as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) Fng LOF is mimicked by low Notch. That is the main line of the argument along the paper. But from here, I would expect the authors to consider how this could happen by showing the effects of Fng on ligands or on Notch activity would have been informative. Neither it is clear to me whether the levels of Notch affect the expression of modulators or vice versa. We do not really know how Notch operates outside lateral inhibition and all possibilities should remain open.</italic></p><p>We have now included extra data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> showing a decrease in Notch activity (as revealed by N1ICD staining) in the Lfng/Mfng mutants. It is of course possible that lowering Notch signaling or Fringe activity will have other effects on the system, but we are at present limited by our readouts – functional (numbers of hair cells and supporting cells) and molecular (N1ICD staining or expression of Hes/Hey genes).</p><p><italic>4) As to the levels of Notch activation, indeed, the observations fit well with the Murata paper. But nevertheless, the different conditions generated by the experiments in the paper open some questions about what are the levels of Notch in the different regions of the sensory epithelium. In this sense, conditions are not strictly comparable. Mfng and Lfng show overlapping but different expression domains, and in MAM and Pofut CKO or DAPT experiments, the decrease of Notch is ubiquitous. Can this be assessed specifically for Fng mutants? Please comment on that.</italic></p><p>As mentioned above, we have now included extra data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to show the lowering of Notch activity in the Lfng/Mfng mutants. We hope this addresses this point.</p><p><italic>5) The data in the bar diagrams of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> indicate that there is an inverse correlation between Notch activity, Hes/Hey expression and the production of hair cells. And it shows the differential sensitivity of inner and outer hair cells to Notch. This is in good correspondence with MAMl and Pofut experiments. But what about in Fng mutants? It would have been interesting to see Hes/Hey levels in Fng mutants.</italic></p><p>The available data on Hes/Hey gene expression in the cochlea at this stage suggests that Hes and Hey are expressed at low levels at the border of the future organ of Corti (see, for example the E14.5 data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of Tateya et al., 2011). Although this is entirely consistent with our conclusion that the levels of Notch signaling at this border are quite low and sensitive to small changes, it makes it very hard to detect quantitative changes, especially since in situ hybridization itself is not very quantitative.</p><p><italic>6) Cis-inhibition: The experiments say little about cis-inhibition. &quot;Lfng activity attenuates Jag1-Notch signaling between cells (Hicks et al. 2000; Rana and Haltiwanger 2011) and promotes Jag1-Notch cis-inhibition in the same cell, with the result…&quot; I am not sure how the second sentence follows the first and, moreover, whether it is a general true at all. Is there a good evidence for cis-inhibition in ear sensory cells? The results from Daudet's lab indicate rather the opposite for Dll1.</italic></p><p><italic>The argument on cis-inhibition continues in the second and third paragraphs of the Discussion, quoting LeBon 2014 as if an ear paper: &quot;we hypothesize that this column of cells only delivers a moderate level of Notch signaling, due to active cis-inhibition between the Notch ligands and Notch receptors that can occur in the same cell&quot;. However, the experiments do not provide any evidence of that occurring in the ear.</italic></p><p>We have rewritten these parts of the Discussion to clarify that cis-inhibition is <italic>predicted</italic> to occur in the cochlea when Notch ligands and receptors are expressed in the same cell. As mentioned above, the majority of evidence for cis-inhibition comes from both mammalian cell lines and <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics. The process of cis-inhibition cannot be visualized by a unique marker; rather it is inferred by a) evidence for co-expression of receptor and ligand in the same cell and b) evidence for intermediate levels of Notch signaling that can be increased or decreased by manipulating levels of receptor, ligand or Fringe proteins in the cell. The low level of Notch signaling seen in the E13/14 prosensory domain that expresses both Jag1 and Notch1 is thus consistent with the phenomenon of cis-inhibition. The Daudet paper of 2012 is based on over-expression experiments and it is possible that the residual Notch signaling was sufficient to induce the rather sensitive Hes5-dsEGFP reporter in their experiments.</p><p><italic>In summary, the results are indeed sound and of general interest, but as to the model, it is unclear that the function of Fng on Notch and cis-inhibition are sufficiently substantiated. Leaving aside cis-inhibition, which actually I see out of the paper, the model still needs a link between Fng, ligands and Notch in the cochlea. Something that may give a hint of what are the effects of Fng on Notch, Notch ligands or Fng. The main evidence for the model is correlative, the parallel between phenotypes. The main question, in my view, is what is the connection between both.</italic></p><p>We have now added data showing that Lfng;Mfng double mutants have significantly reduced Notch signaling at the time and place where the boundary of the organ of Corti forms. We hope this adds weight to the idea that Lfng and Mfng activity are together necessary to promote Notch signaling from the cells that transiently co-express them.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>The organ of Corti is characterized by strikingly precise rows of hair cells, although how this precision is established is not known. This manuscript by Basch et al., proposes a novel form of Notch signaling that sets up the boundary of the initial row of inner hair cells, in which Fringe proteins, modulators of Notch signaling, are an essential component. The authors show that Lfng and Mng are initially precisely positioned at the location of the first inner hair cell row. In their absence, multiple rows form, along with a duplication of supporting cells. By comparing the results of minor reductions in Notch signaling to more robust loss of Notch, the authors suggest that establishment of the initial row of hair cells is inherently different in that it requires lower levels of Notch signaling, and is therefore more susceptible to mild reductions in Notch signaling. Overall the data is well-performed and presented, and the authors analyze quite a number of different Notch mutants to determine differences. The authors put forward an interesting hypothesis as to why the hair cell genesis is initially restricted to a single row. However, it is not clearly established that a lower level of Notch signaling is required for boundary formation – while milder defects in Notch signaling may first lead to an expansion of the sensory domain, it may be that the non-sensory regions (or supporting cells outside the hair cell regions) are simply more sensitive to loss of Notch signaling, and thus boundary formation is lost first.</italic></p><p><italic>The authors suggest that cis-inhibition mediated by Lfng and Mfng expression results in moderate levels of Notch activation in nearby Kolliker's cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and that this is important for setting up the boundary. However, in this case the prediction would be that deleting both fringes would lead to higher levels of Notch, as cis-inhibition would be largely relieved. However, this does not seem to be the case, as new hair cells develop, suggesting Notch activity is reduced in their absence. Since the model indicates that moderate levels of Notch activity are important for setting up this boundary, it would be important to show directly how levels of Notch are regulated at the boundary.</italic></p><p>As mentioned above, we have now provided data showing that Lfng;Mfng double knockouts have reduced Notch signaling in the border region of the future organ of Corti.</p><p><italic>It is not clear that severe loss of Notch signaling shows an inherently different phenotype than milder forms. Is it not more likely that the severe loss obscures the initial milder phenotype? After all, there is a dramatic loss of boundary formation in the severe cases of loss of Notch signaling. While additional supporting cells are present in the milder cases, these may be induced by the excess hair cells, which themselves also convert to hair cells in the case of more severe reductions in Notch.</italic> </p><p>This is exactly what we believe is happening in our Notch1 mutants and previously published Notch1 mutants – there is a duplication of inner hair cell and inner phalangeal cell progenitors at the boundary of the organ of Corti, but the loss of Notch1 causes the inner phalangeal cell progenitors to form hair cells. We have stated this more explicitly in the revision.</p><p><italic>If the regulation of inner hair cell formation to a single row is not via lateral inhibition, what type of signaling is it? It would seem that even at the proposed lower levels the cell expressing the ligand is inhibiting nearby cells (in Kolliker's organ) from adopting the hair cell fate, and therefore this would fit the definition of lateral inhibition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</italic></p><p>We do believe the signal is inhibitory, but it is clearly different from conventional Notch mediated lateral inhibition, both qualitatively (we see a different loss-of-function phenotype) and quantitatively (it is sensitive to changes in Notch signaling that do not affect the choice between hair cells and supporting cells). We felt that referring to this phenomenon was lateral inhibition would be confusing.</p><p><italic>The authors show that Lfng likely initially marks the inner hair cell using fate-mapping, although given that they have reporters for both Lfng and Atoh1-it seems relatively straightforward to show that these both overlap during differentiation, further strengthening the hypothesis that Lfng and Mfng mark the inner hair cell boundary. It would also be interesting to look at the onset of these factors-Does Lfng mark the inner hair cell prior to Atoh1? Or vice versa?</italic></p><p>The reason we chose to use the Lfng-CreER mice to show that inner hair cells derive from Lfng-expressing progenitors rather than other methods is that a) fluorescent protein reporters can persist after the gene is switched off; b) this is also true of protein reporters such as Atoh1-GFP fusion mice we have used in the past and c) in situ hybridization probes (either fluorescent or DIG-labeled) each have different sensitivities (as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), making it hard to determine the precise temporal order of expression if expression patterns are changing rapidly as they do in the developing cochlea. Our expression and fate-mapping data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> show that Lfng is expressed broadly in Kölliker’s organ before becoming restricted to the boundary region. Therefore, it is likely that Lfng is expressed in hair cell progenitors first, but since we don’t have a unique marker of hair cell progenitors that is expressed before Atoh1, we can’t address this question. We recently showed that Mfng is a candidate Atoh1 target gene (Cai et al., 2015), but this has not been demonstrated directly.</p><p><italic>The suggestion that Lfng modulates Jag1 levels initially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) has not been demonstrated previously-is there any evidence of this from the Lfng loss of function? If not this part of the model should be modified.</italic></p><p>We were not suggesting that Lfng modulates Jag1 <italic>levels</italic>, but rather Jag1 <italic>activity</italic>, which has been well-documented in the past in vivo and in vitro. We have now tried to clarify this in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
