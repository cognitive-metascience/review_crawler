pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44305.001</object-id><p>The biological players involved in angiogenesis are only partially defined. Here, we report that endothelial cells (ECs) express a novel isoform of the cell-surface adhesion molecule L1CAM, termed L1-ΔTM. The splicing factor NOVA2, which binds directly to <italic>L1CAM</italic> pre-mRNA, is necessary and sufficient for the skipping of L1CAM transmembrane domain in ECs, leading to the release of soluble L1-ΔTM. The latter exerts high angiogenic function through both autocrine and paracrine activities. Mechanistically, L1-ΔTM-induced angiogenesis requires fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 signaling, implying a crosstalk between the two molecules. NOVA2 and L1-ΔTM are overexpressed in the vasculature of ovarian cancer, where L1-ΔTM levels correlate with tumor vascularization, supporting the involvement of NOVA2-mediated L1-ΔTM production in tumor angiogenesis. Finally, high NOVA2 expression is associated with poor outcome in ovarian cancer patients. Our results point to L1-ΔTM as a novel, EC-derived angiogenic factor which may represent a target for innovative antiangiogenic therapies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44305.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Growing tumors stimulate the formation of new blood vessels to supply the oxygen and nutrients the cancerous cells need to stay alive. Stopping tumors from forming the blood vessels could therefore help us to treat cancer. To do so, we need to understand how different proteins control when and how blood vessels develop.</p><p>Cells make proteins by first ‘transcribing’ genes to form RNA molecules. In many cases, the RNA then goes through a process called alternative splicing. Proteins known as splicing factors cut out different segments of the RNA molecule and stick together the remaining segments to form templates for protein production. This enables a single gene to produce many different variants of a protein.</p><p>Angiolini, Belloni, Giordano et al. have now studied mouse and human versions of the cells that line the blood vessels grown by tumors. This revealed that a splicing factor called NOVA2 targets a protein called L1CAM, which is normally responsible for gluing adjacent cells together. Angiolini et al. found that NOVA2 splices L1CAM into a form not seen before. Instead of remaining anchored to cell surfaces, the newly identified form of L1CAM is released into the blood circulation, where it stimulates new blood vessels to grow.</p><p>Samples taken from the blood vessels of human ovarian tumors showed high levels of both NOVA2 and the modified form of L1CAM, while blood vessels in healthy tissue contain no, or very low levels of both proteins. Therefore, if the new form of L1CAM can be detected in the blood, it could be used to help cancer diagnosis, and to indicate which patients would benefit from treatments that restrict the growth of blood vessels in tumors. Further work is now needed to explore these possibilities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>atermative splicing</kwd><kwd>NOVA2</kwd><kwd>L1CAM</kwd><kwd>Angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>Ovarian Cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG-17395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghigna</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011713</institution-id><institution>Worldwide Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AICR 10-0091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cavallaro</surname><given-names>Ugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-StG-LS2-637591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Irimia</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2017-89201-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Irimia</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006781</institution-id><institution>Giovanni Armenise-Harvard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Forneris</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministero dell'Istruzione dell'Università e della Ricerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Forneris</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG-14622</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cavallaro</surname><given-names>Ugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG-18853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giavazzi</surname><given-names>Raffaella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG-18683</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dejana</surname><given-names>Elisabetta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endothelial cells express a soluble isoform of the L1CAM cell adhesion molecule that is generated by the splicing factor NOVA2 and induces angiogenesis, with relevant implications for ovarian cancer vascularization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>L1CAM, also known as CD171 or L1, is a cell adhesion molecule encoded by the gene <italic>L1CAM</italic>. It is a cell surface glycoprotein with an extracellular portion that comprises six Ig-like domains, five fibronectin type III repeats, a short transmembrane (TM) domain, and a conserved cytoplasmic tail. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)10-mediated cleavage at membrane proximal site induces shedding of the L1CAM ectodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mechtersheimer et al., 2001</xref>), while intramembrane processing mediated by γ-secretase generates a cytosolic domain which can translocate to the nucleus and modulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maretzky et al., 2005</xref>). L1CAM was initially identified in the nervous system and characterized for its important function in neural development and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maness and Schachner, 2007</xref>). Further studies then showed that L1CAM is not restricted to the nervous system and, in particular, we reported its expression in the tumor vasculature of several cancer types, while no or very low L1CAM expression is detectable in normal vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maddaluno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Magrini et al., 2014</xref>). L1CAM orchestrates different endothelial cell (EC) functions within tumor-associated vessels, such as permeability, pericyte coverage and polarity. Since these cellular processes influence tumor angiogenesis, cancer growth and metastasis, L1CAM has emerged as a potential target for tumor vascular-specific therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Magrini et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>L1CAM occurs mainly in two alternatively spliced isoforms: while neurons typically express the full-length variant of L1CAM, non-neural cell types produce a shorter isoform which lacks exon 2 and exon 27. Exon 2 is involved in the interaction with other neuronal proteins, and exon 27 facilitates endocytosis of L1CAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schäfer and Altevogt, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Alternative splicing (AS) produces different mature transcripts (mRNAs) from a single primary pre-mRNA. AS decisions are modulated by a number of <italic>cis</italic>-acting motifs and splicing regulatory factors (SRFs) that function in a coordinate manner to promote or inhibit the inclusion of specific exons into the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nilsen and Graveley, 2010</xref>). More than 90% of human protein-coding genes undergo AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) giving rise to different protein isoforms with distinct structural and functional properties. Hence, AS represents an important mechanism to expand the coding potential of the human genome, thus contributing to generate the cellular complexity of different tissue types and to support key functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Manley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baralle and Giudice, 2017</xref>).

In particular, it has been shown that mutations or altered expression of specific SRFs allow neoplastic cells to generate cancer-specific AS isoforms involved in tumor establishment, progression and resistance to therapeutic treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonomi et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anczuków and Krainer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biamonti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oltean and Bates, 2014</xref>).

However, in contrast to the established role of AS in tumor cells, it remains unclear whether this process is also relevant in tumor microenvironment and, in particular, in cancer vasculature. In fact, AS events specifically occurring in tumor-associated ECs have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neri and Bicknell, 2005</xref>) and proposed as potential targets for antiangiogenic therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Steiner and Neri, 2011</xref>). However, how such AS events impact on the pathophysiology of tumor vasculature remains elusive.</p><p>Recently, we described the SRF Neuro-Oncological Ventral Antigen 2 (NOVA2) as a prominent regulator of AS during vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giampietro et al., 2015</xref>). NOVA2 was initially identified in neural cells where it controls AS of several genes involved in various neural developmental processes by binding to clusters of YCAY (Y = C/U) repeats within its pre-mRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ule et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leggere et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saito et al., 2016</xref>). Our study revealed that NOVA2 is also expressed in vascular endothelium and is regulated during angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giampietro et al., 2015</xref>). NOVA2 controls at the post-transcriptional level the establishment of EC polarity, a process that is essential for vascular lumen formation and, hence, for angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iruela-Arispe and Davis, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, NOVA2 ablation causes defects in vascular lumen formation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giampietro et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report a novel isoform of L1CAM expressed in ECs as the result of a NOVA2-induced AS event that removes the exon encoding the transmembrane domain of the protein. This gives rise to a soluble L1CAM variant, referred to as L1-ΔTM, that is released by ECs and is able to stimulate angiogenesis via autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. NOVA2 and L1-ΔTM are overexpressed in the vasculature of ovarian cancer and correlate with poor outcome and tumor vascularization, respectively. Our findings, therefore, implicate the novel NOVA2/L1-ΔTM axis in EC pathophysiology and in ovarian cancer aggressiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Alternative splicing of <italic>L1CAM</italic> in endothelium</title><p>We have recently reported the novel function of L1CAM in vascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Magrini et al., 2014</xref>).

This suggests that AS of exon 25 could affect L1CAM localization and, hence, its activity. To test this hypothesis, we selected an immortalized endothelial cell line of murine origin, moEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lampugnani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taddei et al., 2008</xref>), because it expresses no or very little endogenous L1CAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and, therefore, is amenable to gain-of-function studies.

Thus, exon 25 was deleted from non-neural mouse <italic>L1cam</italic> in order to obtain L1-ΔTM.

To address this question, we performed immunofluorescence staining for L1CAM on moEC expressing the two isoforms. Only L1-FL was prominently exposed on the cell surface of moEC, while cells expressing L1-ΔTM exhibited mainly a cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Indeed, conditioned medium (CM) from L1-ΔTM-expressing moEC contained high amounts of L1-ΔTM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Of note, the protein in the CM retained the cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, this resulted in increased expression and extracellular release of endogenous L1-ΔTM. Importantly, lu2EC exposed to the CM from morpholino-treated cells exhibited higher tube-forming activity than those exposed to control CM, thus confirming the functionality of endogenous L1-ΔTM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we aimed at validating our findings in an in vivo assay of angiogenesis. Mice underwent subcutaneous implantation of Matrigel plugs containing CM from either L1-ΔTM- or L1-FL-expressing ECs or from control cells. Neovascularization was markedly induced by L1-ΔTM-containing CM, while a weaker effect was observed with the CM from L1-FL-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This strongly supports the angiogenic function of L1-ΔTM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>FGFR1 signaling is required for L1-ΔTM-induced tube formation</title><p>Previous studies implicated fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling as an effector of L1CAM in different cellular contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Díaz-Balzac et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kulahin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mohanan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Williams et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zecchini et al., 2008</xref>). However, the L1CAM/FGFR interplay in ECs has not been investigated. Given the well-characterized role of FGFR function in vascular biology and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ronca et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized that the pro-angiogenic effect of L1-ΔTM was mediated by FGFR. Among the four FGFR family members, moEC express only <italic>FGFR1</italic> (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giampietro et al., 2012</xref>), as previously reported for other EC types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giacomini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Javerzat et al., 2002</xref>). To determine if L1-ΔTM function could be mediated by FGFR1, we first investigated whether soluble L1-ΔTM affects FGFR1 activation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, treating parental moEC with recombinant L1-ΔTM resulted in increased phospho-FGFR1, consistent with the L1-ΔTM-induced activation of FGFR1 signaling. Moreover, when L1-ΔTM-expressing moEC were subjected to tube formation assay in the presence of the small-molecule FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skaper et al., 2000</xref>), L1-ΔTM-dependent tube-forming activity was reduced to the level of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Thus, our data implicate FGFR1 signaling as an effector of L1-ΔTM in ECs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>NOVA2 controls alternative splicing of L1-ΔTM in ECs</title><p>To gain further insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating the AS of <italic>L1cam</italic> in endothelium, we analyzed the sequence of mouse <italic>L1cam</italic> exon 25 and its flanking intronic regions, using SFmap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sfmap.technion.ac.il/">http://sfmap.technion.ac.il/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akerman et al., 2009</xref>) to search for putative binding sites of RNA-binding proteins.

To test this possibility, we selected human ovarian carcinoma (OC) as a suitable model system. In fact, we found a markedly higher number of NOVA2-positive vessels in OC (identified via staining with the endothelial marker CD31) than in healthy ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The percentage of L1CAM-positive vessels was also dramatically increased in OC samples as compared to normal ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, NOVA2 was often co-expressed with L1CAM in OC vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we applied RT-PCR to examine the AS of <italic>L1CAM</italic> in ECs isolated from OC (HOC-EC). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the <italic>L1-ΔTM</italic> isoform was readily detected in HOC-EC from seven independent OC samples. To test whether vascular L1-ΔTM in OC is associated with tumor angiogenesis, we measured the vessel density in a small cohort of OC samples pre-classified as <italic>L1-ΔTM</italic>-positive or negative by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

These findings imply that the AS of <italic>L1CAM</italic> correlates with the degree of OC vascularization, which is consistent with a proangiogenic function of L1-ΔTM in this tumor type.

Due to NOVA2-induced skipping of exon 25 that encodes the TM domain, L1-ΔTM is no longer associated to the cell surface and, hence, is released in the extracellular space. Consistent with the expression of NOVA2 in vascular ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giampietro et al., 2015</xref>), the latter express and release high levels of L1-ΔTM.</p><p>We demonstrated that L1-ΔTM increases the ability of ECs to form tube-like structures in vitro and stimulates neovascularization in vivo. These data point to L1-ΔTM as a <italic>bona fide</italic> angiogenic factor which, however, belongs to a class of molecules highly divergent from the classic polypeptide growth factors that exert this function (vascular endothelial growth factors, fibroblast growth factors, etc.). To our knowledge, L1-ΔTM provides the first example of an immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule converted into a soluble angiogenic factor through AS removal of the exonic sequence that encodes the TM domain. AS of the TM domain occurs in a broad spectrum of human genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xing et al., 2003</xref>), yet for most of them the biological significance and the functional outcome of such an event remain elusive. Based on our findings, it is conceivable that this post-transcriptional modification expands the repertoire of biologically active proteins that are released into the extracellular compartment.</p><p>We discovered that ECs acquire angiogenic properties not only upon ectopic expression of L1-ΔTM, but also when exposed to exogenously added L1-ΔTM (either as CM or as a recombinant protein). This supports the notion that extracellular L1-ΔTM can promote angiogenesis via both autocrine and paracrine stimulation. The latter mode of action, in particular, might represent a way to amplify the angiogenic signal provided by vascular L1CAM. Indeed, in most cases only a fraction of vessels within tumor and inflammatory tissues (i.e. the most prominent conditions where vascular L1CAM is detected), exhibits L1CAM expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Issa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaifi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maddaluno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Magrini et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the AS-mediated generation of L1-ΔTM, and hence its release, would contribute to spread the proangiogenic stimulus also to L1CAM-negative vessels.</p><p>In different cellular contexts, such as neurons, L1CAM frequently engages in homophilic L1CAM-L1CAM interactions between adjacent cells, which underlie its function in cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maness and Schachner, 2007</xref>). However, our experiments were conducted in two EC lines, moEC and luEC, that express no or very little endogenous L1CAM. This implies that, regardless of autocrine or paracrine activity, L1-ΔTM stimulates ECs by heterophilic interactions with different surface molecules. Accordingly, the extracellular portion of L1CAM has been reported to interact with a wide spectrum of membrane proteins, including different integrins, CD24, NCAM, F11R, neuropilins, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haspel and Grumet, 2003</xref>). With regard to potential L1-ΔTM interactors, one of the most intriguing aspects of our study is related to the crosstalk between L1-ΔTM and FGFR1. Following the pioneering studies of Doherty and Walsh in neuronal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Williams et al., 1994</xref>), L1CAM has been proposed to interact with the FGFR signaling machinery in different experimental settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mohanan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Son et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zecchini et al., 2008</xref>), possibly entailing a direct binding between the two molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kulahin et al., 2008</xref>). Our data show for the first time a functional interplay between L1-ΔTM and FGFR1 in ECs, and implicate it in L1-ΔTM-induced angiogenesis. Future studies should elucidate whether interfering with the L1-ΔTM/FGFR1 crosstalk will open novel perspectives for antiangiogenic therapy.</p><p>In neural cell types, NOVA2 is required for the inclusion of the <italic>L1CAM</italic> exons 2 and 27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mikulak et al., 2012</xref>). This is not the case in ECs, where even upon ectopic over-expression of NOVA2 exons 2 and 27 are not included in the <italic>L1CAM</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, despite the high expression of NOVA2 in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giampietro et al., 2015</xref>), we did not detect L1-ΔTM in human or mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which implies that NOVA2 is not involved in the AS of exon 25 in neural cells. Interestingly, our CLIP data on ECs revealed the binding of NOVA2 to exon 25, while no binding was detected with the regions flanking the neural-specific exons 2 and 27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Overall, these observations point to differential and cell type-specific interactions of NOVA2 with the <italic>L1CAM</italic> pre-mRNA that, in turn, underlie distinct AS outcomes. Future studies should aim at identifying the molecular determinants of such a cell type specificity.</p><p>NOVA2 is significantly up-regulated in OC vasculature as compared to vessels in healthy ovary. Of note, NOVA2 expression is detected only in the vascular endothelium of OC and, in particular, in the nucleus of ECs. It is remarkable that, in spite of such a restricted expression pattern, NOVA2 has a prognostic value in OC, given its association with shorter patients’ survival. To the best of our knowledge, NOVA2 is the only SRF reported to be upregulated in cancer vasculature, including OC (this study) and colorectal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallo et al., 2018</xref>). This implies that NOVA2-mediated AS might play a relevant, yet underappreciated, role in the phenotypic and functional aberrancies of the tumor vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011</xref>). Consistent with the proposed role of the NOVA2/L1-ΔTM axis in tumor angiogenesis, increased NOVA2 levels are frequently accompanied by the expression of L1-ΔTM in tumor vessels. Furthermore, L1-ΔTM expression correlates with OC vascularization, although further studies should investigate the causal role of L1-ΔTM in tumor angiogenesis. These data, together with our observations on the role of vascular L1CAM in tumor angiogenesis and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Magrini et al., 2014</xref>) and on the proangiogenic activity of L1-ΔTM, point to NOVA2 as a potential driver of OC neovascularization. In addition, our results further strengthen the rationale for testing vascular L1CAM as a novel target for antiangiogenic strategies. Indeed, interfering with the function of cell surface-associated endothelial L1CAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Magrini et al., 2014</xref>) and, at the same time, with that of extracellular L1-ΔTM might result in efficient repression of cancer angiogenesis.</p><p>The translational implications of our findings extend beyond the therapeutic area. Based on its specific up-regulation in OC vessels (and likely in other cancer types as well), we speculate that L1-ΔTM could serve as a new circulating biomarker of cancer-associated vasculature. In this case, it may become necessary to discriminate between vessel-derived L1-ΔTM and the ectodomain of transmembrane L1CAM which is released by various cell types, including tumor cells, upon proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kiefel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Assays aimed at detecting the cytosolic domain of circulating L1CAM would serve this purpose. Circulating L1-ΔTM could be harnessed for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, ranging from the detection of primary and recurrent OC to monitoring the therapeutic response, all objectives that would improve dramatically the clinical management of OC patients. Along this line, the circulating levels of vessel-derived L1-ΔTM could offer a novel predictive tool to identify patients eligible for antiangiogenic therapies.</p><p>In summary, we provide evidence that L1-ΔTM is a novel, soluble isoform of L1CAM generated in ECs through NOVA2-mediated AS. L1-ΔTM exhibits proangiogenic activity and is up-regulated in tumor vessels, which may have high translational and clinical relevance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells (ATCC, CCL-2) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Euroclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Euroclone) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Lonza).

Cell suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 3 min, and pellet was incubated for 10 min on ice in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), and RNase inhibitor (Promega)]. Samples were briefly sonicated and incubated with 10 μl of 1:1000 RNase I (100 U/µL, Ambion) dilution and 2 μl of DNase (2 U/µL, Ambion) for 3 min at 37°C shaking at 1100 rpm, and then centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. One milligram of extract was immunoprecipitated using anti-NOVA2 antibody (C-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or purified IgG (negative control) in the presence of protein A/G magnetic Dynabeads (Life Technologies). Immunoprecipitates were incubated overnight at 4°C under constant rotation. After stringent washes with high salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), beads were equilibrated with PK buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA). An aliquot (10%) was kept as input lysate, while the rest was treated with 50 µg Proteinase K and incubated for 20 min at 37°C shaking at 1100 rpm. 7 M urea was added to the PK buffer and incubated for further 20 min at 37°C shaking at 1100 rpm. The solution was collected and phenol/CHCl<sub>3</sub> (Ambion) was added. After incubation for 5 min at 30°C shaking at 1100 rpm, phases were separated by centrifuging for 5 min at 13000 rpm at RT. The aqueous layer was transferred into a new tube and precipitated by addition of 0.5 μl glycoblue (Ambion), 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.5 and 100% ethanol. After mixing, the solution containing retained RNA was precipitated overnight at −20°C. RNA extracted from both the input material and the immunoprecipitates was then analyzed by RT-qPCR as described in the above paragraph. The binding was expressed as percentage of the input material.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Minigene splicing assay</title><p>HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected by using Lipofectamine 3000 with 500 ng of <italic>p-L1 WT</italic> minigene and either 500 ng of protein expression vectors (HA-NOVA2, T7-hnRNPA1 and T7-SRSF3) or the empty vector.

Four hours after transfection with pUPE.06.45-L1-ΔTM, Primatone RL (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the culture medium at the final concentration of 0.6%. The culture medium was harvested 7 days after transfection by 10 min centrifugation at 1000 g. The supernatant containing secreted L1-ΔTM was loaded at 0.5 ml/min on a 1 ml StrepTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 10 column volumes (cv) of buffer P, composed of 50 mM HEPES and 250 mM NaCl pH 7.5. Elution was performed with 1 cv of the same buffer supplemented with 5 mM d-Desthiobiotin (Sigma-Aldrich). After elution, protein was incubated overnight at 4°C with TEV protease to remove the N-terminal affinity tags. The resulting protein was concentrated by centrifugation using Vivaspin Turbo 15, 100000 MWCO centrifugal filters (Sartorius) to a volume less than 500 μl and then loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer P. The elution peak corresponding to L1-ΔTM as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis was collected and concentrated to 1 mg/ml.

The sample size estimation was based on previous studies and pilot experiments. C57Bl/6 mice were injected into the right flank with 200 μl of CM derived from mouse ECs expressing either L1-ΔTM or L1-FL or from control ECs in a final volume of 600 μl of Growth Factor-Reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Matrigel containing 0.5 μg of FGF2 was used as positive control. Groups were composed by three mice for each construct. Plugs were removed 7 days after injection, fixed in 4% PFA and paraffin embedded. Sections from fixed plugs were stained for CD31 as described above. The number of CD31-positive vessels that invaded Matrigel plugs were evaluated by manual counting of five different fields per section using Axioskop two microscope (Leica Biosystems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Survival analysis</title><p>To determine the prognostic relevance of NOVA2, overall survival curves of ovarian cancer patients were built analyzing the GDC TCGA dataset with the UCSC Xena web tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://xena.ucsc.edu/">http://xena.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>).

When performed, technical replicates deriving from the same biological replicate were averaged. For in vivo experiments, each mouse represented one biological replicate. For staining of human tissues, each patient represented one biological replicate. Data are expressed as mean ±SEM, calculated from at least three independent experiments. Student’s two-tailed t test or ANOVA multiple comparison test, followed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis, were used to compare two or three or more groups, respectively, and to determine statistical significance (GraphPad Prism 5). The correlation between the expression of L1-ΔTM and tumor vessel density was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.</p><p>Differences were considered significant at p&lt;0.05.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;A Novel L1 Isoform with Angiogenic Activity Generated by NOVA2-mediated Alternative Splicing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Patrick A Murphy (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Based on discussions between the reviewers and editors and the individual reviews below, we regret that we are rejecting your paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All the reviewers and editors agreed that the basic results characterizing Nova2 regulation of L1 splicing and its possible role in tumor angiogenesis were quite interesting. However, there was general agreement that several key issues regarding angiogenic effects of the splice variant were not well supported. In particular, it is important to distinguish effects of the soluble splice variant from those of the extracellular domain that is cleaved from the typical isoform. Similarly, it is not clear whether the increased L1 and Nova2 expression observed in tumors was simply due to their increased vascularization and not causal as is proposed. To resolve this, the expression of the L1 variant and Nova2 need better quantification in normal and tumor endothelium. These issues are fundamental to the model that the L1 splice variant is driving tumor angiogenesis. The reviewers raise other valid points below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting follow-up on previous work by this group, which had revealed an important function for the Nova2 splice factor in vascular development. Here, they reveal a connection between Nova2 and a target splice event in L1cam, resulting in a form of the protein with altered cellular localization and function. Furthermore, Nova2, which like L1cam is fairly endothelial specific in ovarian tumors, correlates with tumor progression. Overall, the work is well done and exciting, but I think there are a few points which could be addressed in greater detail.</p><p>How much of the angiogenic properties of L1cam are due to altered splicing is a critical question. Rather than comparing angiogenic properties of supernatants of cells with exon25 deficient version of L1cam (L1-ΔTM) to vector control, I would have liked to see a comparison between cells expressing exon25 exclusive and inclusive versions of L1cam (L1- ΔTM and L1-FL). This would help address how much of the angiogenic effects observed are due to the change in splicing, rather than L1cam expression alone. It would be best to do these experiments in the matrigel plug assay, which more closely indicates angiogenic function than the tubulogenesis assay (fibroblasts and cancer cells also form tubules on matrigel, PMID: 11806243).</p><p>A link between FGF and Exon25- negative L1cam is suggested but not confirmed by the experiments. Is there a change in FGF signaling that can be defined by immunofluorescence or Western blot? For example, could a difference in FGF receptor expression or phosphorylation be detected following treatment with soluble L1cam? One interpretation is that the FGF and L1cam signaling pathways are parallel inputs in the tube formation assay where both are required for tubulogenesis. Given these concerns and the use of the in vitro tube formation assay alone as an indication of their cross-talk, the claim that &quot;L1-ΔTM promotes angiogenesis via FGFR1&quot; seems overstated.</p><p>Authors allude to data on increased secretion of L1cam in endothelial cells (Discussion, first paragraph), but I do not see a data reference for this observation. Can they measure soluble L1cam with the C-terminus in the supernatant of their endothelial cell lines and some other L1 expressing cells which do not make the L1-ΔTM isoform? Or can they measure this in their endothelial cells with and without Nova2 suppression? This would help alleviate concerns about any artifacts due to overexpression of L1cam in moECs.</p><p>If L1-ΔTM is specific to tumor endothelium, it is not surprising that tumor levels are correlated with vascular density. It would be more meaningful if the endothelial levels of L1-ΔTM expression were correlated with tumor vascularization. There is some heterogeneity in the L1-ΔTM expression levels in isolated tumor endothelial cells (Figure 5C), do those with lower L1-ΔTM come from less vascular tumors? Do they have lower NOVA2 expression? Perhaps that is what the authors looked at already, but this was not clear to me.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>L1 (L1CAM gene) is a cell-surface glycoprotein that undergoes ectodomain shedding via proteolytic cleavage at a membrane proximal site. This soluble ectodomain has previously been implicated in a wide array of cell signaling and adhesion processes involved in tumorigenesis.</p><p>In this manuscript, Angiolini et al. identify a novel isoform of L1CAM with exon 25 skipped, termed L1-ΔTM. Because exon 25 contains the entire transmembrane domain of the protein, skipping of this exon results in a L1 protein isoform that no longer localizes on the cell surface and instead is found both in the cytoplasm and secreted into the extracellular space. The authors investigate whether this secreted full-length protein isoform of L1 (which does not undergo proteolytic cleavage and maintains the cytoplasmic tail) drives a pro-angiogenic program that supports aggressive tumorigenesis. They identify the well-characterized splicing factor, Nova2, as an important factor in promoting skipping of exon 25.</p><p>This manuscript presents a novel alternative (non-proteolytic) mechanism for the release of the L1 ectodomain into the extracellular space and characterizes the role of Nova2 in producing this isoform. The observation that this novel splice variant occurs in endothelial cells and its regulation by Nova2, as well as the exogenous expression of the full-length and L1-ΔTM isoforms to produce glycosylated transmembrane and soluble proteins, respectively, are all compelling pieces of data. However, the major flaw in the manuscript is the lack of physiological evidence that the angiogenic effects observed upon overexpression of L1-ΔTM are specific to the isoform itself, or whether a similar pro-angiogenic affect would also result from overexpressing full length L1. Indeed, overexpression of membrane bound L1 (FL-L1) resulted in release of L1 into the extracellular space (Figure 2D), presumably through proteolytic cleavage which would presumably have the same effect.</p><p>The difficulty in separating the effect of the cleaved full-length protein compared to the exon 25 skipped splice variant is acknowledged. The authors could address this issue by generating a mutation in the proteolytic cleavage site that would render it inactive and determine whether the splicing variant can overcome this deficiency.</p><p>A separate concern related to this criticism is that the manuscript relies almost entirely on a gain-of-function system. It is unclear how the level of overexpression of the L1-ΔTM isoform relates to endogenous expression either in cell lines or tumors, and without the L1-FL controls, one cannot assess the relative potency of this isoform being expressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Angiolini et al. describes a novel alternatively spliced isoform of the cell-surface adhesion molecule L1CAM in endothelial cells (ECs). This novel isoform lacking exon 25, lacks the transmembrane domain, creating a soluble form of L1CAM. The authors show that this soluble L1-ΔTM isoform enhances the formation of tubes in mouse endothelial cells and this is inhibited by an inhibitor of FGFR1 signaling. They show direct binding of NOVA2 to exon 25 of the L1CAM transcript and in a splicing assay, show NOVA2 to be responsible for promoting skipping of L1CAM exon 25. Finally, they show a correlation between higher vessel density in L1-ΔTM-positive ovarian tumors, implying that alternative splicing of L1CAM correlates with tumor vascularization, supporting a proangiogenic function for L1-ΔTM.</p><p>In general this manuscript is well written and easy to follow. The experimental data is clearly presented. The novelty of this report is the identification of a cell adhesion molecule converted into a soluble angiogenic factor through alternative splicing. This represents not only a novel target for future antiangiogenic strategies but also can be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. However, there are some things lacking in the paper that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Even though NOVA2 is an important splicing factor in EC cells, there is a bit of a logic &quot;jump&quot; caused by focusing only on NOVA2 as the regulator of L1CAM. The authors need to show other possible splicing factors from the SFmap/SpliceAid analysis, and possibly knockdown several of them (e.g. SRSF1, SRSF2, PTBP1, in addition to hnRNP A1) in their minigene splicing assay or RT-PCR on the endogenous transcripts.</p><p>2) Figure 5 The authors need to normalize the amount of L1CAM and NOVA2 to the amount of blood vessels in the IHC. If any blood vessel expresses L1CAM and NOVA2 then it is only a measure of higher vascularity in the tumor. The relevant question is if the blood vessels in the tumor express higher L1CAM and NOVA2 than normal? Also, it seems that additional cells are stained with NOVA2 (epithelial cells or other cells?) which do not express L1CAM.</p><p>3) In order to claim that the blood vessels in the tumor express more NOVA2 and L1CAM isoform, the authors need to show that in the presence of the cancer cells the EC cells express higher levels of NOVA2. Maybe this is through secretion of factors from the cancer cells or direct interaction, but the claim is not proven until some causative experiment is performed.</p><p>4) Figure 4—figure supplement 3B and C should show endogenous levels of Nova2 in the transfected cells. The authors write in Materials and methods &quot;Since NOVA2 expression is regulated by EC density (Giampietro et al., 2015), for the analysis of L1 splicing, NOVA2-knockdown moEC were used as confluent monolayers (500,000 cells in 35-mm Petri dishes), whereas moEC overexpression HA-tagged NOVA2 were tested at low density (500,000 cells in 100-mm Petri dishes).&quot; If the expression is sensitive to cell density it should be shown for the specific experiments.</p><p>5) Figure 4—figure supplement 3F. The effect of Nova2 overexpression on L1CAM splicing in human cells (82% inclusion) is not as strong as in mouse cells Figure 4B (27.2% inclusion). Can the authors provide an explanation for that?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Novel L1 Isoform with Angiogenic Activity Generated by NOVA2-mediated Alternative Splicing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The reviewers agreed that the previous version was of significant interest but all had major criticisms and experiments that they felt were needed to support its conclusions. All of the reviewers now agree that the authors have made major changes that strengthen the paper. Assuming that the authors can adequately address the remaining points in these reviews, the editors are pleased to accept this paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The addition of new data has solidified key conclusions and addressed my original concerns. With these new pieces of data, the authors make a compelling argument that a reduction in the inclusion of exon 25, which is mediated by Nova2 in the endothelium, promotes the expression of a secreted L1 variant with angiogenic properties beyond the constitutive form of L1. I particularly like the addition of Supplementary Figure 2M and N, showing that a morpholino suppressing L1 exon 25 inclusion results in increased secretion of soluble L1. I think this should be considered for the main figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript is a resubmission of a previously reviewed work that all reviewers agreed presents an important and novel biological mechanism in which alternative splicing essentially replaces proteolytic cleavage to release a polypeptide that is otherwise integrally associated with the plasma membrane. The authors have addressed most of the initial reviewers' comments and the paper is clearly much stronger now from the addition of new data and textual clarifications.</p><p>I had originally suggested a making a mutation in the proteolytic site – Figure 2A showing the putative ADAM cleavage site as a box implies some knowledge of where cleavage occurs (hence the suggested experiment, as there are only 6 amino acids in the extracellular domain of that region). If it is not clear where the cleavage occurs (and which enzymes are responsible), this figure is a bit misleading. The difficulties the authors cite regarding performing the suggested experiments are reasonable, but perhaps the figure could be clarified.</p><p>The immunofluorescence data added to Figure 2C is much improved with regard to clearly showing the subcellular localization of each isoform. The data that has been added to Figure 3 (and in particular Figure 3F) are instrumental in addressing both my concerns and those of reviewer #1, this experiment adds a great deal of support to the central hypothesis of this paper.</p><p>The authors have taken the criticism that the previous manuscript was overly dependent on gain-of-function experiments constructively in adding the new data presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. These experiments provide an elegant alternative approach to overexpression of individual isoforms by perturbing the splicing of the endogenous gene. This is a well-conceived and executed experiment.</p><p>Figure 5B solidifies the assertion that NOVA2 and L1 are colocalized. This is a strong piece of evidence for the physiological relevance of the proposed mechanism within tumors.</p><p>In summary, with this resubmission the authors have more than satisfactorily addressed the major points of concern raised in the original manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript &quot;A novel L1 isoform with angiogenic activity generated by Nova-2 mediated alternative splicing&quot; has been revised. The authors have supplied additional data in several figures, new supplementary figures and table and two figures in their response to the reviewers. In addition, they have addressed the concerns of the reviewers in their letter.</p><p>They have analyzed a cohort of 13 ovarian cancer samples for vessel density and expression levels of L1-ΔTM. They show that the levels of mRNA correlate with the degree of tumor vascularization (Figure 5D). They have also redone the immunohistochemistry of NOVA2 in EC cells (Figure 5B) showing that the immunoreactivity of NOVA2 is restricted to the nuclei of vascular ECs.</p><p>The authors did not completely address point 3. Thus, the connection between L1-ΔTM and vascularization is left at the level of correlation rather than a causative effect. The authors should at least say that further experiments are required to determine if this a direct effect of L1-ΔTM.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44305.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is an interesting follow-up on previous work by this group, which had revealed an important function for the Nova2 splice factor in vascular development.

Treating parental moEC with recombinant L1-ΔTM resulted in increased phospho-FGFR1, consistent with the L1-ΔTM-induced activation of FGFR1. These observations have been included in the Results (Figure 3G and subsection “FGFR1 signaling is required for L1-ΔTM-induced tube formation”).</p><p>The reviewer is correct in pointing out that FGFR1 and L1CAM might activate parallel pathways that are both involved in tube formation. However, the observation that the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 reduces the tubulogenesis of L1-ΔTM-expressing moEC to the level of control cells (but has no effect on the L1-ΔTM-independent tube formation in control moEC), strongly suggests that in the context of tubulogenesis FGFR1 signaling acts as an effector of L1-ΔTM. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer’s concern about the overstatement and have modified the sentence accordingly (“FGFR1 signaling is required for L1-ΔTM- induced tube formation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors allude to data on increased secretion of L1cam in endothelial cells (Discussion, first paragraph), but I do not see a data reference for this observation.

The figure, indeed, shows in both moEC and luEC that the ectopic expression of L1-FL per se (shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, lower panel, and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, right upper panel) does not result in the secretion of significant amounts of L1 with the C-terminus. The latter is detected occurs only in the CM of L1-ΔTM- expressing cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, upper panel, and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, right lower panel), supporting the specificity of our results.</p><p>Nevertheless, the reviewer’s suggestion to compare endothelial cells with another L1- expressing cell type was very insightful. We compared mouse lung-derived EC, which express endogenous L1-ΔTM (Figure 1C, “lu2EC”) and the mouse melanoma cell line B16, known to express L1 (Linnemann and Bock, 1986; Magrini et al., 2014). We first verified by RT-PCR that B16 cells do not express the L1-ΔTM isoform (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E), which is consistent with the lack of Nova2 expression (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E), and then assayed for the secretion of C- terminus-containing L1 in the conditioned medium. Despite B16 cells express much higher levels of endogenous, cell-associated L1 than lu2EC (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F), no protein was detectable in their conditioned medium with the antibody against the cytoplasmic tail, while lu2EC secreted high amounts of C-terminus-containing L1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F). Together with the other data presented in the manuscript, these findings (described in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Alternative splicing generates a novel soluble form of L1”) strongly support the increased secretion of L1- ΔTM in endothelial cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If L1-ΔTM is specific to tumor endothelium, it is not surprising that tumor levels are correlated with vascular density.

Unfortunately, we could not assess the vascularization of the same tumors used to derive endothelial cells, as proposed by the reviewer, since the entire surgical specimens were processed to obtain the ECs themselves. Nevertheless, since our data strongly suggest that tissue expression of L1-ΔTM is largely confined to vascular endothelium (e.g., Figure 1B, C and Figure 5B), we performed RT-PCR for L1-ΔTM on a cohort of 17 archival samples of ovarian cancer. The same specimens were also stained for CD31 to measure vessel density. As shown in Figure 5D, the levels of L1-ΔTM mRNA correlated with the degree of tumor vascularization (<italic>r</italic>=0.84, p&lt;0.001).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] This manuscript presents a novel alternative (non-proteolytic) mechanism for the release of the L1 ectodomain into the extracellular space and characterizes the role of Nova2 in producing this isoform.

As shown in Figure 3F and described in the last paragraph of the subsection “L1-ΔTM regulates endothelial cell function”, the conditioned medium (CM) from L1-ΔTM-expressing ECs was significantly more angiogenic than the CM from L1-FL-expressing cells. Similar results were obtained in the tubulogenesis assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). As recommended by reviewer #1, only the results of the Matrigel plug assay have been included in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The difficulty in separating the effect of the cleaved full-length protein compared to the exon 25 skipped splice variant is acknowledged. The authors could address this issue by generating a mutation in the proteolytic cleavage site that would render it inactive and determine whether the splicing variant can overcome this deficiency.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this would be a very elegant and appropriate strategy. However, it would be quite a challenging task, given that the proteolytic cleavage of L1 can be carried out by a plethora of proteases (ADAM10, ADAM17, plasmin, trypsin, proprotein convertase PC5A, etc.). Moreover, L1 shedding has been investigated mostly in neurons, and the enzymes involved in the cleavage of L1 in endothelial cells remain elusive. Therefore, it would be quite difficult and time-consuming to identify such enzymes and perform the mutagenesis suggested by reviewer #2, and we feel that such an effort would fall out of the scope of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A separate concern related to this criticism is that the manuscript relies almost entirely on a gain-of-function system. It is unclear how the level of overexpression of the L1-ΔTM isoform relates to endogenous expression either in cell lines or tumors, and without the L1-FL controls, one cannot assess the relative potency of this isoform being expressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for asking these important controls, which lent further support to our conclusions. As described above in our response to reviewer #1, we have included the requested L1-FL controls. The results showed that L1-ΔTM-containing conditioned medium (CM) has a markedly higher angiogenic potential than L1-FL CM (Figure 3F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>To address the concern on the manuscript relying almost entirely on a gain-of-function system, we have added new data on an endogenous system. The lung-derived endothelial cells lu2EC, which express both NOVA2 and L1-ΔTM endogenously (Figures 1C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1E), were treated with a morpholino oligonucleotide that selectively interfered with the inclusion of exon 25 (Figure 3E). As shown in Figure 3F (left), this resulted in increased skipping of exon 25 and release of endogenous L1-ΔTM in the extracellular compartment. Importantly, ECs exposed to the CM from morpholino-treated cells exhibited higher tube-forming activity than those exposed to control CM (Figure 3F, right). These observations validated in an endogenous system our observations on the angiogenic activity of AS-generated L1-ΔTM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) Even though NOVA2 is an important splicing factor in EC cells, there is a bit of a logic &quot;jump&quot; caused by focusing only on NOVA2 as the regulator of L1CAM. The authors need to show other possible splicing factors from the SFmap/SpliceAid analysis, and possibly knockdown several of them (e.g. SRSF1, SRSF2, PTBP1, in addition to hnRNP A1) in their minigene splicing assay or RT-PCR on the endogenous transcripts.</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined in more details in the Results (paragraph “NOVA2 controls alternative splicing of L1-ΔTM in ECs”), the SFmap analysis identified NOVA2, hnRNP A1 and SRSF3 as possible candidate regulators of <italic>L1cam</italic> exon 25 splicing (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). By using the minigene- based splicing assay as suggested by the reviewer, we found that the skipping of <italic>L1cam</italic> exon 25 occurred only upon overexpression of NOVA2, but not with hnRNP A1 or SRSF3 (Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>To further probe the specificity of NOVA2, we also tested SRSF1, as an additional AS regulator, and two known splicing repressors, hnRNP M and hnRNP A2/B1. None of these additional candidates was able to affect skipping of <italic>L1cam</italic> exon 25 (data not included in the revised manuscript but shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><p>The rationale for investigating NOVA2-mediated AS of <italic>L1cam</italic> was also supported by the analysis of the RNA-seq data from NOVA2-knockdown ECs (Giampietro et al., 2015), which revealed <italic>L1cam</italic> exon 25 as a novel target of NOVA2 in ECs (subsection “NOVA2 controls alternative splicing of L1-ΔTM in ECs”, second paragraph, and Supplementary file 2).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of candidate splicing regulatory factors (SRFs) on L1cam splicing.</title><p>AS of the p-L1 wild- type WT minigene co-transfected in HeLa cells with either HA-NOVA2, FLAG-hnRNP A2B1 (FLAG-A2B1), GFP- hnRNP M (GFP-M) or the empty vector.

If any blood vessel expresses L1CAM and NOVA2 then it is only a measure of higher vascularity in the tumor. The relevant question is if the blood vessels in the tumor express higher L1CAM and NOVA2 than normal? Also, it seems that additional cells are stained with NOVA2 (epithelial cells or other cells?) which do not express L1CAM.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 5A (left panel) shows indeed the percentage of NOVA2-positive vessels over the total number of vessels (determined by CD31 staining). We have now clarified this in the legend to Figure 5A as well as on the Y-axis of the graph. In addition, we now provide analogous measurements also for L1-positive vessels, confirming that they are markedly increased in cancer samples (Figure 5A, right panel).</p><p>Reviewer #3 argues that “if any blood vessel expresses L1CAM and NOVA2 then it is only a measure of higher vascularity in the tumor”. This concern was somehow similar to the last major comment of reviewer #1. To investigate in more detail the possible correlation between the expression of L1-ΔTM and tumor angiogenesis, we have analysed a cohort of 13 ovarian cancer samples both for vessel density and for the expression levels of L1-ΔTM (for more details, see our reply to the last major comment of reviewer #1). As shown in Figure 5D, the levels of L1-ΔTM mRNA correlated with the degree of tumor vascularization (<italic>r</italic>=0.84, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>As for the expression of NOVA2 in additional cell types, we acknowledge that from the original IHC images one could hypothesize the presence of NOVA2 in non-endothelial cells. We have investigated that issue in more detail and found out that the faint cytosolic staining was due to non-specific interactions of the antibodies. Indeed, we have now optimized the immunohistochemistry conditions (using Viva Green instead of diaminobenzidine as the chromogenic substrate) and are able to show that the immunoreactivity of NOVA2 is restricted to the nuclei of vascular ECs (Figure 5B and Figure 5—figure supplement 2A). Finally, the vessel-specific immunoreactivity of NOVA2 is also shown in the images taken from the Human Protein Atlas website (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In order to claim that the blood vessels in the tumor express more NOVA2 and L1CAM isoform, the authors need to show that in the presence of the cancer cells the EC cells express higher levels of NOVA2. Maybe this is through secretion of factors from the cancer cells or direct interaction, but the claim is not proven until some causative experiment is performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We are afraid we did not understand completely the reviewer’s comment. In particular, we do not see the causal link between the effect of cancer cells on the endothelial expression of NOVA2 and our “claim that the blood vessels in the tumor express more NOVA2 and L1CAM isoform”. Along the same line, it is unclear to us why “the claim is not proven until some causative experiment [on the role of cancer cells] is performed”. The increased expression of NOVA2 and L1CAM in ovarian cancer vasculature is illustrated in Figure 5A, where we show that tumors contain 6 and 4-fold more vessels positive for NOVA2 and L1CAM, respectively, than their normal tissue counterpart. This phenomenon is independent on whether and how cancer cells regulate the expression of the two proteins in the endothelium.</p><p>Having said that, we agree with the reviewer about the relevance of understanding the mechanisms that regulate the expression of NOVA2 in tumor-associated ECs. Nevertheless, we feel that investigating this issue would fall out of the scope of the present study. The experiments suggested by the reviewer, in addition, would be quite time-consuming in that they should not be limited to the cancer cells themselves, but should rather be extended to other components of the tumor microenvironment. It is conceivable, indeed, that different cell types and/or other microenvironmental factors account for (or at least contribute to) the induction of NOVA2 in the cancer vasculature. Along this line, a very recent paper reported that NOVA2 is upregulated in colorectal carcinoma vasculature and that endothelial NOVA2 expression is induced upon exposure to hypoxia (Gallo et al., 2018), a condition shared by many solid tumors. This paper is now cited in our Discussion (sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4—figure supplement 3B and C should show endogenous levels of Nova2 in the transfected cells.

In this specific case, moEC derive from mouse lung, while hCMEC/D3 derive from human brain vessels. The heterogeneity of ECs from different districts, in fact, has been extensively documented and may reflect profoundly different phenotypic and functional properties (Potente and Mäkinen, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, 2017).</p><p>To further address the reviewer’s comment, we have reduced by shRNA the expression of endogenous NOVA2 in a different EC model, consisting of human umbilical vein ECs. As shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 3G, <italic>NOVA2</italic> knockdown resulted in a marked decrease in L1CAM splicing (with the inclusion of exon 25 going from 72% to 100%). This supports the hypothesis that the splicing of exon 25 in response to the genetic manipulation of NOVA2 is quantitatively different indifferent EC types. Of note, these data suggest that the activity of NOVA2 is cell context- dependent even within the same cell type (i.e., endothelial cells).</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The addition of new data has solidified key conclusions and addressed my original concerns. With these new pieces of data, the authors make a compelling argument that a reduction in the inclusion of exon 25, which is mediated by Nova2 in the endothelium, promotes the expression of a secreted L1 variant with angiogenic properties beyond the constitutive form of L1. I particularly like the addition of Supplementary Figure 2M and N, showing that a morpholino suppressing L1 exon 25 inclusion results in increased secretion of soluble L1. I think this should be considered for the main figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #1 for his appreciation of the work we have done to improve our manuscript. We also thank him for his comments on the data presented in Supplementary Figure 2M and N. Following his suggestion, we have modified Figure 3 to include the morpholino data (Figure 3E and F).
