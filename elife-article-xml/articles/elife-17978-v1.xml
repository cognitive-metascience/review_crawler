Lactic acid also induced [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>]-like epigenetic states in fungi that diverged from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ~200 million years ago, and in which glucose repression evolved independently.

But how do bacteria, yeast and other single-celled microbes communicate? In 2014, researchers reported a new example of communication between bacteria and yeast in which the bacteria send a chemical message that has a very long-lasting effect on how the yeast grow in certain environments. This in turn also affected the ability of the bacteria to survive in these environments. The identity of the chemical message produced by the bacteria, however, was not known.</p><p>Garcia, Dietrich <italic>et al.</italic> – including one of the researchers from the previous study – used biochemical and genetic approaches to identify the chemical message. The experiments show that the message is a molecule called lactic acid, which is very common in nature and is produced by many bacteria. Garcia, Dietrich <italic>et al.</italic> found out how much lactic acid is needed to alter the growth of brewer’s yeast, and which genes in yeast are involved in responding to the message from the bacteria. Further experiments suggest that the ability of yeast and bacteria to communicate using lactic acid is likely to have existed for hundreds of millions of years.</p><p>The next step following this work will be to identify other chemical messages used by microbes. The human body is packed with billions of bacterial cells, and in some cases yeast can also take up residence. A future challenge will be to find out if bacteria and yeast inside the human body are able to communicate with each other in ways that could affect our health.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17978.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17978.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Dekkera bruxellensis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus gallinarum</italic></kwd><kwd>lactic acid</kwd><kwd>prion</kwd><kwd>catabolite repression</kwd><kwd>molecular communication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM086258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clardy</surname><given-names>Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAREER award, NSF-MCB116762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarosz</surname><given-names>Daniel F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Searle Scholars Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Searle Scholars Award, 14-SSP-210</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarosz</surname><given-names>Daniel F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM109680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000010</institution-id><institution>Ford Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Enrichment Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activity-guided fractionation identifies the first bacterial metabolite that potently induces a prion in nature.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Small molecules commonly drive productive and destructive relationships between species. The breadth of these molecular messages is vividly illustrated by examples ranging from bacterial control of fungal pathogenesis to programming of multi-cellular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alegado et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrhardt et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hogan and Kolter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hogan et al., 2004</xref>). Small molecule interactions between mammals and their associated gut microbiota may have important consequences for human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">David et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lozupone et al., 2012</xref>). Cross-kingdom interactions also have commercial relevance – for example those that occur between yeast and bacteria in the fermentation of alcoholic beverages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bokulich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boulton et al., 1996</xref>). Pasteur and others since have noted that lactic acid bacteria are a common contaminant in incomplete fermentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boulton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pasteur, 1873</xref>). Indeed, brewers and vintners have long appreciated that some bacteria have the power to both reduce the ethanol content and spoil the taste profile of fermented beverages.</p><p>The budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is a metabolic specialist: it strongly favors glucose as a carbon source even when other carbohydrates are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston, 1999</xref>). This is achieved through stringent regulation of enzymes involved in glycolysis and respiration at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zampar et al., 2013</xref>). Such glucose-associated repression of metabolism is a defining feature of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and many other microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorke and Stulke, 2008</xref>). A similar preference for glycolytic metabolism, even in the presence of oxygen, is a defining feature of cancer cells, known as the ‘Warburg effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsu and Sabatini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liberti and Locasale, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warburg, 1956</xref>).</p><p>When yeast cultures switch from metabolizing glucose to utilizing a respirative carbon source such as glycerol, they experience a pronounced lag phase known as the diauxic shift. This pause in growth occurs as a new transcriptional program is engaged to favor respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galdieri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zampar et al., 2013</xref>). The robust nature of this glucose-associated repression can be readily observed by using glucose mimetics. Even in trace quantities, these molecules provide a stable glucose signal, but cannot be metabolized. For example, just 0.05% of the mimetic glucosamine prevents yeast cells from utilizing non-fermentable carbon sources present at 40-fold higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ball et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Lindquist, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunz and Ball, 1977</xref>).</p><p>We recently reported that yeast strains have the ability to overcome such glucose-associated repression of metabolism at frequencies that depend upon the ecological niche from which they were isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jarosz et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2014b</xref>). This allows them to switch from being metabolic specialists to metabolic generalists, gaining the ability to metabolize a wide variety of carbon sources in the presence of glucose. This heritable change in metabolic program is not accompanied by a change in the yeast genotype. Rather, the trait is cytoplasmically transduced from mother cells to their daughters through the inheritance of an altered protein conformation – a prion known as [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] (named for its ability to reverse <underline>g</underline>lucose <underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>r</underline>epression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Lindquist, 2009</xref>). Although the molecular details of [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] are incompletely understood, several operational tests to identify and modify it are known. [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>]’s nomenclature derives from defining characteristics of prion biology: dominance in genetic crosses (denoted by capital letters) and transmission to all progeny of meiosis (denoted by brackets). The ability to acquire [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] has been widely conserved among wild <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains and is also present in fungal species separated by at least two hundred million years of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jarosz et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>Under monoculture conditions in the laboratory, acquisition of [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] occurs much more frequently than spontaneous mutations that reverse glucose repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Lindquist, 2009</xref>). In nature, the precise rates of [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] appearance correlate with environmental niche from which yeast are derived, suggestive of a bet-hedging mechanism for adaptation in environments with fluctuating carbon stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griswold and Masel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jarosz et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lancaster and Masel, 2009</xref>). Perhaps most remarkably, [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] can be induced by cross-kingdom communication with many bacterial species, and this interaction has been conserved over long evolutionary timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jarosz et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2014b</xref>). Notably, this relationship substantiates a model in which [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>]’s benefit as a reversible bet-hedging element would alone be sufficient to motivate its evolutionary retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jarosz et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>Induction of [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] by bacteria occurs with an extremely high efficiency – orders of magnitude greater than the spontaneous acquisition rate – and the consequences are mutually beneficial. [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] yeast cells gain the ability to metabolize a wider range of carbohydrates, improved uptake of limiting nutrients, and increased chronological lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jarosz et al., 2014a</xref>). [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] yeast cells also produce less ethanol, which itself has anti-bacterial properties. This generates a more hospitable environment for the inducing bacteria and allows them to flourish in fermentations where they would otherwise have perished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jarosz et al., 2014a</xref>); bacterial species that strongly induce [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] are common contaminants in failed wine fermentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boulton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jarosz et al., 2014a</xref>). When yeast and inducing bacteria are co-cultured on solid medium, induction of [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] occurs along a spatial gradient emanating from the bacteria. Conditioned medium generated from cultures of these bacteria also induces the prion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jarosz et al., 2014a</xref>). These results and others have led us to propose that inducing bacteria produce a diffusible signal that promotes [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] in yeast.</p><p>Here we report that the common bacterial metabolite lactic acid can serve as this inducing signal. Different concentrations of lactic acid elicit distinct and heritable [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>]-like phenotypes that have the properties of ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ variants of the prion. Lactic acid also has the capacity to induce [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>]-like epigenetic states in evolutionarily distant organisms in which glucose repression has evolved independently. Our results suggest that [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] induction may provide a molecular explanation for Pasteur’s observations, and indicate that links between lactate and diversification of metabolic strategies have been repeatedly employed to modulate the collective behavior of eukaryotic cells. More importantly, we for the first time uncover a bacterially secreted molecule that induces a prion. We do so using a straightforward approach with few technical prerequisites, which we propose could be used for discovering other natural molecules that potentiate epigenetic transformations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lactic acid induces robust and heritable reversal of glucose repression</title><p>Diverse bacteria have the capacity to induce [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] in neighboring yeast cells through a cross-kingdom chemical communication. To characterize the diffusible element that was responsible for eliciting this change in yeast metabolism, we employed activity guided fractionation. We first grew large-volume cultures of the inducing bacteria <italic>S. gallinarum</italic> and <italic>L. innocua</italic> to saturation in rich media containing glycerol as a principle carbon source (YP-glycerol). After removing the bacteria from the media by filtration to create a sterile conditioned medium, we assessed its capacity to induce growth on media containing glycerol (2%) and glucosamine (0.05%), hereafter abbreviated as GLY + GlcN. GlcN provides a stable, non-metabolizable glucose signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ball et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunz and Ball, 1977</xref>).

Pre-treatment with this purified extract afforded growth to a similar degree as <italic>S. gallinarum</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After these two rounds of purification, the inducing activity eluted in a single fraction as a homogenous peak. We combined active fractions from multiple injections and analyzed this peak by NMR and mass spectrometry.

Both occur naturally. Some bacteria, including the class known as lactic acid bacteria (LAB), have the ability to produce one or both forms from carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eiteman and Ramalingam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salminen et al., 2004</xref>).

We saw robust reversal of glucose repression in this range from both stereoisomers, in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). D-lactic acid induced cells to acquire the phenotype slightly more rapidly (data not shown). Addition of 0.05% lactic acid did not increase growth on YP alone, eliminating the possibility that the yeast were simply metabolizing the lactic acid (data not shown). Induction was also robust in synthetic complete medium, further establishing that it was due to the added lactic acid, rather than unknown components of the medium (e.g. yeast extract, peptone, or an unknown metabolite therein; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, we addressed the possibility that the presence of lactic acid could select for pre-existing [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells, as opposed to true induction of [<italic>gar</italic><sup>−</sup>] cells into the [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] state.

The [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] prion is found in evolutionarily distant fungal species, and can confer strong selective advantage – converting metabolic specialists to metabolic generalists in a manner that improves fitness in complex microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jarosz et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2014b</xref>). Our data link the common bacterial metabolite lactic acid, both structurally simple and widespread in nature, to this ancient switch in metabolic strategies.</p><p>Recent evidence points to important signaling roles for lactic acid in human cancer cells, in the context of the Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeva-Andany et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhup et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fiaschi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liberti and Locasale, 2016</xref>). Other studies have linked LAB to benefits for human health and disease prevention, however it remains unclear how much these effects are due to the effects of lactic acid on host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Masood et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tiptiri-Kourpeti et al., 2016</xref>). In at least some cases, LAB appear to exert their health effects by influencing other microbes, for example, modulating the virulence of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yun et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Many mysteries remain regarding the genetic and biochemical features that lead to the [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] prion; findings have so far been limited to its initial characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Lindquist, 2009</xref>) and discovery of its regulation by environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jarosz et al., 2014a</xref>). Our discovery of a connection between passive lactic acid uptake and the ability to induce [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] (via our results with <italic>SOK2</italic>) provides new insight into the initiation of this complex cross-kingdom chemical communication. Further molecular understanding of induction by lactic acid, and its links to the unusual biochemistry that fuels [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>], stands as a goal for future studies.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that other molecules may modulate [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] induction by lactic acid. Although we were able to fully reconstitute induction with lactic acid alone, the kinetics were slightly faster in conditioned media. Moreover, some of the bacteria that induce [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> do not induce the [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>]-like state in <italic>D. bruxellensis</italic>, even though high levels of lactic acid can induce the prion in each of these organisms. An intriguing but plausible explanation is that other bacterially secreted factors influence perception of the lactic acid signal, and that the effects of these molecules may also be species specific. Indeed, there is precedent for this behavior in choanoflagellates, where two bacterially secreted lipids were required to recapitulate full induction of rosette, multicellular colony formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alegado et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woznica et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, although we have shown that <italic>S. gallinarium</italic> induces [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] via lactic acid, it is entirely possible that other molecules could also fuel this cross-kingdom interaction in diverse ecological niches. There is also precedent in mechanisms of quorum sensing for competition among inducers secreted by different bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drescher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Even-Tov et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Perhaps most remarkably, our study raises the possibility that other prion-like epigenetic states could be regulated by common metabolites, at times in service of cross-species communication. Prior studies have highlighted the fact that general stressors that perturb protein homeostasis can modestly elevate the frequency of cells harboring the [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] or [<italic>MOT3</italic><sup>+</sup>] prions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tyedmers et al., 2008</xref>). These intrinsic links between stress responses and prion switching ensure that subpopulations of cells can diversify their phenotypes when they are ill-suited to the environment. Our findings extend this biology to a more concerted, switch-like behavior in which prions can serve as a target for rapid and effective cross-species communication.</p><p>Biological niches like the human body harbor microbial communities that are far more complex than those we have studied here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lozupone et al., 2012</xref>). It is striking that the robust connection we have discovered between a simple metabolite and a heritable change in metabolic strategy has been missed despite a multitude studies in this model organism. Our observations thus underscore the potential of cross-kingdom molecular communication to illuminate biological processes, in particular its capacity to elicit heritable, epigenetic transformations of biological traits. Recent progress in metabolomics and metagenomics motivate deeper exploration of such interactions between species, at both the molecular and systems levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast and bacterial media and strain maintenance</title><p>Bacteria strains were cultured on LB agar (Research Products International, Mt.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A common bacterial metabolite elicits prion-based bypass of glucose repression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This succinct paper reports the solution to a mystery posed by the authors' earlier work on induction of the [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] 'prion' by a low molecular weight molecule. That the inducer is lactic acid makes sense given the known ability of lactic acid-producing bacteria to induce [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] as well as the historical context vis-à-vis Pasteur's observations. The data that demonstrate that lactic acid is a [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] inducer are well controlled and nicely presented although the 'induction vs. selection' argument that is always raised in such studies should ideally have been explicitly addressed in the experimental design and resulting Discussion. The manuscript is clearly written and experimental design is straightforward.</p><p>However, several issues need to be addressed before this manuscript can be accepted for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Authors need to show that the glucosamine resistant colonies induced by lactic acid indeed contain a [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] prion. The evidence provided in the manuscript includes a dominance in genetic crosses and inhibition by myricetin, an inhibitor of Hsp70.

That the inducer is lactic acid makes sense given the known ability of lactic acid-producing bacteria to induce [GAR<sup>+</sup>] as well as the historical context vis-à-vis Pasteur's observations. The data that demonstrate that lactic acid is a [GAR<sup>+</sup>] inducer are well controlled and nicely presented although the 'induction vs. selection' argument that is always raised in such studies should ideally have been explicitly addressed in the experimental design and resulting Discussion.</italic> To address the induction vs. selection argument, we have examined whether [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells have accelerated growth rates compared to [<italic>gar</italic><sup>–</sup>] cells in the presence of inducing concentrations of lactic acid, which might raise the possibility that we could be favoring selection for [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] colonies in our assays to measure induction frequency.</p><p>We grew four biological replicates of [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] or [<italic>gar</italic><sup>–</sup>] cells in YP-glycerol or YP-glycerol + 0.35% D-lactic acid liquid media, measuring OD600 every 6 minutes over 4 days using an automated microplate reader. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells neither grew better than [<italic>gar</italic><sup>–</sup>] cells in glycerol alone nor when lactic acid was added to the medium. While we cannot exclude the possibility that a [<italic>gar</italic><sup>–</sup>] cell switching to a [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] state may introduce some immediate but short-lived growth advantage in lactic acid, we posit that this difference would need to be almost inconceivably large to result in the even the lowest levels of induction that we measured.</p><p><italic>The manuscript is clearly written and experimental design is straightforward.</italic> </p><p><italic>However, several issues need to be addressed before this manuscript can be accepted for publication.</italic> </p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Authors need to show that the glucosamine resistant colonies induced by lactic acid indeed contain a [GAR<sup>+</sup>] prion. The evidence provided in the manuscript includes a dominance in genetic crosses and inhibition by myricetin, an inhibitor of Hsp70. However, this is insufficient to conclude that the observed phenotype is controlled by a prion. First, authors need to show that in the lactic acid induced colonies, this phenotype shows non-Mendelian inheritance in meioisis and/or is transmitted by cytoplasmic infection (cytoduction).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion – it is a critical point. We have now added data showing non-Mendelian inheritance of the induced phenotype in meiosis. These data appear in a supplemental figure associated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Second, they need to show that myrecitin irreversibly cures [GAR<sup>+</sup>] rather than inhibiting it. it isn't clear from the paper if the phenotypic inhibition by inhibition of HSP70 is due to &quot;curing&quot; some cells of the prion, or a general inhibition of phenotype in all cells. Also it isn't clear if this &quot;prion&quot; inhibition is present only during HSP70 inhibition or if transient inhibition of HSP70 has a lasting effect on the so called [GAR<sup>+</sup>] phenotype.</italic> </p><p>We agree that it is important to test whether transient perturbations in Hsp70 function are sufficient to permanently eliminate the induced [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] phenotype. To rigorously address this question we have employed a dominant negative Hsp70 variant (Ssa1-K69M) in this revision. We transiently inhibited Hsp70 activity by expressing this dominant negative variant of Hsp70 from a plasmid and then ‘cured’ the cells of this construct, restoring normal Hsp70 function. Just as it did with spontaneous and bacterially-induced [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] (Jarosz et al., 2014a), this regimen eliminated the [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] phenotype induced by lactic acid. These data are now provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p>We have moved the myricetin data from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, in part to motivate the use of this method for <italic>D. bruxellensis [GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>]-like cells described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. (<italic>D. bruxellensis</italic> is not genetically tractable.) Accordingly, we have altered the language we use to describe the [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>]-like state in this organism.</p><p><italic>3) Third, at least in some isolates obtained from induction by lactic acid, either genetic or biochemical characterization needs to be performed showing that the phenotype under investigation is indeed related to proteins implicated in originally described [GAR<sup>+</sup>]. For example, two proteins have been identified as being associated with [GAR<sup>+</sup>], one (Pma1 p) is a major plasma membrane proton pump while the other (Std1p) is a transcription factor that among other targets, regulates hexose transporters. Does lactic acid influence the levels/activity of either of these in any plausible way? (In case if non-Mendelian inheritance/cytoduction and chaperone sensitivity are proven, but clear identification of the obtained isolates as [GAR<sup>+</sup>] is not done, results might still be publishable, but authors should be more careful in interpretations and should talk about the non-Mendelian prion-like elements similar to previously described [GAR<sup>+</sup>], rather than about [GAR<sup>+</sup>] prion per se.</italic> </p><p>Spontaneous [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] arises from alterations in the structure of Pma1 that influence its association with Std1. We have added data to address the requirement for Pma1 in lactic acid’s capacity to induce the [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] state, now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. <italic>PMA1</italic> is an essential gene, so we took advantage of a strain containing a degron allele that reduces its mRNA levels significantly (Breslow et al., 2008). We show that this strain produces colonies on GLY + GlcN plates at a low frequency that is not further induced by lactic acid. Thus we conclude that the ability of lactic acid to induce the [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] state depends on the level of Pma1 in the cell, just as spontaneous prion acquisition does.</p><p><italic>4) The same comments apply to [GAR<sup>+</sup>] isolates obtained in Dekkera yeast. As detailed characterization of such isolates in Dekkera is more difficult than in Saccharomyces, authors should probably change wording and refer to them more accurately, e. g. as glucosamine resistant colonies similar to [GAR<sup>+</sup>].</italic> </p><p>We have altered the language accordingly when referring to the “[<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>]-like” state in <italic>Dekkera</italic>.</p><p><italic>5) Authors talk about mitotic stabilities of [GAR<sup>+</sup>] isolates, but don't show actual data. These data need to be shown.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for noticing our wording error. We have edited this section to reflect the intention of our experiments.</p><p><italic>6) A further complexity alluded to by the authors in their brief Discussion is the possibility that there are other molecular 'co-factors' that are part of the induction mechanism – although clearly lactic acid can induce [GAR<sup>+</sup>] without added (but unidentified) 'co-factors'.</italic> </p><p>We have expanded on this point in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>7) What is disappointing is that the authors do not really attempt to come up with a plausible model based on their data and what was previously published about [GAR<sup>+</sup>] and its induction.

Moreover, surprisingly little is known about how yeast cells respond to lactic acid compared to other carbon sources. This lack of knowledge in both areas hampers our ability to propose a mechanistic model that is more than just conjecture. We now allude to this in the Discussion, highlighting our result that <italic>SOK2</italic> provides a link between the two responses.</p><p>The similarities and differences in biochemical properties of [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] compared to other prions is indeed interesting. Semi-dominance is key among them. This work raises another interesting point of comparison that fascinates us – can other prions be induced by common environmental factors? Of course, we would not expect that lactic acid could induce all yeast prions, but discovery of inducers for other prions could substantially revise our understanding of the ecological dynamics at play in prion biology. We also now incorporate these lines of thinking in the Discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A common bacterial metabolite elicits prion-based bypass of glucose repression&quot; for further consideration at eLife.
