The molecular basis for their anti-inflammatory effects is incompletely understood, but has been proposed to involve the indirect tethering of LXRs to inflammatory gene promoters. Here we demonstrate that the ability of LXRs to repress inflammatory gene expression in cells and mice derives primarily from their ability to regulate lipid metabolism through transcriptional activation and can occur in the absence of SUMOylation. Moreover, we identify the putative lipid transporter Abca1 as a critical mediator of LXR's anti-inflammatory effects. Activation of LXR inhibits signaling from TLRs 2, 4 and 9 to their downstream NF-κB and MAPK effectors through Abca1-dependent changes in membrane lipid organization that disrupt the recruitment of MyD88 and TRAF6. These data suggest that a common mechanism-direct transcriptional activation-underlies the dual biological functions of LXRs in metabolism and inflammation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08009.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08009.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08009.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inflammation is a normal part of the immune response to infection or tissue damage. However, increased inflammation has been linked to diseases such as obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis (in which the walls of the arteries become hardened). These same diseases have also been linked to problems with the production or breakdown of fatty molecules, such as cholesterol.</p><p>Transcription factors are proteins that bind to DNA to control gene expression. A transcription factor called LXR regulates the production and breakdown of cholesterol in response to changing levels of cholesterol in the body. LXR has also been shown to inhibit inflammatory responses, but previous studies suggested that these two actions of LXR are independent of each other.</p><p>Ito et al. have now challenged these findings by showing that LXR inhibits inflammation via changes in the metabolism of cholesterol and other fatty molecules. The experiments used genetically engineered immune cells, called macrophages, and mice to show that activating LXR causes cholesterol molecules to move between the membranes in a cell. This in turn leads to changes in the signals sent by proteins found at the cell surface, and eventually to a reduction of inflammation responses.</p><p>Future work will focus on better understanding the link between LXR's effects on metabolism and inflammation in models of human diseases such as diabetes and atherosclerosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08009.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08009.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>nuclear receptor</kwd><kwd>LXR</kwd><kwd>lipid metabolism</kwd><kwd>Toll-like receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tontonoz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL066088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tontonoz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL118161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tarling</surname><given-names>Elizabeth J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM103540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gratton</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM076516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gratton</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11POST7390075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ito</surname><given-names>Ayaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK063491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tontonoz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cholesterol-sensing nuclear receptor LXR regulates inflammatory responses by altering the lipid composition of cell membranes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that play pivotal roles in sterol homeostasis in mammals. LXRs control the expression of a battery of genes involved in cholesterol, fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism through direct binding to LXR response elements (LXREs) in their target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calkin and Tontonoz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hong and Tontonoz, 2014</xref>). In addition to their ability to activate the expression of genes linked to lipid metabolism, LXRs also have the ability to antagonize inflammatory gene expression triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joseph et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castrillo et al., 2003a</xref>). LXRs are not known to act as direct ligand-dependent repressors, that is, there is no well-documented example of LXR/RXR heterodimers binding to an LXRE in a gene promoter and repressing transcription in response to ligand. Rather, they have been proposed to act on inflammatory promoters through mechanisms that do not involve DNA-binding domain recognition of LXREs.</p><p>One proposed mechanism, termed ‘transrepression’, postulates that LXRs become SUMOylated in response to LXR agonist and that this SUMOylated LXR monomer stabilizes repressive nuclear complexes on the promoters of inflammatory genes. Key features of this model include the requirement for receptor SUMOylation, the involvement of an LXR monomer, and the mechanistic separation of the transcriptional activation and repression functions of LXRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghisletti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Venteclef et al., 2010</xref>). Although several lines of evidence have supported the transrepression model, the requirement for receptor SUMOylation in the repressive actions of LXRs on inflammatory genes in cells and animals remains to be tested. The potential involvement of additional or alternative mechanisms has also not been excluded.</p><p>We demonstrate here that the ability of LXRs to antagonize endogenous inflammatory gene expression in cultured cells and in vivo is a consequence of changes in cellular lipid metabolism. We show that the ability of LXRs to activate transcription of the Abca1 sterol transporter, and thereby alter membrane cholesterol homeostasis, has a secondary effect on inflammatory signaling through inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways downstream of TLRs. These data present a unified view of LXR-dependent gene regulation in which direct transcriptional activation underlies the dual biological functions of LXRs in metabolism and inflammation. They further emphasize the importance of local membrane composition in the activation of TLR signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gene activation is required for inflammatory repression by LXRs</title><p>LXRs activate gene expression as heterodimers with RXRs.

The synthetic LXR agonist GW3965 did not induce the canonical LXR target gene <italic>Abca1</italic>, nor did it repress LPS-induced inflammatory gene expression, in LXR-deficient MEFs or macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1B,C, 2A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castrillo et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Joseph et al., 2004</xref>).

It is also important to note that this approach does not involve supraphysiologic overexpression of LXRs, as the level of reconstituted protein expression in these cells was within the physiologic range and restored target gene expression to physiologic levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08009.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Transactivation but not sumoylation is required for LXR-mediated inflammatory repression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immortalized MEFs from <italic>Lxrα</italic>−<italic>/</italic>−<italic>Lxrβ</italic>−<italic>/</italic>− mice reconstituted with wild-type human LXRα, sumoylation site mutants (K328R/K434R (KK), K328R, K434R), wild-type human LXRβ, sumoylation site mutants (K410R/K448R (KK), K410R, K448R), or mock control were pretreated with GW3965 (1 µM) overnight, followed by stimulation with LPS (10 ng/ml) for 4 hr.

Thus, MyD88 emerged as potential common component of inflammatory signaling pathways targeted by LXR and Abca1. Flow cytometry revealed that TLR4 expression in plasma membrane was not affected by LXR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). We therefore tested whether the recruitment of key adaptor molecules to lipid rafts was altered by LXR activation. We performed cell fractionation studies to assess the ability of MyD88 and TRAF6 to associate with lipid rafts in response to TLR4 activation by LPS. We confirmed the ability of our antibodies to detect MyD88 and TRAF6 using MyD88-deficient and siRNA to TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). LPS-dependent recruitment of MyD88 and TRAF6 in Flotillin-1-enriched detergent-resistant membrane microdomains was markedly reduced by treatment of iBMDM with GW3965 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). Furthermore, the ability of LXR agonist to inhibit recruitment of MyD88 and TRAF6 was lost in Abca1-deficient macrophages. These observations suggest that a reduction in raft cholesterol content in response to LXR activation and Abca1 expression leads to alterations in membrane dynamics and/or raft structure and to the disruption of functional TLR4 complexes. Therefore, downstream MAPK and NF-κB signaling and inflammatory gene expression are repressed.<fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08009.017</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>LXR activation inhibits recruitment of MyD88 and TRAF6 to lipid rafts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type iBMDM were pretreated with GW3965 (1 µM) overnight and TLR4 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry.

Both of these processes are central to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castrillo et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Joseph et al., 2004</xref>). LXRs have been proposed to repress inflammatory gene expression <italic>in trans</italic> by tethering to NF-κB transcriptional complexes in a SUMOylation-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghisletti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Venteclef et al., 2010</xref>). This has heretofore been believed to be the sole mechanism underlying LXR's anti-inflammatory effects. The present study suggests that LXR-mediated transcriptional repression of endogenous inflammatory genes is principally dependent on LXR's capacity for transactivation. Our studies also identify the sterol transporter Abca1 as an important mediator of LXR's anti-inflammatory effects, both in vitro and in vivo. We find that Abca1 induction represses TLR-induced NF-κB and MAPK pathway activation by reducing the cholesterol content of detergent-resistant membrane domains. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for LXR-mediated inflammatory repression in which inflammatory repression is secondary to activation-dependent changes in cellular lipid metabolism.</p><p>Although we cannot exclude the possibility that trans-repression may operate in certain contexts, LXR agonist did not repress endogenous inflammatory gene expression in the absence of RXRα and RXRβ in our system, suggesting that LXR/RXR heterodimers were mediating repression. This led us to explore additional mechanisms for LXR inflammatory crosstalk. We found that an LXR L439A/E441A mutant that lacks co-activator recruitment capacity was unable to repress inflammation. These studies suggested that repression was mechanistically linked with transcriptional activation, and that repression might be a secondary phenomenon.</p><p>We examined an array of endogenous gene expression in LXR-null cells reconstituted with various LXRs mutants and found that mutants that could not undergo SUMOylation at the previously identified lysines (LXRα K328 and K434 and LXRβ K410 and K448) were still competent to repress inflammatory gene expression. Interestingly, the nuclear receptor SF-1 can be modified by SUMO in its hinge region and this modification has been shown to be functionally important for gene repression in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campbell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to the LXR transrepression model, however, the repressive effects of SUMOylated SF-1 are mediated by direct binding of SF-1 to response elements in its target promoters. Nevertheless, we considered the possibility that alternative SUMOylation sites in the hinge region of LXR (LXRα K177/K178/K180) might be used for transrepression. However, mutation of the three hinge lysines to arginine did not alter LXR-dependent repression of endogenous inflammatory genes.</p><p>Prior studies from our group suggested that LXR-mediated inflammatory repression was not mediated by the inhibition of nuclear translocation or DNA binding of NF-κB and AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castrillo et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2003b</xref>). These conclusions were drawn based on the analysis of electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In retrospect, these studies likely had technical limitations that prevented us from appreciating the effects of LXR on NF-κB signaling. Our prior studies did not define which NF-κB isoforms were bound to our DNA probe, and according to a recent comprehensive analysis of DNA binding by NF-κB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Siggers et al., 2012</xref>), the sequence we used is not predicted to have high affinity for the LPS-induced p65-p50 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoffmann and Baltimore, 2006</xref>). Our subsequent analysis of IκB phosphorylation, p65 nuclear translocation, and p65 recruitment to gene promoters has revealed previously unrecognized impairments in NF-κB and MAPK signaling in the setting of LXR activation.</p><p>The observation that gene activation was required for LXR-mediated inflammatory repression led us to identify the cholesterol transport protein Abca1 as a key mediator of the phenomenon. Accumulating evidence suggests that changes in membrane lipid content can affect inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Westerterp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rong et al., 2015</xref>). Our membrane dynamics and biochemical studies indicate that LXR-dependent Abca1 induction reduces raft cholesterol content and alters membrane fluidity, suggesting a biophysical basis for the ability of LXR to inhibit TLR signaling. Previous studies have reported that <italic>Abca1</italic>-deficient macrophages contain more cholesterol and TLR4 protein in plasma membrane lipid rafts and that this results in enhanced inflammatory signaling upon LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koseki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2010</xref>). Our data are consistent with these results and provide an additional mechanism whereby changes in Abca1 expression can affect TLR signaling. We found that Abca1 expression is important for the ability of LXR to inhibit signaling from TLRs 2, 4 and 9–all of which use MyD88 as a key adaptor. We showed that LXR activation inhibits recruitment of the adaptor proteins MyD88 and TRAF6 to rafts and thereby blocks TLR-induced activation of MAP kinases and NF-κB.</p><p>LXR activation leads to the induction of an entire cascade of genes involved in cellular lipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calkin and Tontonoz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hong and Tontonoz, 2014</xref>). Although Abca1 is clearly a major contributor, our data do not exclude the involvement of other factors. In our view, it is likely that additional LXR target genes involved in lipid handling may also contribute to effects on inflammation. One attractive additional player is the phospholipid-remodeling enzyme Lpcat3, which we have recently shown affects inflammatory signaling in hepatocytes in the setting of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rong et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, these studies outline a mechanistic connection between regulated plasma membrane cholesterol distribution and TLR-mediated inflammatory signaling. They further support a unified view of the role of LXR in transcriptional regulation in which direct activation underlies the dual biological functions of these nuclear receptors in metabolism and inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Reagents and plasmids</title><p>Synthetic LXR ligand GW3965 was provided by T.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Reviewers’ comments:</p><p>This manuscript provides compelling data refuting several papers suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effects of LXR agonism are due to increased SUMOylation of LXR, which was reported to recruit a co-repressor complex to promoters of inflammatory genes in macrophages. The present work suggests that SUMOylation is not required and that instead the mechanism involves the upregulation of ABCA1 expression. The authors show that ABCA1 is required for LXR-dependent anti-inflammatory activity through its ability to alter membrane lipid composition and in turn signaling through TLR4. While the data demonstrating that ABCA1 is required for the anti-inflammatory action of LXR agonists is quite good, the experiments were less robust in ruling out a role for SUMOylation or co-repression. Since a major conclusion of this work is based on co-repression not being involved, this is something that would need to be fleshed out in more detail. In addition, the proposed mechanism of ABCA1 effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) needs further experimental clarification.</p><p>1) The previous paper by Ghisletti et al., which was the basis for most of the conclusions that SUMOylation of LXRs mediates the anti-inflammatory effects, postulated that HDAC4 caused ligand-dependent SUMOylation via Ubc9, which in turn recruited N-CoR to target promoters (e.g., the iNos promoter). This previous paper used cells transfected with various siRNAs and/or LXR mutants to support their conclusions. The present manuscript has a similar set of experiments using retroviral expression in LXR KO and ABCA1 KO cells to show that LXR mutants lacking the SUMO sites still repress some genes. However, these experiments cannot be directly compared to Ghisletti et al., since the present work never even investigates the requirement of Ubc9 or N-CoR. In addition, perhaps the discrepancy may be due to the promoters studied in each paper. Ghisletti mainly studied the iNos promoter, while this paper focused mostly on other targets (e.g., IL-1b). At this point I do not believe one can entirely rule out the co-repression as part of the mechanism. The involvement of Ubc9 and N-CoR should be investigated. It would be important to include iNOS genes in the analyses here, as the effects may well be gene dependent and so direct comparison impossible and the issue will remain unresolved unless the same genes are analyzed.</p><p>2) I note that the present paper as well as the previous papers used siRNA as well as overexpression of mutant proteins to support their conclusions. Therefore, please include data showing the level of expression of proteins introduced into cells by retroviral infection, and the level of knockdown achieved by siRNA treatment. These are important controls to show the physiologic relevance of the findings.</p><p>3) Why is the LPS responds in the LXR-null macrophages slower than it is in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>)? LPS induced Erk, p38 and JNK phosphorylation within 20 min in WT but not in the KO cells. It may be informative to also include a time course of this effect in the Abca1-null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>) as well. It should be the same as the LXR KOs.</p><p>4) Please include statistical analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> to show which effects are significant.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F, G</xref> needs statistical quantitation. Visual inspection of this figure does not reveal “markedly reduced” changes in any of the bands due to LXR agonism. It is also not clear why flot-1 is not detected in any fractions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>? This doesn't seem to correspond to what the authors are saying in the text. Please clarify. I found it hard to interpret <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7F and G</xref> are equally uninterpretable: the result showing MyD88 recruitment between Raw cells and BMDMs looks opposite – in one case LPS increases the recruitment, in another reduces it. I feel this is not the best assay to address the mechanism. One likely scenario is that ABCA1 mediated cholesterol efflux affects recruitment of TIRAP. TIRAP is a sorting adaptor responsible for recruitment of MyD88 to TLR4 at the plasma membrane. TIRAP interacts with PIP2, which is enriched at lipid rafts. So a plausible scenario is that cholesterol 'depletion' from PM may affect TIRAP mediated MyD88 recruitment. A direct way to test this is by looking at TIRAP recruitment to PM in response to LPS (Kagan, Cell. 2006 Jun 2;125(5):943-55.). This is a fairly simple experiment that can be done quickly and all the reagents are available from the authors of the above study.</p><p>8) Recruitment of TIRAP-MyD88 should only affect NF-kB/MAPK pathways, but not the TRAM-TRIF pathways leading to IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Is ISG expression affected in the conditions tested in the study (GW, ABCA-1 KO)? The authors already have the data, just need to discuss it.</p><p>9) Further to point 3 above, the authors should test the effect of LXR and ABCA1 deficiency on CpG induced gene expression. Regardless of the outcome, the result of this simple experiment would be very informative.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08009.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] The authors show that ABCA1 is required for LXR-dependent anti-inflammatory activity through its ability to alter membrane lipid composition and in turn signaling through TLR4.

In response to the reviewers’ comments, we have now performed additional knockdowns for Ubc9 and HDAC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The data indicate that neither of these factors is required for repression in our system. We have also included iNos gene expression in our analysis as requested in multiple <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig8 fig10">figures (2, 3, 8, 10)</xref>. iNos is not expressed by fibroblasts and therefore could not be included in the MEF studies. We have not performed N-CoR knockdowns, because this experiment is not informative in our view. Loss of N-CoR derepresses LXR target genes, and this actually leads to increased Abca1 expression, as well as a myriad of other effects on many different nuclear receptors.</p><p>We do not wish to claim that there is no role for SUMOylation in any context. However, our data do clearly show that it is possible for LXR to repress inflammation in the absence of SUMOylation. The SUMOylation hypothesis was primarily based on analysis artificial promoters and it was never tested in vivo. Our systems examine endogenous genes and, as outlined in more detail in point 2 below, does not employ supraphysiological levels of LXRs.</p><p><italic>2) I note that the present paper as well as the previous papers used siRNA as well as overexpression of mutant proteins to support their conclusions.

We neglected to make it clear that we are not massively overexpressing LXRs in our system. Retroviral reconstitution of LXRs in the KO cells results in LXR protein expression within the physiological range and restores LXR target gene expression to levels comparable to WT cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have now also provided additional data on protein expression for various mutant LXRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have also provided additional validation of the efficacy of the siRNA reagents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Note, the key experiments on Abca1 are all done with true KO cells and the absence of protein is confirmed by western (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Why is the LPS responds in the LXR-null macrophages slower than it is in WT cells (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A, B</italic></xref><italic>)?

As requested we have now included the comparable time course for Abca1 in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. As predicted by the reviewer, the response is in fact similar to the LXR KOs.

We have remade the image and hope that this will correct the PDF conversion error (Revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A, B</xref>). Note, although the magnitude of change in the cholesterol levels in the raft fraction is not large in absolute terms, it is nonetheless biologically significant. Cholesterol levels in membranes never change dramatically in any physiological context. E.g., a change in ER cholesterol content between 3 and 5% has been reported by Brown and Goldstein to control SREBP cleavage.</p><p><italic>7)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figures 7F and G</italic></xref> <italic>are equally uninterpretable: the result showing MyD88 recruitment between Raw cells and BMDMs looks opposite – in one case LPS increases the recruitment, in another reduces it.

We agree that the RAW cell data was ambiguous, and we now present data exclusively from bone marrow macrophages, as they represent the most physiological system. We now compare WT and ABCA1-/- macrophages and show that LXR activation clearly inhibits MyD88 and TRAF6 recruitment to rafts in WT but not Abca1-/- cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). We also appreciate the insightful suggestion regarding TIRAP, but based on our finding that TLR9 is also inhibited by LXR, TIRAP seems to be excluded as the mediator of the LXR effect.</p><p><italic>8) Recruitment of TIRAP-MyD88 should only affect NF-kB/MAPK pathways, but not the TRAM-TRIF pathways leading to IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).

LXRs do not repress activation of the TRAM-TRIF-IRF3 arm stimulated by TLR3, consistent with MyD88 being the target.</p><p><italic>9) Further to point 3 above, the authors should test the effect of LXR and ABCA1 deficiency on CpG induced gene expression. Regardless of the outcome, the result of this simple experiment would be very informative</italic>.</p><p>This was an excellent suggestion. We have now examined LXR effects on signaling through TLR2,3 and 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). LXR represses TLR9 in an Abca1-dependent manner, again suggesting that MyD88 rather than TIRAP is the target.</p></body></sub-article></article>
