direct transcription factor-hormone interactions that modulate gene expression. In contrast, plant hormone signalling is most commonly based on de-repression via the degradation of transcriptional repressors. Recently, we uncovered a non-canonical signalling mechanism for the plant hormone auxin whereby auxin directly affects the activity of the atypical auxin response factor (ARF), ETTIN towards target genes without the requirement for protein degradation. Here we show that ETTIN directly binds auxin, leading to dissociation from co-repressor proteins of the TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED family followed by histone acetylation and induction of gene expression. This mechanism is reminiscent of animal hormone signalling as it affects the activity towards regulation of target genes and provides the first example of a DNA-bound hormone receptor in plants. Whilst auxin affects canonical ARFs indirectly by facilitating degradation of Aux/IAA repressors, direct ETTIN-auxin interactions allow switching between repressive and de-repressive chromatin states in an instantly-reversible manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Auxin</kwd><kwd>ETTIN</kwd><kwd>Chromatin</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd><italic>gynoecium</italic> development</kwd><kwd>histone modification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S002901/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Østergaard</surname><given-names>Lars</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L010623/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kepinski</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M011216/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuhn</surname><given-names>André</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P013511/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Østergaard</surname><given-names>Lars</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Auxin binding to the ETTIN transcription factor disrupts the interaction between ETT and a TPL/TPR co-repressor and subsequently affects chromatin dynamics to ensure proper gynoecium development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Developmental programmes within multicellular organisms originate from a single cell (<italic>i.e.</italic> a fertilised oocyte) that proliferates into numerous cells ultimately differentiating to make up specialised tissues and organs. Tight temporal and spatial regulation of the genes involved in these processes is essential for proper development of the organism. Changes in gene expression are often controlled by mobile signals that translate positional information into cell type-specific transcriptional outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hironaka and Morishita, 2012</xref>). In plants, this coordination can be facilitated by phytohormones such as auxin, which controls processes throughout plant development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vanneste and Friml, 2009</xref>). In canonical auxin signalling, auxin-responsive genes are repressed when auxin levels are low by Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors that interact with DNA-bound Auxin Response Factors (ARFs). As auxin levels increase, the auxin molecule binds to members of the TIR1/AFB family of auxin co-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</xref>). The main role of this auxin perception mechanism, besides non-transcriptionally inhibiting growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fendrych et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallei et al., 2019</xref>), is transcriptional reprogramming. This is realised by interaction with Aux/IAA repressors, leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome, ultimately relieving the repression of ARF-targeted loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kelley and Estelle, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leyser, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weijers and Wagner, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We recently identified an alternative auxin-signalling mechanism whereby auxin directly affects the activity of a transcription factor (TF) complex towards its downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simonini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Simonini et al., 2017</xref>). This mechanism mediates precise polarity switches during organ initiation and patterning and includes the ARF, ETTIN (ETT/ARF3) as a pivotal component. However, ETT is an unusual ARF lacking the Aux/IAA-interacting Phox/Bem1 (PB1) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simonini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sessions et al., 1997</xref>) and is therefore unlikely to mediate auxin signalling via the canonical pathway. Here, we demonstrate that ETT binds auxin directly and that this interaction determines expression of ETT target genes. In conditions of low auxin levels, ETT interacts with co-repressors of the TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED (TPL/TPR) family to keep chromatin at ETT target loci in a repressed state through HDA19-mediated histone deacetylation. Under high auxin conditions, ETT binds auxin leading to dissociation of TPL/TPR-HDA19 and de-repression of ETT targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>ETT can interact with a diverse set of TFs and these interactions are sensitive to the naturally occurring auxin, indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simonini et al., 2016</xref>). To test if this effect is mediated through a direct interaction between ETT and auxin, we took advantage of the drug affinity-responsive target stability (DARTS) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lomenick et al., 2011</xref>) and followed the effect of IAA on proteolytic degradation of a FLAG-fused ETT segment conditionally expressed in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The concentrations of IAA applied (0.1 µM, 1 µM, 10 µM) were selected to saturate the protein with ligand and to ensure maximal protection from proteolysis. As a negative control, benzoic acid (BA) was applied at the same dose as IAA (10 µM and 100 µM) because of its similar size and pK<sub>a</sub> as IAA. Treatments with IAA but not BA protected ETT-FLAG from pronase-induced degradation consistent with direct, specific interaction between IAA and ETT in planta.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ETT directly binds auxin (IAA).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) DARTS assay suggests that ETT binds IAA.

A protein fragment containing 207 amino acids of the ES domain, ES<sup>388-594</sup>, sufficient for mediating IAA-sensitivity in ETT-protein interactions, was produced recombinantly and shown to be intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Simonini et al., 2018</xref>). The sensitivity of ETT-TF interactions to IAA suggests a direct effect of the IAA molecule on the ETT protein. Therefore, to test whether ETT binds IAA, we carried out heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments using <sup>15</sup>N-labelled ES<sup>388-594</sup> protein. The HSQC spectrum, recorded at 5 °C, shows a prominent signal-dense region consistent with the ES domain being largely intrinsically disordered. Interestingly, the spectrum also shows dispersed peaks flanking the signal-dense region indicating that there is nevertheless some propensity to form secondary structure, particularly with a helical character (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In addition to this overview of ETT structure, the HSQC NMR probes chemical shifts of protein amide-NH bonds in response to the presence of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meyer and Peters, 2003</xref>). We found that a number of residues shifted their position in the spectrum in response to the addition of IAA, whereas addition of BA had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–d</xref>). These shifts show that certain residues are experiencing a changed chemical environment as a consequence of IAA-binding and this may include the conformational change of a structural motif within the ETT protein. The HSQC experiment therefore demonstrates that ETT binds IAA directly. This experiment has not allowed us to assign signals to specific amino acids and hence there is some uncertainty associated with tracking the chemical shifts of some residues. However, a particularly large change is observed for the tryptophan NH cross peak when IAA is added to the ETT fragment (~10 ppm, rectangle I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,d</xref>). Since there is only one tryptophan in the ETT fragment used here (W505), this shift can be assigned to this residue and suggests that W505 has a prominent role in the interaction with IAA.</p><p>We also used the recombinant ETT fragment in an Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) assay, which characterises binding of ligands to proteins by determining thermodynamic parameters of the interaction as heat exchange. This experiment revealed interaction between ETT and IAA, while control experiments titrating IAA into buffer without protein and titrating buffer without IAA into the ETT fragment showed no heat exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–g</xref>). We were unable to obtain a K<sub>d</sub> value for the interaction, which may be due to the interaction being weak as well as potential protein aggregation. This could reflect that the ETT-auxin interaction is stabilised by interacting protein partners in planta that are not present in this in vitro experiment.</p><p>Together, these three independent biochemical methods demonstrate that ETT binds IAA directly thus revealing a key molecular aspect of the non-canonical auxin-signalling pathway.</p><p>Previously, <italic>PINOID</italic> (<italic>PID</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benjamins et al., 2001</xref>) and <italic>HECATE1</italic> (<italic>HEC1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gremski et al., 2007</xref>) were identified as ETT target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simonini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Simonini et al., 2017</xref>) and both genes are upregulated in gynoecium tissue from the <italic>ett-3</italic> mutant compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Unsurprisingly, the DNA-binding domain characteristic to B3-type TFs such as ARF proteins was conserved across all ETT proteins. Towards the C terminus of the ES domain we identified an EAR-like motif with a particularly high level of conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated Amphiphilic Repression (EAR) motifs are also found in Aux/IAA proteins. Interactions between Aux/IAA and members of the TOPLESS and TOPLESS-RELATED (TPL/TPR) family of co-repressors occur via this motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Szemenyei et al., 2008</xref>). TPL/TPRs mediate their repressive effect by attracting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to promote chromatin condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krogan et al., 2012</xref>). It was recently shown that ETT is required to keep Histone H3 at a deacetylated state at the gene locus of the meristem identity gene <italic>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS</italic> (<italic>STM</italic>) thereby repressing <italic>STM</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). Since ETT functions independently of the canonical auxin pathway, it is possible that its role in chromatin remodelling occurs via direct interaction with TPL/TPRs through the EAR-like motif. To test this, we carried out Yeast 2-Hybrid (Y2H) assays in which ETT was found to interact with TPL, TPR2 and TPR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

Henceforth, ‘auxin’ will refer to IAA unless stated otherwise. These data suggest that in conditions with low auxin levels, ETT can interact with TPL/TPR proteins to repress the expression of target genes. An increase in cellular auxin causes ETT to bind auxin thereby undergoing a conformational change that abolishes interaction with TPL/TPR co-repressors.</p><p>The HSQC-NMR experiment described above indicate that the tryptophan in position 505 (W505) affects the direct interaction between the ETT protein and auxin. To test the role of W505 in the auxin-sensitive interaction with TPL/TPRs, we constructed a mutated version of ETT (W505A) and assessed the effect in protein interaction assays. Both Y2H and Co-IP experiments revealed that W505 is required for the ETT-TPL/TPR interaction to be sensitive to auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>). The key importance of W505 is furthermore supported by a phylogenetic analysis of ETT protein sequences revealing that this residue is highly conserved in ETT proteins across angiosperms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><p>TPL was originally identified as a key factor involved in setting up the apical-basal growth axis during embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Long et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith and Long, 2010</xref>).

Although only ETT is expected to bind DNA, ChIP followed by qPCR revealed that all three proteins associate with DNA elements in the same regions of the promoters of <italic>PID</italic> and <italic>HEC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref>). Moreover, while ETT association with these promoter regions was largely unaffected in the presence of IAA, TPL and HDA19 interactions are reduced upon auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref>). This supports a model in which ETT recruits TPL/TPR2 and HDA19 to ETT target loci to keep chromatin in a condensed state through histone deacetylation. When auxin levels increase, the ETT-TPL/TPR2 interaction is broken and TPL/TPR2 and HDA19 dissociate from the loci, presumably preventing HDA19 from deacetylating histones. To test this, we assayed for H3K27 acetylation, which is a substrate for HDA19. H3K27 acetylation increased in the absence of ETT and upon treatment with auxin. This occurred in the same regions of the <italic>PID</italic> and <italic>HEC1</italic> promoters where the proteins were found to associate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d,e</xref>).

Our data lead to a model in which low levels of auxin maintain ETT associations with TPL/TPR2 to repress gene expression via H3K27 deacetylation. As auxin levels increase, TPL/TPR2 (and hence HDA19) disassociate from ETT, promoting H3K27 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). This model molecularly underpins the published association between auxin dynamics and <italic>PID</italic> expression at the gynoecium apex where <italic>PID</italic> is repressed at early stages of development to allow symmetry transition, but subsequently de-repressed as auxin levels rise to facilitate polar auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simonini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moubayidin and Ostergaard, 2014</xref>). Whilst this model explains the data on ETT-mediated auxin signalling during gynoecium development, it is possible that the effect of auxin on ETT varies depending on the developmental context. Moreover, the concentrations of auxin required to mediate its effect on ETT is likely to differ between diverse ETT-containing complexes.</p><p>The direct binding of auxin allows ETT to switch the chromatin locally between repressive and de-repressive states. The recent report of ETT negatively regulating <italic>STM</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2019</xref>) provides molecular evidence that ETT can function as a repressor. Whether ETT also has a role in recruiting activating components is yet to be clarified. Indeed, different modes of actions are possible that could depend on other interacting partners or auxin levels and even be target-gene specific. Nevertheless, the effect of auxin on ETT-mediated regulation of the genes studied here is instantly reversible, making it possible to switch between states, immediately responding to changes in auxin levels. This feature, which is reminiscent of animal hormonal signalling pathways such as the Thyroid Hormone and Wnt/ß-catenin pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsai and O'Malley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gammons and Bienz, 2018</xref>), may be particularly important in controlling changes in tissue polarity during plant organogenesis as observed in the Arabidopsis gynoecium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moubayidin and Ostergaard, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The identification of a direct auxin-ETT interaction to control gene expression adds an additional layer of complexity to auxin action, which contributes towards explaining how auxin imparts its effect on highly diverse processes throughout plant development. In a broader context, this work also opens for the exciting possibility that direct transcription factor-ligand interactions is a general feature in the control of gene expression in plants as found in animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

After centrifugation of the sonicated cell suspension, the pellet was resuspended and washed in Wash Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 0.1 mM EDTA; 5% (v/v) Glycerol; 0.1 mM DTT; 50 mM NaCl; 2% (w/v) NaDOC) for 1 hour at 4°C followed by centrifugation (11,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C). The resulting pellet was again washed in Wash Buffer and centrifuged as described previously. The pellet was resuspended in 20mL of Solubilisation Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 0.1 mM EDTA; 5% (v/v) Glycerol; 0.1 mM DTT; 50 mM NaCl; 0.25% Sarkosyl (N-Lauroyl sarcosine) and stirred at 4°C for 1h. Subsequently the resuspension was dialysed overnight in 2L Dialysis Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 0.1 mM EDTA; 5% (v/v) Glycerol; 0.1 mM DTT; 50 mM NaCl). The Dialysis Buffer was exchanged for fresh Dialysis Buffer after at least 2 hours of dialysis. After dialysis the lysate was centrifuged (11,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C). The resulting supernatant contained the required protein which was concentrated to 2 mL using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters with a 10kDa cut-off (Millipore (UK) Ltd.) and further purified using size exclusion chromatography. The protein was eluted in Chromatography Buffer and concentrated to 2 mL as previously described. Protein concentration was determined with Quick Start Bradford 1x reagent (Bio-Rad) and adjusted using Chromatography Buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>HSQC NMR</title><p>The ES domain, ES<sup>388-594</sup>, protein was analysed by NMR at 5°C under reducing conditions (DTT 10 mM), buffered at pH 8.0 (Tris 20 mM). <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC was performed at 950 MHz, TCI probe, Bruker following the parameters described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.

of data.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Direct ETTIN-auxin interaction controls chromatin state in gynoecium development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While both reviewers highlighted the suitability of your work for <italic>eLife</italic> in principle, they also see certain shortcomings, which prevents publication in its present form.</p><p>Essential revisions include:</p><p>1) The reviewers see a big gap between the in vitro ETT/TPL interaction and the H3K27ac changes in vivo that needs to be bridged. TPL is not the only co-repressor complex that may recruit <italic>HDA19</italic> to ETT and ETT interacts with other transcription factors that in turn can also recruit co-repressors. It is currently unclear whether auxin-mediated disruption of the ETT/TPL interaction directly induces changes in <italic>HDA19</italic> interaction or chromatin recruitment. This should be tested directly in the presence of auxin in transient interaction assays and by ETT/TPL/HDA19 ChIP +/- IAA at target loci (see further comments to this aspect by reviewer #1).</p><p>2) The reviewers also request additional experiments, consolidating the auxin binding to ETT. They encourage the authors to carry out additional MST analyses with ideally using full length ETTIN vs ettin mutant protein (W505). Please quantify binding ETT binding to auxin (see further comments to this aspect by reviewer #2).</p><p>Please, see also additional comments by the reviewers below, which may guide you to further strengthen your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study picks up where Simonini et al., 2016 had left off, which had showed that multiple TFs including IND interact with ETT in an auxin -dependent manner. ETT-IND were found to repress <italic>PID</italic> expression based on in situ hybridization in mutant gynoecia. Mutations in IND that disrupted interaction with ETT led to reduced accumulation of <italic>PID</italic>, which was interpreted as a role in transcriptional activation of <italic>PID</italic> by IND and ETT in the absence of auxin.</p><p>As I am not an expert on HSQC-NMR or ITC, I will let other reviewers comment on these data. The authors show that nicely TIR1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for <italic>HEC1</italic> and <italic>PID</italic> are induction, suggesting that Aux/IAA degradation is not required for this processes. Critiques that should be addressed are in the numbered/lettered paragraphs below.</p><p>1) They next test physical interaction between ETT and TPL/TPRs in Y2H and show it is abolished by addition of IAA. They also test interaction by co-IP in 35S:OE lines after transient transfection into N. benthamiana. In plants, the IAA treatment seems to lead to a both strong reduction in TPL accumulation as well as interaction. This needs to be addressed. It is moreover critical to assess the <italic>HDA19</italic> interaction with ETT in N. benthamiana. Using ETT and <italic>HDA19</italic> co-transfection into plant cells, ETT was recently shown to interact with <italic>HDA19</italic> via endogenous co-repressors (such as TPL or SEU) by co-IP and by BiFC (Chung et al., 2019). In addition, the ETT interaction partner FIL also interacts with <italic>HDA19</italic> (likely via different co-repressors). So it is critical to assess whether auxin disrupts ETT complex formation with <italic>HDA19</italic> to show that the auxin disrupted ETT/TPL interaction is important for <italic>HDA19</italic> association with ETT. As an aside, it should be mentioned in the text that ETT/FIL were shown to recruit <italic>HDA19</italic> to <italic>STM</italic> in the above-mentioned study (Chung et al., 2019).</p><p>In ett or tpl /tpr mutant gynoecioa, auxin was not able to induce <italic>HEC1</italic> and <italic>PID</italic>, this was true to a lesser degree for <italic>HEC1</italic> in the <italic>hda19</italic> mutant. In addition, <italic>HEC1</italic> and <italic>PID</italic> expression is elevated in ett, tpl and <italic>hda19</italic> mutants relative to wt. Although not based on inducible mutants, these data suggest that in the wild type ETT and TPL/R repress <italic>HEC1</italic> and IND.</p><p>2) Figure 5 attempts to show a possible mechanisms for the observed effects by using chromatin immunoprecipitation of ETT, <italic>HEC1</italic> and <italic>HDA19</italic>. There are several issues with the data provided.</p><p>a) First, from a technical perspective, the authors should show the factor binding as% input (to give the reader an idea of the occupancy compared to other TFs or chromatin regulators). More importantly, H3K27ac should be presented as fraction of H3. The latter is critical as a change in histone modification is only informative if we know that the nucleosome occupancy has not changed.</p><p>b) Second, there was no test for a possible change in TFL or <italic>HDA19</italic> occupancy upon auxin treatment at <italic>PID</italic> or <italic>HEC1</italic>, although this is a key tenet of their model. ETT occupancy at <italic>PID</italic> and <italic>HEC1</italic> should also be assayed plus minus auxin.</p><p>Third, the authors reported lower H3K27ac in the non auxin-treated wild type. This fits with the reduced gene expression, yet cause and consequence are not clear – especially in the absence of test of disruption of ETT- HDA19 interaction by auxin or <italic>HDA19</italic> occupancy at the loci being tested. This is important, because changes in gene expression lead to changes in histone modifications and vice -versa.</p><p>3) Finally, the title and main conclusion are misleading and oversell the findings.</p><p>a) According to the author's data and with some additional support as specified above, the manuscript could show that ETT serves to recruit TPL and <italic>HDA19</italic> in the absence of IAA. In the presence of IAA this complex may fall apart. This does not show that ETT toggles between activation and repression. It would show that ETT 's ability to recruit co-repressors is abrogated by auxin.</p><p>b) I know the authors suggested this activator/repressor model in the Simonini paper based on dominant mutant proteins, which are tricky to interpret. Besides there being no evidence for such a dual role of ETT in the current paper, I think it is important to remember that the ett loss of function mutant has elevated <italic>PID</italic> and <italic>HEC1</italic>. This suggest ETT acts as a repressor. Likewise, for genes bound by MP where loss of MP function results in loss-of-expression, MP is an activator, even though MP does associate with different types of chromatin regulators in the absence or presence of auxin at these loci.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors deal with the idea that ETT is a particular ARF protein, that engages directly not only other transcriptional regulators, but the family of TPL co-repressors, and more importantly binds directly auxin. Two previous manuscripts from the same research group (Simonini et al., 2016 and Simonini et al., 2017) had brought up the very intriguing hypothesis that ETT-binds auxin by a non-canonical mechanism, independently of TIR1/AFB-AUX/IAA auxin perception. The hypothesis is fascinating, and the authors previously used genetics, plant physiology and developmental genetics to validate their claim.</p><p>In Kuhn et al., the authors seek to: show biochemically direct auxin binding by ETT; connect the ETT &quot;auxin binding role&quot; to specific non-canonical gene expression; bring evidence of ETT directly binding TPL and TPRs for auxin-triggered responses in the gynoecium; show that ETT interactions with TPL and histone deacetylases are sensitive to auxin levels, regulating thereby <italic>HEC1</italic> and <italic>PID</italic> expression. Kuhn et al. work is good and straightforward, in the sense that their hypotheses were addressed by few, but robust experiments. The manuscript would tremendously profit from additional biochemical or biophysical experiments though, using preferably the full length of ETT, to evidence auxin binding. Is that feasible?</p><p>Since the authors identified W505 as important putative auxin binding site, why was not an ETT W505 mutant version, and other mutations, tested in iTC or MST, for instance? This reviewer is concerned that since the interaction between ETT and auxin is weak, one could almost account for random peptide interaction, via charges or the similar, for the poor ITC data. Can the authors please quantify binding?</p><p>– Along the same lines and about Figure 1 and interactions experiments: Why did the authors not estimate the binding affinity or Kd of ETT-IAA? could the weak (not saturable) ETT-IAA signal be the result of transient peptide interactions?</p><p>– When the authors implemented the synthetic auxin-TIR1 tool developed in Keiko Torii's lab, they showed that ETT interaction is highly specific for IAA, but not cvxIAA even though the interaction occurs in an IDR. Can the authors please explain the findings?</p><p>– Have the authors evaluated whether there is any sequence conservation for IAA binding around ETT W505?</p><p>– Can the authors make the binding comparison of ETT-IAA vs. ETT-BA, or vs. ETT-other auxins, or ETT-tryptophan via iTC in order to make a more robust claim about auxin binding?</p><p>– Regarding Model Figure 5D. Do the authors have any hypothesis about what happens with ETT upon auxin binding?</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>– The Abstract includes references, is that not a bit unusual?</p><p>– Abstract fifth sentence: Sentence too long. Split and/or rephrase</p><p>– Abstract final sentence: Giving the outcome of the paper, I recommend to state &quot;ETT might be able to switch chromatin locally…”</p><p>– Introduction first paragraph: The word &quot;ubiquitinylation&quot; is incorrect, as it does not refer to ubiquitin conjugation of proteins. Please use &quot;ubiquitination&quot; or &quot;ubiquitylation&quot; instead</p><p>– Please rephrase the statement about ES domain being disordered, as it is disconnected, and the reason for bringing it up on that section of the Introduction is not clear.</p><p>– The authors used the word &quot;sensitivity&quot;, which is a broad claim, given they used a single IAA concentration of 100 µM in their yeast-two hybrid assay.</p><p>– HSQC is not the typical experimental approach to proof an X ligand binds to a putative receptor. If this approach is implemented because of the solely disordered nature of ETT, please say it so or rephrase.</p><p>– &quot;Helical character&quot; indicated by what? It would be nice to have a visualization help for non-NMR experts.</p><p>– “…found that a number of residues shifted…&quot;. Please elaborate.</p><p>– Why did the authors use benzoic acid (BA) as a control ligand in their experiments? Why not to use tryptophan as the obvious non-active auxin precursor?</p><p>– &quot;The HSQC experiment demonstrates that ETT binds IAA directly&quot;. I recommend the authors to be cautious here with this statement. While high-field NMR is a powerful tool for investigating transiently forming protein-ligand complexes and for the identification of protein binding partners, there are a number of strategies that the authors must implement first that will specifically enable the physicochemical characterization of ETT-IAA interactions.</p><p>– iTC experiments are unfortunately weak e.g. no saturation reached, extremely low signal to noise ratio. Therefore, the authors again should be careful about their statements on direct biochemically relevant ETT-IAA binding.</p><p>– Please specify if the ccvTIR1 can accommodate the native IAA.</p><p>– Please use here &quot;…independently of the canonical TIR1/AFB1-5 signalling pathway.&quot;</p><p>– Why IAA = auxin? This is unnecessary and not accurate, stick to &quot;IAA&quot; please.</p><p>– Could the authors elaborate on a hypothesis for the role of TPR4? Could its action and interaction with ETT or an ETT-like protein in a different tissue be also auxin sensitive?</p><p>– &quot;low levels of auxin&quot; do not maintain per se ETT-TPL/TPR2 associations. Please rephrase.</p><p>– The authors have referred twice about the &quot;instantly reversible&quot; event. What do they mean by this? There is no data on timing! &quot;Instantly&quot; as when a [IAA] threshold has been reached?</p><p>– The inclusion of an auxin insensitive ett mutant might have shed light on the true nature of the ETT-IAA responsive genes.</p><p>Comments on Figures:</p><p>– Figure 1. Which IAA concentration was used for these experiments? Please include relevant info in the Figure legend.</p><p>– Figure 1. The color of NMR data is hard to distinguish, particularly the blues and the blacks.</p><p>Figure 1D-F. Are the control panels E and F necessary as extra figure?

As mentioned, this experiment was recently published in Chung et al., 2019, and showed that <italic>HDA19</italic> and ETT do not interact directly, but via other proteins. Unless we have misunderstood the reviewer's comment, we do not see the need to carry this out again.</p><p>Reviewer: <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> assays also probe indirect interactions between proteins via host proteins. Perusal of the pulldowns in Chung et al. does indeed reveal a weak <italic>HDA19</italic> pulldown by ETT (and a very strong ARF4 pulldown by <italic>HDA19</italic>). BiFC using Arabidopsis protoplasts showed strong (indirect) interactions between ETT and <italic>HDA19</italic>. The current study suggests that these indirect interactions should be impaired in the presence of high levels of auxin.</p><p>Current review</p><p>2) The authors should reconcile their data with the previously published data that implicates ETT/ARF4/FIL in recruitment of <italic>HDA19</italic> containing co-repressor complexes to repress KNOX genes in regions of local auxin maxima at the inflorescence shoot apex. In looking at the literature and the current manuscript, a difference in effective auxin levels became apparent. The authors used a rather high auxin concentration to disrupt the ETT – <italic>HDA19</italic> co-repressor complex in planta: 100 µM IAA for Figure 4 and Figure 5. By contrast 10 µM IAA is commonly used in inflorescences. Gynoecia may indeed have higher auxin levels.</p><p>This suggests a different model and a different conclusion from that currently proposed by the authors are needed. At intermediate auxin levels, for example those of the inflorescence shoot apex, ETT (together with other TFs) is able to recruit <italic>HDA19</italic>-containing co-repressors, while at higher auxin levels, those present in the gynoecium, this interaction is blocked. The authors should revise the Discussion and their model accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51787.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions include:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>1) The reviewers see a big gap between the</italic> in vitro <italic>ETT/TPL interaction and the H3K27ac changes</italic> in vivo <italic>that needs to be bridged.

We performed the ChIP experiments suggested showing that the interaction of both <italic>HDA19</italic> and TPL with the promoters of <italic>HEC1</italic> and <italic>PID</italic> is disrupted in the presence of IAA, while ETT binding remains (as previously shown – Simonini et al., 2016).

Additional attempts could take a long time with no guarantee for success. However, we have previously shown that the ES domain is sufficient for the IAA-sensitivity (Simonini et al., 2016; Simonini et al., 2018) in agreement with numerous other studies reporting a biophysical interaction using an individual protein domain in isolation (e.g. Martin-Arevalillo et al. 2017 PNAS 114, 8107-12; Wild et al. (2016) Science 352, 986-90).</p><p>We have not been able to improve on the ITC data presented in the first version. This is due to different factors. Firstly, even with a further optimisation of ES-domain production, we are unable to obtain large enough amounts of fully soluble and stable protein. Secondly, the protein we use seems to aggregate during the ITC measurements making it difficult to obtain a K<sub>d</sub> value. This is now discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we instead include an additional independent experiment using the DARTS assays providing additional evidence for the direct interaction between ETT and IAA (presented in Figure 1A).</p><p>Finally, we also show that the tryptophan in position 505 (W505) is required for the IAAsensitivity of ETT in both Y2H and transient assays in N. benthamiana.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) They next test physical interaction between ETT and TPL/TPRs in Y2H and show it is abolished by addition of IAA.

Kuhn et al. work is good and straightforward, in the sense that their hypotheses were addressed by few, but robust experiments. The manuscript would tremendously profit from additional biochemical or biophysical experiments though, using preferably the full length of ETT, to evidence auxin binding. Is that feasible?</p></disp-quote><p>Despite using a large range of different expression systems over several years, we are unable to produce full length ETT in any recombinant system. As described in Simonini et al., 2018, we can make an almost full version of the Cterminal ES domain (only lacking 14 amino acids at the terminus), which is sufficient for the ETT-sensitivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the authors identified W505 as important putative auxin binding site, why was not an ETT W505 mutant version, and other mutations, tested in iTC or MST, for instance? This reviewer is concerned that since the interaction between ETT and auxin is weak, one could almost account for random peptide interaction, via charges or the similar, for the poor ITC data. Can the authors please quantify binding?</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, we have not been able to improve on our ITC data despite several attempts (including developing a fusion protein that stayed in solution, but had lost ability to bind IAA in this assay). However, we agree with the reviewer on exploiting the potential importance of the tryptophan in position 505 (W505) in the ETT-auxin interaction. Therefore, we developed mutant versions substituting tryptophan for alanine (W505A) and tested them in interaction assays ± IAA (Y2H and Co-IP with TPL). In agreement with a central role of W505, the ETT(W505A)-TPL interaction was not disrupted by IAA (Figure 3B, D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Along the same lines and about Figure 1 and interactions experiments: Why did the authors not estimate the binding affinity or Kd of ETT-IAA? could the weak (not saturable) ETT-IAA signal be the result of transient peptide interactions?</p></disp-quote><p>Possibly due to insufficiently high protein concentration and/or aggregation, we were unable to obtain ITC data allowing quantification of the binding affinity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– When the authors implemented the synthetic auxin-TIR1 tool developed in Keiko Torii's lab, they showed that ETT interaction is highly specific for IAA, but not cvxIAA even though the interaction occurs in an IDR. Can the authors please explain the findings?</p></disp-quote><p>Without a protein structure it is hard to explain the specific requirement for IAA over other auxinic compounds in this pathway. However, this is not just IAA vs cvxIAA. We have previously reported that neither NAA nor 2,4-D are able to mediate the effect on ETTprotein interactions (this paper and Simonini et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Have the authors evaluated whether there is any sequence conservation for IAA binding around ETT W505?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We have found that the tryptophan in position 505 is highly conserved among the 25 ETT proteins that we have identified. In contrast, very little sequence conservation is observed among other residues in that region. We have included a sequence logo of the W505 region in the alignment in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A to point this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Can the authors make the binding comparison of ETT-IAA vs. ETT-BA, or vs. ETT-other auxins, or ETT-tryptophan via iTC in order to make a more robust claim about auxin binding?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we use IAA vs BA in the DARTS and NMR experiments and IAA vs. NAA in the Y2H and Co-IP in N. benthamiana. We did not test all variations in ITC due to difficulty in obtaining sufficient protein as described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Regarding Model Figure 5D. Do the authors have any hypothesis about what happens with ETT upon auxin binding?</p></disp-quote><p>Structurally, we do not yet have any idea what changes are occurring in the ETT protein upon IAA binding, although, our recent data included in this revised manuscript suggest that the tryptophan in position 505 may play an important role. Moreover, in response to the comments from reviewer 1, we have modified the speculations to include the possibility that ETT functions primarily as a repressor and that IAA binding induces a conformational change in ETT to make it unable to bind the co-repressive complex. An alternative hypothesis is that IAA-bound ETT is required for de-repression by recruiting activators of gene expression. Both possibilities are presented in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>– The Abstract includes references, is that not a bit unusual?</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to exclude if the journal requests this.

If this approach is implemented because of the solely disordered nature of ETT, please say it so or rephrase.</p></disp-quote><p>NMR was used to investigate the binding of auxin to ETT principally because it is a powerful technique for analysing interactions that are relatively low affinity, as was suspected in this case. Such HSQC experiments examine the interaction from the perspective of the receptor rather than the ligand (as is the case in WaterLOGSY NMR experiments) and provide information on the number of residues of the receptor that are affected by the binding of the ligand, indicated by changes in the position of HN cross peaks within the spectra.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;Helical character&quot; indicated by what? It would be nice to have a visualization help for non-NMR experts.</p></disp-quote><p>The helical character is typically indicated by the dispersed HN cross peaks between 7.8 to 7.0 ppm on the 1H chemical shift axis of the HSQC spectrum.

Please elaborate.</p></disp-quote><p>Perturbations in the position of the HN cross peaks in the HSQC is due to changes in the local chemical environment of the amide bonds within the protein. This is caused either by being in close proximity to bound ligand and/or due to conformational change to the protein induced by the binding event. These IAA specific induced changes are shown in Figure 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why did the authors use benzoic acid (BA) as a control ligand in their experiments? Why not to use tryptophan as the obvious non-active auxin precursor?</p></disp-quote><p>Benzoic acid was selected as the control because it has no auxinic activity but like IAA, is a weak acid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;The HSQC experiment demonstrates that ETT binds IAA directly&quot;. I recommend the authors to be cautious here with this statement. While high-field NMR is a powerful tool for investigating transiently forming protein-ligand complexes and for the identification of protein binding partners, there are a number of strategies that the authors must implement first that will specifically enable the physicochemical characterization of ETT-IAA interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>The IAA specific induced changes in the HSQC spectrum is the effect of IAA binding directly to ETT, either by direct interaction with the binding interface or due to more distal conformational changes as a result of binding. This protein-ligand complex is further supported by ITC and DARTS assays. These results do not rule out possibility that the bioactive complex involves further binding partners.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– iTC experiments are unfortunately weak e.g. no saturation reached, extremely low signal to noise ratio. Therefore, the authors again should be careful about their statements on direct biochemically relevant ETT-IAA binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have included text to explain the problems we have experienced with the ITC. In addition to the HSQC-NMR data we now also show data from a DARTS experiment that provide additional evidence of direct interaction (Figure 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please specify if the ccvTIR1 can accommodate the native IAA.</p></disp-quote><p>This is described in Uchida et al., 2018 and their data show that ccvTIR1 does not respond to IAA.

I do not recommend additional experiments, but provide a clarification based on the author response. […]</p><p>Reviewer: N. benthamiana assays also probe indirect interactions between proteins via host proteins. Perusal of the pulldowns in Chung et al. does indeed reveal a weak HDA19 pulldown by ETT (and a very strong ARF4 pulldown by HDA19). BiFC using Arabidopsis protoplasts showed strong (indirect) interactions between ETT and HDA19. The current study suggests that these indirect interactions should be impaired in the presence of high levels of auxin.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for clarifying this comment. We believe the new ChIP data provided using a <italic>p35S:HDA19:GFP</italic> line in presence of auxin also addresses this point showing that auxin leads to dissociation of <italic>HDA19</italic> from ETT-target loci, while ETT remains bound.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Current review</p><p>2) The authors should reconcile their data with the previously published data that implicates ETT/ARF4/FIL in recruitment of HDA19 containing co-repressor complexes to repress KNOX genes in regions of local auxin maxima at the inflorescence shoot apex. In looking at the literature and the current manuscript, a difference in effective auxin levels became apparent. The authors used a rather high auxin concentration to disrupt the ETT – HDA19 co-repressor complex in planta: 100 µM IAA for Figure 4 and Figure 5. By contrast 10 µM IAA is commonly used in inflorescences. Gynoecia may indeed have higher auxin levels.</p><p>This suggests a different model and a different conclusion from that currently proposed by the authors are needed. At intermediate auxin levels, for example those of the inflorescence shoot apex, ETT (together with other TFs) is able to recruit HDA19-containing co-repressors, while at higher auxin levels, those present in the gynoecium, this interaction is blocked. The authors should revise the Discussion and their model accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and we agree with the reviewer that different auxin concentrations may have different effects in diverse developmental contexts. It is, moreover, possible that different ETT-containing complexes require different auxin concentration thresholds to generate auxin responses. We have modified the Discussion accordingly (first paragraph); however, we think that Figure 5F depicts our model appropriately.</p></body></sub-article></article>
