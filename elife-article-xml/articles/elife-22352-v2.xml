Variable ion channel compositions can produce similar neuronal physiologies across animals. Less is known regarding the morphological precision required to produce reliable neuronal physiology. Theoretical studies suggest that moraphology is tightly tuned to minimize wiring and conduction delay of synaptic events. We utilize high-resolution confocal microscopy and custom computational tools to characterize the morphologies of four neuron types in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab <italic>Cancer borealis</italic>. Macroscopic branching patterns and fine cable properties are variable within and across neuron types. We compare these neuronal structures to synthetic minimal spanning neurite trees constrained by a wiring cost equation and find that STG neurons do not adhere to prevailing hypotheses regarding wiring optimization principles. In this highly modulated and oscillating circuit, neuronal structures appear to be governed by a space-filling mechanism that outweighs the cost of inefficient wiring.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22352.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22352.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Cancer borealis</kwd><kwd>neuronal morphology</kwd><kwd>wiring cost</kwd><kwd>optimization principles</kwd><kwd>dendritic tree</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37NS17813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marder</surname><given-names>Eve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31NS092126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otopalik</surname><given-names>Adriane G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reliable neuronal physiology can arise from variable and inefficient morphologies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal physiology arises from a neuron’s ion channel distribution and its unique geometry.

STG circuit function is mediated predominately by slow oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Graubard and Ross, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ross and Graubard, 1989</xref>) and graded inhibitory transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eisen and Marder, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marder and Eisen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maynard and Walton, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Graubard et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manor et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">1999</xref>).

Thus, the slow voltage events arising from graded synaptic transmission undergo minimal electrotonic decrement across the neuronal structure. Such electrotonic structures could feasibly mask animal-to-animal variability in neuronal morphology within identified STG neuron types. Additionally, given their compact electrotonic structures, it is plausible that developmental growth of STG neurons may not be constrained by wiring optimization rules, but perhaps other rules that speak to their role in this highly modulated, oscillating circuit. In the present study, we quantitatively characterize the morphology of four STG neuron types across several animals. Then, we investigate whether these identified neurons adhere to prevailing wiring optimization principles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The neurons of the STG of the crab <italic>Cancer borealis</italic> each have a primary neurite that branches extensively throughout the neuropil, forming synapses.

We also observed the presence of ‘hair-like’ neurites: very thin (&lt;1 µm) neurites that are more than 50 µm in length in all neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Expansive and complex neurite trees</title><p>Each of the neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> exhibits an expansive and complex neurite tree that ramifies throughout the STG neuropil.

Each of these analyses provides a characterization of a neuron’s arborization patterns. Sholl analysis provides a measure of neurite density as a function of distance, from soma to terminating tips. Alternatively, spatial density analysis preserves the neuronal structure and provides a graphical depiction of neurite density.</p><p>In a somato-centric neuron where the neurite tree surrounds the soma, such as in starburst amacrine or stellate cells, Sholl analysis provides a characterization of neurite density as a function of distance from the soma. In this approach, concentric circles are overlaid on the image of a neuronal structure. Neurite density is characterized by counting the number of neurite intersections with increasing radius from the centroid, which is typically aligned with the neuronal soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sholl, 1953</xref>). This can be extended to three dimensions by using spheres instead of circles. Because STG neurons are unipolar rather than somato-centric, we adapted the three-dimensional Sholl analysis by linearizing the neurites and computing Sholl intersections for path length relative to the soma, rather than keeping the neurons in their innate three-dimensional conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These data are shown in the violin plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. Because somata are located at varying distances from the neuropil, the Sholl counts at each distance are normalized (described in Materials and methods). Across and within cell types, there are no apparent trends in this characterization of macroscopic branching patterns. It is interesting to note, however, that some distributions are multi-modal, suggesting that there is more branching at certain distances from the soma, within each neuron. For example, the fourth, right-most LG neuron (blue), has at least three distinct peaks in its distribution. In contrast, the first, left-most LG neuron appears to have primarily one broad peak in its distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Spatial density plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) illustrate neurite density. The skeletal reconstruction of each neuron is composed of points in the x, y, and z dimensions. For each neuron, the probability distribution function of these points was determined with Gaussian kernel density estimation. The color map represents these probabilities (between 0 and 1), which are scaled within each neuron. Based on these graphical representations, there appears to be no obvious patterning in neurite arborizations within each neuron type. Although GM neurons appear to have distinct regions of high neurite density, PD neurons are more uniformly distributed about the neuropil.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22352.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Variable spatial density profiles within and across neuron types.</title><p>Spatial density profiles were generated using Gaussian kernel density estimation in the x and y dimensions.

Using the three-dimensional coordinates of each subtree’s terminal tips, we calculated each subtree’s center of mass (consistent with analyses in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wilensky et al., 2003</xref>), and approximated each subtree’s neuritic field by fitting an elliptical volume to the tip coordinates and centering this ellipse to the subtree’s center of mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, middle).

In this approach, we scrambled the observed tip coordinates and reassigned them to any subtree, while maintaining the same number of tips per subtree as observed in the actual neuronal structure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–F</xref> (right axes) shows an example of one scrambled tip iteration of each of the four example neurons.

To compare within and across neuron types, we measured two metrics that characterize the degree of overlap between subtree neuritic fields. First, we simply counted the number of overlapping subtree neuritic fields across the 16 neurons (scatter plot points) and in their corresponding scrambled-tip populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). For comparison, histograms showing the distributions of subtree neuritic field radii across the scrambled-tip populations are overlaid on these same axes. In 13/16 neurons, the subtree neuritic fields of the actual neurons show less overlap in space than the scrambled-tip populations.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref> shows the mean subtree neuritic field radii for each neuron (scatter plot points) relative to those of the scrambled-tip populations (histograms). Across all neurons, the mean subtree neuritic field radii observed in the actual neuronal subtree arrangements are smaller than those of the scrambled-tip population (bootstrap analyses yielded p-values &lt;0.01 within each neuron). Thus, the actual subtree neuritic fields are more compact relative to those generated by random tip distributions. Taken together, this analysis suggests that STG neuronal subtrees may be organized to span the neuropil in a manner that minimizes overlap between subtrees and their neuritic fields. This arrangement is unlikely to arise from random distribution of terminal tips.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>II. Fine structure</title><p>A neuron’s fine geometrical properties: its neurites’ lengths, tortuosities, diameters, and branching patterns, are a reflection of the distributed cable properties influencing current flow and propagation of voltage signals throughout each neuron’s neurite tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rall, 1977</xref>).

The number of carrier points was tuned such that the MSTs had branch point number within 20% of the actual neuron’s branch point number (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Scale bars apply to skeleton, carrier point, and MST plots.

Features of actual neurons are shown with black lines, whereas synthetic neurite tree data are plotted in the color scale described in the key for each neuron. Total wiring lengths, branch order distributions, neurite length distributions, and tortuosity distributions were calculated excluding axons for all synthetic and actual neurite trees.

Lower <italic>bf</italic> values result in MSTs with minimal total cable length at the expense of longer root-to-tip path lengths. Low-<italic>bf</italic> structures are consistent with relatively electrotonically compact neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuntz et al., 2010</xref>). Greater <italic>bf</italic> values result in lower root-to-tip path lengths at the expense of greater total cable length. High<italic>-bf</italic> structures are consistent with electrotonically compartmentalized neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuntz et al., 2010</xref>). It is qualitatively evident that the MSTs are not exact representations of the actual LP neuronal structure. However, if the synthetic MSTs recapitulate structural features of the actual STG, this would suggest that wiring cost is an important constraint in STG neuronal morphology. Furthermore, should a given <italic>bf</italic> value generate neurite trees consistent with the actual neurite trees, the <italic>bf</italic> value will be suggestive of the actual neuron’s electrotonic structure.</p><p><italic>Bf</italic> values between 0.1 and 0.85 have been used to generate realistic neuronal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cuntz et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2012</xref>). We generated minimal spanning neurite trees with <italic>bf</italic> values between 0.1 and 0.6 for each of the 16 STG neurons (simulation parameters shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). We then compared a number of structural features across the synthetic MSTs and actual neuronal structures. These measures include neurite lengths, tortuosities, and total wiring as described previously. We also considered branch order distributions, which provide a quantitative characterization of neuritic arborizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s4">4</xref>). In brief, branch order is a property of each branch point in the neuronal structure. It is equivalent to the number of branch points between the first branch point (relative to the soma, which has a branch order of 0), and a given branch point. The branch order distributions of many of the actual STG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>, in black) are skewed right, with branch orders of 100 or greater, suggesting that neurite paths may branch more than 100 times before terminating. In this way, the branch order distributions reflect the complex and highly branched nature STG neurons.<table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22352.023</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Minimal spanning trees (MSTs) simulation parameters. 16 STG neuronal structures were simulated using MST analyses from the TREES toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuntz et al., 2010</xref>).

Yet, it remains unclear how tightly tuned or variable their macroscopic and fine structural features must be in order to generate reliable physiological output. In the present study, we carried out a detailed morphometric analysis of four STG neuron types. We found that their expansive and complex neuronal structures do not adhere to prevailing hypotheses regarding wiring optimization principles thought to govern developmental growth.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Complex and variable morphologies</title><p>Studies in a variety of nervous systems have explored how macroscopic dendritic and axonal arborizations map to physiological function. Work in insect nervous systems showed that spatially distinct dendritic subtrees compute a weighted integration of sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Miller and Jacobs, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cuntz et al., 2008</xref>). Studies in the mammalian retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloomfield and Miller, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hong et al., 2011</xref>) and visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martin et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Martin and Whitteridge, 1984a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">1984b</xref>) have demonstrated that neurons receiving sensory inputs at distinct dendritic subtrees detect various visual stimulus features. In this way, large-scale dendritic and axonal arborization patterns reflect circuit-level connectivity and contribute to input-output functions in single neurons.</p><p>Some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cuntz et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2010</xref>) have reported quantitative ranges, across many neurons of the same type, in the fine structural properties essential for current flow and integration of voltage signals arising across complex dendritic trees. The geometrical properties of any neurite path: its length, diameter, taper, and branch points, shape current flow. In this way, whether voltage events arising at disparate sites across a dendritic tree are integrated is highly dependent on neuronal geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rall, 1977</xref>). Thus, a comprehensive understanding of how morphology maps to function requires examination of both macroscopic branching patterns and finer cable properties.</p><p>Our results suggest that STG neuronal morphologies are highly variable across animals. Additionally, our analyses did not reveal any single metric, or combination of metrics, that distinguish the four neuron types from each other. GM neurons presented significantly longer total cable lengths and branch point numbers than the other three neuron types and PD neurons showed slightly more symmetrical neurite arborizations; these are the only statistically significant cell-specific features.</p><p>Our investigation of macroscopic features such as soma position, total wiring, and branching patterns, revealed variability across neurons and within neuron types. Analysis of fine geometrical properties revealed that individual STG neurons have soma-to-tip neurite lengths that vary between 200 and 800 µm and diameters with high coefficients of variation within neurite class (primary, secondary, tertiary, or terminating neurites). Additionally, Rall powers at branch points were heterogeneous within and across neurons, suggesting variable continuity of current across the neurite tree. Given all these degrees of freedom, it is quite remarkable that these cell types show highly conserved physiological waveforms across animals.</p><p>Other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wilensky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bucher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thuma et al., 2009</xref>) have described neuronal morphology in the STG. However, it is important to note that these works were completed in different species with different staining procedures, lower imaging resolution, and less precise reconstruction methods. Therefore, it is not surprising that the 16 neurons in this study are more expansive and have measurably greater neurite lengths than previously reported. This is likely due to visualization of smaller processes that may have been lost in these earlier studies. Yet, many of the take-home messages are consistent with these earlier studies: soma positions of given neuron types vary across animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bucher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thuma et al., 2009</xref>), and most neuron types are indistinguishable by soma position, maximum branch order, and total cable lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thuma et al., 2009</xref>). While these earlier works are suggestive of morphological variability, our image resolution and morphometric analyses have allowed us to quantitatively assess this across a broader range of macroscopic and fine structural features.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sloppy geometries that are suitable for circuit function</title><p>To date, a number of experimental and theoretical works have argued that neuron growth is governed by a series of optimization principles that serve to maximize conduction velocity and minimize wiring material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cuntz et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2013</xref>; Chklovskii 2000, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wen and Chklovskii, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rivera-Alba et al., 2014</xref>). These studies have shown that many neuron types adhere to such optimization principles, suggesting that these are not only theoretical principles, but developmental rules that facilitate synaptic connections and circuit function.</p><p>Tortuosity measurements and comparison of STG neurons to minimal spanning trees provided within-neuron measures of wiring inefficiency. Across all 16 neurons, mean tortuosities ranged between one and seven, suggesting highly inefficient wiring. This is in contrast to other neuron types, such as mammalian pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons that show efficient tortuosities close to one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stepanyants et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wen et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, the neurons of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> present a highly stereotyped and efficient connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>This sloppy morphological tuning of STG neurons is notable, but it is not the first exception to wiring optimality shown in the literature. For example, anatomical studies of motor axons at the interscutularis neuromuscular junction in mouse show a great deal of variability in branching topology of axonal arbors, as well as suboptimal wiring lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu et al. (2009)</xref>, such case studies do not imply that wiring optimization principles are not at play, but may simply suggest that other factors constrain morphology in these nervous systems.</p><p>STG circuit structure and anatomy are evidently resilient to this loose morphological tuning. STG circuit function relies predominantly on slow oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Graubard and Ross, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ross and Graubard, 1989</xref>) and graded inhibitory transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eisen and Marder, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marder and Eisen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maynard and Walton, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Graubard et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manor et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bose et al., 2014</xref>). Slow synaptic events undergo minimal electrotonic decrement and are resilient to the variable, complex, and extended neurite trees of STG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Otopalik et al., 2017</xref>). This would effectively mask the physiological consequences of animal-to-animal variability in morphology.</p><p>Additionally, early electron microscopy studies describe the sparse distribution and tight apposition of synaptic input and outputs across the finer processes of the neurite tree, such that nearly every secondary process has both pre- and post-synaptic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">King, 1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">1976b</xref>). Further, the connections between particular pairs of neurons are sparsely distributed over multiple neurites of their neurite trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">King, 1976a</xref>). King suggests that this sparse distribution of synaptic contacts on finer processes gives rise to some degree of synaptic democracy, wherein no one synaptic partner “exerts an overriding influence on the neuron&quot; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">King, 1976a</xref>). Such distribution of synaptic connections likely contributes to the masking of morphological variability at the physiological level. Slow postsynaptic voltage events arising across sparsely distributed sites may influence transmission globally or locally. Sparse, slow voltage events, resilient to electrotonic decrement, may have the capacity to sum and alter the net physiology of the neuron. Alternatively, small postsynaptic potentials may locally influence transmission at nearby postsynaptic sites on the same branch, influencing particular synaptic connections in the circuit. Regardless, the electrotonic compact nature of these neurons, along with this tight pairing of pre- and post-synaptic sites across the neurite tree, may effectively compensate for the complex and variable morphologies observed across animals.</p><p>Theoretical studies have described the direct consequences of neuronal morphology and neuronal firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mainen and Sejnowski, 1996</xref>) and shed light on how neuronal structures may be optimized for Hebbian or spike-timing-dependent computations at faster time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stiefel and Sejnowski, 2007</xref>). We suspect that minimization of wiring and morphological precision may be more critical when synaptic and circuit-level computations occur at faster time-scales. Yet, a recent study demonstrated a great deal of variability in dendritic morphology within one class of mammalian neocortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hamada et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the distance between the soma and spike initiation zone co-varies with and compensates for variability in the dendritic tree. In this case, the pyramidal neuron achieves its target physiological properties by tuning ion channel distributions to the neuron’s geometry.</p><p>If developmental growth of STG neurons is not governed by the same wiring principles suggested in other neuron types, what constrains their growth? Consideration of the spatial relationships between subtrees within individual STG neurons suggests that subtrees grow to fill and tile distinct spatial fields in the neuropil. We speculate that this may be for the purpose of maximizing surface area for the reception of the numerous neuromodulatory substances that are diffusely released in the hemolymph and by the descending inputs of the stomatogastric nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marder and Bucher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitz and Nusbaum, 2011</xref>). Thus, in development, space-filling of the neuropil may outweigh the wiring economy that might be expected if decrement of synaptic events were critical to circuit function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and dissections</title><p>Adult male Jonah crabs (<italic>Cancer borealis;</italic> carapace lengths between 13 and 17 cm) were obtained from Commercial Lobster (Boston, MA).

This and all code is available for download at github.org/marderlab/Quantifying_Morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Path length and tortuosity</title><p>Path lengths were calculated as the sum of the distances between the points that constitute a given branch. Geometry objects contain instances of branches and segments, each with a length attribute. The length of a path is simply the sum of the lengths of its constituent segments. Horizontal histograms were used to show the relative distributions underlying the data; means are indicated with solid black lines, medians with dashed lines (solid orange lines for radial histograms), and interquartile ranges with shaded regions. Path tortuosity is defined as path length divided by the Euclidean distance from the first node to the last node (the soma to a tip). A tortuosity of 1.0 indicates a perfectly straight path while values larger than 1.0 indicate a wandering or tortuous path.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Branch angle</title><p>To compute branch angles, all the branch points and segments that contributed to the bifurcation were collected; in the case of a multi-furcation, the procedure was repeated with all possible combinations of branches.

Most STG neurites, especially large-diameter neurites, are slightly flat (compressed in the z-dimension), rather than cylindrical. Therefore, the values given here should represent a fair assessment of the parent-daughter ratios (used to calculated Rall Power) of the neurons.

Because STG somata are segregated from the neuropil and the neurite field, this approach was not logically consistent with the goal of Sholl analyses. Instead, we calculated an equivalent somatofugal Sholl distance by creating linearly spaced distances ranging from zero to the maximum path length and asked for each pair of nodes whether the traversing line crossed this distance. In this way, path lengths are the distances being measured and branching patterns can be elucidated. Equivalently, one could re-plot an STG neuron with the soma at the center of a 2D Sholl graph with filaments that conserve segment length branching out radially from the soma.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Spatial density analysis</title><p>Spatial density analysis was used to visualize neurite density of individual neurons in the x-y plane. Geometry objects were generated from the <italic>hoc</italic> skeletons for each neuron using Python. A Gaussian kernel density estimation (from the SciPy statistics module, utilizing Scott’s Rule for bandwidth selection) was used to generate a probability distribution function for all points in the x and y dimensions composing each neuron’s geometry object. This resulted in a probability value (between 0 and 1) for each point that indicates its relative number of nearest neighbors. For each neuron, the geometry object points were plotted in the x-y plane and colored by the points’ probabilities. The color map was scaled to the range of probabilities within each neuron. In this way, the spatial density plots can be interpreted as visualizations of neurite density. This approach was adapted from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/20107592">http://stackoverflow.com/a/20107592</ext-link> and can be found on the Marder Lab Github.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Subtrees</title><p>The main path was defined as the segments connecting the soma to the axon(s). LP, PD, and LG neurons have only one axon (thus, only one main path), whereas GM neurons have 3–5 axons and, therefore, 3–5 main paths. Subtrees were defined by: (1) having a root segment that departed from the primary neurite and (2) containing at least one terminating tip segment. The terminating tips of a subtree form a tip cluster. The center of mass of a subtree was calculated as the mean x-y-z coordinates of its terminating tips. The radius of a subtree tip cluster was calculated as the mean distance from the center of mass coordinates to each tip’s coordinates. We used a design-based inference sampling strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geuna, 2000</xref>) to randomly assign tips to any cluster, while maintaining the number of tips per cluster. The reassigned tips for a given subtree could originate from any subtree, consistent with an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wilensky et al., 2003</xref>). We performed this randomization between 100 and 2000 times, depending on the number of possible tip configurations and subtrees. The subtree tip cluster radii and the number of overlapping subtree tip clusters from the randomized subtrees were compared to those of the original neuronal structure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>General and statistical analysis of skeletal reconstructions</title><p>All analyses were carried out in R 3.2.2 or Python 3.4.2 with the assistance of open-source packages, chiefly NumPy and SciPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van der Walt et al., 2011</xref>), NetworkX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hagberg et al., 2008</xref>), and generally used interactively with IPython (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perez and Granger, 2007</xref>).

(2010)</xref>. For each of the 16 STG neurons, synthetic trees were constructed to connect the root node (defined by the coordinates of the first branch point relative to the soma, in the actual neuronal structure) to the target nodes. Target nodes were randomly generated from points uniformly distributed in an elliptical volume approximating the space occupied by the actual neuronal structure. The number of target nodes was tuned such that branch point numbers of the MSTs were within 0–20% of the actual STG neuron. The lengths and paths of neurite segments connecting these nodes were constrained by the simple wiring cost equation: total cost = wiring cost + <italic>bf</italic> * path length cost (as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuntz et al., 2010</xref>). The balancing factor (bf) is the only variable parameter in this model and weighs the cost of minimizing total cable length versus minimizing soma-to-tip path lengths. Seven corresponding synthetic trees were generated for each of the 16 STG neurons in the present study with a range of balancing factor values between 0.1 and 0.6 (at increments of bf = 0.1). Total wiring, branch point numbers, branch order distributions, neurite length distributions, and tortuosity distributions of the synthetic trees were plotted in comparison to those of the actual skeletal structures using MATLAB. This range of bf values was chosen because the resulting MSTs recapitulated realistic ranges in these morphological features that spanned those of the actual neurons.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by David Van Essen (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hermann Cuntz (Reviewer #2); Davi D Bock (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This very intriguing study provides an alternative scenario to the prevailing idea that neuronal arborization will conform to simple developmental rules that balance a minimization of total neurite length and soma-to-tip path lengths. Though the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of crabs is not analogous to brain structures that have given rise to the prevailing concepts it does provide a stark contrast to this view. The spatial relationships between subtrees within individual neurons suggests that STG neurons grow to fill and tile distinct spatial fields in the neuropil. The authors then argue that because in the STG synaptic transmission is predominantly graded and slow, &quot;in development, space-filling of the neuropil may outweigh the wiring economy that might be expected if decrement of synaptic events were critical to circuit function.&quot; They also argue that tiling the entire neuropil is advantageous for reception of paracrine modulatory input. The data presented is very high resolution whole mount dye fills of 4 types of STG neurons, two unique types that are singularly represented and two types that are represented by more than one copy. The analysis is highly quantitative and thoroughly analyzed statistically with appropriate techniques. The figures are not only clear but esthetically pleasing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are some concerns, especially with the minimal spanning trees analyses, that must be addressed, but overall this appears to be a very strong study with very high quality data.</p><p>1) The MST analyses should be redone as prescribed by reviewer 2. Once these analyses are redone the conclusions of the paper should be appropriated altered if needed.</p><p>2) Expansion of the range of considered <italic>bf</italic>'s should be performed as prescribed by reviewer 3.</p><p>3) An analysis of density distributions similar to the one by Jefferis et al. (Cell. 2007 Mar 23; 128(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>): 1187-1203) should be performed on the Sholl analyses a prescribed by reviewer 3.</p><p>4) There is general concern that the Discussion does not consider all aspects pertinent to interpretation of the data analyses.</p><p>a) The neurons analyzed have both direct synaptic inputs and outputs throughout their neuritic arbors and there is limited data to definitively separate or lump these within the neuritic field. It is safest to assume that in STG neurons inputs and outputs are cheek by jowl given the work of King (1976 a, b) and Kilman and Marder (1996). There is no mention of this ambiguity or discussion concerning how inputs and outputs overlap or are segregated; the relevant papers are cited without mention of this aspect of their findings. Instead the Introduction and Discussion focus on modulatory inputs when there is even less data as to where the relevant receptors occur. It would be an interesting study to prove that input fields and output fields were separate or overlapping and relate that to the neuritic fields described, but here the issues must be aired, at least. Could this likely overlap of inputs and outputs be as important as graded transmission in determining STG neuronal morphology?</p><p>b) The STG is not the first nor the only previously observed exception to optimality of wiring. A more nuanced discussion here would help the manuscript as described by reviewer 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript describes in exquisite detail the morphology of four cells in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab – a type of study that as the authors point out hasn't been performed for many cell types to date with this amount of precision. The authors use a minimum spanning tree algorithm that I developed to check whether these neurons optimize wiring and they come to the conclusion that the neurons don't so much observe minimal amounts of cable and short conduction times to collect their inputs but rather fill the available neuropil. I was excited to find a system in which the considerations that we have found to be true for so many other systems (fly tangential cells, cortical pyramidal cells of many different types, cerebellar Purkinje cells, many different hippocampal cells, starburst amacrine cells in the retina, periglomerular neurons in the olfactory bulb etc., in fact, even all of NeuroMorpho.Org was subjected to the analysis in Cuntz et al. 2012 PNAS) would not hold.</p><p>Unfortunately the authors make a fundamental mistake in their analysis that overturns the results and conclusions. I will therefore focus my review on that part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>) since the fact that crab STG neurons are not subjected strongly to optimal wiring constraints seems to be the main conclusion in the paper.</p><p>With our method of modelling the morphologies using minimum spanning trees (MSTs) it is important to realise that the dendrites collect their inputs from a set of given carrier locations (corresponding probably to a developmentally predestined subset of all synapses) and that connecting these optimally in terms of wiring describes a large proportion of the dendritic tree. Unfortunately, in most cases the locations of those carrier synapses are unknown (except for example for data from Adi Mizrahi on periglomerular neurons from the olfactory bulb that we used in Cuntz et al., 2012 PNAS). Therefore, one has to make some assumptions about which target locations should be connected by the MST. The authors here decided to take the termination points of the dendrites that they reconstructed as target points for the minimum spanning tree. This choice is not discussed. Connecting N termination points with an MST (constrained to be binary) will lead to termination points, branch points and continuation points (with one daughter). The resulting trees therefore will automatically have less termination points than the original trees. In binary trees (which <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows the STG neurons mostly are), the number of branch points is equal to the number of termination points minus 1. In MSTs on N randomly distributed points with a <italic>bf</italic> = 0 we have shown previously that the distributed points divide into N/4 termination points, N/4 branch points and N/2 continuation points approximately (Cuntz et al., 2012 PNAS). This explains directly the findings in the present manuscript: Number of branches, total length, and average branch order are all dramatically underestimated here by the fact that only 25% of the correct number of target points were distributed (assuming <italic>bf</italic>=0, but otherwise certainly never more than about 40%).</p><p>In our previous work (Cuntz et al., 2008 PLoS CB; Cuntz et al., 2010 PLoS CB and others) we have set the number of target points in for example fly tangential cells such that the resulting MST had the correct number of branch points since we did not know the number or identity of target points from biology. In the case of the periglomerular neurons in (Cuntz et al., 2012 PNAS) we found that the number of branch points was indeed in numbers about 25% of the number of synapses marked by PSD95-GFP.</p><p>I am sorry for the lengthy explanation but I hope that it now becomes clear that the MSTs applied in this present manuscript need to be adjusted to match the complexity of the original trees. It is no surprise that the number of branch points and the total length are much lower in the MSTs if only the termination points (the tips) of the dendrites were used. After correcting this, the results will look very differently and maybe will show that the crab STG neurons also optimise wiring as so many others do (However analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> indeed show a much larger tortuosity than in most other dendrites that I have looked at). If the results are still at odds with this claim after correction, then the conclusion from this paper holds.</p><p>Having said all this, I would like to point out that the study is very thoroughly done otherwise and after the correction of this issue could well be subjected to review one more time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript presents a high quality data set and accompanying analysis, and could readily be published with some revisions. However, I think the authors have in some ways left the job half-done. They show very nicely that crab stomatogastric ganglion neurites do not obey a standard wiring length optimality rule, but do not offer a positive alternative. In the last few sentences of the Discussion, they speculate that STG neurons maximize surface area in order to sample the &quot;cocktail of peptides and amines&quot; being released into this ganglion. This seems like a reasonably straightforward hypothesis to test using the existing data and analytical toolset the authors have marshalled. Specifically, does a geometrical model maximizing surface area allow for a better fit to the data than the Cuntz et al. spanning tree-based model? This type of analysis could be done in a follow-up paper, but it also seems within the authors' grasp here. (And, if a model maximizing surface area fits the observed arbors very closely, can the observed arbors really be considered 'sloppy'?)</p><p>A few additional high-level thoughts:</p><p>1) Would <italic>bf</italic> values well outside the previously used values of 0.1 and 0.85 give better fit to the STG data? The authors find that <italic>bf</italic> of 0.9 gives best fit to their data (subsection “Wiring Cost”, last paragraph); this is at one end of the parameter range explored. The authors show STG neurons are 'different'; they should explain why exploring a previously used parameter range is therefore acceptable.</p><p>2) The Sholl analysis of linearized arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) is useful, but the linearization causes quantification of the density distribution of neurites to be lost. The neurons of each subtype could have variably branching patterns (as the authors show), while still having stereotyped density distributions in the STG. An analysis of density distributions similar to the one by Jefferis et al. (Cell. 2007 Mar 23; 128(6): 1187-1203) could be used to examine this.</p><p>3) In the Discussion, the authors write &quot;This sloppy morphological tuning is in stark contrast to that which has been described in other neuron and circuit types.&quot; The wiring length optimization literature is at its most convincing when handling very large numbers of neurons (order 10^5 or more) traveling long distances (mm to cm or more). Van Essen's argument about cortical folding (Nature. 1997 Jan 23;385(6614):313-8) is an example at the extreme of this idea. At smaller length scales, for smaller numbers of neurons, wiring frequently looks highly suboptimal. For example, in the cat, retinogeniculate axons frequently make many branches which each independently target the same volume of LGN (Sur et al., J Neurophysiol. 1987 Jul;58(1):1-32), and in the mouse, motor neurons take extremely tortuous paths to cover the end plate (Lu et al., PLoS Biol. 2009 Feb 10;7(2):e32. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000032). The STG is not the first nor the only previously observed exception to optimality of wiring. A more nuanced discussion here would help the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22352.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>There are some concerns, especially with the minimal spanning trees analyses, that must be addressed, but overall this appears to be a very strong study with very high quality data.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The MST analyses should be redone as prescribed by reviewer 2. Once these analyses are redone the conclusions of the paper should be appropriated altered if needed.</italic></p><p>We were grateful to have had the opportunity to discuss this issue directly with reviewer #2, who invented the MST analyses. From this reviewer’s comments, and our direct conversation, it was evident that our MST simulations should be tuned such that the resulting synthetic trees present a level of complexity similar to the actual STG neurons (this was not the case in the previously submitted manuscript). To address this issue, we generated carrier points from uniformly distributed points that spanned the elliptical volume of the actual STG neuron. We tuned the number of carrier points such that the branch point numbers of the resulting MSTs were within range of the actual STG neurons’ branch point numbers (all within 20%, but often within 5%). This revised simulation yielded MSTs with structural features (total wiring, branch order distributions, neurite length distributions, and tortuosity distributions) with realistic ranges, consistent with those observed in STG neurons. However, as is clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and the supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, no one <italic>bf</italic> comprehensively recapitulated these structural features of the STG neurons. Thus, our conclusions are left unchanged and we still interpret this to mean that STG neuronal morphology may not be constrained by the wiring optimization principles probed with the MST analysis.</p><p><italic>2) Expansion of the range of considered bf's should be performed as prescribed by reviewer 3.</italic></p><p>After discussion of the MST analyses with reviewer #2 and revision of the carrier points, the <italic>bf</italic> value range was changed to 0-0.6, at increments of 0.1. This range is sufficient, given this revised simulation, as the MSTs generated with this <italic>bf</italic> range present neurite length, branch order, and tortuosity distributions that range beyond the measured values of the actual neurons (this is clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and the supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). This addresses reviewer 3’s concern that the actual neurons appeared to fit best with <italic>bf</italic> values at one extreme of the previously chosen <italic>bf</italic> value range (this is no longer the case in the revised simulation).</p><p><italic>3) An analysis of density distributions similar to the one by Jefferis et al.

Could this likely overlap of inputs and outputs be as important as graded transmission in determining STG neuronal morphology?</italic></p><p>We now address this issue in the Discussion. In brief, we write that, “early electron microscopy studies describe the sparse distribution and tight apposition of synaptic input and outputs across the finer processes of the neurite tree, such that nearly every secondary process has both pre- and post-synaptic regions (King, 1976a, b). […] Regardless, the electrotonic compact nature of these neurons, along with this tight pairing of pre- and post-synaptic sites across the neurite tree, may effectively compensate for the complex and variable morphologies observed across animals.”</p><p><italic>b) The STG is not the first nor the only previously observed exception to optimality of wiring.

It is no surprise that the number of branch points and the total length are much lower in the MSTs if only the termination points (the tips) of the dendrites were used. After correcting this, the results will look very differently and maybe will show that the crab STG neurons also optimise wiring as so many others do (However analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> indeed show a much larger tortuosity than in most other dendrites that I have looked at). If the results are still at odds with this claim after correction, then the conclusion from this paper holds.</italic></p><p><italic>Having said all this, I would like to point out that the study is very thoroughly done otherwise and after the correction of this issue could well be subjected to review one more time.</italic></p><p>We are grateful to have received this feedback from the inventor of these analyses. After direct discussion with reviewer #2, we were able to resolve this issue by running a revised simulation with new carrier points (as described in Essential revisions point #1). In doing this, we were able to generate MSTs that reflected the complexity of the original trees (as described in reviewer #2’s comments above). We approached the revised simulation with an open mind toward its results and interpretation. However, the results of the revised simulation were such that our interpretation remains relatively unchanged. We did re-write parts of the Results and Discussion to better reflect the meaning of these analyses. It remains true that these analyses do, in fact, recapitulate the properties of numerous other neuron types. The fact that this is not the case for STG neurons does not undermine the wiring optimization theory, but simply demonstrates that wiring cost may not be a major factor in determining neuronal morphology in the STG.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>This manuscript presents a high quality data set and accompanying analysis, and could readily be published with some revisions. However, I think the authors have in some ways left the job half-done. They show very nicely that crab stomatogastric ganglion neurites do not obey a standard wiring length optimality rule, but do not offer a positive alternative. In the last few sentences of the Discussion, they speculate that STG neurons maximize surface area in order to sample the &quot;cocktail of peptides and amines&quot; being released into this ganglion. This seems like a reasonably straightforward hypothesis to test using the existing data and analytical toolset the authors have marshalled. Specifically, does a geometrical model maximizing surface area allow for a better fit to the data than the Cuntz et al. spanning tree-based model? This type of analysis could be done in a follow-up paper, but it also seems within the authors' grasp here. (And, if a model maximizing surface area fits the observed arbors very closely, can the observed arbors really be considered 'sloppy'?)</italic></p><p>This last point is a good one. Although we have not chosen to address this follow-up question in this manuscript, it is something that we will consider moving forward.</p><p><italic>A few additional high-level thoughts:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Would bf values well outside the previously used values of 0.1 and 0.85 give better fit to the STG data? The authors find that bf of 0.9 gives best fit to their data (subsection “Wiring Cost”, last paragraph); this is at one end of the parameter range explored. The authors show STG neurons are 'different'; they should explain why exploring a previously used parameter range is therefore acceptable.</italic></p><p>This is addressed above, in response to Essential revision #2.</p><p><italic>2) The Sholl analysis of linearized arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) is useful, but the linearization causes quantification of the density distribution of neurites to be lost. The neurons of each subtype could have variably branching patterns (as the authors show), while still having stereotyped density distributions in the STG. An analysis of density distributions similar to the one by Jefferis et al. (Cell. 2007 Mar 23; 128(6): 1187-1203) could be used to examine this.</italic></p><p>This type of analysis is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) In the Discussion, the authors write &quot;This sloppy morphological tuning is in stark contrast to that which has been described in other neuron and circuit types.&quot; The wiring length optimization literature is at its most convincing when handling very large numbers of neurons (order 10^5 or more) traveling long distances (mm to cm or more). Van Essen's argument about cortical folding (Nature. 1997 Jan 23;385(6614):313-8) is an example at the extreme of this idea. At smaller length scales, for smaller numbers of neurons, wiring frequently looks highly suboptimal. For example, in the cat, retinogeniculate axons frequently make many branches which each independently target the same volume of LGN (Sur et al., J Neurophysiol. 1987 Jul;58(1):1-32), and in the mouse, motor neurons take extremely tortuous paths to cover the end plate (Lu et al., PLoS Biol. 2009 Feb 10;7(2):e32. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000032). The STG is not the first nor the only previously observed exception to optimality of wiring. A more nuanced discussion here would help the manuscript.</italic></p><p>We appreciate that reviewer #3 brought this area in the literature to our attention. We have addressed other exceptions to optimality of wiring in the Discussion, subsection “Sloppy Geometries that are Suitable for Circuit Function”. The studies we bring to light are perhaps the most intuitively similar to our case in the STG. In the third paragraph of the aforementioned subsection we mention the Lu et al., (2009) study, writing: “While this sloppy morphological tuning of STG neurons is notable, it is not the first exception to wiring optimality shown in the literature. […] As suggested by Lu et al. (2009), such case studies may not imply that wiring optimization principles are not at play, but may simply suggest that other factors constrain morphology in these nervous systems.”</p><p>In the sixth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, we write of another more recent case that describes variability in dendritic tree morphology in one class of neocortical pyramidal neurons: “Yet, a recent study demonstrated a great deal of variability in dendritic morphology within one class of mammalian neocortical pyramidal neurons (Hamada et al., 2016). Interestingly, the distance between the soma and spike initiation zone co-varies with and compensates for variability in the dendritic tree. In this case, the pyramidal neuron achieves its target physiological properties by tuning ion channel distributions to the neuron’s geometry.”</p><p>By mentioning these works, we feel that we have provided a more thorough comparison of our findings to those in the current literature, and perhaps made it more clear that STG neurons are not the only exception to wiring optimality.</p></body></sub-article></article>
