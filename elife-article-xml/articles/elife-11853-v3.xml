However, it is unclear how this critical trait is acquired and regulated. We demonstrate that under the control of PPARα, the genes required for lipid catabolism are transcribed before birth so that the neonatal liver has a prompt capacity to extract energy from milk upon suckling. The mechanism involves a fetal glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-PPARα axis in which GR directly regulates the transcriptional activation of PPARα by binding to its promoter. Certain PPARα target genes such as <italic>Fgf21</italic> remain repressed in the fetal liver and become PPARα responsive after birth following an epigenetic switch triggered by β-hydroxybutyrate-mediated inhibition of HDAC3. This study identifies an endocrine developmental axis in which fetal GR primes the activity of PPARα in anticipation of the sudden shifts in postnatal nutrient source and metabolic demands.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11853.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11853.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11853.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Birth is a highly stressful and critical event. In the womb, babies rely on the supply of oxygen and nutrients provided by the placenta. However, once they are born they need to breathe for themselves and gain all their nutrients from suckling milk. The placenta provides a sugar-rich diet, while milk is richer in fat. Failing to cope with this change in diet leads to serious complications and sometimes death. Therefore, a better understanding of how the body adapts to these changes may shed light on pathways that are important for good health in later life.</p><p>The liver plays a central role in processing the nutrients absorbed by the gut. It uses fats to produce molecules called ketone bodies, such as β-hydroxybutyrate, which are then used as fuel by other tissues and organs including the heart, muscle and the brain. A protein called PPARα controls the production of ketone bodies primarily by regulating genes that are involved in the uptake and breakdown of fat in the liver. However, little is known about how this protein affects the development of the liver.</p><p>Here, Rando, Tan et al. report that mice start to produce more PPARα in the liver shortly before birth. This ultimately activates several genes that encode enzymes that break down fats. The experiments show that during labor, stress hormones called glucocorticoids directly stimulate the production of PPARα in the liver of the fetus to prepare newborn mice for harnessing energy from fat-rich milk.</p><p>In the absence of PPARα, mouse liver cells are less able to break down fats after birth and so start to accumulate fat, resulting in fewer ketone bodies being produced. Rando, Tan et al. show that β-hydroxybutyrate regulates some PPARα target genes, including one called <italic>Fgf21.</italic> The activity of this gene increases only after milk suckling starts and it encodes a protein that enhances the breakdown of fats in the liver. Without PPARα, the expression levels of its target genes, including <italic>Fgf21,</italic> do not increase after birth, which promotes the build up of fats in liver cells, a condition known as liver steatosis.</p><p>Overall, the results reported by Rando, Tan et al. highlight how stress during labor plays an important role in priming the body to cope with a fat-rich diet after birth. Future studies will need to determine if stress hormones and ketone bodies could be used as therapies for babies born by caesarean section with liver steatosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11853.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11853.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>glucocorticoid receptor</kwd><kwd>PPARα</kwd><kwd>hepatic steatosis</kwd><kwd>ketone body</kwd><kwd>HDAC3</kwd><kwd>FGF21</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wahli</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001475</institution-id><institution>Nanyang Technological University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine Start-Up Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wahli</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007255</institution-id><institution>Bonizzi-Theler Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wahli</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wahli</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the 7th EU Program TORNADO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wahli</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006390</institution-id><institution>Université de Lausanne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wahli</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pôle de Recherche National &quot;Frontiers in Genetics&quot;</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wahli</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Glucocorticoid receptor directly regulates the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated alpha (PPARα) before birth in anticipation of the sudden shifts in the postnatal nutrient source and metabolic demands.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammals, embryonic and postnatal development depends on nutrition from placentation and lactation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brawand et al., 2008</xref>).Before birth, hepatic energy metabolism relies mainly on glucose catabolism. Metabolic fluxes change abruptly at birth when milk, which has a higher lipid but relatively lower glucose content, becomes the exclusive nutrient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Girard et al., 1992</xref>). At the first few hours after birth, liver expresses the rate-limiting enzymes responsible for extracting energy from milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krahling et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huyghe et al., 2001</xref>). However, whether lipid catabolism at birth is developmentally programmed or an adaptive response requiring an external stimulus remains unknown. Failure to adapt to this catabolic switch results in life-threatening errors of metabolism, with serious energy imbalances that are recapitulated in mouse models of neonatal liver steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ibdah et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherkaoui-Malki et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) is a key transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism owing to its activation by a lipid surge to induce lipid catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Desvergne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montagner et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2016</xref>). However,the role of PPARα in the perinatal liver is not fully understood. Certain PPARα target genes (e.g., acyl-CoA oxidase 1 [<italic>Acox1</italic>]) are highly expressed in fetal liver at the end of gestation, whereas the expression of others (e.g., fibroblast growth factor 21 [<italic>Fgf21</italic>]) strictly depends on postnatal milk uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hondares et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yubero et al., 2004</xref>). Based on these contrasting observations, we hypothesized the presence of a PPARα-triggering program before birth that does not require milk suckling for activation. Given that fetal liver metabolism mostly relies on glycolysis rather than lipid oxidation, we postulated that the liver phenotype of PPARα-deficient fetuses may not be obvious due to the absence of a lipid-rich diet challenge.</p><p>By measuring gene expression in prenatal and postnatal livers, we show that PPARα activation has already occurred a few days before birth, and that glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated control of PPARα in late gestation prepares its physiological role in the pups for harnessing milk lipids immediately after birth. However, before birth we could barely detect the expression of certain PPARα target genes such as <italic>Fgf21</italic>, which is exclusively involved in adaptive metabolism. Therefore, we explored the mechanistic basis for the temporal regulation of PPARα target genes. We found that certain PPARα target genes, including <italic>Fgf21</italic> and <italic>Angptl4</italic> (Angiopoietin-like 4), are epigenetically controlled by histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and de-repressed in response to β-hydroxybutyrate, a by-product of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Taken together, our data provide the evidence of a major role of glucocorticoid signaling in direct hepatic regulation of PPARα and indirect HDAC3-mediated regulation of FGF21, which controls important metabolic and thermogenic events in the early days of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hondares et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GR controls PPARα expression in the late fetus</title><p>Stress at labor is associated with high glucocorticoid signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlow et al., 1974</xref>). We previously reported that glucocorticoids stimulate PPARα expression in the adult liver, but the mechanism was not elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lemberger et al., 1994</xref>). Interestingly, the mRNA expression of GR (<italic>Nr3c1</italic>) in the fetal liver is the highest just before birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Speirs et al., 2004</xref>).Because GR plays a role in the preparation for birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cole et al., 1995</xref>), we further tested GR implication in the regulation of fetal PPARα expression. We confirmed that <italic>Nr3c1</italic> mRNA levels in the fetal liver peak at embryonic day E19.5, similar to <italic>Ppara</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Notably, <italic>Ppara</italic> mRNA levels were low in the liver at E13 and E15, but markedly increased at E17, peaking just before birth at E19.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This observation coincides with a maximal RNA polymerase 2 (Pol2) recruitment to the PPARα transcriptional start site (TSS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and enhanced nuclear accumulation of PPARα protein similar to the levels in the postnatal pups (Figure 5A). Interestingly, we also observed a significant reduction in the expression of <italic>Nr3c1</italic> in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers during development when compared with <italic>Ppara<sup>+/+</sup> </italic>controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that PPARα may also reciprocally regulate <italic>Nr3c1</italic> expression. To investigate the regulation of PPARα expression by GR, we treated E15 fetal liver explants, when <italic>Ppara</italic> expression is relatively low, with GR agonist dexamethasone, which induced <italic>Ppara</italic> mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also examined the expression of <italic>Ppara</italic> in GR-null fetuses at E17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), when <italic>Ppara</italic> mRNA levels just begin to increase in the wild-type fetal liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We identified three putative GR response elements (GRE) in the promoter/regulatory region of <italic>Ppara</italic> and analyzed their occupancy by GR in the fetal liver at E17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an antibody against GR revealed that the element spanning -1007 to -993 was preferentially occupied while the other two sites were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Upon treatment of primary hepatocytes with GR-targeting siRNA, the occupancy of GR at this putative site was significantly decreased as compared to treatment with non-targeting siRNA, thereby indicating the specificity of GR binding to this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Binding of GR to this putative GRE also followed the ontogenic pattern of <italic>Ppara</italic> expression in the fetal liver (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, PPARα is a direct target of GR in the fetal liver and its expression parallels that of GR in later stages of fetal development. These findings reveal a novel endocrine GR-PPARα axis in the regulation of the fatty acid (FA) catabolic machinery just before birth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PPARα controls the prenatal lipid catabolic machinery</title><p>We next performed microarray analysis on gene expression in the fetal and neonatal <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> livers. PPARα-dependent fold changes in gene expression were higher in the term fetuses than in suckling pups, revealing major transcriptional PPARα activities just before delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2— figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We found 915 and 425 down-regulated genes in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> liver at E19.5 and postnatal day 2 (P2), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Many of the differentially expressed genes were preferentially regulated in either the prenatal or postnatal liver, suggesting the involvement of distinct metabolic pathways at these two time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>, SD12). Genes preferentially controlled by PPARα in fetal liver (e.g., <italic>Pex19, Slc25a20, Cpt2</italic>, and <italic>Fabp1</italic>) relate to peroxisome biogenesis and FA shuttling−two upstream steps essential for FA catabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Genes encoding the peroxisomal and mitochondrial enzymatic core of β- and ω-FAO, such as <italic>Acox1, Acaa2, Acadl, Acadvl, Acsl1</italic>, and <italic>Cyp4a14</italic>, were prenatally and/or postnatally controlled by PPARα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>).

Using antibodies against hepatoblast- and hepatocyte-specific markers (i.e., Delta-Like Homolog 1 (DLK) and cytokeratin 18 (CK18), respectively), we performed flow cytometric analyses on the cells extracted from <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> livers at E19.5. Upon cell sorting, we specifically recovered the DLK<sup>+</sup> and CK18<sup>+</sup> fractions. Firstly, we showed that PPARα deficiency only led to marginal changes in these two hepatic cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Secondly, we determined the mRNA expression of <italic>Nr3c1, Ppara</italic> and the target genes of PPARα in these cells. Our results indicated that both <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> hepatoblasts and hepatocytes similarly contributed to the expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Notably, we observed a modest but not significant upward trend in the expression of oxidative genes (e.g., <italic>Acox1, Acaa2, Acadl</italic>, and <italic>Acadvl</italic>) and a downward trend in the expression of glycolytic genes (e.g., <italic>Gck</italic> and <italic>Hk1</italic>) in the <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> hepatocytes compared to hepatoblasts, possibly suggesting a more pronounced oxidative program in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, the expression of these genes was concomitantly down-regulated in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hepatoblasts and hepatocytes, thereby highlighting the pivotal role of PPARα in glycolytic and oxidative metabolism in both cell types.</p><p>Consistent with our gene expression studies, <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fetal livers had reduced numbers of peroxisomes and mitochondria compared to wild-type littermates at E19.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, only the mitochondria numbers but not the peroxisome numbers varied between the two groups at P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), underscoring the crucial role of mitochondrial FAO in PPARα-mediated lipid catabolism after birth. We next measured mitochondrial membrane potential (∆<sub>Ψm</sub>) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production levels which are two common parameters used in assessing mitochondria health and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suski et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a much lower ∆<sub>Ψm</sub> and a markedly increased intracellular ROS level in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> primary hepatocytes at P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), indicative of mitochondria dysfunction at this stage. However, there was no discernible difference in ∆<sub>Ψm</sub> between <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes at E19.5 despite that a slight increase in the intracellular ROS level was observed in the latter. These findings suggest that an increased ROS production in cells likely precedes the loss of ∆<sub>Ψm</sub> and mitochondria dysfunction, consistent with a previous report of a similar mitochondrial disorder associated with the dysfunctions of the respiratory chain components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lebiedzinska et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, respiratory chain-mediated ATP production in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes was approximately 35–50% of the levels measured in both prenatal and postnatal wild-type livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Substantiating these findings, a reduction of ~2.3-fold was observed in the basal oxygen consumption rate in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> primary hepatocytes from both E19 and P2 livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). In the presence of FA (i.e., palmitate), the oxygen consumption rate significantly increased in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> hepatocytes but remained very similar in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes, indicating a deficiency in the activation of FAO in the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). The addition of etomoxir, an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, resulted in significant inhibition of mitochondrial β-FAO in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> but not in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes. <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> hepatocytes exhibited a robust mitochondrial respiratory capacity of ~40% at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, only ~25% and ~11% of the total oxygen consumption rate were attributed to mitochondrial β-FAO in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes from E19 and P2 livers, respectively. Thus, these results provide evidence that PPARα-dependent respiration occurs in the term fetus. The higher expression of FA catabolic genes in fetal liver just before birth may prime the liver for the upcoming postnatal energy demand or point to an unknown role of fetal FAO. Therefore, we investigated whether the above defects in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes contribute to any phenotype in the fetal and neonatal liver.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11853.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Defective mitochondrial function, fatty acid oxidation and energy production in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>,<bold>B</bold>) Flow cytometric analyses of intracellular peroxisomes and mitochondria in primary hepatocytes isolated from <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> livers at E19.5 (<bold>A</bold>) and P2 (<bold>B</bold>) using Alexa Fluor 488-labeled antibodies against peroxisome membrane protein 70 and Mitotracker Red, respectively.

To test whether the change in food composition that occurs at weaning is responsible for the reduction in the fatty liver phenotype as observed in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>pups after P5-6, we performed a 10-day high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet challenge starting just before P5 and continuing into the suckling-to-weaning transition period. After the high-fat diet (HFD) challenge, the occurrence of liver steatosis was reenacted at P15 in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice which consistently exhibited significantly higher liver weight, hepatic and serum triglyceride levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>).

Furthermore, we also demonstrated in hepatocyte-specific <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (i.e., <italic>Ppara<sup>fl/fl</sup>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>) the presence of liver steatosis at P3, thereby confirming that the phenotypes observed in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice is most likely due to the hepatocyte-specific effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4— figure supplement 1I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montagner et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, PPARα deficiency leads to lower mitochondria numbers, defective FA oxidative metabolism, and aberrant mitochondria functions which collectively contribute to the development of liver steatosis and hypoketonemia in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neonates as a result of their inability to metabolize milk lipids.</p><p>An effective hepatic FAO is necessary to support hepatic de novo ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis by providing essential co-factors such as acetyl-CoA and/or NADH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Girard, 1986</xref>). This notion is consistent with the presence of hypoketonemia in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neonates with defective hepatic FAO. Interestingly, we found that <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> pups were able to maintain a body weight increase similar to their <italic>Ppara<sup>+/+</sup></italic> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neonates harnessed energy required for normal growth from fuels other than ketone bodies and lipids. Furthermore, we did not detect any differences in the plasma glucose levels between the two genotypes during the suckling period from P2 to P15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This was rather surprising since <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neonates were previously reported to exhibit hypoglycemia at P1 due to impaired gluconeogenesis from glycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cotter et al., 2014</xref>). This finding prompted us to check whether the gluconeogenesis pathway is modified in the <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> liver at P2. Based on our microarray data, we found that most of the genes (e.g., <italic>Gpt, Pck1</italic>, and <italic>G6pc</italic>) encoding the rate-liming enzymes involved in this pathway were up-regulated in parallel with a down-regulation of the rate-limiting genes involved in glycolysis (e.g., <italic>Gck, Hk1</italic>, and <italic>Gpd2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). We also detected in the <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> liver a significantly elevated level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which is encoded by <italic>Gpt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). ALT is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of amino groups to form the hepatic metabolite oxaloacetate, an intermediate substrate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)/Krebs cycle, which can be used for gluconeogenesis. Thus, we postulated that an increased anaplerotic oxidation of amino acids may be an alternative pathway engaged to maintain gluconeogenesis and to supply glucose as an energy source for normal growth in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neonates when the FAO capacity was impeded in the absence of PPARα. Indeed, most of the rate-limiting enzymes involved in amino acid oxidation (except for valine, leucine, and isoleucine) were concomitantly up-regulated in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> liver at P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Up-regulation of these genes would provide some of the intermediate substrates of the TCA cycle, such as α-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and oxaloacetate, which could be used for gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>).

In the neonatal liver, however, we show that mitochondrial β-oxidation prevails as the major contributor to the neonatal oxidative capacity and protects against hepatic steatosis when faced with a sudden surge in dietary fat. Our findings are consistent with the notion that mitochondrial FAO represents the dominant metabolic pathway whereas peroxisomal FAO assumes a relatively minor role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hashimoto et al., 1999</xref>). Accordingly, long-chain FAs constitute more than 60% of the total FAs in animals and milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 1968</xref>), and their abundance makes them the only significant source of metabolic fuel for the mitochondrial, but not peroxisomal, β-oxidation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reddy and Mannaerts, 1994</xref>). Moreover, decreased mitochondrial FAO has been considered one of the major contributing factors leading to liver steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ockner et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the concomitant presence of lipid content of milk, a lower number of mitochondria and overt mitochondrial dysfunctions jointly contributes to the development of liver steatosis in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>neonates. Notably, mitochondrial dysfunctions were evident in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hepatocytes due to reduced ∆<sub>ΨM</sub> and increased intracellular ROS levels. We postulate that an increased intracellular ROS level likely precedes the loss of ∆<sub>ΨM</sub> and mitochondria dysfunction. As this oxidative stress condition continues to worsen after birth, perhaps induced by nutritional lipid as previously indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tirosh et al., 2009</xref>), reduced ∆<sub>ΨM</sub> and ATP production ultimately ensue. This is in agreement with a previous report of a similar mitochondrial disorder associated with the dysfunctional respiratory chain components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lebiedzinska et al., 2010</xref>). Particularly, the increased intracellular ROS levels observed in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes may be due to the reduced clearance of ROS as evidenced by the down-regulation of genes coding for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and copper chaperone for SOD1 (a metalloprotein responsible for delivering copper as a co-factor to SOD1) before and/or after birth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). This observation is consistent with the report that PPARα activation by agonist clofibrate stimulates SOD1 and catalase activities as part of the defense mechanisms against oxidative stress in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ibarra-Lara et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Many of the PPARα-regulated genes involved in FAO have previously been shown to contain a PPRE in their promoter region and hence, recognized as direct PPARα target genes (Rakhshandehroo et al., 2010). This implicates that the reduced oxidative capacity observed in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was due to the lack of direct PPARα-mediated stimulatory effects rather than a cellular-autonomous metabolic adaptation in response to lower mitochondria numbers. As discovered by Semenkovich and<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rakhshandehroo et al., 2010</xref> co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakravarthy et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2009</xref>), newly synthesized FA by fatty acid synthase may also regulate glucose, lipid, and cholesterol metabolism by serving as endogenous activators of a distinct physiological pool of PPARα ligands in adult liver. However, we doubt that de novo synthesis of FA plays a predominant role in the regulation of PPARα activity during early postnatal period since insulin/glucagon ratio is low, which promotes FAO rather than de novo synthesis of FA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Girard et al., 1977</xref>). Our recent work indicates that PPARα has little impact on the expression of lipogenic genes in normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montagner et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, an effective hepatic FAO is essential for the provision of acetyl-CoA and NADH to support hepatic de novo ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Girard, 1986</xref>). This notion is consistent with the hypoketonemia and hypoglycemia in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>neonates reported in this work and by Crawford and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cotter et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, the hypoglycemic phenotype previously reported in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>neonates by Cotter et al. happened at P1 due to a decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis from glycerol. However, we did not detect any sign of hypoglycemia in these mice starting from P2. This apparent discrepancy is likely attributable to the rapid (~1 day) and dynamic adaptive functions of <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>neonatal liver in providing glucose as the primary source of energy required for postnatal growth and in maintaining glucose homeostasis. Our finding also supports the work of others indicating a preserved gluconeogenesis from glycerol in adult <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2002</xref>). We elucidated that this cell-autonomous metabolic adaptation was enhanced in the absence of PPARα and mediated through the up-regulation of hepatic ALT and anaplerotic amino acid oxidation. Thus far, the mechanism behind the increased production and secretion of ALT in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>neonatal liver still remains unclear. It is notable that <italic>ALT2</italic> expression is up-regulated under metabolic stress and that plasma and tissue ALT levels are elevated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Salgado et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Josekutty et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, defective PPARα signaling has been reported to cause hepatic mitochondrial and ER stress in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis through reduced mRNA expression of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Su et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, our transcriptome analysis revealed a consistent reduction by ~1.2-fold in the expression of <italic>Atp2a2</italic>, which encodes SERCA, in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> liver at E19.5 and P2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Moreover, we also delineated that most of the rate-limiting enzymes involved in amino acid oxidation were concomitantly up-regulated in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>neonatal liver to provide essential intermediate substrates in TCA/Krebs cycle required for gluconeogenesis. Hence, we speculate that de novo synthesis of glucose becomes the primary energy source in sustaining normal postnatal growth in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>neonates as evidenced by the observed growth retardation upon decoupling of amino acid oxidation from gluconeogenesis. This is in conjunction with the failure of <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>neonatal liver in harnessing energy from ketone bodies and lipids due to defective mitochondrial functions. In parallel, the compensatory up-regulation of pyruvate carboxylase (Pcx) and other gluconeogenic genes in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>neonates at P2 probably corresponds with a lower hepatic acetyl-CoA level, as supported by a recent report that hepatic acetyl-CoA acts as an allosteric regulator of Pcx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perry et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, these findings in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice illustrate the tremendous flexibility of the neonatal liver in coordinating ketogenesis, FAO, and gluconeogenesis so as to meet the energy demand required for normal growth especially when faced with an energy crisis caused by defective oxidative metabolism and hypoketonemia.</p><p>Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) is one of the rate-liming enzymes involved in ketogenesis. <italic>Hmgcs2</italic> contains a PPRE in its promoter region and is under the direct transcriptional control of PPARα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rodríguez et al., 1994</xref>). HMGCS2 has been shown to induce mitochondrial FAO and FGF21 expression, possibly via a SIRT1-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vilà-Brau et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Hmgcs2</italic> mRNA expression peaks 16 hr after birth and coincides with a decline in <italic>Acox1</italic> mRNA expression thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yubero et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Serra et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">1996</xref>). These reports substantiate our findings of preferential activation of mitochondrial FAO at birth. Our results also support the in vivo finding that β-hydroxybutyrate is a potent physiological inhibitor of HDAC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimazu et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that PPARα-mediated activation of HMGCS2 and β-hydroxybutyrate production precedes the PPARα-regulated production of FGF21. Similar to other PPARα target genes, we detected PPARα occupancy in the <italic>Fgf21</italic> promoter before birth, but its transcription is ultimately determined by the alleviation of HDAC3-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Thus, fatty acid catabolism provides β-hydroxybutyrate, which acts as a secondary signal to initiate the de-repression of the <italic>Fgf21</italic> promoter by HDAC3, allowing it to become PPARα responsive. It was previously indicated that HDAC-mediated histone deacetylation may inhibit transcription at the initiation and/or elongation step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). If the genes are loaded by Pol2 at the TSS, similar to what we observed at the <italic>Fgf21</italic> TSS upon PPARα agonistic activation, HDAC-mediated inhibition of transcription most likely happens at the elongation step although abortive initiation of the TSS bound Pol2 cannot be excluded. Our results suggest that PPARα activation induces the recruitment and assembly of a transcription initiation complex at the <italic>Fgf21</italic> TSS. However, the elongation of <italic>Fgf21</italic> mRNA transcript only ensues after alleviation of HDAC3 inhibition by β-hydroxybutyrate. Therefore, it is consistent with our findings that PPARα agonist has no effect on <italic>Fgf21</italic> mRNA or transcriptional activation in the absence of β-hydroxybutyrate.</p><p>Both human and mouse neonates exhibit mild ketogenic conditions during early postpartum period (0–1 day, 0.2–0.5 mmol/L), which further exacerbates after 5–10 days (0.5–1.1 mmol/L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamosh, 2004</xref>). We believe that it could be due to the use of lipids as preferred fuel for growth while the carbohydrate parts of milk (e.g., lactose and oligosaccharide−two main carbohydrates in milk) mainly contribute to brain growth (i.e., myelin synthesis) and gut microbiota nourishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edmond, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chichlowski et al., 2011</xref>). Further, the observed ketogenic condition may also be explained by the low insulin/glucagon ratio in early postpartum life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Girard et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferré et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Girard et al., 1992</xref>).

However, unlike <italic>Fgf21</italic>, the expression of <italic>Angptl4</italic> has already begun in the fetal liver. This finding is congruent with the report that ANGPTL4 functions as a glucocorticoid-dependent gatekeeper of FA flux by inhibiting the activity of adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase during fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koliwad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dijk and Kersten, 2014</xref>). In fact, significant overlap exists between the bioenergetic challenges experienced during fasting and at birth. Liver-derived FGF21 acts as an endocrine regulator of ketogenesis, which links the phenotypes observed during fasting and in newborns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hondares et al., 2010</xref>). This concept is evident in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, which have reduced plasma FGF21 levels. During fasting, the switch to a lipid-dominated nutrient supply provokes hypoketonemia, hypoglycemia, and hepatic steatosis in adult <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kersten et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montagner et al., 2016</xref>). In concordance with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cotter et al., 2014</xref>), the shift to a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neonates results in steatosis similar to that observed in fasted adult <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Notably, FGF21 has previously been shown to stimulate hepatic FAO and to prevent hepatic steatosis following ingestion of lipid-laden milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, we believe that the physiological relevance of FGF21 induction in neonates after milk suckling relates to its role in metabolic regulation by stimulating lipid catabolism rather than a response to starvation or a low calorie condition which no longer exists upon milk ingestion. It is also important to note that the early human breast milk is not initially ketogenic due to the relatively high lactose content, which gradually decreases while the fat content increases as the milk matures over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jenness, 1979</xref>). In contrast, mouse milk is likely a ketogenic diet as evidenced by a previous report that early mouse milk comprises ~17% of fat and ~1.7% of lactose at P3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Görs et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, direct translation of our findings to human situations needs to be cautioned for such differences in milk composition.</p><p>In summary, we provide evidence that prenatal expression of PPARα is under the direct control of GR. The GR-dependent PPARα activity is pivotal for the induction of hepatic FA catabolic genes, pointing to a novel anticipatory role of PPARα in the fetal liver in preparation for the efficient use of milk fat as an energy source. In addition, hepatic FA catabolism provides essential co-factors for the synthesis of ketone bodies such as β-hydroxybutyrate. Interestingly, ketone bodies act as a secondary signal that further activates PPARα-dependent regulation of the hepatokine FGF21. Therefore GR-PPARα axis may represent a critical signaling pathway in late gestation for the ability of mammalian newborns to use nutrients and maintain whole-body homeostasis. We conclude that in the absence of PPARα, a vicious cycle pertaining to the (i) lower mitochondria numbers, (ii) mitochondrial dysfunctions, (iii) impaired mitochondrial FA β-oxidation, (iii) hypoketonemia either due to a lack of direct PPARα stimulation of <italic>Hmgcs2</italic> or a lack of essential co-factors provided by functional FAO, (iv) lack of epigenetic activation of FGF21 by ketone bodies (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate), and (v) a surge in nutritional lipids upon milk suckling, exists to concomitantly contribute to the development of hepatic steatosis in neonates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>PPARα-null (<italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) and GR-null (<italic>Nr3c1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice were acquired from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar, Harbor, ME) and Nuclear Receptor Zoo (MGI: 95824, Strasbourg, France), respectively. These mice were given standard rodent chow diet (AIN93M, Specialty Feeds, Australia) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and water ad libitum, maintained in a C57BL/6 background, and bred in our specific pathogen-free facilities by inter-crossing <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice to obtain experimental wild-type and knockout pups in the same litter. This breeding strategy allowed the experimental mice to be exposed to the same gestational environment and ensured that pups received milk of the same nutritional content from the heterozygous dams. Pregnancy was timed based on vaginal plug formation. Pregnant dams approaching full-term were closely monitored and cesarean section performed to obtain fetuses at E19.5 or earlier (E13, E15, E17). Pups at P2 were timed based on the delivery day. Litters of 6–8 pups were used to minimize differences in milk availability verified by stomach inspection. All experimental protocols involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Veterinary Office of the Canton Vaud (SCA–EXPANIM, Service de la Consommation et des Affaires Vétérinaires, Epalinges, Switzerland) in accordance with the Federal Swiss Veterinary Office Guidelines and by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (#2013/SHS/866) in Singapore.

Hybridization was performed with Affymetrix Mouse Genome MoGene1.0 ST arrays according to the manufacturer’s protocol and analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leuenberger et al., 2009</xref>).Briefly, the significant enrichment of underlying KEGG, GO, and Reactome curated pathways was determined from the hypergeometric distribution and corrected for multiple comparisons using Broad Institute Molecular Signatures Database v4.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/</ext-link>). Gene sets with a false discovery rate p<italic>-</italic>value&lt;0.05 were considered significant. Genes that were up- or down-regulated were identified by selecting genes with logarithmic fold-change ratio (<italic>PPARα<sup>-/-</sup>/PPARα<sup>+</sup></italic><sup>/+</sup>) &gt; 1.3 (up-regulated genes) or &lt; −1.3 (down-regulated genes). The raw data have been deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and made accessible through the GEO database (accession number: GSE39669 and GSE39670).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell sorting</title><p>E19.5 fetal hepatic cells were isolated as described above and incubated with PE- or FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against DLK (LS-C179444) (LifeSpan Biosciences, Seatlle, WA) or CK18 (ab52459) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at 1:200 dilution in PBS supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum according to a protocol previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanimizu et al., 2003</xref>). The samples were then washed with PBS and mixed with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide before cell sorting using a FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Primary hepatocytes were isolated as described above. Mitochondria and peroxisomes were stained using MitoTracker Red and SelectFX Alexa Fluor 488 Peroxisome Labeling Kits (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Negative controls without Mitotracker Red or fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were used to gate the quadrants. Levels of mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ROS production were determined by tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) (ab113852) staining and 2’,7’ –dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) (ab113851) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) staining, respectively, according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Treatments with carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP, an ionophore uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation capable of eliminating mitochondrial membrane potential) at 20 μM for 10 min or N-acetylcysteine (NAC, an antioxidant) at 5 mM for 2 hr served as negative controls for the respective staining. A total of 10,000 events were recorded. The data were analyzed using BD FACSDiva software (version 6; Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and further processed by FlowJo software (version 7.6.1; Tree Star, OR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Measurement of Cellular ATP Production</title><p>Primary hepatocytes were isolated and cultured as described above. Cellular ATP production was measured in the presence of 25 mM glucose, 10 mM galactose, or 2.5 μM rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) using the ENLITEN ATP Assay System Bioluminescence Detection Kit (Promega, Madison, MI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Bioluminescence signals were read on a GloMax 20/20 Luminometer (Promega, Madison, MI) and normalized to the total number of viable cells. Cell viability assay was performed in extracted primary hepatocytes using trypan blue exclusion test based on a protocol previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strober, 2001</xref>). The production of pyruvate via the glycolytic metabolism of glucose yields 2 net ATP, but the same catalytic pathway yields no net ATP when galactose is used instead of glucose, thereby forcing cells to rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy. Thus, the use of galactose in the primary hepatocyte culture acts as a positive control for the measurement of oxidative phosphorylation-dependent energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguer et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR) Measurement</title><p>Primary hepatocytes were isolated as described above and 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells seeded per well on XF-24 cell culture plates (Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA) coated with rat tail collagen in DMEM medium containing 5% FCS and incubated overnight at 37°C. The cellular oxygen consumption rate was measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nasrin et al., 2010</xref>). The next day, cells were equilibrated with buffer (111 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 mM glucose, 0.5 mM carnitine) and incubated at 37°C for 60 min. The basal cellular respiration was measured without any treatment for 15 min (n = 9 per group), followed by treatment with 200 μM palmitate conjugated with BSA in a 6:1 molar ratio or BSA alone for 40 min (n = 6 per group). To measure the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, cells were subsequently incubated with 300 μm etomoxir, a known carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibitor, for another 30 min (n = 3 per group). All measurements utilized the Seahorse XF24 Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences, Billerica, MA). The OCR of whole hepatocytes was standardized for total protein concentration after the assay was completed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Histological analysis</title><p>Fresh liver samples were collected and embedded in OCT tissue freezing medium (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Oil Red O stock solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of Oil Red O powder (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 500 ml isopropanol. To constitute 50 ml of 60% Oil Red O working solution, 30 ml of the stock solution was diluted with 20 ml of water. Fresh-frozen samples were sectioned (6 μm thick) and stained with 60% Oil Red O solution for 10 min. The Oil Red O-stained sections were counterstained with methylene blue.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Analysis of serum and tissue metabolites</title><p>Serum glucose and triglyceride levels were measured using the Accutrend Plus meter (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Serum β-hydroxybutyrate and liver ALT levels were measured using the β-hydroxybutyrate Assay Kit and ALT Activity Assay Kit, respectively (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO). Lipids were extracted from the liver samples by the Bligh/Dyer method and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zadravec et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>High-fat-diet weaning challenge</title><p>Although feeding the P5 pups with milk harvested from <italic>Ppara<sup>+/-</sup> </italic>dams would be ideal for this HFD-weaning challenge, we were ethically and technically restricted to perform oral gavage in these young pups and to collect sufficient milk for this experiment. For these reasons, we resorted to the best compromise by exposing the pups to a high-fat/low-carbohydrate (HF/LC) diet or a control diet from P5 (i.e., just before tooth eruption) to P15 (i.e., when liver steatosis is mostly resolved). The diets (Provimi Kliba, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) had the following macronutrient compositions (% w/w: fat, carbohydrates, protein): control, 16.7/64.3/19.0 (#2222) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>) and HF/LC, 74.4/6.6/19.0 (#2201) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>).

The computation of the sample size is based on the assumption that there would be no missing data (i.e., all mice will produce data). The data in all figure panels reflect multiple experiments performed on different days using pups (n = 6 with triplicates) derived from different litters. In this study, we used 6 mice per group (i.e., biological replicates) for all experiments. Further, measurements and experiments were repeated in triplicates for each sample (i.e., technical replication). Values were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor who also served as Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sander Kersten (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper Rando, G et al. elegantly show a new mechanism by which PPARα controls hepatic adaptation to changes in the nutrition during the late stages of development and at birth. The story is very interesting as general knowledge and it adds a novel model by which the liver may adapt to changes in the diet and how this adaptation could be exploited in health and disease. Specifically, the paper explores the mechanism underlying the activation of the transcription factor PPARα in liver during the late embryonic period and the impact of this mechanism on cellular energetics and lipid metabolism. The paper highlights the crucial role of the glucocorticoid receptor in activation of PPARα during embryogenesis, and proposes a contribution of epigenetic mechanisms involving the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate. The paper consists of a number of mini-stories that differ substantially in the quality of the data and in the level of depth provided. Some of the mini-stories are mostly confirmatory, while others are novel. The unification of the individual stories into a coherent and convincing overall message is a bit problematic and deserves attention. Even though the experiments are very well conducted, there are some pitfalls that should be resolved for a better understanding of the main points of the story.</p><p>The finding that PPARα target genes exhibit different types of expression profiles pre- and post-natally is worthy of a more detailed mechanistic pursuit. The demonstration that the glucocorticoid receptor is the driving force behind induction of PPARα during embryogenesis and directly binds to the PPARα promoter is very interesting and novel. The data showing a major impact of PPARα deletion on neonatal lipid metabolism are confirmatory of a publication by Cotter et al. (Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. 2014 Jul 15; 307(2): E176-E187). The data on epigenetic regulation of PPARα target genes are interesting but do not link particularly well to the data on lipid metabolism. Β-hydroxybutyrate may contribute to induction of specific PPARα target genes (<italic>Fgf21</italic>) via epigenetic mechanism but how does this effect connect to the observed phenotype of <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. The part describing epigenetic regulation by β-hydroxybutyrate is potentially very exciting (following the work of Verdin) but the physiological/metabolic rationale needs to be better explained.</p><p>Overall, the paper has quite a few rough edges. The presentation/description of the data and story lines can be much improved. The paper would benefit from a more linear story line from GR to PPARα to ketone bodies to epigenetic regulation of <italic>Fgf21</italic> (while perhaps mentioning a potential vicious cycle between PPARα, ketone bodies and <italic>Fgf21</italic>). Some figures should be removed as they are unnecessary and distracting (confirmatory data of Cotter, data on gluconeogenesis and anaplerotic oxidation of amino acids). It would be fantastic if the role of β-hydroxybutyrate in epigenetic gene regulation of <italic>Fgf21</italic> could be confirmed via in vivo data but that would be an unreasonable request.</p><p>All three reviewers mention that the storyline of the paper is complex and that the structure of the paper needs to be substantially improved. That is something that could be completed in two months. As far as additional analyses are concerned, the possible translation of the data to humans should addressed with more caution and in any case be very difficult to address experimentally. We would appreciate additional elaboration on the generalizability of effect of β-hydroxybutyrate on gene expression. The authors are encouraged to look at additional genes to solidify this very interesting finding.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We list the major comments from each reviewer rather than consolidating them. They are largely distinct with some overlap.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1) It is described that PPARα null and WT animals were maintained on a mixed C57BL/6 × SV129 background and bred by intercrossing mice heterozygous for the mutation. The rationale for this practice is unclear. First, PPARα null mice are available at Jackson labs on a pure C57BL/6 or SV129 background, which would be preferred over a mixed genetic background. In addition, PPARα null mice are perfectly viable as homozygous. Why weren't PPARα null maintained as homozygous and compared with wildtype mice matched for genetic background?</p><p>2) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> to be meaningful, the entire set of PPARα targets within a metabolic pathway should be shown (as opposed to a potentially biased subselection of genes) or the comparative analysis should be performed statistically at the pathway level.</p><p>3) In the second paragraph of the Results section: the nearly 90% reduction in ATP production in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>hepatocytes as compared to WT hepatocytes seems implausible, especially considering that the cells were fed with glucose or galactose. Could it be that these results are reflective of the low viability of the <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hepatocytes? There is no mentioning of measurement of cell viability in the primary hepatocytes.</p><p>4) Please explain why palmitate and etomoxir do not have any influence on oxygen consumption in either <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> or <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hepatocytes. The lack of effect of etomoxir on oxygen consumption in <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> hepatocytes suggests that the difference in oxygen consumption between <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>hepatocytes is not related to differences in fatty acid oxidation.</p><p>5) The part of the manuscript addressing plasma glucose (subsection “PPARα Required for Protection against Neonatal Hepatic Steatosis”, last paragraph) is poorly developed. It is unclear why a <italic>lack</italic> of difference in plasma glucose levels or body weight between the two genotypes would prompt the authors to check whether the gluconeogenesis pathway is modified.</p><p>6) It is described that &quot;… increased anaplerotic oxidation of amino acids may be an alternative pathway for maintaining the de novo synthesis of glucose as an energy source when the FAO capacity is impeded in the absence of PPARα&quot;. What is the evidence that oxidation of amino acids may be increased? The genes shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2E are part of an energy-requiring process: gluconeogenesis.</p><p>7) In the Discussion section, increased anaplerotic oxidation of amino acids is proposed as a potential explanation for the discrepancy with Cotter et al., who found that <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> pups were hypoglycemic. Why would anaplerotic oxidation of amino acids be different between the two studies?</p><p>8) The interpretation of the experiment with L-cycloserine is difficult. Did the authors verify that it effectively inhibited gluconeogenesis? For instance, were plasma glucose levels altered. The authors don't derive any conclusion from this experiment. Why was it included?</p><p>9) In the last paragraph of the Results section: Rephrase &quot;Activation of the <italic>Fgf21</italic> TSS and the levels of <italic>Fgf21</italic> mRNA required both the activation of PPARα by Wy and HDAC3 inhibition through butyrate or β-hydroxybutyrate treatment.&quot; Can the authors explain why WY has no effect on <italic>Fgf21</italic> mRNA or transcriptional activation in the absence of butyrate of β-hydroxybutyrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), whereas WY alone effectively induces polII binding to the <italic>Fgf21</italic> TSS in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>1) Hepatocytes from E14.5 and E15.5 did not show any changes in the activity of <italic>Pparα</italic>, which is not surprising since at this stage of liver development the liver bud generates mainly hematopoietic cells and precursors. At later stages we can expect that some hepatic precursors appear and at 19.5 there is a mixed population of cells in the liver: one compartment is the undifferentiated hepatoblasts and the other is the newly formed hepatocytes. Since the deletion of <italic>Pparα</italic> is constitutive, it would be important to show if either the changes seen at E19.5 are stemming from the pluripotent hepatoblasts compartment or from the hepatocytes. The same is observed in the newly born population. This is a key point to be addressed since it could change the main story. It is expected that hepatoblasts will show an aerobic glycolytic metabolic profile, as seen in many other stem cell-like population; but it would be important to address what happens to hepatocytes before birth?</p><p>2) In the <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice there are many changes but the most relevant one is related to the number of mitochondria. How can it be excluded that all the changes in FAO and gluconeogenesis observed are not cellular-autonomous metabolic adaptation as a result of the lower number of mitochondria instead of epigenetic regulation? Is the mitochondrial potential maintained in these mitochondria? What is the redox status of the mitochondria and the cytoplasm? Can it be excluded that the induction of β-Hydroxybutyrate is not due to mitochondrial defects?</p><p>3) Related to the previous question, the authors claim that ALT could be activated to replenish the TCA cycle in the absence of <italic>Pparα</italic>. This is very interesting, but not backed up by solid data. The ALT activity is mainly cytoplasmic because the liver expresses mainly the cytoplasmic isoform of Gpt (ALT). Therefore, if the reactions occur in the cytoplasm, it is expected to be accompanied by changes in the mitochondrial potential. This would need to be shown. In some cases, the change in the pyruvate flux to alanine will affect amino acid metabolism. Were any changes in the expression of genes from amino acid metabolism detected in the microarray data? In addition, is there a reason that ALT would be more active?</p><p>4) For the ChIP-seq data, the authors should show that the antibody against GR does not pull down anything in the <italic>GR</italic><sup>-/-</sup> livers.</p><p>5) The paper is written in a complicated fashion, which makes understanding of the most important points tedious. The authors should be encouraged to simplify their writing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>1) The mice used are classical PPARα k.o. mice. How specific are the effects found for the liver (in particular in vivo) as the PPARα is expressed in many organs (including the gut) and this could influence the outcome?</p><p>2) The hepatic steatosis in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> is caused by? The dietary fat or more related to the carb part of the diet leading to de novo lipogenesis that is also under control of PPARα, I thought (references are not mentioned describing the role in regulating 'new' fat metabolism). Translated to the human situation early breastmilk has a rather low fat content and as a baby breastfeeds, the fat content very gradually increases, with the milk becoming fattier and fattier over time. So in the beginning is largely a sweet high lactose/carb feed; how does this relate to this study?</p><p>3) Related to this the HF diets used for the challenge are quite extreme, ketogenic diets, why this is needed as I guess this is not the same in the human situation? I do not see the full relevance for this challenge? To induce FGF21? Is FGF21 functional for early nutrition related metabolic regulation or more related to starvation/low calorie periods of the baby (where β-hydroxybutyrate also goes up?), so is it ketogenesis because of ketogenic diets or fasting-related metabolic states? I am not really convinced of the diets used here to mimic (human) milk. Human milk is clearly not a ketogenic diet. So I question the regulation of FGF21 because of the milk.</p><p>4) The composition is not precisely mentioned e.g. no lactose or sucrose in the diet?). On the other hand, using chow is not ideal as it will prevent the exact reproducibility of this study because of the natural/variable ingredients of the chow.</p><p>In summary, I am not so convinced yet that the main finding of this paper (epigenetic regulation of FGF21, which has been partly described before, and partly attributed to SIRT1/3) is really related to the HF diet challenge but it could be also alternatively explained as it might contribute in the difficult periods of low-/no-food /starvation when bHB is providing fuel for the brain to optimize glucose transport by other organs to prevent hypoglycemia etc.?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11853.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] All three reviewers mention that the storyline of the paper is complex and that the structure of the paper needs to be substantially improved.

We have addressed all the reviewers’ comments in the following point-by-point response.</p><p>In response to some of the comments highlighted in this summary but not raised by the reviewers, we have made the following changes in the manuscript:</p><p>We have changed the title of the manuscript to “Glucocorticoid receptor-PPARα axis in fetal mouse liver prepares neonates for milk lipid catabolism” to better encapsulate the major findings reported in our revised manuscript.</p><p>We have reconstructed the manuscript to streamline the story (from GR to PPARα to ketone bodies to epigenetic regulation of <italic>Fgf21</italic>) and simplified our writing to enhance accessibility to a broad readership. We have also discussed and placed more emphasis on the physiological relevance of our work in the Discussion.</p><p>We have now established the connection between epigenetic regulation of PPARα target genes (particularly FGF21) and lipid metabolism in the Discussion (sixth paragraph). In particular, the physiological/metabolic relevance of the epigenetic regulation of FGF21 by β-hydroxybutyrate has been discussed.</p><p>We have also established the connection between the induction of FGF21 via HDAC3 inhibition by β-hydroxybutyrate and the observed phenotype of <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>mice in the Discussion (sixth paragraph).</p><p>We did not remove some of the figures as suggested (e.g., gluconeogenesis and anaplerotic oxidation of amino acids) because we believe that these data complement the work of Cotter et al. and provide important information on the overall metabolic situations in the absence of PPARα. We believe that you found the inclusion of these data unnecessary and distracting because of our failure to successfully integrate/connect this information with other parts of the metabolic processes. We have tried to address this shortfall in the Discussion of the revised manuscript (fourth paragraph).</p><p>We have mentioned, as suggested, a potential vicious cycle between PPARα, ketone bodies and FGF21 in the Discussion (last paragraph).

It is important to note that, unlike <italic>Fgf21</italic>, the expression of <italic>Angptl4</italic> started before birth. We have reported this new data in the Results (subsection “An Epigenetic Switch Controls a Subset of PPARα Target Genes”, last paragraph) and further discussed this difference in the Discussion (sixth paragraph).</p><p>Further, we have also performed several additional experiments and we believe that the new data have strengthened our work.

They are largely distinct with some overlap.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p><italic>1) It is described that PPARα null and WT animals were maintained on a mixed C57BL/6 × SV129 background and bred by intercrossing mice heterozygous for the mutation. The rationale for this practice is unclear. First, PPARα null mice are available at Jackson labs on a pure C57BL/6 or SV129 background, which would be preferred over a mixed genetic background. In addition, PPARα null mice are perfectly viable as homozygous. Why weren't PPARα null maintained as homozygous and compared with wildtype mice matched for genetic background?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing to our attention this lack of clarity in the rationale of our breeding strategy. In addition, this good comment made us realize that there was a mistake in our text.</p><p>Firstly, we acquired PPARα-knockout (<italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice on a pure C57BL/6 background from the Jackson Laboratory and inter-crossed them with our in-house wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice for at least 5 generations to generate PPARα-heterozygous (HT) mice. We have corrected this information in the Materials and methods (first paragraph).</p><p>Secondly, we obtained the foetuses and pups through heterozygous mating so that we could control for gestational and lactational confounding factors introduced by using dams from different genotypes (WT and <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>). It is currently unknown whether PPARα deficiency in lactating dams can lead to alteration in milk composition, as it is the case for PPARγ-knockout mice (Wan et al., 2007) (PMID: 17652179). Therefore, it was important to ensure that both WT and <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>pups received milk of the same nutritional content from the HT dams. We have clarified this rationale in the Materials and methods (subsection “ChIP Assays”).</p><p><italic>2) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> to be meaningful, the entire set of PPARα targets within a metabolic pathway should be shown (as opposed to a potentially biased subselection of genes) or the comparative analysis should be performed statistically at the pathway level.</italic></p><p>We have performed an unbiased comparative analysis of the similarly and differentially regulated (both up- and down-regulation) genes between WT and <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>foetuses at E19.5 and pups P2. Statistical analysis was also performed with <italic>p-</italic>values indicated for the top 10 most affected pathways for each category. This piece of information can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) In the second paragraph of the Results section: the nearly 90% reduction in ATP production in Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes as compared to WT hepatocytes seems implausible, especially considering that the cells were fed with glucose or galactose. Could it be that these results are reflective of the low viability of the Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes? There is no mentioning of measurement of cell viability in the primary hepatocytes.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As suggested, we have repeated the ATP measurements using primary hepatocytes obtained from E19.5 and P2 livers (n=4 per time point per group). We have performed trypan blue exclusion test to quantify the number and percentage of viable cells. We observed a ~20% reduction in the number of viable primary <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>hepatocytes as compared with the WT hepatocytes at both time points, despite that these two groups were simultaneously extracted using the same procedure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>, left panel). We subsequently normalized ATP production to the number of viable cells and found that ATP production in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>hepatocytes was ~40-50% of the levels measured in both prenatal and postnatal WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>, right panel). We have reported the new data in the Results (subsection “PPARα Controls the Prenatal Lipid Catabolic Machiner”, last paragraph).</p><p>and Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes is not related to differences in fatty acid oxidation.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11853.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11853.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11853.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-11853-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p><italic>4) Please explain why palmitate and etomoxir do not have any influence on oxygen consumption in either Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> <italic>or Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes. The lack of effect of etomoxir on oxygen consumption in Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> <italic>hepatocytes suggests that the difference in oxygen consumption between Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup><italic>and Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes is notrelated to differences in fatty acid oxidation.</italic></p><p>We apologise for the confusion caused as we previously did not indicate the statistical significance between the treatment groups of the same genotype. We have now performed two-tailed Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for these observed differences in palmitate treatment groups (where <sup>###</sup> indicates <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 vs. baseline), and in palmitate + etomoxir treatment groups (where <sup>§§§</sup> indicates <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 vs. palmitate treatment alone). We found that the differences were statistically significant in WT but not in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> groups. To clarify this, we have included the indications of significance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) The part of the manuscript addressing plasma glucose (subsection “PPARα Required for Protection against Neonatal Hepatic Steatosis”, last paragraph) is poorly developed. It is unclear why a lack of difference in plasma glucose levels or body weight between the two genotypes would prompt the authors to check whether the gluconeogenesis pathway is modified.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this lack of clarity in the rationale of investigating the gluconeogenesis pathway. It is known that the transition from a carbohydrate-rich fetal diet to a high-fat, low-carbohydrate neonatal diet requires inductions of hepatic fatty acid oxidation (FAO), gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis in order to preserve bioenergetics homeostasis (Cotter et al., 2013) (PMID: 23689508). In addition, an effective hepatic FAO is necessary to support hepatic de novo ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis by providing essential co-factors such as acetyl-CoA and/or NADH (Girard, 1986) (PMID: 3542066). Since PPARα deficiency leads to defective hepatic FAO and hypoketonemia, we were interested to find out whether the gluconeogenesis pathway is altered to sustain the energy demand for normal growth. We have clarified this point in the Results (subsection “PPARα Is Required for Protection against Neonatal Hepatic Steatosis”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>6) It is described that &quot;… increased anaplerotic oxidation of amino acids may be an alternative pathway for maintaining the de novo synthesis of glucose as an energy source when the FAO capacity is impeded in the absence of PPARα&quot;. What is the evidence that oxidation of amino acids may be increased? The genes shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2E are part of an energy-requiring process: gluconeogenesis.</italic></p><p>Based on our microarray data, we have delineated that most of genes coding for the rate-limiting enzymes involved in amino acid oxidation were concomitantly up-regulated in the <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> liver at P2 (except for valine, leucine, and isoleucine). Up-regulation of these genes provides some of the intermediate substrates in TCA/Krebs cycle, such as α-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and oxaloacetate, which are ultimately used for gluconeogenesis. We have incorporated this information in the Results (subsection “PPARα Is Required for Protection against Neonatal Hepatic Steatosis”, last paragraph) and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref> with the gene name indicated in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>7) In the Discussion section, increased anaplerotic oxidation of amino acids is proposed as a potential explanation for the discrepancy with Cotter et al., who found that Ppara<sup>-/-</sup> pups were hypoglycemic. Why would anaplerotic oxidation of amino acids be different between the two studies?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. The hypoglycemic phenotype was reported by Cotter et al. in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> pups at P1 due to a decreased hepatic production of glucose from glycerol. However, we did not detect any sign of hypoglycemia in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic>neonates starting from P2. We believe the findings from the two groups complement each other. This apparent discrepancy is likely attributable to the rapid (~ 1 day) and dynamic adaptive function of the neonatal liver in maintaining glucose homeostasis via anaplerotic amino acid oxidation, which was particularly evident in the <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> liver at P2. We have further discussed this discrepancy and emphasized on this implication in the Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>8) The interpretation of the experiment with L-cycloserine is difficult. Did the authors verify that it effectively inhibited gluconeogenesis? For instance, were plasma glucose levels altered. The authors don't derive any conclusion from this experiment. Why was it included?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have now measured the plasma glucose levels in WT and <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> pups after L-cycloserine treatment. We found that L-cycloserine treatment consistently impeded the production of glucose in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> pups at P2, P4, P5 and P6. This finding further supports the notion that anaplerotic amino acid oxidation in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> liver provides the intermediate substrates in TCA/Krebs cycle required for the gluconeogenesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>). We have included this information in the Results (subsection “PPARα Is Required for Protection against Neonatal Hepatic Steatosis”, last paragraph) and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>.</p><p><italic>9) In the last paragraph of the Results section: Rephrase &quot;Activation of the Fgf21 TSS and the levels of Fgf21 mRNA required both the activation of PPARα by Wy and HDAC3 inhibition through butyrate or β-hydroxybutyrate treatment.&quot; Can the authors explain why WY has no effect on Fgf21 mRNA or transcriptional activation in the absence of butyrate of β-hydroxybutyrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), whereas WY alone effectively induces polII binding to the Fgf21 TSS in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this interesting point. It was previously indicated that HDAC-mediated histone deacetylation may inhibit transcription at the initiation and/or elongation step (Wang et al., 2009) (PMCID: PMC2750862). If the genes are loaded by Pol2 at the TSS, similar to what we observed at the <italic>Fgf21</italic> TSS upon PPARα agonistic activation, HDAC-mediated inhibition of transcription most likely happens at the elongation step although abortive initiation by the TSS bound Pol2 cannot be excluded. Our results suggest that PPARα activation induces the recruitment and assembly of transcription initiation complex at the <italic>Fgf21</italic> TSS. However, the elongation of <italic>Fgf21</italic> mRNA transcript only ensues after alleviation of HDAC3 inhibition by β-hydroxybutyrate. Therefore, it is consistent with our findings that WY-14643 has no effect on <italic>Fgf21</italic> mRNA or transcriptional activation in the absence of butyrate or β-hydroxybutyrate due to HDAC3-mediated inhibition. We have discussed this in the Discussion (fifth paragraph).</p><p>We have also rephrased the sentence (Results), which now reads “Activation of the <italic>Fgf21</italic> transcriptional activity was dependent on both the activation of PPARα and HDAC3 inhibition through butyrate or β-hydroxybutyrate treatment”.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Hepatocytes from E14.5 and E15.5 did not show any changes in the activity of Pparα, which is not surprising since at this stage of liver development the liver bud generates mainly hematopoietic cells and precursors. At later stages we can expect that some hepatic precursors appear and at 19.5 there is a mixed population of cells in the liver: one compartment is the undifferentiated hepatoblasts and the other is the newly formed hepatocytes. Since the deletion of Pparα is constitutive, it would be important to show if either the changes seen at E19.5 are stemming from the pluripotent hepatoblasts compartment or from the hepatocytes. The same is observed in the newly born population. This is a key point to be addressed since it could change the main story. It is expected that hepatoblasts will show an aerobic glycolytic metabolic profile, as seen in many other stem cell-like population; but it would be important to address what happens to hepatocytes before birth?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. Since there is a heterogeneous population of undifferentiated hepatoblasts and differentiated hepatocytes in the liver at E19.5, we determined whether hepatoblasts and/or hepatocytes were responsible for the observed changes in mRNA expression. Using antibodies against hepatoblast- and hepatocyte-specific marker (i.e., DLK and CK18, respectively), we performed flow cytometric analyses on the cells extracted from <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers at E19.5. Upon cell sorting, we specifically recovered the DLK<sup>+</sup> and CK18<sup>+</sup> fractions. We showed that PPARα deficiency only led to marginal changes in the abundance of these two hepatic cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, we determined the mRNA expression of <italic>GR, PPARα</italic> and PPARα target genes in these cells. Our results indicated that both <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> hepatoblasts and hepatocytes similarly contributed to the expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Notably, we observed a modest but not significant upward trend in the expression of oxidative genes (e.g., <italic>Acox1, Acaa2, Acadl</italic>, and <italic>Acadvl</italic>) and a downward trend in the expression of glycolytic genes (e.g., <italic>Gck</italic> and <italic>Hk1</italic>) in the <italic>Ppara</italic><sup>+/+</sup> hepatocytes compared to hepatoblasts, thereby suggestive of a more pronounced oxidative program in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, the expression of these genes was concomitantly down-regulated in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hepatoblasts and hepatocytes, thereby highlighting the pivotal role of PPARα in glycolytic and oxidative metabolism in both cell types. We have reported this new data in the Results (subsection “PPARα Controls the Prenatal Lipid Catabolic Machinery”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) In the Ppara<sup>-/-</sup>mice there are many changes but the most relevant one is related to the number of mitochondria. How can it be excluded that all the changes in FAO and gluconeogenesis observed are not cellular-autonomous metabolic adaptation as a result of the lower number of mitochondria instead of epigenetic regulation? Is the mitochondrial potential maintained in these mitochondria? What is the redox status of the mitochondria and the cytoplasm? Can it be excluded that the induction of β-Hydroxybutyrate is not due to mitochondrial defects?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. Firstly, many of the PPARα regulated genes involved in FAO have previously been shown to contain PPRE in their promoter region and hence, recognized as direct PPARα target genes (Rakhshandehroo et al., 2010) (PMID: 20936127). This implicates that the reduced oxidative capacity observed in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was due to the lack of direct PPARα-mediated stimulatory effects rather than cellular-autonomous metabolic adaptation in response to lower mitochondria numbers.</p><p>Hepatic FAO has previously been shown to increase the gluconeogenic flux by providing acetyl-CoA and NADH which are both necessary for gluconeogenesis (Ferré et al., 1979) (PMID: 508300). This notion is in line with the observation of hypoglycemia in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> pups at P1 (Cotter et al., 2014) (PMID: 24865983). However, we observed normoglycemia in these pups beyond P2. We subsequently delineated that a cell-autonomous adaptation enhanced in the absence of PPARα and mediated through up-regulation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and anaplerotic oxidation of amino acid oxidation (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>) was in place to maintain glucose homeostasis so as to sustain normal postnatal growth in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neonates. Thus, glucose became the primarily source of energy in these mice since they exhibited defective hepatic FAO and ketogenesis. In parallel, we also observed an augmented expression of pyruvate carboxylase (<italic>Pcx)</italic> and other gluconeogenic genes in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This compensatory effect likely corresponds with a lower hepatic acetyl-CoA level, as supported by a recent report that the hepatic acetyl-CoA acts as an allosteric regulator of Pcx (Perry et al., 2015) (PMID: 25662011). We have discussed this information in the Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p><p>We have also measured mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm) and intracellular ROS production levels, which are two common parameters used in assessing mitochondria health and functions (Suski et al., 2012) (PMID: 22057568). Interestingly, we observed a much lower mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm) and a markedly increased intracellular ROS level in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hepatocytes at P2, indicative of mitochondria dysfunction at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). However, there was no discernible difference in ∆Ψm between <italic>Pparα</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hepatocytes at E19.5 despite that a slight increase in the intracellular ROS level was observed in the latter. These findings suggest that an increased ROS level in cells likely precedes the loss of ∆Ψm and mitochondria dysfunction. This is consistent with a previous report of a similar mitochondrial disorder associated with the dysfunctions of the respiratory chain components (Lebiedzinska et al., 2010) (PMID: 20226758). Particularly, the increased intracellular ROS levels observed in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hepatocytes may be due to the reduced clearance of ROS as evidenced by the down-regulated of genes coding for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and copper chaperone for SOD1 before and/or after birth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Particularly, the increased intracellular ROS levels observed in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hepatocytes may be due to the reduced clearance of ROS as evidenced by the down-regulated of genes coding for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and copper chaperone for SOD1 before and/or after birth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). This observation is consistent with the report that PPARα activation by agonist clofibrate stimulates SOD1 and catalase activities as part of the defence mechanism against oxidative stress in the heart (Ibarra-Lara et al., 2016). We have reported and discussed the new data in the Results (subsection “PPARα Controls the Prenatal Lipid Catabolic Machinery”, last paragraph) and Discussion (third paragraph), respectively.</p><p>Lastly, the observed reduction in the serum β-hydroxybutyrate in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neonates is likely due to defective mitochondrial FAO, which provides the co-factors (e.g., acetyl-CoA and NADH) required for ketogenesis. We have discussed about this point in the Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Related to the previous question, the authors claim that ALT could be activated to replenish the TCA cycle in the absence of Pparα. This is very interesting, but not backed up by solid data. The ALT activity is mainly cytoplasmic because the liver expresses mainly the cytoplasmic isoform of Gpt (ALT). Therefore, if the reactions occur in the cytoplasm, it is expected to be accompanied by changes in the mitochondrial potential. This would need to be shown. In some cases, the change in the pyruvate flux to alanine will affect amino acid metabolism. Were any changes in the expression of genes from amino acid metabolism detected in the microarray data? In addition, is there a reason that ALT would be more active?</italic></p><p>In agreement with this interesting point raised by the reviewer, most of genes coding for the rate-limiting enzymes involved in amino acid oxidation were concomitantly up-regulated in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> liver at P2 (except for valine, leucine, and isoleucine). Up-regulation of these genes provides some of the substrates in TCA cycle, such as α-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and oxaloacetate, which are ultimately used for gluconeogenesis. We have now incorporated this important information in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>. We have also included the gene name of the rate-limiting enzymes involved in the pathways indicated in the figure legend. Thus far, we couldn’t explain the increased <italic>ALT</italic> expression in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> liver except that it involved a pathway up-regulated in the absence of PPARα to compensate for the defective FAO and hypoglycemia. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>ALT2</italic> has previously been shown to be up-regulated under metabolic stress (Salgado et al., 2014, PMID: 24418603). Furthermore, plasma and tissue ALT levels are elevated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Josekutty et al., 2013) (PMID: 23532846). Interestingly, defective PPARα signaling has been reported to cause hepatic mitochondrial and ER stress in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis through reduced mRNA expression of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) (Su et al., 2014) (PMID: 24735884). Our microarray data revealed a consistent reduction by ~1.2-fold in the expression of <italic>Atp2a2</italic>, which encodes for SERCA, in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> liver at E19.5 and P2, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). We have incorporated this information in the Results (subsection “PPARα Is Required for Protection against Neonatal Hepatic Steatosis”, last paragraph) and in the Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) For the ChIP-seq data, the authors should show that the antibody against GR does not pull down anything in the GR<sup>-/-</sup> livers.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of this important control. Due to logistic limitation, we were unable to acquire <italic>GR<sup>-/-</sup></italic>livers to meet the timeline for resubmission. Nonetheless, we have performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of GR in primary hepatocytes extracted from E17 <italic>Pparα<sup>+/+</sup></italic>livers. Upon treatment with GR-targeting siRNA, the occupancy of GR at the -1007 to -993 GRE was significantly decreased as compared to treatment with non-targeting siRNA, thereby indicating the specificity of GR binding to this GRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We have reported this new data in Results (subsection “GR Controls PPARα Expression in the Late Fetus”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>5) The paper is written in a complicated fashion, which makes understanding of the most important points tedious. The authors should be encouraged to simplify their writing.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have reconstructed the manuscript to streamline the story and simplified our writing to enhance accessibility to a broader readership. We believe that the revised manuscript has now been improved to achieve these aims.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The mice used are classical PPARα k.o. mice. How specific are the effects foundfor the liver (in particular in vivo) as the PPARα is expressed in many organs(including the gut) and this could influence the outcome?</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point. PPARα is expressed in many organs including the intestine which is highly challenged in the perinatal life. To further support our findings, we have performed Oil-Red-O staining and histological examination on the livers of hepatocyte-specific <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<italic>Ppara<sup>fl/fl</sup>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>) and their wild-type littermates (<italic>Ppara<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). We demonstrated that <italic>Pparα<sup>hep</sup></italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited liver steatosis at P3. Hence, we conclude that the phenotypes observed in our model is most likely due to the effects specifically observed in the hepatocytes. This information has been included in the Results (subsection “PPARα Is Required for Protection against Neonatal Hepatic Steatosis”, second paragraph)</p><p><italic>2) The hepatic steatosis in Ppara<sup>-/-</sup>is caused by? The dietary fat or more related to the carb part of the diet leading to de novo lipogenesis that is also under control of PPARα, I thought (references are not mentioned describing the role in regulating 'new' fat metabolism). Translated to the human situation early breastmilk has a rather low fat content and as a baby breastfeeds, the fat content very gradually increases, with the milk becoming fattier and fattier over time. So in the beginning is largely a sweet high lactose/carb feed; how does this relate to this study?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting these important points. In our opinion, it is the deficiency in metabolising the dietary fat that contributes to this steatotic phenotype in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers because in the early days of life mouse milk is abundant in lipids and insulin level is low while glucagon is high, which promotes FAO rather than de novo synthesis of FA (Girard et al., 1977) (doi: 10.1007/978-1-4612-6366-1_36). As discovered by Semenkovich and co-workers (Chakravarthy et al., 2005, Chakravarthy et al., 2009) (PMID:16054078, 19646743), new FA synthesized by fatty acid synthase regulates glucose, lipid, and cholesterol metabolism by serving as endogenous activators of distinct physiological pools of PPARα in adult liver. However, we doubt that de novo synthesis of FA plays a predominant role in the regulation of PPARα activity during early postnatal period since insulin/glucagon ratio is low.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that early human breast milk has a rather relatively low fat content (3%-5%) and a relatively high content of lactose/carbohydrate (6.9%-7.2%). As described by Jenness (1979) (PMID: 392766), fat content does not vary much during lactation but exhibits large diurnal variations and increases during the course of each nursing. Therefore, the human breast milk may be classified as not ketogenic. However, both newborn humans and mouse pups are in ketogenic conditions, in which similar plasma concentrations of ketone body were detected in both species (0.2-0.5 mmol/L) (Hamosh, 2004) (doi:10.1016/B978-0-7216-9654-6.50032-1). This neonatal ketogenic condition could be due to a low plasma insulin/glucagon ratio at this stage of life. Furthermore, many scientists are more inclined towards the notion that lactose and oligosaccharides−two of the main carbohydrates present in the milk, are not used as general fuel, but preferentially to support the growth of the brain and myelin synthesis as well as to provide nutrients for the newly established gut microbiota of infants (Edmond, 1992; Chichlowski et al., 2011) (PMID: 1295662, 22129386). Indeed, many believe that the reason for such a ketogenic environment in human infants is crucial to preserve carbohydrates for the development of the brain (Klepper et al., 2002) (PMID: 12555938). Therefore, oxidative metabolism of lipids represents a preferred fuel for the newborns. We have tried to clarify and discussed this important information in the Discussion (sixth paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Related to this the HF diets used for the challenge are quite extreme, ketogenic diets, why this is needed as I guess this is not the same in the human situation? I do not see the full relevance for this challenge? To induce FGF21? Is FGF21 functional for early nutrition related metabolic regulation or more related to starvation/low calorie periods of the baby (where β-hydroxybutyrate also goes up?), so is it ketogenesis because of ketogenic diets or fasting-related metabolic states? I am not really convinced of the diets used here to mimic (human) milk. Human milk is clearly not a ketogenic diet. So I question the regulation of FGF21 because of the milk.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing to our attention this lack of clarity. Relating to the previous comment, the purpose of the high-fat diet (HFD) challenge we performed in this experiment was to test whether the change in food composition that occurs at weaning is responsible for the reduction in the fatty liver phenotype as observed in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> pups after P5-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Indeed, many other changes occur at weaning, including changes in the insulin/glucagon ratio (Girard et al., 1977). The high-fat diet (HFD) experiment indicates that the lipid content of the milk primarily contributes to the development of liver steatosis in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> pups. Our findings suggest that the concomitant presence of mitochondrial dysfunction (cum defective oxidative capacity) and dietary fat synergistically contribute to the development of liver steatosis in <italic>Ppara<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neonates. As discussed in our response to comment #2, both newborn humans and mouse pups are in ketogenic condition (Medina and Tabernero, 2005) (PMID: 15573408). We believe that the high circulating levels of ketone bodies (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate) in neonates are due to the use of lipids as the preferred fuel to support the energy demand for growth. This in turn induces FGF21 through HDAC3 inhibition by ketone bodies. We believe that the induction of FGF21 in neonates after milk suckling relates more to metabolic regulation rather than a response to starvation/low calorie condition which should no longer exist upon milk ingestion. This notion is substantiated by the stimulatory effects of FGF21 on hepatic FAO and energy expenditure to prevent hepatic steatosis following milk ingestion (Xu et al., 2009) (PMID: PMC2606881). We have clarified this point in the Results (subsection “PPARα Is Required for Protection against Neonatal Hepatic Steatosis”, second paragraph). We have also discussed this important point in the Discussion (sixth paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) The composition is not precisely mentioned e.g. no lactose or sucrose in the diet?). On the other hand, using chow is not ideal as it will prevent the exact reproducibility of this study because of the natural/variable ingredients of the chow.</italic> </p><p>We have provided the formulation for all the diets used in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">5</xref>). We used an internationally recognised formulation, AIN93M, which specifies the total energy derived from carbohydrate, fat, and protein to be 76%, 9%, and 15%, respectively. Although the ingredients used for each chow diet may vary to suit locally available raw materials, the formulation and the% total energy guideline should allow reproducibility of this study.</p><p><italic>In summary, I am not so convinced yet that the main finding of this paper (epigenetic regulation of FGF21, which has been partly described before, and partly attributed to SIRT1/3) is really related to the HF diet challenge but it could be also alternatively explained as it might contribute in the difficult periods of low-/no-food /starvation when bHB is providing fuel for the brain to optimize glucose transport by other organs to prevent hypoglycemia etc.?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important point. We have discussed the work by Marrero and co-workers (Vilà-Brau et al., 2011) (PMID: 2150232) in which they show that FGF21 is specifically induced by HMGCS2 activity and that the oxidized form of ketone bodies (acetoacetate) could also induce FGF21, possibly via a SIRT1-dependent mechanism.However, as discussed in comments #2 and #3, the induction of FGF21 is likely linked to the ketogenic condition in neonates. It is unclear why neonates exhibit higher circulating levels of ketone bodies. We believe that it could be associated with the use of lipids as preferred fuel for growth while the carbohydrate parts of milk contribute to brain growth and gut microbiota nourishment. Further, the ketogenic condition may also be explained by the low insulin/glucagon ratio in early postpartum life. Regardless, it is clear that ketone bodies act as a hit that is important to prime PPARα-dependent expression of <italic>Fgf21</italic> by modulating HDAC3 activity on <italic>Fgf21</italic> promoter. As suggested by the reviewer, we have tried to further discuss and clarify this important information in the Discussion (fifth and sixth paragraphs).</p></body></sub-article></article>
