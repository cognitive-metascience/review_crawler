However, it is currently unclear whether these abnormalities reflect defective splicing of specific pre-mRNAs or a direct role of the SFs in mitosis. Here, we show that two highly conserved SFs, Sf3A2 and Prp31, are required for chromosome segregation in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells. Injections of anti-Sf3A2 and anti-Prp31 antibodies into <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos disrupt mitotic division within 1 min, arguing strongly against a splicing-related mitotic function of these factors. We demonstrate that both SFs bind spindle microtubules (MTs) and the Ndc80 complex, which in Sf3A2- and Prp31-depleted cells is not tightly associated with the kinetochores; in HeLa cells the Ndc80/HEC1-SF interaction is restricted to the M phase.

Although many studies attributed the observed mitotic phenotypes to defective splicing of specific pre-mRNAs required for cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burns et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maslon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pacheco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Lelij et al., 2014</xref>), other studies pointed to a direct role of the SFs in mitotic division after the breakdown of the nuclear envelope (‘open mitosis’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hofmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hofmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montembault et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>An example of a splicing defect leading to an aberrant mitotic phenotype is provided by the analysis of mutations in the <italic>S. cerevisiae CEF1</italic> gene, which encodes a conserved SF. In <italic>CEF1</italic> mutants, the failure to remove the single intron of the α-tubulin gene results in reduction of the tubulin level, disrupting mitotic spindle assembly. However, cells containing an engineered intronless α-tubulin gene were resistant to mutations in <italic>CEF1</italic>, indicating that the splicing defect is responsible for the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burns et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, RNAi-mediated depletion of SFs such as SNW1, PRPF8, MFAP1, NHP2L1, SART1 and CDC5L causes loss of sister chromatid cohesion and correlates with defective pre-mRNA splicing of sororin, a factor required for association of cohesin with DNA. Here again, the expression of an intronless version of sororin partially rescued the mitotic phenotype elicited by loss of the SFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Lelij et al., 2014</xref>). An indirect role of SFs in mitotic division is also suggested by studies on the hU2F35 and SRSF1 factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maslon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pacheco et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>However, there are also studies that point to a direct mitotic role of SFs in open mitosis. Depletion of the Prp19 splicing complex from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts results in defective spindle assembly and impaired microtubule-kinetochore interaction. Because in this system neither transcription nor translation of any message, except Cyclin B, is required for spindle assembly, it has been suggested that Prp19 plays a role in spindle formation that is independent of mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hofmann et al., 2013</xref>). Another protein involved in mRNA splicing with a direct mitotic role is PRP4, a kinetochore-associated kinase that mediates recruitment of spindle checkpoint (SAC) proteins at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montembault et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, it has been recently shown that <italic>Xenopus</italic> SFs interact with kinetochore-associated non-coding RNAs, and are required for recruitment of Cenp-C and Ndc80 at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grenfell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grenfell et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it appears that some SFs are required for the splicing of specific mitotic pre-mRNAs, while others directly participate in the mitotic process. The latter possibility is consistent with the fact that transcription and splicing are suppressed during cell division, allowing SFs to perform direct mitotic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hofmann et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that the Sf3A2 and Prp31 SFs play direct mitotic functions in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human open mitosis. We show that depletion of these SFs affects spindle formation and disrupts chromosome segregation. We also show that antibody-based inhibition of <italic>Sf3A2</italic> or <italic>Prp31</italic> in fly embryos results in a strong and highly specific mitotic phenotype, which manifests less than 1 min following the injection, arguing against an indirect mitotic role of these SFs. Consistent with these results, Sf3A2 and Prp31 bind microtubules (MTs) and the Ndc80 complex that mediates kinetochore-MT attachment. Collectively, our results indicate that Sf3A2 and Prp31 regulate interactions among kinetochores, spindle MTs and the Ndc80 complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Sf3A2</italic> and <italic>Prp31</italic> are required for mitotic chromosome segregation <italic>in Drosophila</italic></title><p>We have previously observed that RNAi against the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologues of <italic>SF3A2</italic> (<italic>CG10754</italic>; henceforth designated <italic>Sf3A2</italic>) and <italic>PRPF31</italic> (<italic>CG6876;</italic> henceforth <italic>Prp31</italic>) results in abnormal chromosome congression and segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Somma et al., 2008</xref>).

To check for RNAi efficiency by western blotting, we raised and affinity-purified two specific antibodies against Sf3A2 and Prp31; western blotting of cell extracts demonstrated that these antibodies specifically recognize bands of the expected molecular weights (33 and 65 kDa, respectively), and that these bands are strongly reduced after RNAi against the corresponding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We have previously observed frequent PMLES (formerly called <italic>p</italic>seudo-<italic>a</italic>na-<italic>t</italic>elophases, abbreviated as PATs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Somma et al., 2008</xref>) in S2 cells depleted of the centromere-specific histone H3 Cid/Cenp-A or the kinetochore components Ndc80, Nuf2 and Kmn1/Nsl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Renda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Somma et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that PMLES are a consequence of a defective kinetochore-MT interaction in S2 cells. dsRNAs targeting the 5' UTR of <italic>Sf3A2</italic> or the 3' UTR of <italic>Prp31</italic> produced the same mitotic phenotypes as the dsRNAs directed to the coding sequences; these phenotypes were rescued by expression of RNAi resistant genes (<italic>Sf3A2-RFP</italic> and <italic>Prp31-GFP</italic>) lacking the UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), ruling out the possibility of RNAi off-target effects.</p><p>We next performed RNAi against <italic>Sf3A2</italic> or <italic>Prp31</italic> in S2 cells expressing histone-GFP and tubulin-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goshima et al., 2007</xref>) and examined mitosis in living cells.

However, following RNAi against the SF-coding genes both metaphases and PMLES displayed high Cyclin B levels. In addition, anaphases were infrequent, suggesting that the SAC remains engaged. Further, most prometaphases/metaphases and all PMLES displayed clear accumulations of checkpoint proteins at their kinetochores (BubR1 and Zw10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Somma et al., 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> below).

If not otherwise specified, imaging started no more than 30 s after injection. We analyzed mitosis in 10 embryos injected with the anti-Sf3A2 antibody and in 10 embryos injected with the anti-Prp31 antibody. Embryos were injected in (i) interphase; in many cases, shortly before nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) that occurs in early prometaphase, as suggested by the fact that they were in late prophase/early prometaphase at beginning of filming, (ii) during early prometaphase (showing full chromosome condensation by the beginning of filming) or (iii) during late telophase and then monitored throughout the following cell cycle. An additional five embryos were injected with buffer alone before NEB to serve as mock controls. We carefully compared mitotic progression in these different injection conditions to ascertain the nature of specific phenotypes and their temporal manifestation.</p><p>In movies starting just before NEB, the time elapsing from NEB to initial chromosome alignment was similar between control-injected and α-Sf3A2- or α-Prp31-injected embryos. However, the length of metaphase was significantly increased in embryos treated with the anti-SF antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>). In addition, in both α-Sf3A2- and α-Prp31-injected embryos, spindles did not increase to mature metaphase spindle length, as occurred with controls, but remained ‘stunted’. This decrease in spindle length relative to controls became significant at 64 s following NEB and remained significant until anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>), such that, 20 s prior to anaphase onset, the spindles of anti-SF injected embryos were approximately 30% shorter than those of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and D</xref>). Our qualitative observations also suggested that the chromosomes of α-Sf3A2- and α-Prp31-injected embryos were less aligned than in controls throughout the extended metaphase period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>). To test this, we measured the area encompassed by the chromosomes during the last 80 s (20 frames) that precede anaphase in anti-SF injected embryos. The chromosomes were indeed less tightly aligned than in their mock-injected counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Finally, the most striking defect in anti-SF injected embryos was a complete failure in chromosome segregation during anaphase, such that chromosomes decondensed and coalesced in a single indistinct mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref> show a specific example of an embryo injected with anti-Prp31antibodies.

However, when these embryos entered mitosis they displayed the same defects seen in embryos injected just before or during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further, embryos which were in metaphase immediately following injection with α-Sf3A2 or α-Prp31 antibodies manifested the same phenotype as those injected during interphase – with short spindles, poorly aligned chromosomes and failure in segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Videos 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">8</xref>).

Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayward et al., 2014</xref>), the embryos injected with the anti-Dgt6 antibodies showed delayed spindle formation, thinner and long spindles and arrested in a metaphase-like state. This phenotype is very different from that elicited by anti SF-antibodies, ruling out the possibility that the mitotic effects of the anti-SF antibodies are due to chemical contaminants associated with antibody purification and concentration processes.</p><p>To supplement these phenotypic observations, we determined the localization of Sf3A2 and Prp31 in living embryos. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, mitosis is semi-open; the spindle is established through polar fenestrae formed during early prometaphase and remains surrounded by a nuclear envelope till anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harel et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kiseleva et al., 2001</xref>). We injected fluorescently labeled α-Sf3A2 or α-Prp31 antibodies into live syncytial embryos and filmed their behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Both antibodies were virtually excluded from interphase and prophase nuclei. However, as soon as the nuclear envelope became fenestrated and the spindle was formed, the antibodies quickly penetrated into the nuclear space and remained there until anaphase; they then became dispersed in the cytoplasm and failed to concentrate in telophase nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results strongly suggest that during interphase the antibodies cannot disrupt the splicing process that occurs within the nucleus. Additionally, even if the antibodies are injected one minute before nuclear fenestration, they can act on kinetochores/microtubules only after their entry into the nucleus at prometaphase. Thus, given that splicing does not occur during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hofmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin and Manley, 2002</xref>), our embryo injection experiments make highly unlikely an indirect, splicing-dependent mitotic effect of Sf3A3 and Prp31 inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Sf3A2 and Prp31 associate with the spindle MTs</title><p>To determine the localization of Sf3A2 and Prp31 during mitosis we co-stained S2 cells with anti-tubulin antibodies and antibodies to the individual SFs.

In contrast, RNAse-treated metaphases displayed a normal spindle staining with anti-Sf3A2 and anti-Prp31 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We reasoned that, if the spindle and chromosome defects observed following SF RNAi were due to lack of splicing, the levels of general or specific mitotic proteins would be reduced, in comparison to control cells. To comprehensively test this, we performed a simultaneous Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) quantitative proteomic analysis of control S2 cells, and of cells depleted of Sf3A2, Prp31 or Sf3A1, a splicing factor that does not exhibit any apparent mitotic defect upon RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This quantitative proteomic analysis identified 4483 protein IDs in control S2 cells (the full dataset can be found at www.thewakefieldlab/ms). The abundance scores for the resultant protein IDs from each of the three RNAi samples (<italic>Sf3A1</italic>, <italic>Sf3A2</italic> and <italic>Prp31</italic>) were normalised against the control sample to create an abundance ratio. The mean abundance ratio and standard deviation (SD) were calculated and proteins with abundance ratios of more than 1 SD from the mean were identified and classed as significantly reduced, in comparison to control.

Ndc80/HEC1 and Nuf2 are mutually dependent for their in vivo stability, as RNAi against either protein results in reduction of both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeLuca et al., 2003</xref>). However, the entire Nuf2 protein and very large Ndc80/HEC1 fragments are stable when expressed in bacteria in the absence of Ndc80/HEC1 and Nuf2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciferri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2009</xref>).

Reciprocal Co-IP assays showed that each splicing factor interacts in vivo with both Ndc80 and Nuf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>). These results were confirmed by GST pulldown experiments from S2 cells extracts expressing 3HA-Sf3A2 or 3HA-Prp31; we found that GST-Ndc80, GST-Nuf2 and GST-Mitch efficiently precipitate 3HA-Sf3A2 and 3HA-Prp31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We then asked whether the Co-IP results reflect direct protein-protein interactions and performed GST pulldown experiments using bacterially expressed purified proteins (6His-Sf3A2, 6His-Prp31, GST-Ndc80, GST-Nuf2 and GST-Mitch). We carried out pulldowns with glutathione-agarose beads bound to GST-Ndc80, GST-Nuf2, or GST-Mitch. Both 6His-Sf3A2 and 6His-Prp31 efficiently bound the GST-tagged components of the Ndc80 complex but not GST alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

These cells populations were both highly enriched in cells undergoing mitosis marked by the PHH3, which was not found in adherent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). Co-IP with an anti-HEC1 antibody did not detect any HEC1-SF interaction in cells shaken-off from nocodazole-containing cultures or from adherent cells. However, mitotic cells shaken off from cultures kept in fresh medium for 6 hr after nocodazole removal displayed a robust interaction between HEC1 and either SF3A2 or PRP31. These results indicate that the physical interaction between HEC1 and either SF3A2 or PRP31 is restricted to mitosis, when pre-mRNA splicing is suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hofmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin and Manley, 2002</xref>) and kinetochore proteins and SFs can come into contact following nuclear envelope breakdown. The finding that this interaction does not occur in mitotic cells with depolymerized MTs, but takes place when these cells have reassembled a spindle, further suggests that the HEC1-SF interaction requires the presence of the spindle MTs.</p><p>To further characterize HEC1 association with kinetochores after <italic>SF3A2</italic> or <italic>PRP31</italic> siRNA-mediated depletion, we fixed cells using a procedure that is thought to improve visualization of proteins associated with kinetochore MTs (fixation after pre-extraction with Triton X-100; see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roscioli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tanenbaum et al., 2006</xref>). Prometaphase and metaphase cells fixed in this way exhibit chromosome-associated MT bundles that are often bent and tangled and no longer exhibit the typical spindle-like structure. SF3A2- and PRP31-depleted cells fixed with this procedure were co-immunostained with an anti-HEC1 antibody and either an anti-tubulin or a CREST antibody that marks the kinetochores. In contrast to control cells, in which HEC1 staining was confined to kinetochores, in SF3A2- or PRP31-depleted mitotic cells, we found HEC1 associated with filaments that in many cases appear to protrude from the CREST-stained kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>); these filaments were also stained by anti-tubulin antibodies, suggesting that they are kinetochore fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). We noted a variability in this phenotype; in some cases, the bulk of HEC1 was still bound to kinetochores and only a fraction of the protein was associated with the filaments; in other cases a substantial part of HEC1 was no longer on kinetochores and was found on the tubulin filaments. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>).

In <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and brains, depletion of either SF resulted in metaphase delay, failures in chromosome segregation and frequent monopolar spindles; a mitotic phenotype that is consistent with defective k-fiber formation and/or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Somma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Toso et al., 2009</xref>). We also showed that SF depletion in S2 cells prevents SAC satisfaction, contributing to the metaphase arrest phenotype. Notably, although S2 cells depleted of either <italic>Sf3A2</italic> or <italic>Prp31</italic> are both defective in Ndc80 localization at kinetochores, their phenotypes detected in living cells were rather different from that elicited by Ndc80 depletion. Following RNAi against <italic>Sf3A2</italic> or <italic>Prp31</italic>, most cells remained arrested in metaphase for long times without showing substantial chromosome decondensation. In contrast, most <italic>Ndc80</italic> RNAi cells were delayed in a prolonged prometaphase-like state but, after many oscillations, their chromosomes decondensed as occurs during normal telophase. We believe that this phenotypic diversity depends on differences in both kinetochore function (see below) and SAC activity. The chromosome decondensation phenotype observed in Ndc80-depleted cells could reflect a partial impairment of the SAC, which is known to be attenuated in S2 cells lacking Ndc80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feijão et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, some of the Ndc80-depleted cells would proceed through the mitotic process and undergo chromosome decondensation. In <italic>Sf3A2</italic> and <italic>Prp31</italic> RNAi cells, even if Ndc80 is abnormally distributed, the SAC machinery is probably still functional but the SAC is not satisfied, leading to metaphase arrest and preventing mitotic progression and chromosome decondensation.</p><p>Injections of either α-SfA3 or α-Prp31 into <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos caused very similar mitotic defects, although these mitotic phenotypes differ from those seen in S2 or larval brain cells. Inhibition of either SF in syncytial embryos led to spindles which initially form normally, but then reduce in size, leading to short metaphase-like spindles with poorly aligned chromosomes. These spindles, however, exit mitosis after a delay, with anaphase-like MT dynamics but a catastrophic failure of chromosome segregation, followed by chromosome decondensation. These results indicate that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos Sf3A2 and Prp31 are required for proper kinetochore-MT interactions and chromosome segregation. In addition, because chromosomes of colchicine-treated or anti-Dgt6 (augmin) injected embryos arrest in metaphase for several minutes without undergoing decondensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayward et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zalokar and Erk, 1976</xref>), we further suggest that inactivation of Sf3A2 or Prp31 affects SAC function in embryos. Interestingly, a phenotype similar to that elicited by anti-Sf3A2 or anti-Prp31 antibody injection was observed in embryos homozygous for mutations in the <italic>mis12</italic> or <italic>Kmn1</italic> (formerly <italic>Nsl1</italic>) genes that encode kinetochore components whose loss partially impairs the SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Venkei et al., 2011</xref>). It is also possible that premature chromosome decondensation in early anaphase of αSf3A2 and αPrp31 injected embryos is a consequence of their delayed progression through metaphase. Finally, the phenotypic differences between embryonic and S2 cells observed after Sf3A2 or Prp31 inhibition might reflect differences in the SAC mechanisms operating in the two cell types, as has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blower et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Venkei et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sf3A2 and Prp31 play direct mitotic roles conserved from flies to humans</title><p>Our findings on <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells strongly suggest that Sf3A2 and Prp31 play direct mitotic roles independent of their roles in pre-mRNA splicing. Our analyses on S2 cells have produced several results that support this conclusion. First, we have shown that Sf3A2 or Prp31 deficiency produces strong mitotic effects that are not elicited by depletion of other factors with which they form splicing subcomplexes, a finding that suggests the Sf3A2 and Prp31 have specific and possibly direct mitotic roles. Second, our proteome-wide analysis of S2 cells showed that RNAi against <italic>Sf3A2</italic> or <italic>Prp31</italic> causes a significant reduction in only a small proportion of the proteome. Of these proteins, all except one (HUS1-like) are also reduced in Sf3A1 RNAi-treated cells that do not exhibit any mitotic phenotype. As HUS1-like is involved in homologous recombination during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peretz et al., 2009</xref>), it is highly unlikely that its depletion results in the mitotic defects observed in <italic>Sf3A2-</italic> or <italic>Prp31-</italic>depleted cells. Third, we have shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sf3A2 and Prp31 physically interact with both the MTs and the components of the Ndc80 complex, an additional feature suggesting a direct participation of these factors in the mitotic process.</p><p>Further strong evidence for a direct mitotic role of Sf3A2 and Prp31 is also provided by the results of our embryo injection experiments. The mitotic phenotype observed in α-Sf3A2- and α-Prp31-injected embryos is quite specific and was not previously observed after injection of antibodies against several different proteins enriched in chromatin and/or the mitotic apparatus, such as Skeletor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walker et al., 2000</xref>), Cid/Cenp-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blower and Karpen, 2001</xref>), mitotic motors (cytoplasmic dynein, Klp61F or Ncd) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sharp et al., 2000</xref>), Eb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>), and the Akt kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buttrick et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the mitotic defects observed in embryos appear to be the consequence of loss of a specific mitotic function rather than the result of a general disturbance in embryo development.</p><p>Early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos undergo 13 extremely rapid nuclear divisions within a syncytium. These divisions predominantly rely on already spliced mRNA molecules that are packaged into the egg by the mother, although a minor wave of transcription has been reported during cycles 8–13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). Although it could be argued that Sf3A2 and Prp31 function in the syncytium in splicing this small number of transcripts, three pieces of evidence refute this. First, the genes that are expressed early in embryogenesis are small and generally lack introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Renzis et al., 2007</xref>). Second, the few early transcripts with introns require the Fandango/Xab2 subunit of the NCT/Prp19 complex for splicing. However, <italic>fandango</italic> mutants exhibit normal syncytial mitoses and show abnormal nuclear shaping only upon cellularization, during the 14th cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guilgur et al., 2014</xref>). Third, the mitotic phenotypes seen upon α-Sf3A2 or α-Prp31 injection occur less than 1 min following injection. In addition, the bulk of the injected antibody penetrates into the nucleus only when it becomes fenestrated at early prometaphase. Thus, injected antibodies can bind and inhibit the SFs only when dividing embryonic nuclei are in prometaphase. To postulate that the mitotic defect observed in injected embryos is not a direct effect of the SF inhibition but is instead a consequence of failed pre-mRNA processing one has to make three highly unlikely assumptions: (i) that mRNA splicing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos occurs during mitosis when transcription and splicing are usually suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hofmann et al., 2010</xref>), (ii) that splicing and translation of a hypothetical mitotic pre-mRNA, and the folding and activation of its downstream protein all takes less than 60 s, a time interval that does not appear to be sufficient for these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beyer and Osheim, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huranová et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Khodor et al., 2011</xref>), and (iii) that the mitotic protein whose mRNA splicing is acutely inhibited by antibody injection has an extremely rapid turnover and needs to be continuously replenished throughout cycles 10–13.</p><p>Our conclusion that Sf3A2 and Prp31 have direct mitotic functions is strongly supported by our results in human cells. Indeed, we have shown that HeLa cells depleted of SF3A2 or PRP31 exhibit mitotic phenotypes similar to those observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and larval brains. In addition, HEC1/Ndc80 physically interacts with SF3A2 and PRP31 also in HeLa cells, and the HEC1-SF interaction is restricted to the M phase and is MT-dependent. These results strongly suggest that the functions and behavior of Sf3A2 and Prp31 are evolutionarily conserved. These findings strengthen our view that these SFs play direct mitotic roles, and also suggest that these roles are ancient and might therefore be common to many organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>What are the direct mitotic roles Sf3A2 and Prp31?</title><p>Although our data indicate that Sf3A2/SF3A2 and Prp31/PRP31 have direct mitotic functions, these functions are not well defined.

However, when these SF-depleted cells were treated with colchicine or nocodazole, they displayed normal amounts of kinetochore-associated Ndc80/HEC1.</p><p>In SF-depleted HeLa cells fixed after pre-extraction with Triton X-100, HEC1 was partially diffused along the remnants of the k-fibers. A similar HEC1 diffusion along MTs was not observed in control cells. We note that we were not able to obtain a similar result in <italic>Drosophila</italic> because the pre-extraction procedure used for HeLa cells disrupts the morphology of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitotic cells. The Ndc80 complex interacts with the spindle MTs mainly through its Ndc80/HEC1 subunit and constitutes the major kinetochore-MT binding interface (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeLuca and Musacchio, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Varma and Salmon, 2012</xref>). The complex forms discrete oligomeric linear arrays along the kinetochore MTs. These arrays have the ability to diffuse along the MTs and are thought to have a stabilizing effect on kinetochore MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alushin et al., 2010</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest a model for the mitotic role of SF3A2 and PRP31. We propose that these SFs interact with Ndc80/HEC1 on the k-fibers, regulating the association of the Ndc80 complex with the kinetochore. In the absence of the SFs, the Ndc80/HEC1 complex would associate with the kinetochores, or the kinetochore-MT interfaces, in an abnormal fashion, so that the binding of the complex to the kinetochore would be weakened and the SAC satisfaction prevented. As a result, when the kinetochores are attached to MTs, Ndc80/HEC1 would diffuse away from the kinetochores possibly along the kinetochore fibers. However, although the most straightforward interpretation of our observations on Triton X pre-extracted cells is that HEC1 spreads out along the kinetochore MTs, we cannot exclude the possibility that the association of HEC1 with the spindle MTs depends on the fixation technique. It is indeed possible that HEC1 dissociates from the kinetochores and then binds the MTs that resisted the pre-extraction/fixation procedure. Intriguingly, several features of the SF-Ndc80/HEC1-MT interactions are reminiscent of those described for the mammalian Ska complex, which is required for proper kinetochore- MT-attachment and SAC satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auckland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanisch et al., 2006</xref>). The Ska complex directly interact with the Ndc80 complex and with microtubules and this interaction is required for Ska localization at the kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helgeson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janczyk et al., 2017</xref>). The main difference between the Ska and the SF behavior is that Ska accumulates at kinetochores while the SFs do not appear to have this ability.</p><p>Recent work using <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts has shown that inhibition of RNA splicing leads to the accumulation of unprocessed centromeric noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) accompanied by decreased recruitment of centromere/kinetochore proteins such as CENP-A, CENP-C and NDC80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grenfell et al., 2016</xref>). However, the persistence of these centromere-associated RNAs does not appear to be required for normal kinetochore assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grenfell et al., 2017</xref>). It has been instead suggested that a transient association of RNAs with the centromere stabilizes CENP-C and contributes to the recruitment of SFs, which could play important regulatory roles at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grenfell et al., 2017</xref>). It has been also shown that non-coding transcripts from the 359 bp <italic>Drosophila</italic> satellite DNA localize to the centromeric regions of the chromosomes and are required for the correct localization of the fly homologues of CENP-A (Cid) and CENP-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rošić et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, recent results strongly suggest that transcription occurs at S2 cell centromeres and it is necessary for Cid incorporation into centromeric chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bobkov et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings are compatible with the studies on <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts and <italic>Drosophila</italic> and do not exclude that Sf3A2 and Prp31 could transiently interact with centromere/kinetochore-non coding associated RNAs. We have shown that these SFs bind both MTs and the Ndc80 complex, two events that could facilitate their interaction with centromeric RNAs.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that Sf3A2 and Prp31 and their human orthologues are required for mitotic division. Our data argue strongly against the possibility that the mitotic defects caused by Sf3A2 or Prp31 inhibition are the consequence of a failure to splice protein-coding mRNAs. We therefore propose that Sf3A2 or Prp31 play a direct and evolutionarily conserved role in open mitosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and RNA interference</title><p>S2 cells (DGRC, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_Z232">CVCL_Z232</ext-link>; tested negative for mycoplasma) were cultured at 25°C in Schneider’s insect medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco).

To perform GST pulldown with bacterially expressed and purified proteins, full length <italic>Sf3A2</italic> and <italic>Prp31</italic> sequences fused in frame with −6His at N-term were cloned in pET200 and then expressed in the BL21 (DE3) strain. Exponentially growing cells were induced at 37°C for 4 hr by the addition of 1 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested, resuspended and incubated for 1 hr in lysis buffer (400 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM imidazole, 50 mM Phosphate buffer pH 7.8, 0.2% lysozime, Complete protease inhibitors Roche). Lysates were then sonicated for 20 s, incubated for 30 min with 1.5% N-Lauryl Sarcosyl, and centrifuged for 25 min at 15,000 g at 4°C.

The mixture was then centrifuged at 100,000 g at RT for 40 min. Supernatants and pellets were collected and analyzed by Coomassie staining or by western blotting. The fraction of proteins bound to microtubules was plotted as a function of MT concentration.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank David Glover, Mike Goldberg, Gohta Goshima, Gary Karpen, Christian Lehner and Stefano Sechi for their generous gifts of antibodies and cell lines, and Giuseppe Bosso for the GST-tagged telomere proteins.

Several splicing factors have previously been implicated in mitosis, notoriously after RNAi perturbation, which could argue against a direct role. In the present paper, the authors report similar findings after RNAi-mediated depletion of the Sf3A2 and Prp31 (and respective orthologues) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells in culture, larval neuroblasts and human HeLa cells. They go further do demonstrate that antibody injections in <italic>Drosophila</italic> syncytial embryos cause problems in mitosis within approximately 1 minute after injection, arguing for a specific role in mitosis. The phenotypes in the three different <italic>Drosophila</italic> models are nevertheless quite distinct. Phenotypes after RNAi in HeLa cells are more related with those observed in S2 cells. The authors provide compelling evidence that Sf3A2 and Prp31 bind to each other and to Ndc80, likely in a direct fashion. Sf3A2 and Prp31 also appear to associate with microtubules and localize in the spindle region during mitosis (both in S2 and HeLa cells). Sf3A2 and Prp31 appear to be required for normal recruitment of Ndc80 to kinetochores also in both systems. Overall, the authors provide a strong case for a direct role of Sf3A2 and Prp31 in regulating Ndc80 recruitment to kinetochores during mitosis. There are however some major concerns that would merit some attention by the authors. This is particularly important because this field is quite murky and any major claim for a splicing-unrelated role of splicing factors in mitosis must be bullet proof.</p><p>1) The authors focused their functional analysis of Sf3A2 and Prp31 on the impact over Ndc80. The main problem here is that one cannot be sure what else is being affected, especially given some phenotypic differences between Ndc80 and Sf3A2 and Prp31. The authors made an effort to look at the localization of other kinetochore components, but this falls short to draw any definitive conclusion. A quantitative proteomic analysis would be ideal here comparing controls with Sf3A2 and Prp31 RNAis, but this would require a significant additional effort. Could the authors show at least a Silver-stained gel comparing total protein amounts between controls and Sf3A2 and Prp31 RNAis? If major differences are found, would be important to identify which proteins are affected (by mass-spec, but now against specific proteins).</p><p>2) Along the same line, but now focusing on Ndc80, could the expression of an Ndc80 cDNA (which is already spliced) rescue at least part (the PMLES) of the Sf3A2 and Prp31 phenotypes? This experiment might turn out to be informative on multiple fronts, as it will test whether the observed mitotic phenotypes after Sf3A2 and Prp31 are dependent or not on Ndc80 splicing. It will also be important to rescue the mitotic phenotypes after Sf3A2 and Prp31 RNAis, by expressing the corresponding ORFs. This can be done by targeting the 5' or 3' UTR region of the endogenous genes, making sure these are not present in the rescue constructs (see e.g. Lince-Faria et al., 2009)</p><p>3) The other matter of concern relates with the phenotypic differences between RNAis and antibody microinjections. In the latter, the main defect appears to be after congression, arguing for a kinetochore-independent role for Sf3A2 and Prp31. Overall, it is difficult to reconcile all the data to draw a strong conclusion here. It should be noted that most injections were performed in interphase nuclei, leaving open the possibility that splicing might still be affected (there are still few short transcripts that are spliced between cycles 8-13). In the same line, the total duration of interphase at these stages is around 5 minutes, and splicing events can take as short as 30 seconds (see e.g. Guilgur et al., 2014, cited by the authors). One suggestion would be to extend the few examples where embryos were injected apparently (no indication of injection time is provided) already in mitosis. An easier way might be to perform the injections in metaphase-arrested embryos by inhibiting the APC (see e.g. Oliveira et al., 2010).</p><p>4) The spindle MT localization of Sf3A2 and Prp31 is not totally convincing. Many proteins, including soluble tubulin, are known to enrich in the spindle region, simply because of molecular crowding due to a fenestrated envelope and the presence of large organelles that are excluded from the spindle region (see e.g. Schweizer et al., 2013). This turns out to be MT-independent. The authors do show one colchicine-treated cell in figure S7C, but there is no information in the Materials and methods section about this experiment, including the drug concentration used. I would suggest to provide a better characterization of Sf3A2 and Prp31 localization in mitosis after 30 minutes treatment with 100 μM Colchicine, which is sufficient to depolymerize all spindle MTs in S2 cells. Longer treatments (for 2 hours as used by the authors) will cause diffusion of &quot;spindle matrix&quot; components due to gradual disintegration of the membranous envelope that surrounds the spindle. It would also be important to provide direct localization of Sf3A2 and Prp31 in mitosis by expressing a GFP-tagged version. Similar approaches should also be conducted in human cells with micromolar doses of nocodazole.</p><p>5) The time course experiment after double thymidine block is suggestive of a specific mitotic interaction between Sf3A2, Prp31 and HEC1. However, the possibility remains that many of the cells after 8 hours release are actually in G2. This experiment should be repeated using mitotic extracts only, obtained by mitotic shake-off of cells treated with nocodazole or STLC. The kinetochore localization of HEC1 after Sf3A2 and Prp31 RNAi in HeLa cells should also be investigated in cells treated with nocodazole (to standardize the conditions) and properly quantified relative to constitutive kinetochore components (e.g. using ACA serum from CREST patients).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Pellacani et al., examines the role of splicing factors mitotic chromosome segregation. Specifically, the authors address an unresolved long-standing issue of whether the mitotic defects associated with mutants in splicing factors are an indirect consequence of a failure to properly splice factors required for mitosis or whether the splicing factors have a distinct direct role in mitosis. The studies presented here provide a comprehensive set of experiments favoring the latter. Key evidence includes inhibitory antibody injections of splicing factors that result in an immediate disruption of chromosome segregation, and localization studies demonstrating these splicing factors localize to spindle microtubules and the Ndc80. Significantly they also demonstrate that these factors are required for kinetochore localization of Ndc80.</p><p>Overall the manuscript provides a thorough and compelling set of experiments that strongly support a direct action of splicing factors on the mitotic machinery. The work is of high quality and for the most part the conclusions are well supported by the data. Once the issue below is addressed this manuscript is well suited for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>1) The authors find that their RNAi/cell and antibody/embryo experiments produce different phenotypes. One key difference between the two experiments is that the former results in knockdown of the splicing factors throughout the cell cycle while the latter only during entry into metaphase.</p><p>In addition, some of the phenotypes observed are consistent with inhibition of S-phase (see aphidicolin embryo injection movies in Fasulo et al., 2011). To determine if there are interphase effects of splicing factor disruption the authors should inject the antibody during late anaphase and film the following cycle. If S-phase is inhibited there will be a dramatic delay in interphase. In addition, there will be chromosome segregation defects similar to those they observe.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes the roles of two conserved splicing factors in mitosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans. Defective phenotypes after RNAi are well described. I may have missed something, but experiments which exclude the possibility of off-target effects appear to be missing. If these control experiments have been done, they should be clearly stated in the main text with figures. They are essential before any publication, as many wrong papers have been published in the past due to off-target effects.</p><p>The authors conclude that this mitotic role is independent of splicing function. This conclusion is based on observation of the mitotic defect within 1 minute after antibody injection. This evidence is convincing in principle, but I have a reservation on the strength of the control they used (see below). As this is a crucial experiment for this study, it is important to use a more robust control.</p><p>Apart from phenotypic analysis, some mechanistic studies have been carried out. They showed a reduction of the Ndc80 complex on kinetochores, and interaction between Ndc80 and these splicing factors, which explain the phenotype they observed. It is still not clear how these proteins promote the recruitment of the Ndc80 complex to kinetochores. I judge that this is a very good but not in-depth mechanistic study. Therefore, provided the above two experiments are done, a merit of publishing this study in <italic>eLife</italic> depends on how significant direct involvement of splicing factors in mitosis is judged to be.</p><p>Many examples of proteins with multiple unrelated roles (moonlighting) have been documented. In the old days, it was often proposed that they have crucial roles in cross-talk between two processes, but these claims have not been substantiated in most cases. I do not think that splicing factors having direct mitotic functions conceptually advance the understanding of either splicing or mitosis. Therefore, when considering the merit of this study for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, it should be treated in a similar way to the discovery of a novel conserved proteins which is important for mitosis.</p><p>1) Control experiments are required to exclude the possibility of off-target effects of RNAi in <italic>Drosophila</italic> or humans. Ideally rescue experiments should be carried out using an RNAi resistant wild-type gene.</p><p>2) Figure 3/subsection “The phenotypes elicited by Sf3A2 or Prp31 inhibition in the embryo suggest a direct mitotic role of these SFs”. Injection of buffer only was used as a control. This is acceptable in some cases, but as this is a critical experiment assessed by a sensitive assay, a further control is essential. Preparing affinity purified antibodies requires multiple chemicals which may affect cell physiology even in a trace amount upon injection into cells. Therefore, unrelated antibodies prepared in the identical way (ideally at the same time) should be used as a control. As the authors' claim for direct roles heavily relies on this particular experiment, it is critical to do this control carefully.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Splicing Factors Sf3A2 and Prp31 have direct roles in mitotic chromosome segregation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Jon Pines as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Helder Maiato (Reviewer #2); William Sullivan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Gatti et al., addresses whether the splicing factors Sf3A2 and Prp31 have direct mitotic roles, independently from splicing. In this revised manuscript the authors have made considerable efforts to address previous criticisms of their study. It seems to me that they have done pretty much as much as they can to exclude the possibility that the splicing factors are acting indirectly – their analysis of transcripts is particularly important here. The biochemical data showing interaction between these two factors with MTs and Ndc80 offer a plausible explanation for some of the observed phenotypes and suggest that mitosis is immune to potential splicing defects in the several mRNAs that are under control of Sf3A2 and Prp31.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Before publication the authors should address several inconsistencies in the data.</p><p>1) Ndc80 localization at kinetochores seems reduced after perturbation of Sf3A2 and Prp31only in the presence of MTs. Ndc80/Hec1 localization is normal without MTs (at least in HeLa cells). Thus, SFs are not required for Ndc80 recruitment but might be involved in its maintenance at KTs. Consistently, the in vivo interaction between Sf3A2 and Prp31 with Ndc80 does not seem to take place in mitotic cells in the absence of MTs, leading the authors to propose a model in which the Ndc80/Hec1-SF interaction requires the presence of spindle MTs. The problem comes from the GST pull-down experiments that clearly show that purified recombinant Ndc80 and SFs all interact, and this happens in the absence of MTs. Together with the fact that the observed mitotic phenotypes related with the perturbation of SFs (e.g. monopolar spindles) are not consistent with loss of Ndc80, leaves open an obvious gap in the model. This cannot simply be explained by differences in SAC activity among different cells/systems. These points should be addressed either by modifying the model to include caveats and alternative interpretations – notably that there may be other targets than Ndc80 – or by including experimental data to support the proposed model.</p><p>2) The immunofluorescence data remains somewhat difficult to interpret. The authors state that detergent pre-extraction before fixation improves visualization of KT proteins, but this is also known to cause artefacts. The reviewers do not see the need for such harsh conditions and are aware that conventional PFA works well to stain Hec1; even methanol fixation is preferable to pre-extraction. The authors should include data using a different staining technique that avoids pre-extraction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40325.046</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers.

As HUS1-like is involved in homologous recombination repair during meiosis (Peretz et al., 2009), it is unlikely to be the causative factor of the mitotic phenotype observed in SF-depleted S2 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Along the same line, but now focusing on Ndc80, could the expression of an Ndc80 cDNA (which is already spliced) rescue at least part (the PMLES) of the Sf3A2 and Prp31 phenotypes? This experiment might turn out to be informative on multiple fronts, as it will test whether the observed mitotic phenotypes after Sf3A2 and Prp31 are dependent or not on Ndc80 splicing. It will also be important to rescue the mitotic phenotypes after Sf3A2 and Prp31 RNAis, by expressing the corresponding ORFs. This can be done by targeting the 5' or 3' UTR region of the endogenous genes, making sure these are not present in the rescue constructs (see e.g. Lince-Faria et al., 2009)</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantitated Ndc80 in SF-depleted cells and shown that its amount is not reduced compared to mock controls (Figure 7D). Furthermore, Ndc80 was not significantly reduced in our proteomic analyses of RNAi cells (Supplementary file of Figure 6). We have also performed RNAi against <italic>Sf3A2</italic> and <italic>Prp31</italic> in an S2 cell line bearing a construct containing Tap-tagged <italic>Ndc80</italic> cDNA under the control of the inducible Mtn promoter. Expression of Ndc80-Tap, which localized normally to the kinetochores, did not rescue the mitotic phenotype elicited by the SF depletion (Figure 8). Together, these results indicate that mitotic defects observed in Sf3A2- and Prp31-depleted cellsare not caused by Ndc80 deficiency.</p><p>We performed the suggested rescue experiments. We found that dsRNAs targeting the 5' UTR of <italic>Sf3A2</italic> or the 3' UTR of <italic>Prp31</italic> produce the same mitotic phenotypes as those produced by the dsRNAs directed to the coding sequences; these phenotypes were rescued by expression of RNAi resistant genes (<italic>Sf3A2-RFP</italic> and <italic>Prp31-GFP</italic>) lacking the UTRs (Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 3), ruling out the possibility of RNAi off-target effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The other matter of concern relates with the phenotypic differences between RNAis and antibody microinjections. In the latter, the main defect appears to be after congression, arguing for a kinetochore-independent role for Sf3A2 and Prp31. Overall, it is difficult to reconcile all the data to draw a strong conclusion here. It should be noted that most injections were performed in interphase nuclei, leaving open the possibility that splicing might still be affected (there are still few short transcripts that are spliced between cycles 8-13). In the same line, the total duration of interphase at these stages is around 5 minutes, and splicing events can take as short as 30 secseconds (see e.g. Guilgur et al., 2014, cited by the authors). One suggestion would be to extend the few examples where embryos were injected apparently (no indication of injection time is provided) already in mitosis. An easier way might be to perform the injections in metaphase-arrested embryos by inhibiting the APC (see e.g. Oliveira et al., 2010).</p></disp-quote><p>A qualitative observation suggests that the chromosomes of α-Sf3A2- and α-Prp31-injected embryos are less aligned than in controls throughout the extended metaphase period (Figure 4A, Video 4, Video 5 and Video 6). To test this quantitatively, we measured the area encompassed by the chromosomes during the last 80 s (20 frames) that precede anaphase in anti-SF injected embryos. The chromosomes were, indeed, less tightly aligned than in their mock-injected counterparts (Figure 4E).</p><p>We performed additional antibody injection experiments, as suggested (see the embryo injection part of the Results section that is completely rewritten). The experiments confirmed the phenotypes described in the original version of the manuscript. But the crucial piece of information that rules out the possibility of an indirect splicing-related effect of α-Sf3A2- and α-Prp31 is the fact the fluorescently-labeled antibodies are virtually excluded from interphase and prophase nuclei; they penetrate into the nuclear space only at prometaphase when the nuclear envelope becomes fenestrated (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). This finding, which we did not emphasize in the original version of the manuscript, strongly suggests that during interphase the antibodies cannot disrupt the splicing process that occurs within the nucleus. Also, even if the antibodies are injected one minute before nuclear fenestration, they can act on the mitotic apparatus only after their entry into the nuclear space at prometaphase. Thus, given that splicing does not occur during mitosis, our embryo injection experiments make it highly unlikely an indirect, splicing-dependent mitotic effect of Sf3A3 and Prp31 inhibition.</p><p>An additional consideration that makes it extremely unlikely that antibody-induced SF inactivation disrupts mitosis by affecting the splicing of a mitotic mRNA is that the protein encoded by this hypothetical mRNA would be subject to an extraordinary rapid turnover, so that it would need to be continuously replenished.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The spindle MT localization of Sf3A2 and Prp31 is not totally convincing. Many proteins, including soluble tubulin, are known to enrich in the spindle region, simply because of molecular crowding due to a fenestrated envelope and the presence of large organelles that are excluded from the spindle region (see e.g. Schweizer et al., 2013). This turns out to be MT-independent. The authors do show one colchicine-treated cell in figure S7C, but there is no information in the Materials and methods section about this experiment, including the drug concentration used. I would suggest to provide a better characterization of Sf3A2 and Prp31 localization in mitosis after 30 minutes treatment with 100 μM Colchicine, which is sufficient to depolymerize all spindle MTs in S2 cells. Longer treatments (for 2 hours as used by the authors) will cause diffusion of &quot;spindle matrix&quot; components due to gradual disintegration of the membranous envelope that surrounds the spindle. It would also be important to provide direct localization of Sf3A2 and Prp31 in mitosis by expressing a GFP-tagged version. Similar approaches should also be conducted in human cells with micromolar doses of nocodazole.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the reviewer’s suggestion. We incubated the cells for 30 minutes in 100 μM colchicine, a treatment that is sufficient to depolymerize the spindle MTs in S2 cells but insufficient to cause diffusion of the spindle matrix components (Schweizer et al., 2013). We found that after this treatment both Sf3A2 and Prp31 are diffuse and do not show any enrichment in any spindle-like structure (i. e. the spindle matrix) (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A, B). We performed analogous experiments in HeLa cells; brief nocodazole treatments led to a diffuse localization of the SFs in metaphase cells, suggesting they associate with the spindle and not with the spindle matrix (Figure 9A).</p><p>We also examined S2 cells expressing of <italic>Sf3A2-RFP</italic> or <italic>Prp31-GFP</italic> under the control of the actin promoter and found that the tagged proteins accumulate on the metaphase spindles (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The time course experiment after double thymidine block is suggestive of a specific mitotic interaction between Sf3A2, Prp31 and HEC1. However, the possibility remains that many of the cells after 8 hours release are actually in G2. This experiment should be repeated using mitotic extracts only, obtained by mitotic shake-off of cells treated with nocodazole or STLC. The kinetochore localization of HEC1 after Sf3A2 and Prp31 RNAi in HeLa cells should also be investigated in cells treated with nocodazole (to standardize the conditions) and properly quantified relative to constitutive kinetochore components (e.g. using ACA serum from CREST patients).</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the suggested experiment. We synchronized HeLa cells with a 16 h nocodazole treatment; mitotic cells were then collected by mechanical shake-off both at the end of nocodazole treatment and 6 hours after the drug removal. As expected, both cell populations were highly enriched in cells undergoing mitosis marked by the PHH3, which was not found in adherent cells (Figure 10B). Co-IP with an anti-HEC1 antibody did not detect any HEC1-SF interaction in cells shaken-off from nocodazole-containing cultures or from adherent cells. However, mitotic cells shaken off from cultures kept in fresh medium for 6 hours after nocodazole removal displayed a robust interaction between HEC1 and either SF3A2 or PRP31. This is a very interesting finding, as it indicates that HEC1-SF interaction does not occur in mitotic cells with depolymerized MTs, but takes place only when these cells have reassembled a spindle, suggesting that the HEC1-SF interaction requires the presence of the spindle MTs.</p><p>We have also investigated kinetochore localization of HEC1 in <italic>SF3A2</italic> and <italic>PRP31</italic> RNAi HeLa cells treated with nocodazole. In RNAi cells treated with nocodazole (and fixed after pre-extraction with Triton X-100) the HEC1 signals were compact and strictly associated with the kinetochores (Figure 11—figure supplement 1). In contrast, in RNAi cells not exposed to nocodazole (also fixed after pre-extraction with Triton X-100), HEC1 was associated with filaments that are stained by anti-tubulin antibodies and are likely to be kinetochore fibers. These observations strongly suggest that SF3A2 and PRP31 are required to anchor HEC1 to the kinetochores and that, in the absence of these SFs, HEC1 tends to diffuse along the kinetochore MTs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Pellacani et al., examines the role of splicing factors mitotic chromosome segregation. Specifically, the authors address an unresolved long-standing issue of whether the mitotic defects associated with mutants in splicing factors are an indirect consequence of a failure to properly splice factors required for mitosis or whether the splicing factors have a distinct direct role in mitosis. The studies presented here provide a comprehensive set of experiments favoring the latter. Key evidence includes inhibitory antibody injections of splicing factors that result in an immediate disruption of chromosome segregation, and localization studies demonstrating these splicing factors localize to spindle microtubules and the Ndc80. Significantly they also demonstrate that these factors are required for kinetochore localization of Ndc80.</p><p>Overall the manuscript provides a thorough and compelling set of experiments that strongly support a direct action of splicing factors on the mitotic machinery. The work is of high quality and for the most part the conclusions are well supported by the data. Once the issue below is addressed this manuscript is well suited for publication in eLife:</p><p>1) The authors find that their RNAi/cell and antibody/embryo experiments produce different phenotypes. One key difference between the two experiments is that the former results in knockdown of the splicing factors throughout the cell cycle while the latter only during entry into metaphase.</p><p>In addition, some of the phenotypes observed are consistent with inhibition of S-phase (see aphidicolin embryo injection movies in Fasulo et al., 2011). To determine if there are interphase effects of splicing factor disruption the authors should inject the antibody during late anaphase and film the following cycle. If S-phase is inhibited there will be a dramatic delay in interphase. In addition, there will be chromosome segregation defects similar to those they observe.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the experiment suggested by the reviewer and injected embryos with either of the SF antibodies during late anaphase/telophase. The embryos did not exhibit an increase in the length of the following S phase compared to the mock-injected control embryos, suggesting that interphase/S phase was not disrupted. However, when the embryos entered mitosis they displayed the same defects seen in embryos injected just before or during mitosis (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We note that it is quite possible that the antibodies injected in late anaphase/telophase did not enter the nuclei due to the reassembly of the nuclear envelope. In this case, the antibodies might have been excluded from the nucleus till next mitosis. Indeed, we have shown that the antibodies are virtually excluded from interphase and prophase nuclei and penetrate into the nuclear space only when the nucleus becomes fenestrated in prometaphase (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). This is an important observation that (unfortunately) we did not emphasize in the original version of our manuscript. This finding strongly suggests that the antibodies cannot disrupt the splicing process during interphase, and even if they are injected one minute before mitosis, they can act on kinetochores/microtubules only after their entry into the nucleus at prometaphase. Thus, given that splicing does not occur during mitosis, this finding makes highly unlikely an indirect, splicing-dependent mitotic effect of Sf3A3 and Prp31 inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>This manuscript describes the roles of two conserved splicing factors in mitosis in Drosophila and humans. Defective phenotypes after RNAi are well described. I may have missed something, but experiments which exclude the possibility of off-target effects appear to be missing. If these control experiments have been done, they should be clearly stated in the main text with figures. They are essential before any publication, as many wrong papers have been published in the past due to off-target effects.</p><p>The authors conclude that this mitotic role is independent of splicing function. This conclusion is based on observation of the mitotic defect within 1 minute after antibody injection. This evidence is convincing in principle, but I have a reservation on the strength of the control they used (see below). As this is a crucial experiment for this study, it is important to use a more robust control.</p><p>Apart from phenotypic analysis, some mechanistic studies have been carried out. They showed a reduction of the Ndc80 complex on kinetochores, and interaction between Ndc80 and these splicing factors, which explain the phenotype they observed. It is still not clear how these proteins promote the recruitment of the Ndc80 complex to kinetochores. I judge that this is a very good but not in-depth mechanistic study. Therefore, provided the above two experiments are done, a merit of publishing this study in eLife depends on how significant direct involvement of splicing factors in mitosis is judged to be.</p><p>Many examples of proteins with multiple unrelated roles (moonlighting) have been documented. In the old days, it was often proposed that they have crucial roles in cross-talk between two processes, but these claims have not been substantiated in most cases. I do not think that splicing factors having direct mitotic functions conceptually advance the understanding of either splicing or mitosis. Therefore, when considering the merit of this study for publication in eLife, it should be treated in a similar way to the discovery of a novel conserved proteins which is important for mitosis.</p><p>1) Control experiments are required to exclude the possibility of off-target effects of RNAi in Drosophila or humans.

Injection of buffer only was used as a control. This is acceptable in some cases, but as this is a critical experiment assessed by a sensitive assay, a further control is essential. Preparing affinity purified antibodies requires multiple chemicals which may affect cell physiology even in a trace amount upon injection into cells. Therefore, unrelated antibodies prepared in the identical way (ideally at the same time) should be used as a control. As the authors' claim for direct roles heavily relies on this particular experiment, it is critical to do this control carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>We carried out several additional injection experiments using new aliquots of affinity-purified antibodies. These experiments gave results fully comparable to those described in the original version of this manuscript (see the Results and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 as an example of the new results). To rule out the possibility that the specific phenotypes observed after anti-SF injection were a spurious non-specific results, we injected embryos with an antibody against Dgt6 (a subunit of the Augmin complex involved in spindle formation) that had been prepared at the same time as the anti-SF antibodies. Consistent with previous results (Hayward et al., 2014), the embryos injected with the anti-Dgt6 antibodies showed delayed spindle formation, thinner and long spindles and arrested in a metaphase-like state. This phenotype is very different from that elicited by anti SF-antibodies, ruling out the possibility that the mitotic effects of the anti-SF antibodies are due to chemical contaminants associated with antibody purification and concentration processes.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Gatti et al., addresses whether the splicing factors Sf3A2 and Prp31 have direct mitotic roles, independently from splicing. In this revised manuscript the authors have made considerable efforts to address previous criticisms of their study. It seems to me that they have done pretty much as much as they can to exclude the possibility that the splicing factors are acting indirectly – their analysis of transcripts is particularly important here. The biochemical data showing interaction between these two factors with MTs and Ndc80 offer a plausible explanation for some of the observed phenotypes and suggest that mitosis is immune to potential splicing defects in the several mRNAs that are under control of Sf3A2 and Prp31.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Before publication the authors should address several inconsistencies in the data.</p><p>1) Ndc80 localization at kinetochores seems reduced after perturbation of Sf3A2 and Prp31only in the presence of MTs. Ndc80/Hec1 localization is normal without MTs (at least in HeLa cells). Thus, SFs are not required for Ndc80 recruitment but might be involved in its maintenance at KTs. Consistently, the in vivo interaction between Sf3A2 and Prp31 with Ndc80 does not seem to take place in mitotic cells in the absence of MTs, leading the authors to propose a model in which the Ndc80/Hec1-SF interaction requires the presence of spindle MTs. The problem comes from the GST pull-down experiments that clearly show that purified recombinant Ndc80 and SFs all interact, and this happens in the absence of MTs. Together with the fact that the observed mitotic phenotypes related with the perturbation of SFs (e.g. monopolar spindles) are not consistent with loss of Ndc80, leaves open an obvious gap in the model. This cannot simply be explained by differences in SAC activity among different cells/systems. These points should be addressed either by modifying the model to include caveats and alternative interpretations – notably that there may be other targets than Ndc80 – or by including experimental data to support the proposed model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the fact that GST pulldowns with purified proteins show that Ndc80 directly interact with the SFs is somewhat at odds with the finding that human SFs interact with HEC1 only in the presence of MTs. However, the fact that two bacterially expressed, affinity purified proteins interact in vitro does not necessarily imply that they directly interact also in living cells. For example, it is possible that post-translational modifications occurring in living cells alter the binding abilities of these proteins. We have shown that the SFs interact with HEC1 only in the presence of spindle MTs and that in the absence of the SFs both <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ndc80 and human HEC1 tend to dissociate from the kinetochore and diffuse in the cytoplasm, possibly along the kinetochore MTs. We have therefore modified our model in the following way:</p><p>“Collectively, these results suggest a model for the mitotic role of SF3A2 and PRP31. We propose that these SFs interact with Ndc80/HEC1 on the k-fibers, regulating the association of the Ndc80 complex with the kinetochore. In the absence of the SFs, the Ndc80/HEC1 complex would associate with the kinetochores, or the kinetochore-MT interfaces, in an abnormal fashion, so that the binding of the complex to the kinetochore would be weakened and the SAC satisfaction prevented. As a result, when the kinetochores are attached to MTs, Ndc80/HEC1 would diffuse away from the kinetochores possibly along the kinetochore fibers.”</p><p>We also added that some aspects of SF-Ndc80/HEC1-MT interactions are reminiscent of those described for the mammalian Ska complex (see revised Discussion section).</p><p>Our revised model on the mitotic role of the SFs also explains why the phenotypes of SF depleted cells are different from those of cells lacking Ndc80/HEC1. In our model, Ndc80/HEC1 is associated with the kinetochores in an abnormal fashion, and this would result in a mitotic phenotype different from that caused by Ndc80 depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The immunofluorescence data remains somewhat difficult to interpret. The authors state that detergent pre-extraction before fixation improves visualization of KT proteins, but this is also known to cause artefacts. The reviewers do not see the need for such harsh conditions and are aware that conventional PFA works well to stain Hec1; even methanol fixation is preferable to pre-extraction. The authors should include data using a different staining technique that avoids pre-extraction.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we performed new experiments in which RNAi cells were fixed with PFA. As described in the Results section (see also new Figure 9) these experiments showed that HEC1 accumulation at the kinetochores was reduced, without a concomitant significant reduction in the amount of the protein (Figure 9C). We specifically observed that in most RNAi cells there was a halo of HEC1 in the cytoplasmic area surrounding the chromosomes (Figure 9D). Notably <italic>SF3A2</italic> and <italic>PRP31</italic> nocodazole-treated (for 3 hours) cells displayed HEC1 signals comparable to those of control cells and most of them did not show a fluorescent HEC1 halo around the chromosomes (Figure 9E). In RNAi cells fixed with PFA (and not treated with nocodazole), we did not observe an association of HEC1 with the spindle MTs like in cells pre-extracted with Triton X-100. In the revised text, we explained that the pattern of HEC1 localization observed in pre-extracted RNAi cells (but not in control cells) does not necessarily reflects a diffusion of HEC1 along the kinetochore MTs:</p><p>“However, although the most straightforward interpretation of our observations on Triton X pre-extracted cells suggests that HEC1 spreads out along the kinetochore MTs, we cannot exclude the possibility that the association of HEC1 with the spindle MTs depends on the fixation technique. It is indeed possible that HEC1 dissociates from the kinetochores and then binds the MTs that resisted the pre-extraction/fixation procedure.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
