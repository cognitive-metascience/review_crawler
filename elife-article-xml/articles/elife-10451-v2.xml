Critical to this process is the effector enzyme adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5) that produces second messenger cAMP upon receptor-mediated activation by G protein Golf. However, the molecular organization of the G<sub>olf-</sub>AC5 signaling axis is not well understood. In this study, we report that in the striatum AC5 exists in a stable pre-coupled complex with subunits of G<sub>olf</sub> heterotrimer. We use genetic mouse models with disruption in individual components of the complex to reveal hierarchical order of interactions required for AC5-G<sub>olf</sub> stability. We further identify that the assembly of AC5-G<sub>olf</sub> complex is mediated by PhLP1 chaperone that plays central role in neurotransmitter receptor coupling to cAMP production motor learning. These findings provide evidence for the existence of stable G protein-effector signaling complexes and identify a new component essential for their assembly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10451.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10451.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10451.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the brain, cells called neurons communicate with one another using chemicals called neurotransmitters, which bind to receptors on the surface of cells. In most cases, the binding of neurotransmitter causes a protein known as a G protein to interact with the receptor. G proteins are made up of three subunits: Î±, Î² and Î³. After binding to the receptor, the Î± subunit separates from the Î²/Î³ subunits â which remain together â and both components then act as signals to activate specific targets in the cell.</p><p>There are many different Î±, Î² and Î³ subunits, which participate in various signaling pathways in different parts of the brain. In the striatum â a region involved in controlling movement â a particular combination of Î±, Î² and Î³ subunits called G<sub>olf</sub> is responsible for activating an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5).</p><p>Traditionally, G protein signalling has been thought to occur in stages so that the binding of neurotransmitter to receptors on striatal neurons would lead to the dissociation of G<sub>olf</sub> into the Î± and Î²Î³ subunits. Then the Î± and Î²Î³ subunits are thought to bind to and activate AC5. However, Xie et al. now show that all three subunits of G<sub>olf</sub> are already found in a stable group (or complex) with AC5 in striatal neurons. Neurotransmitter binding to the receptors causes the entire G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5complex to rearrange and this process activates AC5.</p><p>A particular chaperone protein regulates the assembly of the G protein-AC5complex. Mice that lack the gene that encodes this chaperone in striatal neurons struggle to learn how to balance on a rotating rod. In humans, mutations in the genes that encode G<sub>olf</sub> and AC5 cause dystonia, which is a disorder characterised by involuntary movements. Given the evidence linking this chaperone protein to the regulation of G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 signaling, future experiments should investigate whether it might also contribute to dystonia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10451.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10451.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>G protein</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>cAMP</kwd><kwd>motor control</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS081282</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehrlich</surname><given-names>Michelle E</given-names></name><name><surname>Martemyanov</surname><given-names>Kirill A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY012287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Willardson</surname><given-names>Barry M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS073930</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Baoji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003621</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015R1A2A2A01003413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Pyung-Lim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A G protein in striatal neurons forms preassembled complexes with its downstream enzyme, adenylyl cyclase, which has implications for the pathophysiology of movement disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurotransmitters elicit their effects by activating receptors on the surface of neurons. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form the largest group of the receptors responsible for the actions of the majority of neurotransmitters and play a critical role in virtually all neuronal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gainetdinov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wettschureck and Offermanns, 2005</xref>). In a classical model, upon binding to neurotransmitter, GPCRs undergo conformational changes activating heterotrimeric G proteins by promoting GTP binding to GÎ± subunits and triggering the release of the GÎ²Î³ subunits. When dissociated, both GÎ± and GÎ²Î³ subunits modulate the activities of downstream effector molecules that are directly responsible for generating cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neer, 1995</xref>). However, an emerging alternative model suggests that G protein heterotrimers exist in more stable complexes that rearrange rather than dissociate upon activation and may further form higher order signaling complexes with receptors and effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bunemann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dupre et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hepler, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lambert, 2008</xref>). The assembly of this macromolecular complex may be tightly regulated. Indeed, several chaperone proteins have been described to be required for the biogenesis of the G protein subunits and their complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dupre et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Papasergi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Willardson and Tracy, 2012</xref>).</p><p>One of the central and best studied G protein effectors is adenylyl cyclase (AC), an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Taussig and Gilman, 1995</xref>). Numerous isoforms of AC are differentially modulated by both GÎ²Î³ and various GÎ±-GTP subunits and play critical roles in a variety of fundamental neuronal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sadana and Dessauer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sunahara et al., 1996</xref>). GPCR signaling to AC performs a particularly important function in the striatum, the input structure of the basal ganglia circuit essential for initiating and maintaining movement, mood control, and reward valuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graybiel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</xref>). Imbalance in cAMP homeostasis in this region has been associated with drug addiction, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and a variety of movement disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonito-Oliva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Girault, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nestler and Aghajanian, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wilson and Brandon, 2015</xref>). Striatal neurons receive diverse inputs that converge on AC5, the major AC isoform in the region, accounting for ~ 80% of cAMP generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). Coupling of key neurotransmitter receptors, such as dopamine D1 (D1R) and adenosine A2A (A2AR) to increase cAMP production in these neurons, is mediated to a large extent by a unique heterotrimer composed of the stimulatory Î± subunit GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> complexed with GÎ²<sub>2</sub> and GÎ³<sub>7</sub> subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herve, 2011</xref>). Indeed, deletion of GÎ±<sub>olf</sub>, GÎ³<sub>7</sub> or AC5 in mice severely diminishes cAMP production in response to D1R and A2AR activation, which is paralleled by muted behavioral responses to psychostimulants and antipsychotics that act on these receptors as well as by profound motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corvol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iwamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwindinger et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, mutations in GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> and AC5 have been shown to cause primary dystonia in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carapito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>), further supporting the key contribution of G<sub>olf-</sub>AC5 signaling axis to pathophysiology of movement disorders. These observations argue for the lack of functional compensation from other AC isoforms and heterotrimeric G proteins in transducing the signal. However, the functional significance of striatal-specific composition of these specific signaling elements is not well understood.</p><p>Functionally, GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> is similar to another stimulatory G protein GÎ±<sub>s</sub>, but GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> has lower efficiency of both receptor coupling and AC5 stimulation when tested in in vitro biochemical assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 1990</xref>). AC5 displays dual regulation by G protein subunits in which GÎ²Î³ acts to facilitate its activation by GÎ±<sub>s</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2007</xref>). In vitro biochemical studies show that AC5 is capable of binding GÎ±<sub>s</sub> and GÎ²Î³ simultaneously, suggesting that it can scaffold the stimulatory G protein heterotrimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sadana et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, growing evidence suggests that in vivo G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 may exist in a signaling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herve, 2011</xref>). In mice, AC5 elimination leads to a reduction in expression levels of GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iwamoto et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, knockout of GÎ³7 reduces the expression of GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> and GÎ²<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwindinger et al., 2010</xref>). However, interactions involving elements of the complex in the striatum, their reciprocal relationship, mechanisms of complex assembly as well as implications for the cAMP signaling and behavior are not understood.</p><p>Here we report that in the striatum, AC5 forms a stable macromolecular complex with heterotrimeric Golf proteins and this pre-assembly is essential for the stability of AC5 and its ability to produce cAMP. We identified that the GÎ² chaperone phosducin-like protein 1 (PhLP1) plays a key role in the assembly of this signaling complex in striatal neurons. Elimination of PhLP1 in striatal neurons affects assembly and stability of the complex and causes selective impairment in sensorimotor behavior and motor skill learning, preferentially affecting signaling in the striatopallidal medium spiny neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stability of AC5 in the stratum depends on its complex formation with the Golf heterotrimer</title><p>To begin testing the idea that AC5 may exist in a stable complex with the Golf heterotrimer in vivo, we first analyzed their binding by co-immunoprecipitaiton assays. AC5 was effectively and specifically pulled down together with both GÎ±olf and, to a lesser extent, GÎ²<sub>2</sub> from mouse striatal lysates, indicating that in striatal neurons Golf subunits form stable complexes with AC5 in their ground state in the absence of receptor stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, we analyzed the relationship between AC5 and Golf by examining the co-dependence of their expression using mouse knockout models. Elimination of AC5 in mice (<italic>Adcy5</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) dramatically reduced the expression of GÎ±olf but had no appreciable effect on GÎ²2 expression, suggesting that AC5 contributes to the stability of GÎ±olf but not the stability of the GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We further used <italic>Adcy5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> striatal tissues in the immunoprecipitation experiments and found that antibodies against AC5 failed to pull-down G<sub>olf</sub> subunits from striatal lysates lacking AC5, confirming the specificity of G<sub>olf</sub> association with AC5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, disruption of GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> by eliminating GÎ³<sub>7</sub> in <italic>Gng7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> knockout led to a marked down-regulation of both AC5 and GÎ±olf expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The consequences of GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> disruption were evaluated in heterozygous mice (<italic>Gnal</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) with severely diminished GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> expression because complete ablation of GÎ±olf leads to increased perinatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belluscio et al., 1998</xref>). In these animals, the levels of both AC5 and GÎ²<sub>2</sub> were substantially reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, in mouse striatum co-dependence of the complex components appears to be unidirectional: destabilization of either the GÎ± or GÎ²Î³ subunits of the Golf heterotrimer compromised AC5 stability, while only GÎ± but not GÎ²Î³ was affected by the loss of AC5.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10451.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Co-dependence of heterotrimeric G<sub>olf</sub> subunits and AC5 in complex formation and expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â Immunoprecipitation of AC5 complexes from striatal lysates of wild type mice.

In HEK293 cells, co-transfection with PhLP1 significantly increased the expression of all three G<sub>olf</sub> subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, a dominant negative construct of PhLP1 (ÎNT-PhLP1), lacking the first 75 amino acids critical for its interaction with GÎ² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lukov et al., 2005</xref>) had no effect on the expression G<sub>olf</sub> subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with the described impact of PhLP1 on GÎ²Î³ complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lukov et al., 2005</xref>), co-expression with full-length PhLP1 resulted in a significant increase in the formation of the GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> complexes as evidenced by the fluorescence complementation assay with the split-Venus system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, ÎNT-PhLP1 exerted the opposite effect and inhibited GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To examine the functional effects of PhLP1 in a context of the entire Golf heterotrimer, we tested the ability of GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> and GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> subunits to undergo a cycle of dissociation/re-association in response to changes in the D1R activity. We used a cell-based Bioluminescence Energy Transfer (BRET) assay to monitor the release of the GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> dimer in the presence of GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In this assay, stimulation of D1R by dopamine results in the activation of GÎ±<sub>olf</sub>, releasing Venus-tagged GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> to interact with the NanoLuc-tagged reporter, an event detected by changes in the BRET signal. Conversely, application of an antagonist SCH39166 facilitates complex re-association and quenching of the BRET response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Reversing the sequence of ligand addition abolishes the response indicating that changes in the BRET signal are associated with the activation of the D1R receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, omitting D1R or G<sub>olf</sub> from the transfection also dramatically suppressed the signal indicating that the signal is specifically driven by the D1R-mediated activation of the G<sub>olf</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Using this assay we found that PhLP1 coexpression significantly increased dopamine-induced activation of GÎ±<sub>olf</sub>-GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> heterotrimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). In contrast, expression of the dominant negative ÎNT-PhLP1 significantly attenuated the BRET response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>).

We tested this possibility by measuring the effect of PhLP1 co-expression on AC5 expression. PhLP1 co-expression resulted in a significant increase (~1.7 fold) in AC5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This effect was paralleled by elevation of the basal cAMP levels (~4 fold) in the cells expressing AC5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, AC5-containing cells showed enhanced cAMP generation in response to both the direct AC activator forskolin (~4 fold increase) and the Î²2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (~1.5 fold increase) when PhLP1 was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These effects were AC5-dependent as no stimulatory effect on cAMP generation was observed in the absence of AC5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, while the increase in GPCR-driven cAMP production (likely through GÎ±<sub>s</sub>) in the presence of PhLP1 closely matched the increase in the total AC5 levels, the effect of PhLP1 on both basal and forskolin-induced cAMP production was much larger.

Remarkably, purified recombinant full-length PhLP1 significantly enhanced basal AC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This effect was not observed with ÎNT-PhLP1, suggesting that the effect likely involves an ability of PhLP1 to bind GÎ²Î³. The reaction buffer in these assays did not contain GTP, therefore the effect of PhLP1 was unlikely to result from the classical activation of GÎ±. Given that in the striatal membranes AC5 forms a complex with GÎ±<sub>olf</sub>GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub>Â we hypothesized that PhLP1 may cause activation by scavenging GÎ²Î³ and releasing GÎ±<sub>olf</sub>, making it available for the activation of AC5, as even GDP-bound free GÎ± subunits are capable of regulating AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sunahara et al., 1997</xref>). To test this notion, we compared the ability of forskolin and GÎ±<sub>s</sub>-GTP to regulate AC activity in the striatal membranes in the absence or presence of PhLP1. GÎ±<sub>s</sub> is known to synergize with forskolin increasing its ability to regulate cyclase activity by promoting binding of forskolin to a high affinity site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dessauer et al., 1997</xref>). Consistent with our model, PhLP1 significantly enhanced forskolin-stimulated AC activity in striatal membranes and produced an approximately three-fold reduction in EC<sub>50</sub> for forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). In contrast, PhLP1 failed to exert an effect on AC activated by adding exogenous GÎ±<sub>s</sub>-GTPÎ³S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and G</xref>) supporting the idea that PhLP1 activates AC5 through a GÎ±-dependent mechanism. In this case, added GÎ±<sub>s</sub>-GTPÎ³S likely out competed endogenous GÎ±<sub>olf</sub>-GDP activating AC5 after being released by PhLP1. Thus, PhLP1 appears to regulate AC5 activity by a dual mechanism. On the one hand it enhances the expression of the AC5 by facilitating its complex formation with G<sub>olf</sub>. On the other, it may act in promoting the receptor-independent release of GÎ±olf that stimulates AC5 activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Elimination of PhLP1 does not impact survival and connectivity of striatal neurons</title><p>We next sought to examine the effect of PhLP1 on striatal signaling and physiology in vivo.

To study the role of PhLP1 in the striatum, we ablated its expression selectively in the striatum by crossing the conditional PhLP1 mouse strain (<italic>Pdcl<sup>flx/flx</sup></italic>) with the striatal driver mouse line <italic>Rgs9-Cre</italic>, generating a conditional, striatal-specific elimination of PhLP1 (<italic>Pdcl</italic> cKO) mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Overall, striatal morphology of <italic>Pdcl</italic> cKO mice looked normal with no signs of degeneration at least until 3â4 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Counting the number of neurons (diameter &gt; 5 Î¼m) in the striatum tissue using Nissl staining revealed a significantly greater number of neurons in the <italic>Pdcl</italic> cKO mice. A greater number of cells together with a smaller volume that they occupy indicate that the sizes of individual striatal neurons are likely smaller. These changes are consistent with retarded maturation of neurons, a process controlled by the cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujioka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakagawa et al., 2002</xref>).

Quantification of fluorescence intensity revealed no difference in the intensities of the signals for these markers, which were found in appropriate target areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

We find that this interaction occurs at the basal state and can be detected without agonist application, which is typically required to promote dissociation of heterotrimers into GÎ±-GTP and GÎ²Î³ subunits making them competent for binding to effectors. We further demonstrate that binding to GÎ±<sub>olf</sub>Î²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> complex is required for the proteolytic stabilization of AC5 that results in its high expression level in the striatum. In the course of this study, we further confirmed previously reported interdependence among subunits of the G<sub>olf</sub> heterotrimer in which interactions between GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> and GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> are required for mutual proteolytic stabilization of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iwamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwindinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwindinger et al., 2010</xref>).

While there are several examples for the association of both GÎ± and GÎ²Î³ subunits with effector molecule, e.g. PLCÎ², GIRK channels, AC isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kovoor and Lester, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lyon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sunahara et al., 1996</xref>), to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to document a case in which stable association with all subunits of G protein heterotrimer is required for the stability of an effector. Taken together with biochemical studies showing that AC5 is capable of scaffolding inactive G protein heterotrimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sadana et al., 2009</xref>), our results suggest that in striatal neurons heterotrimeric G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 is assembled in a pre-coupled âsignalosomeâ in which subunits rearrange rather than physically dissociate upon GPCR activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of PhLP1 in G<sub>olf-</sub>AC5 complex assembly</title><p>We report that the chaperone protein PhLP1 plays a critical role in the assembly of the Golf-AC5 complex in striatal neurons. Previous studies have demonstrated the role of PhLP1 in the assembly of the complexes involving GÎ² subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. It is thought to function as a co-chaperone with the cytosolic chaperonin complex (CCT), assisting in retrieval of the GÎ² subunits emerging from the CCT and presenting them for the association with the Gg subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Willardson and Tracy, 2012</xref>). In addition to assisting folding of conventional GÎ²Î³ complexes, PhLP1 chaperones the formation of the structurally similar complexes involving the atypical GÎ²<sub>5</sub> subunits and the GÎ³-like domains in RGS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howlett et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this model, deletion of PhLP1 in photoreceptors disrupts the formation of GÎ²<sub>1</sub>Î³<sub>1</sub> (in rods), GÎ²<sub>3</sub>Î³<sub>8</sub> (in cones) and GÎ²<sub>5L</sub>/RGS9-1 complexes (in both rods and cones), dramatically decreasing their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tracy et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of PhLP1 deficient in GÎ² binding in rods down-regulates the expression of the GÎ²<sub>1</sub>Î³<sub>1</sub> and GÎ²<sub>5L</sub>/RGS9-1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Posokhova et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, loss of PhLP1 function also results in a dramatic decrease in the expression of GÎ±<sub>t1</sub> and GÎ±<sub>t2</sub> subunits in rods and cones, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tracy et al., 2015</xref>). Given that stability of these GÎ± subunits depends on their complex formation with Gbg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kolesnikov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lobanova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nikonov et al., 2013</xref>), the role of PhLP1 in stabilizing GÎ±<sub>t1</sub> and GÎ±<sub>t2</sub> is likely indirect and stems from its effects on GÎ²Î³ complex assembly.</p><p>Similar to the situation in photoreceptors, we observe that knockout of PhLP1 in striatal neurons results in marked down-regulation in the expression of all subunits of heterotrimeric G<sub>olf</sub> complex. Direct side-by-side comparison of the impact on protein expression produced by elimination of individual subunits of the G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 complex affords a unique opportunity to analyze the reciprocal relationship between complex components. Our results suggest a hierarchical relationship in the assembly of the complex. The stability of GÎ±olf requires its association with both GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> and AC5, but the stability of GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> depends only on the association with GÎ±olf and not AC5. In turn, stability of AC5 is dependent on both GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> and GÎ±<sub>olf</sub>. Given that PhLP1 directly binds to Gbg subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Savage et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thibault et al., 1997</xref>) and has been shown to be required for folding GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howlett et al., 2009</xref>), we propose the following model for the role in PhLP1 the assembly of the G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 complex. PhLP1 assists the assembly of the GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> complex, increasing its expression, which in turn upregulates GÎ±<sub>olf</sub>. Higher levels of GÎ±<sub>olf</sub>Î²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> promote stabilization of the AC5 by forming pre-coupled complexes with it. Thus, PhLP1 triggers a chain of events resulting in the stabilization of the entire AC5-G<sub>olf</sub> complex ensuring its high expression level and setting the stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10451.009</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of PhLP1 involvement in regulating G<sub>olf-</sub>AC5 complex assembly and signaling.</title> <p>PhLP1 promotes biogenesis of GÎ²2Î³7 and assembly of its complex with G<sub>olf</sub>.

Studies in transfected cells indicate that PhLP1 participates in folding and stabilization of virtually all GÎ²Î³ combinations including complexes of GÎ²<sub>5</sub> with RGS9 and RGS7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howlett et al., 2009</xref>). Yet, we find that in the striatum, PhLP1 elimination has no effect on the expression of many G protein subunits, including GÎ²<sub>1</sub>, a subunit clearly impacted by PhLP1 loss in rod photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lai et al., 2013</xref>). We propose that this apparent selectivity may be explained by higher susceptibility of G proteins with high expression levels to the destabilizing effects associated with PhLP1 loss than those expressed at moderate to low levels. In this scenario, PhLP1 action may be the rate-limiting factor required for achieving high expression of G proteins with abundant mRNA expression in a particular neuronal population, e.g. GÎ±<sub>t1</sub>Î²<sub>1</sub>Î³<sub>1</sub>, GÎ±<sub>t2</sub>Î²<sub>3</sub>Î³<sub>8</sub> and GÎ±olfÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> overexpressed in rods, cones and striatal neurons, respectively. However, at this point, we also cannot rule out an alternative explanation that cellular heterogeneity in the striatum contributes to selectivity of the effects. Although <italic>Rgs9-Cre</italic> driver line that we used to delete PhLP1 is active in 95% of neurons in the striatum, it might have no effect on other cells such as glia that might contain a higher abundance of G protein subunits that we find to be unregulated by PhLP1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of PhLP1 in regulating neurotransmitter signaling to cAMP production</title><p>It is interesting to consider the results of this study in light of the mechanisms linking GPCR signaling in striatal neurons to cAMP production and behavior. The G<sub>olf</sub> heterotrimer is known to be essential for coupling both D1 and A2A receptors in direct and indirect striatal neurons to stimulation of cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herve, 2011</xref>). Knockout of <italic>Gnal</italic> or <italic>Gng7</italic> that encode GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> or GÎ³<sub>7</sub> respectively, markedly reduces the ability of D1R and A2AR agonists to increase cAMP, and this biochemical observation is paralleled by muted behavioral responses of mice to psychostimulants that activate these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corvol et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwindinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhuang et al., 2000</xref>). Acute psychomotor responses to drugs appear to be particularly sensitive to loss of G<sub>olf</sub>, while adaptive behaviors to repeated drug exposure are preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corvol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwindinger et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, levels of G<sub>olf</sub> complex dictate particular signaling outcomes upon receptor stimulation. For example, while GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> is critical for the ability of D1R to stimulate both cAMP production and ERK phosphorylation, GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> haploinsufficiency leads to selective deficits in cAMP signaling without detrimentally affecting coupling to ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corvol et al., 2007</xref>). This signaling dichotomy becomes even more pronounced at the level of AC5. Although, activation of either D1R and A2A clearly results in the increase in cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corvol et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iwamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2002</xref>) and AC5 mediates nearly 80% of this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2002</xref>), elimination of AC5 in mice does not diminish behavioral responses of mice to the administration of A1R and D1R agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iwamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). At the same time, mice lacking AC5 have abolished responses to D2 antagonists, suggesting greater impact of signaling via AC5 in indirect pathway neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). Balance of neurotransmitter signaling between direct and indirect pathway striatal neurons is thought to set a tightly orchestrated coordination of movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graybiel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014</xref>). In agreement with this idea, mice lacking AC5 or GÎ³<sub>7</sub> show profound deficits in motor learning and coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iwamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kheirbek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sasaki et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, mutations in genes encoding AC5 and GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> in humans cause dystonia, a disorder characterized by involuntary movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carapito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is likely that G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 axis is involved in more subtle coordination of signaling in striatal neurons that sometimes might not be evident from measuring gross motor responses to pharmacological treatment with receptor ligands.</p><p>Our findings with a mouse model lacking PhLP1 in the striatum agree well with the expectations based on the analysis of mice with disruptions in AC5 and G<sub>olf</sub> components and also provide additional insight that helps further clarify integration of neurotransmitter signaling in the striatum. Our <italic>Pdcl</italic> cKO model displays complete lack of motor learning, deficits in psychostimulatory effects of A2AR antagonism and diminished neuroleptic responses to D2R antagonism. As with studies on <italic>Adcy5-/-</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herve, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2002</xref>), perhaps the most surprising result of our studies is the intact responses of mice lacking PhLP1 to D1R agonism. This observation is particularly striking given the profound down-regulation of AC5, GÎ±<sub>olf</sub> and GÎ²<sub>2</sub>Î³<sub>7</sub> in these mice paralleled by equal deficits in coupling of both D1R and A2AR to cAMP production. We think that this selectivity is likely related to downregulation of all signaling components rather than their complete loss. It is possible that striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons have differential sensitivity to changes in the efficiency of the G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 coupling, creating signaling imbalance when the expression of signaling components is diminished. This effect could be either exacerbated or compensated by the loss of RGS9-2 that also controls AC5 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xie et al., 2012</xref>) and signaling downstream from D2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabrera-Vera et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Celver et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rahman et al., 2003</xref>), further contributing to signaling imbalance. Alternatively, preservation of D1R mediated behavioral responses in <italic>Pdcl</italic> cKO mice may also indicate that signaling pathways other than cAMP initiated by D1 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishi et al., 2011</xref>) play compensatory role. In any event, our study demonstrates the importance of proper Golf-AC5 complex expression and assembly for the balance of the neurotransmitter signaling in striatal neurons and introduces PhLP1 as a critical regulator of the process and an interesting molecular player to consider in the pathology of dystonia and possibly other movement disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and DNA constructs</title><p><italic>Pdcl <sup>flx/flx</sup></italic>mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lai et al., 2013</xref>) were crossed with <italic>Rgs9-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dang et al., 2006</xref>) to generate striatal specific PhLP1 conditional knockout (<italic>Pdcl</italic> cKO) mice. <italic>Pdcl<sup>flx/flx</sup></italic> Cre(-) control littermates derived from heterozygous breeding pairs were used for all experiments.

To analyze the RNA expression pattern of the target genes, the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) was used with the Taqman gene expression master kit. Three biological replicates and four technical replicates for each sample were used. 10 ng of each sample were used in each real-time PCR (TaqMan Gene Expression Assay ID probes: <italic>Pdcl</italic>: Mm01327170_m1; <italic>Adcy5</italic>: Mm00674122_m1; <italic>Gnal</italic>: Mm01258217_m1; <italic>Gnb2</italic>: Mm00515865_g1; <italic>Gng7</italic>: Mm00515876_m1; <italic>Rgs9</italic>: Mm01250425_m1; Applied Biosystems).

Briefly, dopamine D1 receptor, GÎ±<sub>olf</sub>, Venus156-239-GÎ²<sub>2</sub>, Venus1-155-GÎ³<sub>7</sub>, Flag-Ric-8B and masGRK3ct-Nluc constructs together with PhLP1 or ÎNT-PhLP1 were transfected into HEK293T/17 cells at a 1:6:1:1:1:1:1 ratio using lipofectamine LTX transfection reagent (Invitrogen). 7.5 Âµg total DNA was delivered per 3.5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells in a 6-cm-dish. 16â24âhr post transfection, cells were stimulated with 100 ÂµM dopamine followed by treatment with 100 ÂµM SCH39166. The BRET signal was determined by calculating the ratio of the light emitted by the Venus-GÎ²2Î³7 (535 nm) over the light emitted by the masGRK3ct-Nluc (475 nm). The average baseline value recorded prior to agonist stimulation was subtracted from BRET signal values, and the resulting difference (ÎBRET) was obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histology</title><p>Mice were anesthetized by Avertin (tribromoethanol) and perfused transcardially with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were collected and postfixed in 4% PFA overnight, and stored in 30% sucrose solution for cryoprotection for 3â5 days. Brains were sectioned into 50 Âµm slices by a sliding microtome (SM2000R, Leica). After sectioning, sample slices were stored in PBS at 4Â°C or in antifreeze solution at -20Â°C for long-term storage.</p><p>Immunofluorescent staining was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gharami et al., 2008</xref>). Primary antibodies against enkephalin and substance-P (Immunostar Inc.; 1:1,1000) were used for detecting the projection from dopamine receptor D1 or D2 medium spiny neurons. Fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 594, Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.) were applied during staining. The staining was performed on two brain sections including either external globus pallidus (GPe) or substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). After acquiring images by using a 4X objective (CFI Plan Apo, Nikon) on Nikon Ti microscope, the Nikon NIS-Elements software was used to measure mean intensity in designated area. Then values of control and mutant groups, with backgrounds subtracted, were evaluated by Studentâs unpaired t-test.</p><p>For neuronal cell counting in striatum, we first performed Nissl-staining in six coronal sections with 300 Âµm interval. Stereo Investigator software (MicroBrightField Inc.) was employed to measure the volume of striatum and evaluate the neuronal number. The number of neurons was estimated using a fractionator sampling method described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baydyuk et al., 2011</xref>). The analysis was performed blinded to the genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Behavioral studies</title><p>Locomotor activities were evaluated in automated video tracking ANY-maze open field chambers (Stoelting,Â Wood Dale, IL) under illuminated conditions. Mice were habituated to the testing room for 1âhr before the test on each day. On the first day, naÃ¯ve mice were placed in the novel chambers without injection, and allowed to explore the chambers for 2âhr. Horizontal activity was measured in terms of the total distance traveled or distance traveled in 10-min intervals. Thigmotaxis (wall-hugging) for each subject was determined by dividing the distance traveled in the 10-cm-wide perimeter of the chamber by the total distance traveled during the 2-hr session. For pharmacological studies, mice were injected with vehicle (10 mL/kg, i.p.), D1 receptor agonist SKF 38,393 (50 mg/kg, i.p.), or A2a receptor antagonist SCH 58,261 (3 mg/kg, i.p.), and then immediately placed in the open-field chambers. Activity was monitored for 1âhr. Dose response of the same drug treatments were done on the same mice starting from the low dose first with 2-day intervals between different doses. SKF 38,393 was dissolved in saline, and SCH 58,261 was dissolved in saline solution containing 10% DMSO and 10% Kolliphor EL (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).</p><p>Accelerating rotarod performance was tested using a five-station rotarod treadmill (IITC Rotarod, IITC Life Science,Â Woodland Hills, CA). Mice were habituated in the test room for an hour before the testing. Three trials were performed per day over 3 days for a total of nine trials for each animal. After placing a mouse on the rod, it was accelerated from 8 to 22 r.p.m. in 2âmin. The endurance of mice on the rotarod was measured by the time to fall to the floor of the apparatus, or to turn around one full revolution while hanging onto the drum.</p><p>Catalepsy was measured in the bar test. Briefly, one hour after haloperidol (2 mg/kg, i.p.) administration, mice forepaws were gently placed over a horizontal bar fixed at a height of 5 cm above the working surface. The length of time during which the animal retained this position until the removal of one of its forepaws was recorded with the cutoff time of 180âs.</p> <p>Grip strength of mice was assessed using Grip-Strength Meter (Ugo Basile,Â Italy). The mouse was placed over a base plate, in front of a grasping bar. The bar was fitted to a force transducer connected to the Peak Amplifier. When pulled by the tail, the mouse instinctively grasped to the bar until the pulling force overcomes their grip strength. After the mouse lost its grip on the grasping bar, a peak preamplifier automatically stored the peak pull force (in grams) achieved by the forelimbs. Grip strength of each mouse was averaged from 5 consecutive trials.</p><p>Acoustic startle response tests were performed in acoustic apparatuses with mouse enclosures (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) in sound-attenuating cubicles. The amplitude of each startle response was measured using a piezoelectric movementâsensitive platform. Acoustic stimuli and steady background noise (70 dB) were delivered through a loudspeaker. Briefly, mice were put in the mouse enclosures and acclimated for 2 min. Six trials of 40-ms 120 dB white noise bursts were then presented with a variable intertribal interval. Vmax values recorded by Acoustic Startle Program (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) were averaged from six startle trials for each mouse.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH grants: NS081282 (to ME and KAM), DA036596 (to KAM), EY012287 (to BMW), R01 NS050596, NS073930 (BX), grant 2015R1A2A2A01003413 from the Ministry of Science, Korea (to PLH), Platform for Drug Discovery, Informatics, and Structural Life Science from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan (to HU) and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 25893178 (to KS).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The concept of a signaling complex in the striatum is a fascinating observation worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there was concern about some of the data that needs to be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The co-IP expt in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> needs a specificity control. One way would be to use AC5<sup>â/â</sup> mouse. The lysate lanes should be shown for both WT and KO co-IP.</p><p>2) The BRET data need to be explained. Why is haloperidol reversing an effect through D1Rs? As it stands, these results are troubling and possibly mis-interpreted.</p><p>3) The interpretation of data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> needs to be clarified. The effect could all be explained by enzyme abundance change based on the previously known chaperone function of PhLP and not requiring complex or effects of G protein-GDP form as concluded.</p><p>4) More detail related to these concerns can be found below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Chaperone proteins have been found to play important roles in facilitating the formation of signaling complexes that could include receptors, G protein subunits and effectors. The present data suggest that the PhLP1 chaperone may play a central role in the assembly of AC5-G<sub>olf</sub> complex and in their signaling. This is a novel finding and has potentially important clinical implications.</p><p>The most striking data came from the PhLP1 conditional KO studies. Although the evidence for the role of PhLP1 in the assembly of AC5-G<sub>olf</sub> complex is indirect in these genetic data, they have convincingly demonstrated that PhLP1 deficiency leads to severely impaired G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 signaling and motor skill learning but not locomotion.</p><p>While the genetic data support the significance of PhLP1 in receptor signaling in vivo, it is often expected that in vitro biochemical studies could provide direct evidence for protein-protein interactions. Here the in vitro biochemical data overall provide further support for the proposed model. However, none of the data provide direct evidence. There are no data showing direct interactions between PhLP1 and AC5 or Golf. There is no direct evidence of impaired AC5-Golf complex in PhLP1 KO either. Changes in protein expression of Golf and AC5 in PhLP1 KO provide strong, but still indirect evidence. Other mechanisms cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Non-cAMP pathways are implicated in both D1 and D2 signaling. Do any of the data suggest that? For example, the lack of change in PhLP1 KO in response to D1 drugs. However, it's not clear why a D1 partial agonist SKF38393 was used.</p><p>AC1 and Gs are highly expressed in the striatum during embryonic and early postnatal development. Therefore cAMP signaling may not be impaired in the PhLP1 KO during development. Does this fact bring new interpretations to the knockout phenotype (for example, morphological changes in the striatum)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper claims that AC5, a highly expressed AC isoform in striatum, is in stable complex with GÎ²2Î³7 in vivo and this is required for stability of AC5. It also claims that AC5 stability requires stable association with Î±, Î² and Î³ together in complex, that PhLP1 is necessary to form this complex, and that disrupting the complex by PhLP1 knockout reduces striatal cAMP signaling and produces behavioral deficits. This leads the authors to propose a large signalosome containing all of these proteins and also RGS9, with assembly of this larger signalosome dependent on PhLP1.</p><p>The authors describe an interesting and quite extensive set of experiments showing that Golf supports AC5 protein expression, likely by increasing protein stability, and that AC5 has a converse effect on Golf abundance. They show that PhLP1 over-expression increases protein abundance in HEK2 cells. PhLP1 knockout in striatum causes the reverse, and also reduction in RGS9-2. Using this mouse they observe major cytological defects in striatum, reduced cAMP production in striatal membrane fractions, and deficits in motor behaviors.</p><p>I think that this is an interesting series of experiments that convincingly shows that PhLP1 is important to support Golf, AC5 and RGS9 protein abundance in striatum. On the more critical side, I personally like the larger signalosome idea but am not convinced of it from the data shown. As far as I can tell, all of the effects observed in the PhLP1 KO are consistent with changes in overall protein abundance from co-chaperone actions of PhLP1 in beta-gamma and beta-RGS9 complex formation. The effect on AC5 abundance might indicate that it is included in the complex but might also occur secondarily through changes in Golf subunit abundance. I also think that the signaling data seem consistent with effects of protein abundance changes rather than as evidence that signaling must occur from the larger complex. The knockout mouse is very interesting but there, also, I think that the effects might be explained in a simpler way. The behavioral deficits are interesting but quite complicated to interpret, due to the cytological defects noted.</p><p>1) The only direct evidence for the protein complexes claimed is in the co-IP shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. This lacks important controls. The simplest worry is that AC5 IgG could just be sticky compared to control IgG. Different batches of non-immune serum can vary widely in nonspecific binding. One can even get tricked by pre-immune serum from the same animal due to inflammation (acute phase effect). Here the investigators have an AC5 KO mouse. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> there should be a variant of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> co-IP with AC5<sup>â/â</sup> striatum. Alternative would be to use HEK2 cells to ask, at least in that system, how much Î±, Î² and Î³ come down in the absence of AC5 over-expression. If I understand correctly, one would also expect non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue to partially dissociate the complex but this is not shown or discussed.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> reports a BRET assay designed to detect Golf activation based on free beta-gamma binding to a NanoLuc-labeled GRK2. 10 Î¼M dopamine caused a BRET change that was reversed by 100 Î¼M haloperidol. However, haloperidol is a D2 and not D1 antagonist, and D1 but not D2 receptors couple to Golf. Of course 100 Î¼M is a huge concentration of haloperidol, but so is 10 Î¼M of dopamine. Based on simple competition, I don't think a 10-fold excess of haloperidol will displace dopamine at D1 receptors. This makes think that the BRET results are spurious and incorrectly interpreted.</p><p>3) The increased basal AC activity described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> is proposed to represent enzyme activation by free Î±-GDP subunits due to PhLP1 over-expression. I don't understand this logic because AC5 protein levels are increased. Isn't a simpler explanation that the basal activity is increased due to more AC5 protein as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>? I also don't see how results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> control for the observed change in forskolin potency because one would not expect a difference with activated G protein instead of forskolin â here there is not synergy but, if anything, competition that might produce an opposite effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10451.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The co-IP expt in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> needs a specificity control.

As expected, we see no Golf pull-down from knockout lysates confirming the specificity of the AC5-G<sub>olf</sub>co-immunoprecipitation. These results are reported in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The BRET data need to be explained. Why is haloperidol reversing an effect through D1Rs? As it stands, these results are troubling and possibly mis-interpreted.</italic> </p><p>In our system we use antagonist solely to demonstrate reversibility of the signal, which serves to indicate that the effect of dopamine is mediated by the signaling initiated by the D1R. All of our conclusions are derived from analyzing the maximal responses to agonist (dopamine) application. Although classically defined as D2 antagonist, haloperidol has a reasonable affinity for D1R as well, 63 nM (JBC, 1986, 8397). We performed additional experiments, demonstrating that the BRET signal is specifically associated with the activity of the D1R and exogenous Golf and showed the equivalence of haloperidol to a more selective D1R antagonist SCH39166 in the assays. These experiments are presented in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The interpretation of data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> needs to be clarified. The effect could all be explained by enzyme abundance change based on the previously known chaperone function of PhLP and not requiring complex or effects of G protein-GDP form as concluded.</italic> </p><p>We are glad that the reviewers brought up this point, which we agree was not sufficiently discussed. Based on accumulated data, we think PhLP1 affects AC5 activity by a dual mechanism. On the one hand, it upregulates AC5 activity and this effect is likely responsible for the corresponding increase in receptor stimulated cAMP production (compare ~1.7 fold expression upregulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> to ~ 1.5 fold of ISO driven cAMP production in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the changes in basal or FSK-induced cAMP production (~4-fold) are much greater than the change in the AC5 expression level. This suggests the involvement of other mechanisms by which PhLP1 could regulate AC5 activity. Indeed in panels <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> though 3G we provide evidence that exogenously added PhLP1 can also stimulate AC5 by releasing GÎ±olf from the inhibitory constraints of GÎ²Î³. We clarified these points in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>While the genetic data support the significance of PhLP1 in receptor signaling in vivo, it is often expected that in vitro biochemical studies could provide direct evidence for protein-protein interactions. Here the in vitro biochemical data overall provide further support for the proposed model. However, none of the data provide direct evidence. There are no data showing direct interactions between PhLP1 and AC5 or Golf. There is no direct evidence of impaired AC5-G<sub>olf</sub>complex in PhLP1 KO either. Changes in protein expression of Golf and AC5 in PhLP1 KO provide strong, but still indirect evidence. Other mechanisms cannot be ruled out.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate reviewerâs understanding that this report is the first to demonstrate the involvement of PhLP1 in controlling assembly of G protein signaling complexes in the striatum. Establishing the role, this study covers a wide territory from behavioral analysis of mouse behavior to alterations in signaling reactions and biochemical studies of protein complexes. When building the model describing PhLP1 involvement, we rely on previous biochemical studies that established and extensively characterized direct interactions of PHLP1 with GÎ²Î³ subunits (PNAS, 2015, 2413; JBC, 2009, 16386; Biochemistry, 1998, 15758). We understand that further studies will likely be needed to examine whether in addition to GÎ²Î³ binding, PhLP1 also forms direct interactions with AC5 or GÎ±olf. Thus, our scheme summarizing the conclusions from this work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) is tempered and reflects only what we established beyond reasonable doubt (indirect effects through GÎ²Î³).</p><p><italic>Non-cAMP pathways are implicated in both D1 and D2 signaling. Do any of the data suggest that? For example, the lack of change in PhLP1 KO in response to D1 drugs. However, it's not clear why a D1 partial agonist SKF38393 was used.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct; we did not consider that non-cAMP pathways initiated by the D1R may compensate for the down-regulation of G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 signaling branch. We discuss this possibility in the revised manuscript. The choice of SKF38393 was dictated by its selectivity for D1 receptor and extensive use in hundreds of similar studies, creating a convenient reference for the expected effects or the lack of thereof.</p><p><italic>AC1 and Gs are highly expressed in the striatum during embryonic and early postnatal development. Therefore cAMP signaling may not be impaired in the PhLP1 KO during development. Does this fact bring new interpretations to the knockout phenotype (for example, morphological changes in the striatum)?</italic> </p><p>The Cre driver line that we used to knockout PhLP1 in the striatum (<italic>Rgs9-Cre</italic>) turns on the expression rather late in development, ~ P6 (J Neurosci, 2007, 27:14117). This coincides with the induction of Golf expression and maturation of medium spiny neurons. Thus, we think that morphological changes in the striatum that we observe are related to changes in G<sub>olf</sub>-AC5 signaling. However, mechanisms of morphological changes in striatal neurons were not an emphasis of this report, hence we rather focused on signaling changes in adult brains. However, we agree that examining developmental mechanisms might be an important question to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) The only direct evidence for the protein complexes claimed is in the co-IP shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

In respect to interpretation of data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, the experiment simply shows that PhLP1 is ineffective when activated GÎ±s is provided in the assay, because exogenous GÎ±s-GTP would compete with endogenous GÎ±olf-GDP released by PhLP1.
