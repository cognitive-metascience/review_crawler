Although several P2X3 structures are known, it is unclear how physiologically abundant Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP activate the receptor, or how divalent cations regulate channel function. We used structural, computational and functional approaches to show that a crucial acidic chamber near the nucleotide-binding pocket in human P2X3 receptors accommodates divalent ions in two distinct modes in the absence and presence of nucleotide. The unusual engagement between the receptor, divalent ion and the γ-phosphate of ATP enables channel activation by ATP-divalent complex, cooperatively stabilizes the nucleotide on the receptor to slow ATP unbinding and recovery from desensitization, a key mechanism for limiting channel activity. These findings reveal how P2X3 receptors recognize and are activated by divalent-bound ATP, aiding future physiological investigations and drug development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Mg-ATP</kwd><kwd>divalent cations</kwd><kwd>Mg binding sites</kwd><kwd>Ca binding sites</kwd><kwd>forms of ATP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swartz</surname><given-names>Kenton Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Faraldo-Gómez</surname><given-names>José D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012165</institution-id><institution>Key Technologies Research and Development Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattori</surname><given-names>Motoyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattori</surname><given-names>Motoyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011211</institution-id><institution>State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattori</surname><given-names>Motoyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Office of Global Experts Recruitment in China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattori</surname><given-names>Motoyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural, computational and functional approaches reveal the role of an extended acidic chamber near the nucleotide binding site in activation of P2X3 receptor channels by divalent-bound ATP.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>P2X3 receptors are a family of trimeric cation channels that are activated by extracellular ATP.

This unusually long recovery time limits channel activation frequency, which may be an important protective mechanism for preventing sensory hypersensitivity. The molecular mechanisms underlying these unique gating processes remain to be fully established. X-ray structures of human P2X3 (hP2X3) receptor channels have recently been solved in the absence of ATP, as well as bound to free-ATP (i.e. ATP not complexed with a divalent ion) or to antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>). These structures elegantly reveal how free-ATP binds to the large extracellular domain to open the transmembrane pore, and to subsequently close during the process of desensitization. Specifically, the nucleotide adopts a bent pose with the adenosine ring positioned above an aromatic residue (F174), the α−phosphate group interacting with S275, and the β− and γ−phosphates intimately engaging with K63, K65, K299, R281 and N279 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hattori and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47060.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>X-ray structures of hP2X3 receptors with divalent ions bound..</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall structure of hP2X3 MFC<sub>slow</sub> with ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> bound (PDB ID 6AH5).

From the available structure of hP2X3 bound by free-ATP, it is unclear how the receptor might accommodate a divalent-bound nucleotide. When ATP is in solution, the divalent ion preferably interacts with the β− and γ−phosphate groups simultaneously, or alternatively, with all three phosphate groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branduardi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohn and Hughes, 1962</xref>). Whether these interactions are compatible with those observed between free ATP and the receptor in the ATP-bound structure is unclear; even if they are, the presence of divalent ions would effectively weaken the interaction between agonist and receptor, which would be physiologically counterintuitive. It would seem reasonable to anticipate that when bound to the receptor, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP interact differently than when in solution. Intriguingly, a Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding site was identified in previous structures of hP2X3 in the absence of ATP (apo), or in the presence of antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). However, from the comparison of free-ATP bound and Mg<sup>2+</sup> bound apo structures, this site would be too far from the nucleotide-binding pocket to directly interact with ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), making its functional significance unclear. To add to the complexity of P2X3 receptor activation in the presence of divalent cations, Mg<sup>2+</sup> has been reported to inhibit P2X3 receptors and Ca<sup>2+</sup> to stimulate the activity of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cook et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giniatullin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2013</xref>). To elucidate the mechanisms of these physiologically and therapeutically important ion channels, it is essential to determine the sites and mechanisms of divalent ion action. We therefore set out to elucidate the mechanism by which Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP activate P2X3 receptors, and to explore how divalent cations regulate the receptor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structures of hP2X3 receptor reveal Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATP bind in a unique mode</title><p>We began by crystalizing the hP2X3 MFC<sub>slow</sub> construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>) in solutions containing ATP with either Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This construct shows minimal desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hausmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>), and was previously used to obtain an open state structure of hP2X3 with free-ATPbound. We solved X-ray structures of the receptor with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATP bound at resolutions of 3.8 Å and 3.3 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The pores appear to be in an open-like conformation in both structures, similar to that observed in the structure of hP2X3 bound to free-ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, we observed strong residual electron densities around the ATP binding site in these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Considering that the crystallization conditions included either 50 mM Mg-acetate or 50 mM Ca-acetate with no other divalent cations, and that the electron densities are surrounded by acidic residues, we interpreted the densities as Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, respectively. In both structures, the divalent ions are detected at the edge of the ATP binding pocket, simultaneously interacting with D158 on the receptor and with the γ-phosphate of ATP; E156 is also positioned nearby and appears to be involved in coordinating the ion. Because the similar binding sites we observed for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> imply a common mechanism for activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP, we largely focused our efforts on Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP so we could take advantage of the more extensive data on this form of divalent-bound ATP.</p><p>A survey of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) reveals that the geometry of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATP complexes observed in our structures is highly unusual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Among non-redundant structures determined at 2.5 Å resolution or better with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP (or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATP) bound (see Materials and methods), only 4% (or none) feature a complex in which Mg<sup>2+</sup> is coordinated solely by the γ-phosphate (and 2% for the AMP-PNP analog). The prevalent geometries are instead those in which Mg<sup>2+</sup> is coordinated by both the β- and γ-phosphates or by all three phosphate groups concurrently. These two interaction modes are also the most energetically favorable when Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP is in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branduardi et al., 2016</xref>). That the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP complex observed in our structures adopts a rare configuration suggests that interactions between the receptor and divalent ions have a dominant effect in determining the structure and stability of the complex.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47060.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Computational study of the mode of ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> recognition by P2X3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Occurrence of different modes of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATP interaction in non-redundant high-resolution crystal structures available in the Protein Data Bank.

In those previous structures, Mg<sup>2+</sup> was proposed to be coordinated by the side chains of E109 and D158, and the carbonyl oxygen of E156, which we designate as the ‘upper’ mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>). Although Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the upper mode is near the ATP binding pocket, it is too far to interact directly with the bound nucleotide. Conversely, in our ATP-bound structure, with Mg<sup>2+</sup> directly coordinated by the ATP γ-phosphate and D158, the ion is ~9 Å away from the side chain of E109. The key residue involved in both binding modes is D158, whose side chain points towards E109 for the upper mode or towards the γ-phosphate of ATP for the lower mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). Therefore, these structures not only reveal the mode of recognition of ATP in its physiologically predominant forms with Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> bound, but also demonstrate how the acidic chamber near the nucleotide binding pocket enables the receptor to accommodate Mg<sup>2+</sup> in two distinct configurations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Simulations reveal Mg<sup>2+</sup> displacement to upper mode results from ATP dissociation</title><p>Our crystal structures suggest a correlation between the mode of Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding to P2X3, that is lower or upper mode, and the presence or absence of ATP. To evaluate whether there is a causal relationship between these two observations, we devised a molecular-simulation protocol to induce the spontaneous dissociation of ATP from the receptor and evaluated how Mg<sup>2+</sup> responds to this event (see Materials and methods). In this protocol, based on the solute-tempering method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2005</xref>), a scaling factor is used to weaken the interactions of a ligand (i.e. ATP) with both the surrounding solvent and receptor (i.e. P2X3 with bound Mg<sup>2+</sup>). As a result, the free-energy barriers and minima that underlie ligand binding and unbinding become shallower, accelerating the kinetics of these processes exponentially. Dissociation trajectories can be therefore observed within a relatively short simulation time, without imposing a specific direction of movement or time course.</p><p>Following this strategy, we produced tens of ATP-dissociation trajectories with varying scaling factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then analyzed our simulation data to determine the most populated configuration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> once ATP dissociates, and how it differs from that preferred in the ATP-bound state. In the presence of ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the simulation data (obtained with a conventional algorithm) is highly consistent with our crystal structures, showing stable close-range interactions between Mg<sup>2+</sup> and both the ATP γ-phosphate and D158 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The ion retains part of its first hydration shell, and water molecules mediate additional interactions with E156, E111 and E109 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The γ- and β-phosphates are also tightly coordinated by multiple basic sidechains in the receptor, some of which concurrently form salt-bridges with the acidic sidechains coordinating Mg<sup>2+</sup>, that is K299-D158 and R281-E156 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Altogether, this network of electrostatic interactions appears to mediate a highly stable complex with a well-defined geometry. Following ATP dissociation, this mode of Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding changes noticeably and reproducibly. We detect a clear upward shift in the preferred location of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent for all three protein subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), despite the fact that ATP dissociation from each site occurs at different time points in the simulations. This displacement is seemingly driven by a re-optimization of ion-protein interactions upon ATP release. Specifically, D158, E109 and E111 reorient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>) to interact with the ion at a closer distance, whether directly or via water molecules, while E156 is approximately unchanged (so are the K299-D158, R281-E156 salt-bridges) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

The observation that divalent ions mediate additional interactions between ATP and P2X3 suggests that the ions might slow ATP dissociation. We examined this possibility computationally by inducing ATP-dissociation trajectories from a receptor lacking a divalent ion bound, following the same protocol outlined above. Using this data and that obtained for Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP bound P2X3, we derived the apparent ATP dissociation probability as a function of the interaction-scaling factor, in the absence or presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. As anticipated, the simulation results show that the ATP dissociation probability increases as the value of the scaling factor decreases, whether Mg<sup>2+</sup> is present or not, with sigmoidal-like dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Crucially, though, the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> produces a clear left-shift in this trend, indicating that Mg<sup>2+</sup> strengthens the effective ATP-receptor interaction. Moreover, the sigmoidal slope becomes steeper (by about a factor of 2), indicating Mg<sup>2+</sup> and receptor act cooperatively. Indeed, in many simulated trajectories we observe Mg<sup>2+</sup> holding on to a partially unbound nucleotide, fostering re-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Altogether these results substantiate the hypothesis that the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in our ATP-bound P2X3 structures is not incidental; rather, the ion appears to be a dominant contributing factor to the lifetime and geometry of the ligand-receptor complex.</p><p>To experimentally test this hypothesis, we used electrophysiological measurements. Characterizing the dissociation of ATP using functional approaches is not possible for wild-type hP2X3 because the receptor desensitizes much faster than ATP unbinds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook and McCleskey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giniatullin and Nistri, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sokolova et al., 2006</xref>). Instead we used whole-cell patch clamp recordings of a slowly desensitizing mutant, and measured the time required for channel closure (deactivation) after removing external ATP, both in the absence and presence of divalent cations. ATP unbinding is the rate-limiting step for closure or deactivation of the slowly desensitizing P2X receptor channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rettinger and Schmalzing, 2004</xref>), and we therefore used the kinetics of channel deactivation in hP2X3 slow as a measure of the kinetics of ATP unbinding. The hP2X3 slow construct used for these experiments was generated by mutating three residues in the N-terminus (T13P/S15V/V16I) to greatly slow desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hausmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>). In the absence of divalent cations, the hP2X3 slow construct deactivates with a time constant of 2.1 ± 0.3 s following removal of external ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). By contrast, the presence of 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> slowed deactivation by ~8-fold, while 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> slowed deactivation by ~ 4 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), suggesting that both ions slow ATP dissociation. In addition to these results obtained at pH 7.3, we also tested the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> at pH 5.0, the acidic condition used for crystallization, and observed that 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> increased the deactivation time constant from 0.7 ± 0.1 s to 6.6 ± 0.6 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The deactivation time constants were faster at pH 5.0, in agreement with previous reports that P2X3 receptors have a lower affinity for ATP under acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerevich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wildman et al., 1999</xref>). Although both Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions slow hP2X3 slow deactivation, the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is more modest when compared to Mg<sup>2+</sup>, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> might compete with Mg<sup>2+</sup> to hasten unbinding under physiological conditions. We estimated divalent cation affinity by measuring the deactivation time constant in the presence of different concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and obtained an EC<sub>50</sub> of 102 µM for Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 39 µM for Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>), revealing that all receptors are regulated by divalent ions under physiological conditions and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> might play a more prominent role. When we tested a physiological solution containing 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we measured a deactivation time constant of 10.2 ± 1.8 s, close to that with 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), even though the concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP would be similar in this solution because the stability constant for Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to ATP is weaker than for Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In addition to prolonging deactivation, stabilizing ATP on the receptor would be expected to increase the apparent affinity for ATP activation of the receptor. We therefore constructed concentration-response relations for ATP activation of hP2X3 slow in the absence and presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. We found that 0.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> shifts the EC<sub>50</sub> from 40 nM to 18 nM, demonstrating that Mg<sup>2+</sup> increases the apparent ATP affinity for the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47060.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> slow deactivation of hP2X3 receptors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superimposed fast-desensitizing hP2X3 wt (orange) and slow-desensitizing hP2X3 slow (black) macroscopic receptor channel currents activated by extracellular application of a saturating concentration of free ATP (10 µM) in the presence of EDTA (10 mM).

Once activated, channels rapidly desensitize in the continuous presence of ATP, with the kinetics of current decay being well fit by a double exponential function, with time constants (τ) that were not discernably different in the absence or presence of either Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> or a physiological concentration of the two ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). We then investigated the kinetics of recovery from desensitization by reapplying ATP at different time points after the initial ATP application that activates and desensitizes the receptors. The time constant for recovery from desensitization in the absence of divalent cations was 63 ± 8 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), significantly faster than previous results obtained using physiological concentrations of divalent ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook and McCleskey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cook et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast, recovery from desensitization was slowed by almost 4-fold (τ = 248 ± 71 s) in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM) and to a lesser extent by external Ca<sup>2+</sup> (τ = 115 ± 42 s at 1 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

These results demonstrate that Mg<sup>2+</sup> (and to a lesser extent Ca<sup>2+</sup>) stabilizes a desensitized state of the hP2X3 receptor, most likely by increasing stability of the receptor-ATP complex.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47060.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Influence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> on desensitization of hP2X3 receptor channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Macroscopic wt hP2X3 receptor channel currents activated by a saturating concentration of ATP (300 μM) under different conditions.

Interestingly, although the onset of desensitization for D158A is similar to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>), the mutant slowed recovery from desensitization in the absence of divalent ions, consistent with slower deactivation of D158A mutant in hP2X3 slow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) (τ = 140 s for D158A compared to τ = 63 s for wild-type).

In contrast, when both E156A and D158A mutants were combined, we observed considerably weakened activation by Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>), indicating that the lower mode is important for Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP activation. We also observed a ‘resurgent’ current upon removal of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP from the external solution in the E156A/D158A double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). A similar resurgent current was previously observed for the P2X2 receptor following removal of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP solutions, where we established that the receptor can bind both free ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP, but that only free ATP can robustly promote channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2013</xref>). In the case of P2X2 receptors, the resurgent current appears following removal of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP because Mg<sup>2+</sup> unbinds more rapidly than free ATP, giving rise to the transient activation by free ATP remaining on the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>). Interestingly, when either the D158A or E156A mutants in the lower mode were combined with either the E109A or E111A mutants within the upper mode, we also observed greatly reduced activation by Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP and a resurgent current upon removal of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).

Collectively, our results show how the receptor uses an acidic chamber to accommodate those ions in two distinct modes; either bound in the lower mode where the ion interacts with the γ-phosphate of ATP, or in the upper mode in the absence of the nucleotide. The interaction between divalent ions and the ATP γ-phosphate seen in our crystal structures is distinct from that in most other structures in the PDB and also from that typical of ATP in solution; in both cases, the divalent ions preferentially interact with both β-and γ-phosphates of the nucleotide. Our computational and functional results collectively show that binding of Mg<sup>2+</sup> stabilizes ATP on the receptor, slowing unbinding and recovery from desensitization, and increasing the apparent affinity for ATP, with similar results for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in functional experiments. Our mutagenesis results show that the acidic chamber is required for activation of the receptor when divalent-bound forms of ATP predominate in solution. Although the lower mode of divalent binding is critical for activation by divalent-bound ATP, the upper mode also seems to play a role because combining mutations in the two modes diminishes activation when divalent-bound forms of the nucleotide predominate.</p><p>Our results suggest that the following sequence of events occur as divalent-bound ATP binds to activate P2X3 receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We know that Mg<sup>2+</sup> can bind to the upper mode seen in the X-ray structure of apo hP2X3 when present in mM concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>), so we assume that the upper mode would be occupied by Mg<sup>2+</sup> (and likely Ca<sup>2+</sup>) under physiological conditions prior to the recognition of divalent-bound ATP. In one scenario, initial engagement of divalent-bound ATP with the receptor would weaken the interaction of the ion bound to the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP; in addition, dissociation of the ion would be fostered by the ion occupying the upper mode in the acidic chamber, as this ion shifts to the lower mode to interact with the γ-phosphate of ATP, while still engaged to E156 and D158. In our simulations, both ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (in the lower mode) remain stably associated with the receptor, and when ATP dissociation is accelerated the ion spontaneously moves from the lower mode to the upper mode, demonstrating the existence of a pathway for the movement of divalent ions between the two modes and reinforcing the idea that ion binding within the upper mode is favored in the absence of the nucleotide. An alternate scenario would be that when divalent-bound ATP is recognized by the receptor, it is the divalent ion originally occupying the upper mode that dissociates, allowing the ion bound to β− and γ−phosphates of ATP to reposition to the lower mode seen in our X-ray structures. Our simulations do not permit us to discriminate between these two scenarios, as they probe the dissociation of ATP only. Nevertheless, two arguments can be put forward in favor of the first scenario. From a structural standpoint, dissociation of the ion occupying the upper mode appears less likely because it would be sterically hindered not only by the surrounding receptor but also ATP itself; by contrast, the ion bound to ATP would be completely exposed to the solvent. In addition, a mechanism whereby the ion bound to ATP must dissociate to permit complete agonist recognition and channel activation would be applicable to P2X2 receptors and P2X3 E109A/E156A/D158A mutants, which as noted above, can bind divalent-bound ATP even though the complex does not promote robust activation of the receptor.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47060.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of the mechanism of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATP activation of P2X3 receptor channels.</title><p>Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to hP2X3 receptors in the upper mode under physiological conditions. When ATP divalent cation complex (M-ATP) enters the nucleotide binding pocket, a divalent cation will rapidly dissociate, leaving one to be coordinated by the γ-phosphate of ATP and residues E156 and D158. The divalent cation sandwiched between ATP and receptor strengthens the effective ATP-receptor interaction, and also fosters re-binding of ATP molecules that become transiently dislodged from the nucleotide-binding pocket, rendering a very slow recovery from desensitization for hP2X3 receptors. Only two of three subunits of a hP2X3 receptor are shown for clarity.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47060-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In both of these scenarios, the P2X3 receptor uses the acidic chamber to enable activation and to stabilize ATP on the receptor in the presence of divalent ions. Following receptor activation and desensitization, dissociation of ATP would be much slower in the presence of divalent ions, in no small part due to the divalent ion anchoring the nucleotide to D158. Not only does this ion (at this position) strengthen the effective ATP-receptor interaction; it also fosters re-binding of ATP molecules that become transiently dislodged from the nucleotide-binding pocket, that is the dissociation (and recognition) process becomes cooperative. When the wild-type P2X3 receptor is not occupied by Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and ATP is recognized in its free form under divalent-free laboratory conditions, binding is likely suboptimal because D158 is electrostatically repulsive with the γ-phosphate of ATP. Consistent with this hypothesis, when D158 is mutated to Ala, receptors actually hold on to ATP more strongly than the wild-type in the absence of divalent ions, as reflected in slower ATP dissociation and recovery from desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,F</xref>). In contrast, for the D158A mutant, when the agonist is an ATP-divalent complex, the incoming ion bound to the nucleotide would be less likely to move away from β− and γ−phosphates of ATP, and ATP would thus spend more time in a conformation that is in part incompatible with the intricate network of receptor-ligand-solvent interactions observed in the wild-type receptor, resulting in accelerated ATP dissociation and recovery from desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Consistent with this model, a priori disruption of this network, for example in the E109A/E156A/D158A mutant, results in minimal Mg<sup>2+</sup> effects, but ATP binding is markedly weakened, with dramatically accelerated dissociation and recovery from desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have uncovered a previously unrecognized structural element in P2X3 receptors that is essential for channel activation under physiological conditions where divalent-bound forms of ATP predominate. Our results also reveal that divalent ions play a fundamental role in tuning the gating properties of P2X3 receptors. By hampering ATP dissociation, acting cooperatively with the protein, divalent ions slow down the receptor recovery from desensitization, thereby reducing the frequency with which the channel is available for activation by extracellular ATP. Interestingly, the influence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on stabilizing ATP on the receptor and slowing recovery from desensitization is less pronounced than for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which could explain why Ca<sup>2+</sup> can facilitate activation of P2X3 receptors in physiological solutions containing Mg<sup>2+</sup> in response to repeated applications of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook and McCleskey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cook et al., 1998</xref>).

Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Survey of ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> complexes in the Protein Data Bank</title><p>The statistical analysis described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> comprises entries in the PDB obtained through X-ray crystallography at a resolution higher than or equal to 2.5 Å and containing at least one ATP bound to one Mg<sup>2+</sup> (or Ca<sup>2+</sup>) ion. Redundant structures with more that 70% of sequence identity were eliminated from this set. Structures in which ATP is bound concurrently to Mg<sup>2+</sup>(or Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and other cations were also eliminated. The resulting sets includes 171 entries (12 entries for Ca<sup>2+</sup>). An analogous set of 152 entries was obtained for Mg<sup>2+</sup> complexes with the non-hydrolysable ATP analog AMP-PNP. Both sets were divided into classes according the proximity of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and each of the phosphate groups in the ATP tri-phosphate moiety. For example in the configuration referred as ‘βγ’, Mg<sup>2+</sup> is directly and concurrently coordinated only by oxygen atoms in the β- and γ-phosphate groups. To carry out this classification in practice, we defined and calculated the following ‘ion-coordination number’ for each of the phosphate groups and each of the PDB entries:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>d</italic> (O, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) denotes an oxygen-Mg<sup>2+</sup> distance, <italic>s</italic> denotes either the α-, β- or γ-phosphates, and <italic>i</italic> denotes each of the oxygen atoms in each phosphate not forming the ATP backbone (i.e. three atoms in γ, and two atoms in α and β).

The integration time-step was 2 fs. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME method with a real-space cut-off of 12 Å; van-der-Waals interactions were also cut-off at 12 Å, with a switching function turned on at 10 Å. Periodic boundary conditions were used. The simulations of ATP-bound P2X3 in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> were based on PDB entry 5SVK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>). Those of P2X3 bound to ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> were based on PDB entry 5SVL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>). In the latter, a density signal near the ATP γ-phosphate designated as Na<sup>+</sup> in the PDB entry was reassigned as Mg<sup>2+</sup>; this assignment is confirmed by the crystal structures reported here. Each of the simulation systems is a cubic box of side approximately equal to 100 Å. The systems comprise the extracellular domain of P2X3 (residues 47 to 317), immersed in a 100 mM KCl solution (plus counterions neutralizing the total charge). Disulfide bonds were assumed between residues 107 and 153, 116 and 137, 122 and 147, 203 and 213, and 247 and 256, in all three protomers. Following a PROPKA evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bas et al., 2008</xref>), all ionizable residues were set to be in their default state at pH 7, with the exception of Glu109 in the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free ATP-bound structure. Three types of simulations were carried out for each system, in three consecutive stages. The first stage, or equilibration, comprised a sequence of simulations during which the dynamics of the protein-ligand complex is limited, primarily through internal-coordinate restraints (RMSD, distance restraints), to a degree that is gradually diminished over a period of 85 ns. In the second stage, a simulation of 50 ns was carried whereby the structural dynamics of the complex was for the most part unrestricted; however, to preclude large deviations resulting from the deletion of the transmembrane domain, a weak restraint was applied to approximately maintain the relative arrangement of the secondary-structure elements of the protein as in the experimental structure of the full-length complex. Specifically, this restraint is a harmonic function of the RMSD of the backbone, relative to the X-ray structure, with force constant <italic>k</italic> = 1 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>. On average, the RMSD values of the resulting ensembles of protein configurations are 1.5 ± 0.2 Å for the secondary-structure core and 2.3 ± 0.3 Å for all backbone; that is this weak restraint is such that the variability of the configurations explored by the protein is not unlike what could be expected for a simulation of the full-length protein. A third set of MD simulations were carried out subsequently for both the P2X3-ATP and P2X3-ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> complex, whereby the dissociation of ATP was induced using the so-called solute-tempering method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jo and Jiang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). That is, the energy function was modified so as to scale down the non-bonded interactions of ATP with all other components in the simulation system by a factor <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">λ</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:math></inline-formula>; non-bonded interactions within ATP were also scaled, down, by a factor λ. After a series of initial tests, a total of 80 independent simulations of 50 ns each were carried out for the P2X3-ATP complex, for λ values equal to 0.20, 0.25, 0.30 and 0.35 (20 trajectories for each value of λ). An Analogously for the P2X3-ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> complex, 120 simulations were carried out with λ values equal to 0.12, 0.15, 0.175, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30. The dissociation of ATP from each of the 3 protein subunits was monitored over time by evaluating (1) the distance between the centers-of-mass of ATP and the residues defining its binding site (Thr172, Lys63, Lys65, Arg281, Arg299; hydrogen atoms excluded), or <italic>D</italic><sub>1</sub>, and (2) the distance between the ATP γ-phosphorus atom and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, or <italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub>. In our simulation of the P2X3-ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> complex with unperturbed intramolecular interactions, the characteristic values of <italic>D</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub> are 5.9 ± 0.3 and 3.2 ± 0.1 Å, respectively. The density maps, snapshots and distributions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-D, 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> derive from this simulation. To evaluate the ATP-dissociated state, from the solute-tempering trajectories, we first considered all snapshots for which <italic>D</italic><sub>1</sub> &gt; 12 Å and concurrently <italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub> &gt; 5 Å (each binding site in the protein trimer was analyzed separately). The distributions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-D</xref> describe these configurations, combining the data obtained for all λ values and all binding sites. (Note that the solute-tempering scheme does not perturb the inter- or intra-molecular interactions for the receptor, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and solvent, so once ATP dissociates, the dynamics of the P2X3-Mg<sup>2+</sup> complex is represented with the standard energy function.) These distributions are however not stationary, as they reflect an evolving configuration of the P2X3-Mg<sup>2+</sup> complex. For clarity, therefore, the density maps and snapshots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-D, 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref> reflect the subset of this data that appears representative of the emerging most-populated configuration, namely all snapshots of the P2X3-Mg<sup>2+</sup> complex (with ATP dissociated) in which the distance between Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the carboxyl groups of D158, E156, E111 and E109 is equal or smaller than 6 Å.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell culture and transfection for electrophysiology</title><p>Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells were purchased from ATCC (ATCC CRL-1573), cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 mg/L gentamicin. Following an initial passage, cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen using Freezing Media (Life Technologies) and these aliquots used to generate subsequent cultures. To minimize cell variability, cells were used with fewer than 15 passages (&lt;2 months). All cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies. Trypsin treated HEK293 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 35 mm dish or 6-well plates the day of transfection and placed in a 37°C incubator with 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Transfections were performed using FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Promega). hP2X3 receptors were co-transfected with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA construct pcDNA3-Clover (addgene) at a ratio of 2:1. Cells were used for whole-cell recording 18–30 hr after transfection. hP2X3 in pCMV6-XL4 was purchased from OriGENE and then cloned into pcDNA3. All the mutations were introduced into hP2X3 using QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit and verified by DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Whole-cell patch clamp recording</title><p>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were used to record P2X receptor channel currents from transiently transfected HEK-293 cells. Membrane currents were recorded under voltage-clamp using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc) and digitized on-line using a Digidata 1322A interface board and pCLAMP 9.2 software (Axon Instruments, Inc). Currents were filtered at 2 kHz using 8-pole Bessel filters, and digitized at 5 or 10 kHz. The pipette solution for standard whole-cell recording on HEK cells contained (mM): 140 NaCl, 10 EGTA and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.0 with NaOH. The divalent-free extracellular solution contained (mM): 140 NaCl, 10 EDTA, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.3 or 5.0 with NaOH. Assuming that divalent ion contaminations from reagents and water is less than 1 μM, any possible free divalent cations in the 10 mM EDTA solution would be less than 0.5 nM. The extracellular solutions with different concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> contained (mM): 140 NaCl, 10 HEPES, and desired concentration of MgCl<sub>2</sub> or CaCl<sub>2</sub>, adjusted to pH 7.3 or 5.0. Na<sub>2</sub>ATP (referred to as ATP) was used in all the experiments. The stability constants of ATP binding to cations present in our solutions are: Mg<sup>2+</sup> 10<sup>4.10</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> 10<sup>3.76</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> 10<sup>0.83</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup> 10<sup>1.17</sup> (NIST Critically Selected Stability Constants of Metal Complexes). Max Chelator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://maxchelator.stanford.edu">http://maxchelator.stanford.edu</ext-link>) was used to calculate concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, MgATP<sup>2-</sup> and ATP<sup>4-</sup> in solutions with different concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and ATP. Recording solutions were adjusted to the correct pH after adding MgCl<sub>2</sub> and ATP. Solution exchange was achieved using either the Rapid Solution Changer RSC-200 (BioLogic), which can change solution within ~ 50 ms and has the capacity of switching between nine solutions to construct dose-response relationships, or a Piezo driven system (AutoMate Scientific), which can change between two solutions within 1 ms to resolve rapidly desensitizing currents. To generate concentration-response relationships, a reference concentration of ATP was applied before each test concentration was applied, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2008</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Baron Chanda as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce P Bean (Reviewer #2); Lucie Delemotte (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>P2X3 receptors are involved in sensing nociceptive and gustatory stimuli. They are activated by extracellular ATP and are the targets for inflammatory and neuropathic pain. P2X3 receptors form homotrimeric channels that activate and desensitize within a few milliseconds upon ATP binding. However, these channels recover from desensitization, which is accompanied by ATP unbinding in minutes time scale. This slow recovery from desensitization is necessary to prevent hypersensitivity. In the absence of divalent cations, these channels recover from desensitized state rapidly, which suggests that the divalent cations are essential for normal physiological response. The currently available structures of the ATP bound P2X receptor do not show any evidence of divalent cations. Moreover, the divalent ion present in apo-structure is not compatible with ATP binding. But most importantly, the ATP in physiological solution is complexed to Ca and Mg, whereas the current ATP bound P2X structure implies that ATP is somehow stripped of its divalent cation upon binding to the receptor.</p><p>To address these questions, the authors have taken a multipronged approach of combining x-ray crystallography with molecular simulations and functional analyses. Together, they make a compelling case that the tripartite complex formed by a divalent cation, ATP and receptor constitutes the physiologically relevant desensitized/open state structure of the channel. Molecular simulations based on solute tempering method show that the transition from the resting to open state involve a pre-open state where two magnesium ions are bound per subunit. Functional studies reveal that the divalent cations are crucial for slow desensitization and neutralization of acidic residues affect activation by Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP. This is a comprehensive and elegant study that addresses a long-standing puzzle in the field and provides new insight into the physiological mechanisms of channel activation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Based on my reading of the manuscript, the structure presented in this manuscript represents the channel in the desensitized or open state. I understand that ascribing a functional state to X-ray structure is tricky but it gives non-specialist readers some perspective. Is there a particular reason that the authors are more circumspect?</p><p>2) In Figure 3H, the triple mutant E109A/E156A/D158A is activated equally well with and without Mg-ATP but in Figure 5B and C (bottom panel) shows that the double mutant E156A/D158A is not fully activated by Mg-ATP. It is not clear why there is this discrepancy.</p><p>3) The subsection title &quot;The divalent cation binding chamber is essential […]&quot;. I would replace essential with &quot;crucial&quot; or an equivalent word. The mutated channels are still able to activate albeit not as effectively.</p><p>4) In Figure 1, I would like to see an identical view of bound free-ATP as shown in panels B, C and D. The authors are making the case that the free-ATP structure is not compatible with the published receptor structure complexed with Mg but right now that is not obvious. In addition, if the binding site for the free-ATP is different than Mg-ATP than it is a bit surprising that the channels are still able to open in the absence of divalent cations. Is the rest of the structure identical or there are other common features that are involved in mediating the binding signal to the pore gates? Please comment.</p><p>5) Subsection “Simulations reveal Mg<sup>2+</sup> displacement to upper mode results from ATP dissociation”: &quot;Upon ATP recognition, Mg<sup>2+</sup> relocates to bridge the interaction between agonist and receptor&quot; The simulations have shown that ATP dissociation leads Mg<sup>2+</sup> to relocate to the upper site. This shows that there is a path for Mg<sup>2+</sup> to transfer from the site, and the structures show that in the absence of ATP Mg<sup>2+</sup> sits in the upper site while in the presence of it sits in the lower site in interaction with ATP. However, I don't think the above mentioned statement is absolutely established.</p><p>6) Subsection “Divalent cations stabilize ATP on hP2X3 receptor channels”: In the slowly desensitizing mutant, the time required for channel closure is used as a proxy to measure the rate of ATP dissociation. This seems to assume that the unbinding of ATP is rate-limiting in the process that leads to closing. Is that true? Can this be explained explicitly and a citation added?</p><p>7) Subsection &quot;The divalent cation binding chamber is essential for activation by Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP&quot;. I did not understand the origin of the resurgent currents. I think the description of what happens in P2X2 is too brief and the analogy between what is going on here and in these previous experiments should be better explained.

We now state that the structures are of open-like conformation as previously suggested (Results section paragraph one).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 3H, the triple mutant E109A/E156A/D158A is activated equally well with and without Mg-ATP but in Figure 5B and C (bottom panel) shows that the double mutant E156A/D158A is not fully activated by Mg-ATP. It is not clear why there is this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>The two sets of experiments are designed to test different questions and there is no discrepancy. The purpose of the experiments shown in Figure 3H is to test if Mg<sup>2+</sup> alters the kinetics of channel deactivation, while those in Figure 5 are designed to test whether Mg-ATP can activate the receptor. In Figure 3 a very high concentration (300 μM) of ATP was used to ensure maximal channel activation in the absence and presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In the solution with 300 μM ATP and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, there would be about 35 μM free ATP, a near suturing concentration for even the E109A/E156A/D158A triple mutant. In Figure 3H we did not originally include scale bars for current amplitude because we were testing whether Mg<sup>2+</sup> alters the kinetics of deactivation. However, if one does compare current amplitude, the current activated by 300 μM ATP in EDTA (shown on the left) is ~11% larger than the one activated by 300 μM ATP with 1mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (35 μM ATP<sup>4-</sup>+65 μM Mg-ATP, shown on the right). According to the dose-response curve shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2, we should expect similar current amplitude with 35 μM and 300 μM ATP<sup>4-</sup>. The 11% difference might come from Mg-ATP binding but not activating, competing with free ATP. Indeed, we saw a small resurgent current in some of our experiments with the triple mutant. To clarify that the currents are not of identical size, we have added scale bars for the current amplitude.</p><p>The purpose of the experiments shown in Figure 5 is to test whether Mg-ATP can efficiently activate different constructs, so we designed solutions to contain either a saturating concentration of free ATP or an EC10 of free ATP along with a high concentration of Mg-ATP. For example, in the solution with 10 μM ATP and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, there would be only about 0.2 μM free ATP, an EC10 concentration for the E156A/D158A double mutant, along with 9.8 μM Mg-ATP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The subsection title &quot;The divalent cation binding chamber is essential [...]&quot;.

Is the rest of the structure identical or there are other common features that are involved in mediating the binding signal to the pore gates? Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Figure 1 as suggested to make the comparisons more straightforward. The case we are making, though, is not that the existing structures suggest the binding sites for free-ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP differ; rather, than the position of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound apo structure and of ATP in the ATP-bound structure are not consistent with a direct interaction between Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP in a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP bound state. The new structure indeed shows Mg<sup>2+</sup> must move to directly interact with the ATP.</p><p>The relevant text has been modified as follows:</p><p>“When ATP is in solution[…]. Whether these interactions are compatible with those observed between ATP and the receptor in the ATP-bound structure is unclear; if they are not, the presence of divalent ions would effectively weaken the interaction between agonist and receptor, which would be physiologically counterintuitive. It would seem reasonable to anticipate that when bound to the receptor, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP interact differently than when in solution.

In subsection “Divalent cations stabilize ATP on hP2X3 receptor channels” we have added: “ATP unbinding is the rate-limiting step for closure or deactivation of the slowly desensitizing P2X receptor channels (Rettinger and Schmalzing, 2004), and we therefore used the kinetics of channel deactivation in hP2X3-slow as a measure of the kinetics of ATP unbinding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection &quot;The divalent cation binding chamber is essential for activation by Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP&quot;.
