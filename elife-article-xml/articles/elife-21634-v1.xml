Biology</ext-link>, we published a Registered Report (Chroscinski et al., 2014) that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper &quot;Melanoma genome sequencing reveals frequent <italic>PREX2</italic> mutations&quot; (Berger et al., 2012). Here we report the results of those experiments. We regenerated cells stably expressing ectopic wild-type and mutant phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2 (PREX2) using the same immortalized human NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes as the original study. Evaluation of PREX2 expression in these newly generated stable cells revealed varying levels of expression among the PREX2 isoforms, which was also observed in the stable cells made in the original study (Figure S6A; Berger et al., 2012). Additionally, ectopically expressed PREX2 was found to be at least 5 times above endogenous PREX2 expression. The monitoring of tumor formation of these stable cells <italic>in vivo</italic> resulted in no statistically significant difference in tumor-free survival driven by <italic>PREX2</italic> variants, whereas the original study reported that these <italic>PREX2</italic> mutations increased the rate of tumor incidence compared to controls (Figure 3B and S6B; Berger et al., 2012). Surprisingly, the median tumor-free survival was 1 week in this replication attempt, while 70% of the control mice were reported to be tumor-free after 9 weeks in the original study. The rapid tumor onset observed in this replication attempt, compared to the original study, makes the detection of accelerated tumor growth in <italic>PREX2</italic> expressing NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes extremely difficult. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21634.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21634.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metascience</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>driver mutation</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009827</institution-id><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><institution>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</institution></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Editors' Summary: The results in this Replication Study could not be interpreted.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> (RP:CB) is a collaboration between the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://centerforopenscience.org/">Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/">Science Exchange</ext-link> that seeks to address concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chroscinski et al., 2014</xref>) for a paper by Berger et al., and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p>In 2012, Berger et al. sequenced the whole genome of 25 metastatic melanomas and matchedÂ germline DNA. The authors identified the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2 gene (<italic>PREX2</italic>) as aÂ significantly mutated gene (SMG) in this population and went on to confirm this finding in an independent cohort of 107 human melanoma samples. To investigate the functional relevance of <italic>PREX2</italic> mutations, six of the identified mutant PREX2 isoforms were ectopically expressed in immortalized human melanocytes and tumor formation was monitored after injecting into immunodeficient mice. Four of the mutations, three truncating variants as well as a point mutant, resulted in a statistically significant decrease in tumor-free survival compared to control melanocytes, expressing wild-type PREX2 (PREX2<sup>WT</sup>) or green fluorescent protein (GFP).</p><p>The Registered Report for the paper by Berger et al. described the experiments to be replicated (Figures 3B and S6), and summarized the current evidence for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chroscinski et al., 2014</xref>). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berger et al. (2012)</xref> reported <italic>PREX2</italic> as an SMG in melanoma, other studies have failed to identify <italic>PREX2</italic> as an SMG in genome-wide screens of melanoma samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hodis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krauthammer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Marzese et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ni et al., 2013</xref>), including a meta-analysis of over 200 samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xia et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, <italic>PREX2</italic> was identified as an SMG in pancreatic cancer samples using a whole-genome approach with a mutation rate ofÂ ~10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Waddell et al., 2015</xref>), similar to the reported rate in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berger et al. (2012)</xref>. Further, one of the truncating mutations specific to melanocytes (PREX2<sup>E824*</sup>) identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berger et al. (2012)</xref> was further explored to determine the <italic>in vivo</italic> implications of this mutation in the context of mutant NRAS. Although the PREX2<sup>E824*</sup> mutation was not included in this replication attempt, Lissanu Deribe and colleagues reported that a genetically engineered conditional knockout mouse harboring the <italic>Prex2<sup>E824*</sup></italic> mutation accelerated melanoma development compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lissanu Deribe et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The outcome measures reported in this Replication Study will be aggregated with those from the other Replication Studies to create a dataset that will be examined to provide evidence aboutÂ reproducibility of cancer biology research, and to identify factors that influence reproducibility more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequencing of endogenous <italic>PREX2</italic> in NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes</title><p>Using the same TERT-immortalized human melanocytes engineered to express NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> (NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes) as the original study, we determined the genetic status of the endogenous <italic>PREX2</italic> gene.

This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure S6 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berger et al. (2012)</xref>. The PREX2<sup>G844D</sup> isoform contains a missense variant in exon 22 of the <italic>PREX2</italic> gene (c.2531G&gt;A) and the PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup> isoform contains a nonsense truncating variant in exon 35 of the <italic>PREX2</italic> gene (c.4288C&gt;T). Although Berger et al. tested six different isoforms in total, PREX2<sup>G844D</sup> and PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup> isoforms were selected for evaluation because they each had the greatest effect on tumor free survival within their respective mutation classes (i.e., missense and nonsense).</p><p>Expression of ectopic PREX2 isoforms was evaluated by Western blot through detection of the V5 tag, similar to the original study. Relative expression levels (V5/Tubulin) for the PREX2<sup>G844D</sup> and PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup> isoforms made during this replication attempt were 0.6 and 1.7 times, respectively, the amount of PREX2<sup>WT</sup> protein ectopically expressed. This compares to 0.6 and 0.7 times for the PREX2<sup>G844D</sup> and PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup> isoforms reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berger et al. (2012)</xref>. We also re-analyzed the relative expression levels in the stable NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes generated in the original study, which were shared by the original authors. Western blot analysis resulted in a relative expression ofÂ ~0.5 times for both the PREX2<sup>G844D</sup> and PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup> isoforms compared to PREX2<sup>WT</sup> protein. Not unexpectedly, PREX2<sup>WT</sup> protein levels also varied between the original and replication stable cells, with the stable cells generated in the original study expressing over two times as much protein compared to the PREX2<sup>WT</sup> stable cells generated in this replication attempt. However, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the mean expression of all PREX2 isoforms made during this replication attempt fall within the 95% CI of those generated during the original study and are similar to those reported in the original manuscript.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21634.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Expression of PREX2 isoforms.</title><p>NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes were transduced to express GFP or PREX2 isoforms (PREX2<sup>WT</sup>, PREX2<sup>G844D</sup>, PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup>).

The ANOVA had three levels of PREX2-V5 isoform expression in NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes (PREX2<sup>WT</sup>, PREX2<sup>G844D</sup>, or PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup>) and two levels of study (generated during this replication attempt or the original study). The ANOVA result for the main effect of PREX2 isoform (<italic>F</italic>(2,12)Â =Â 4.608, <italic>p</italic>=0.033), the main effect of study (<italic>F</italic>(1,12)Â =Â 8.701, <italic>p</italic>=0.012), as well as the PREX2 isoform:study interaction effect (<italic>F</italic>(2,12)Â =Â 7.525, <italic>p</italic>=0.008) were statistically significant. While this indicates the null hypothesis that any differences between isoform expression is the same for each study, and vice versa, can be rejected, it is difficult to interpret because the main effects and interaction effect are all statistically significant. If desired, multiple comparison post-hoc tests could be done to explore how expression differs, but this result does suggest that isoform expression is not equal, which is of particular interest for this study.</p><p>While the V5 tag allows for easy detection of ectopically expressed PREX2 isoforms, it does not provide a means to understand how theÂ ectopic expression compares to endogenous PREX2. This aspect was not examined in the original study. TheÂ relative expression of endogenous and ectopic PREX2 was evaluated by Western blot using an anti-PREX2 antibody which recognizes amino acids 960â973 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hodakoski et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâD</xref>). Relative expression (PREX2/Tubulin) for PREX2<sup>WT</sup> made during this replication attempt was 12 times the endogenous PREX2 level detectable in GFP stable cells, while the PREX2<sup>G844D</sup> and PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup> isoforms were 10 and 38 times the endogenous levels, respectively. Comparatively, the stable PREX2<sup>WT</sup>, PREX2<sup>G844D</sup>, and PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup> cells generated during the original study were 9, 5, and 7 times over detectable endogenous PREX2, respectively. However, similar to the V5 analysis, the mean expression of all PREX2 isoforms, aside from GFP, in cells made during this replication attempt fall within the 95% CI of those generated during the original study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>An ANOVA was performed to test if PREX2 expression was similar in NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes across the different isoforms as well as between the originally generated stable cells and the stable cells generated in this replication attempt. This ANOVA had four levels of PREX2 expression (GFP, PREX2<sup>WT</sup>, PREX2<sup>G844D</sup>, or PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup>) and two levels of study (generated during this replication attempt or the original study). The ANOVA result for the main effect of PREX2 expression (<italic>F</italic>(3,16)Â =Â 15.033, <italic>p</italic>=6.47Ã10<sup>â5</sup>), the main effect of study (<italic>F</italic>(1,16)Â =Â 13.08, <italic>p</italic>=0.002), as well as the interaction effect (<italic>F</italic>(3,16)Â =Â 4.499, <italic>p</italic>=0.018) were statistically significant. As with the ANOVA results on the V5 expression data, these results are difficult to interpret, but it does suggest that expression is not the same. Any dissimilarity in expression between the stable cells could be due to a number of factors, such as differences in integration site and copy number, differences in growth conditions between laboratories, and the inherent variability of the Western blot technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koller and WÃ¤tzig, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Generation of tumor xenografts expressing PREX2 isoforms and evaluation of tumor-free survival and tumor growth</title><p>We sought to independently replicate if the expression of different isoforms of PREX2 impacted tumor-free survival (TFS) <italic>in vivo</italic>.

As outlined in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chroscinski et al., 2014</xref>), we planned to conduct four comparisons using the Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons making the <italic>a priori</italic> Bonferroni adjusted significance thresholdÂ 0.0125 (.05/4). Although the Bonferroni method is conservative, it was accounted for in the power calculations to ensure sample size was sufficient. Mice injected with NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes expressing GFP compared to either of the two mutant PREX2 isoforms were not statistically different (GFP vs. PREX2<sup>G844D</sup>: uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.847, Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.99; GFP vs. PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup>: uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.944, Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.99), nor were mice injected with PREX2<sup>WT</sup> compared to either of the two mutant isoforms (PREX2<sup>WT</sup> vs. PREX2<sup>G844D</sup>: uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.652, Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.99; PREX2<sup>WT</sup> vs. PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup>: uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.529, Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Following theÂ detection of a palpable tumor the growth of the tumor was monitored for each mouse as specified in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chroscinski et al., 2014</xref>). Caliper measurements were taken every seven days until tumors reached 1.5cm<sup>3</sup> or until the end of the observation period, 91 days from the first tumor measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). There are multiple approaches that could be taken to explore this data. We determined the area under the curve (AUC) for each mouse to test if there were differences in the tumor growth rates between the different groups. Since not every tumor could be measured until the end of the observation period, we used the first six measurements to calculate AUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Excluding the missing data from the two mice that did not survive during this period we performed a one-way ANOVA on the AUC (natural log-transformed), which was not statistically significant, <italic>F</italic>(3,37)Â =Â 2.411, <italic>p</italic>=0.0824, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>Î·</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>P</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.164, 90% CI [0,0.290]. Follow-up tests were performed to further explore if there were differences between the groups. The comparison between tumor growth in GFP expressing cells compared to either of the two different PREX2 isoforms were not statistically different (GFP vs. PREX2<sup>G844D</sup>: <italic>t</italic>(37)Â =Â 1.217, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.231, Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>=0.925, Cohenâs <italic>d</italic>Â =Â 0.477, 95% CI [â0.308, 1.253]; GFP vs. PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup>: <italic>t</italic>(37)Â =Â 2.568, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.014, Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>=0.058, Cohenâs <italic>d</italic>Â =Â 1.154, 95% CI [0.188, 2.094]). Similarly, the comparison between tumor growth in PREX2<sup>WT</sup> expressing cells compared to either of the two different PREX2 isoforms were not statistically different (PREX2<sup>WT</sup> vs. PREX2<sup>G844D</sup>: <italic>t</italic>(37)Â =Â 0.752, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.457, Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.99, Cohenâs <italic>d</italic>Â =Â 0.352, 95% CI [â0.578, 1.274]; PREX2<sup>WT</sup> vs. PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup>: <italic>t</italic>(37)Â =Â 1.988, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.054, Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>=0.217, Cohenâs <italic>d</italic>Â =Â 1.029, 95% CI [â0.076, 2.099]). Interestingly, although not statistically significant, these comparisons indicate there was an increase in AUC, and thus tumor growth, in the mutant PREX2 isoforms compared to PREX2<sup>WT</sup> or GFP. After completion of the study, one tumor was randomly selected from each study group, sectioned, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâE</xref>). Histopathological examination found the tumors to be morphologically similar to each other.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21634.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Tumor growth.</title><p>Female athymic nude mice were subcutaneously injected in the right flank with NRAS<sup>G12D</sup> melanocytes expressing GFP or PREX2 isoforms (PREX2<sup>WT</sup>, PREX2<sup>G844D</sup>, or PREX2<sup>Q1430*</sup>).
