We combined tissue clearing, 3D-immunofluorescence, and electron tomography (ET) to longitudinally assess early HIV-1 spread in lymphoid tissues in humanized mice. Immunofluorescence revealed peak infection density in gut at 10–12 days post-infection when blood viral loads were low. Human CD4+ T-cells and HIV-1–infected cells localized predominantly to crypts and the lower third of intestinal villi. Free virions and infected cells were not readily detectable by ET at 5-days post-infection, whereas HIV-1–infected cells surrounded by pools of free virions were present in ~10% of intestinal crypts by 10–12 days. ET of spleen revealed thousands of virions released by individual cells and discreet cytoplasmic densities near sites of prolific virus production. These studies highlight the importance of multiscale imaging of HIV-1–infected tissues and are adaptable to other animal models and human patient samples.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23282.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23282.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>humanized mouse</kwd><kwd>tissue clearing</kwd><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>electron tomography</kwd><kwd>3D immunofluorescence</kwd><kwd>CLARITY</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2 P50 GM082545-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bjorkman</surname><given-names>Pamela J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005192</institution-id><institution>California HIV/AIDS Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ID15-CT-017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bjorkman</surname><given-names>Pamela J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combined tissue clearing, 3D-immunofluorescence, and electron tomography spatially revealed the dynamics of early HIV-1 spread within lymphoid tissues of humanized mice at the resolution of single cells and individual virions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>HIV-1 presents an important global health issue with &gt;36 million people infected worldwide and 2.1 million newly acquired infections in 2015. The majority of new HIV-1 infections result from heterosexual transmission, with women accounting for a majority of all new infections worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">UNAIDS, 2015</xref>). During heterosexual transmission of HIV-1, the virus crosses the genital epithelium and infects a target cell, which results in localized infection, establishment of a latently-infected virus reservoir, expansion of a local founder population, and systemic virus spread to distant tissues via lymph and blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fackler et al., 2014</xref>). With blood containing only 1–2% of HIV-1 target cells in the body, the majority of HIV-1 target cells in the human body reside within tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kilby, 2001</xref>). Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), lymph nodes, and spleen contain a large number HIV-1 target cells that support localized virus transmission and remain a key source of virus replication during systemic spread and long term disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haase, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reinhart et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grossman et al., 1998</xref>), yet the biological details of interactions between the virus and immune cells within tissues remain poorly characterized at single cell and subcellular resolution.</p><p>HIV-1–infected animal models offer an opportunity to investigate virus spread within tissues using immunofluorescence (IF) and electron microscopy (EM) imaging. Model systems of HIV-1 infection include both non-human primates (NHP) and mice, with mouse models being more practical for longitudinal studies of infection in which relatively large numbers of animals are infected. Mice with humanized immune systems (hu-mice) allow the rapid generation of human target cells infected with wildtype virus in a living organism with a functioning immune system and recapitulate important aspects of HIV-1 pathology including mucosal infection, systemic virus spread, latency, and response to therapeutic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatziioannou and Evans, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marsden and Zack, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Optical clearing techniques, originally developed &gt;100 years ago, enabled imaging of large volumes of tissue, which led to an enhanced understanding of human anatomy, but the original clearing methods are not compatible with modern fluorescence microscopy due to tissue destruction and quenching of the fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Richardson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Treweek and Gradinaru, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tainaka et al., 2016</xref>). However, recent advances in optical clearing of intact tissues combined with 3D fluorescence microscopy enable imaging of tissues at single cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Richardson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tainaka et al., 2016</xref>). The basic principles of tissue clearing involve removing opaque biomolecules that reduce light penetration into samples and matching the refractive index of optics, solutions, and tissues to minimize optical distortions during imaging. CLARITY/PACT and CUBIC tissue-clearing techniques were recently applied to render entire rodents optically clear while maintaining tissue integrity at the single cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tainaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Treweek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). When combined with IF and fluorescence microscopy, these techniques allow imaging of large volumes (mm<sup>3</sup>–cm<sup>3</sup>) of intact tissues at single cell resolution, delineation of the connectivity of biological structures, and discrimination of individual cell types within complex tissue environments. Tissue clearing techniques were recently applied to image brain, nervous system, and internal organs in rodents, the spatial heterogeneity of mouse tumor models, developmental processes in zebrafish, and post-mortem pathology from preserved human samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tainaka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tainaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tomer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guldner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tomer et al., 2015</xref>), but have not previously been used to image lymphoid tissues from HIV-1–infected animals.</p><p>EM was originally utilized to identify HIV-1 as the causative agent of AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barré-Sinoussi et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gallo et al., 1983</xref>) and has subsequently been applied to examine aspects of HIV-1 pathology at ultrastructural resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orenstein, 2007</xref>). ET can provide 3D information at subcellular resolution from frozen hydrated or from well-preserved, fixed biological samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McIntosh et al., 2005</xref>). ET of purified HIV-1 and HIV-1–infected cultured cells have contributed to our understanding of the HIV-1 life-cycle through investigations of the structures of mature and immature virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briggs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wright et al., 2007</xref>), envelope spike densities and conformations on virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), virus biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlson et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2008</xref>), cell entry, and cell-to-cell transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Earl et al., 2013</xref>). Although informative, these studies provided no information concerning HIV-1 in the context of an infection within a host organism. The in situ environment involves multiple cell types within tissues and organs, which may alter virus behavior and fine-structural associations compared to infection within a cultured cell environment. In a previous study, we combined optimized tissue preservation methods with ET to image HIV-1 in GALT derived from chronically infected hu-mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). This approach allowed us to distinguish and characterize mature, immature, and budding virions, localize infected cells and intercellular pools of free virions within colon crypts, and identify distinct components of virus budding machinery within infected GALT tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). These studies shed light on HIV-1 interactions during later phases of infection, establishing the groundwork for investigations of HIV-1 during critical early virus spread in lymphoid tissues.</p><p>Here we address early HIV-1 spread by combining 3D-IF microscopy of optically-cleared tissues with ET of optimally-preserved tissues. This parallel approach allowed us to image systemic virus spread in HIV-1–infected hu-mouse lymphoid tissues at different volumes, resolutions, and times after infection. These analyses provided a longitudinal and spatial comparison of the location, type, and density of infected cells, routes of virus spread, and virus levels in lymphoid tissues. Infectivity in GALT and spleen preceded peak blood viremia and showed a rapid and exponential spread of virus in these tissues early after infection. Blood viral load peaked over a week later, when infectivity in several lymphoid tissues was beginning to diminish, emphasizing the discrepancy between blood and tissue infectivity. During times of peak infectivity, large numbers of free virions were identified in spleen, with individual infected cells being surrounded by &gt;1000 virions within thin volumes of tissue. These studies provide multiscale information about the early systemic spread of virus within lymphoid tissues at both cellular and subcellular resolution, and these methods are readily adaptable to in situ analysis of HIV-1–infection in other hu-mouse and NHP models, and samples from human patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Validation of PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model for imaging studies</title><p>Perhaps the most accurate hu-mouse model, bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) mice, are generated by transferring CD34+ human stem cells together with human fetal thymic and liver tissues during individual surgeries into immunocompromised mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Melkus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lan et al., 2006</xref>). While BLT mice are optimal for studies of mucosal transmission of HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denton et al., 2008</xref>), they are not cost effective for longitudinal studies of HIV-1 infection involving large cohorts of infected animals. We therefore used a technically simpler and less expensive hu-mouse model constructed by injection of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells/lymphocytes (PBMC/PBL) into NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkd</italic><sup>scid</sup><italic>Il2rg</italic><sup>tm1Wjl</sup>/SzJ (NSG) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishikawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shultz et al., 2005</xref>; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">King et al., 2008</xref>), which are immunocompromised animals lacking mature natural killer cells, B-cells and T-cells. PBMC-NSG mice rapidly reconstitute human CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in addition to human B-cells and disseminate human lymphoid cells to lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, genital mucosa, and intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatziioannou and Evans, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marsden and Zack, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishikawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">King et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mosier et al., 1988</xref>). It is important to note that the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model almost exclusively harbors activated human T cells that can react with host antigens and cause animals to develop graph versus host disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marsden and Zack, 2015</xref>). The lack of other cell lineages combined with raised levels of T cell activation in this model may enhance the dynamics of HIV spread and pathogenesis compared to other hu-mouse models that contain a smaller compartment of activated T cells at the time of infection and a more diverse set of immune cell lineages. Nonetheless, the robust reconstitution of activated human T-cells in the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse models is an important component for HIV-1 studies in hu-mice since (i) CD4+ T-cells make up the majority of all HIV-1 target cells in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haase, 1999</xref>), (ii) activated T cells constitute a sizeable proportion of all CD4+ T cells in humans (~10%), (iii) activated T cells rise to ~20–40% during the course of HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mahalingam et al., 1993</xref>), and (iv) activated T cells localize to important tissue sites of virus pathology including spleen, lymph nodes, and GALT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saksena et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerf-Bensussan and Guy-Grand, 1991</xref>). Importantly, HIV-1 infection of PBMC-NSG mice mimics early stages of infection in humans, in that the virus replicates exponentially, resulting in large scale CD4+ T-cell depletion within a few weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marsden and Zack, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2008</xref>), and this model was previously used to study the effectiveness of anti-HIV-1 therapies in reducing systemic virus spread after intravenous transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balazs et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hur et al., 2012</xref>). The lower cost, simplicity, rapid generation of HIV-1–infected animal cohorts, and effective reconstitution of systemic virus spread make the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model advantageous for longitudinal studies investigating early T cell-mediated pathogenic events in GALT, spleen, and peripheral blood.</p><p>HIV-1-infected PBMC-NSG mice normally show robust blood p24 levels ~2–4 weeks post-infection (PI), followed by a sharp decrease of viral load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balazs et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2014</xref>). By contrast, blood p24 levels in HIV-1 infected BLT mice regularly peak at ~4–6 weeks PI, followed by a slower reduction in blood viral load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brainard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denton et al., 2008</xref>). To compare with our previous imaging studies of GALT from long-term (10 to 20 weeks PI) infected BLT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>), we chose three weeks PI for analysis and imaging in PBMC-NSG mice to ensure that human cells and virus would still be present in tissues. Female NSG mice were reconstituted with human PBMCs and three PBMC-NSG mice were infected with R5-tropic HIV-1 (pNL4-3envYU2). HIV-1 p24 levels in blood showed mean levels of 2.50 ± 0.78 ng/mL at 12 days PI and 12.68 ± 8.05 ng/mL at 21 days PI, demonstrating productive infection in all three animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An infected animal was necropsied at 21 days PI and adjacent GALT samples from the colon were fixed with aldehydes for parallel IF and ET analysis. IF of colon showed the presence of human CD3+ cells and HIV-1 p24 in infected animals three weeks PI in colon crypts and within the crypt epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). ET corroborated the IF results, showing the presence of infected cells indicated by virus budding profiles projecting from the plasma membrane and free virions in similar tissue locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The localization and levels of T-cells and HIV-1 within colon crypts were consistent with our previous studies in HIV-1–infected BLT animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>), establishing the validity of the PBMC-NSG model for conducting longitudinal imaging studies of HIV-1 infection and spread in lymphoid tissues.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23282.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HIV-1 infection and Imaging of hu-mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean blood p24 levels from three HIV-1–infected PBMC-NSG mice assessed at 0, 12, and 21 days PI.

Representative images revealed low levels of infected human CD3+ T-cells at 5 days PI, which rapidly increased to peak levels at 10–16 days PI, before diminishing at time points &gt;21 days PI. To enable quantification of T-cell and infection densities, the total number of nuclei in confocal slices were determined using the Fiji software suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), resulting in an agreement of 96.2 ± 1.9% compared to manual quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Human CD3+ T-cells from at least four confocal slices in 1–3 animals at individual time points were manually quantified in infected and uninfected controls (n &gt; 5000 cells per time point). T-cells in colon from uninfected PBMC-NSG mice remained near 6% of total cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), comparable to the ~10–12% found in uninfected human patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McElrath et al., 2013</xref>). Human CD3+ T-cell densities in HIV-1–infected animals were similar to densities in uninfected controls until 12 days PI, at which time T-cell levels rapidly dropped to &lt;4% of total cells at 16 days PI and continued to decrease gradually out to 45 days PI. p24+/human CD3+ T-cells were quantified similarly in GALT, revealing peak infectivity at 12 days PI, with nearly 3% of cells representing HIV-1–infected T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Infectivity levels rapidly decreased to &lt;1% of cells representing infected T-cells after 21 days PI and approached zero by 35 days PI.

Tissue samples adjacent to those used for IF were imaged in parallel by ET, as opposed to directly imaging the same tissue sample using both IF and EM, because the methods for extracting lipids from cleared tissues for IF eliminates scaffolding within the cell, resulting in destruction of ultrastructural details at the EM level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Treweek et al., 2015</xref>). EM surveys of colon crypts, where we previously characterized active HIV-1 infection by ET in a BLT hu-mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>), confirmed the infectious profile depicted by IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).

This was followed by an exponential increase in the number of infected cells and the presence of large extracellular pools of free virus, often containing &gt;100 free virions within 200–400 nm thick regions of tissue during peak infectivity (10–16 days PI).

Tissue clearing and IF microscopy allowed interrogation of volumes of intact tissues at single cell resolution. This approach provided information about the spatial distribution of human immune cells, HIV-1–infected cells, and virus proteins within multiple tissues from PBMC-NSG hu-mice at specific times after infection. ET of adjacent tissue regions allowed imaging at subcellular resolution and validated infectivity patterns identified by IF. These studies revealed a rapid and vast spread of virus throughout GALT and spleen at times when virus in blood was barely detectable.</p><p>One focus of these studies was GALT, an important site for early aspects of HIV-1 interaction with the immune system that is home to a large proportion of HIV-1 target cells and is critical for early establishment of HIV-1 infection and pathogenic effects that lead to long-term disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saksena et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerf-Bensussan and Guy-Grand, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belmonte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mestecky et al., 2009</xref>). Tissue clearing and 3D-IF allowed the quantification of human T-cells and HIV-1–infected cells within intact GALT from PBMC-NSG hu-mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and revealed a human CD3+ T-cell density that was comparable to those from human patient colon samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McElrath et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, human T-cells were found in intestinal crypts, in agreement with results from HIV-1–infected colon samples from BLT hu-mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>), colon samples from SIV-infected NHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohan et al., 2007</xref>), and uninfected human colon samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McElrath et al., 2013</xref>), validating the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model for studying HIV-1 infection of human T-cells in GALT. Longitudinal quantification of infectivity in GALT revealed the dynamics of HIV-1 infectivity over time. Peak infectivity in GALT occurred while levels of virus in the blood, a hallmark of HIV-1 progression, were quite low. GALT infectivity then rapidly decreased and coincided with a drop in human CD3+ T-cell density in HIV-1–infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), consistent with studies in humans showing T-cell depletion in GALT during acute HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brenchley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mehandru et al., 2004</xref>). In our previous ET study of HIV-1-infection in GALT from BLT animals, all samples were from 10–20 weeks PI, yet HIV-1 and infected T cells were present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). The more rapid dynamics of virus spread and target cell depletion in GALT of HIV-1–infected PBMC-NSG hu-mice could be due to the high levels of T cell activation and a lack of T cell replenishment in PBMC-NSG animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marsden and Zack, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the colon of HIV-1–infected animals, human CD4+ T-cells preferentially localized to the bottom third of villi and in crypts whereas human CD8+ T-cells were more ubiquitously distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Accordingly, HIV-1–infected human CD4+ T-cells also localized to the bottom third of villi and in crypt regions, with most infected cells residing in crypts. This spatial distribution remained consistent, even as human CD4+ andCD8+ T-cell levels changed during the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). These results suggest that local tissue environments influence cell localization and distribution within hu-mice; comparisons between other animal models and human patient samples will be required to extrapolate these findings.</p><p>Adjacent sections of HIV-1–infected GALT were prepared for analysis by ET to gain ultrastructural information that focused on the establishment and spread of HIV-1 in lymphoid tissues. ET of GALT from HIV-1–infected PBMC-NSG hu-mice revealed few or no infected cells or virions at 5 days PI, peak infectivity at 10–16 days PI when infected cells and large pools of free virions were readily detectable, and reduced numbers of infected cells and sizes of virus pools at &gt;21 days PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The ET results were consistent with our IF results and also agree with studies showing the establishment of SIV-infection in GALT and spleen early after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williams et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Hundreds to thousands of free virions accumulating in pools near infected cells in both GALT and spleen were detected by ET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>), consistent with ET of GALT from HIV-1–infected BLT hu-mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). The highest levels of free virus in both GALT and spleen occurred at 10–12 days PI, a time when virus levels in the blood were low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We detected pools of free virus contiguous with mucosal vasculature in GALT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and in spleen, a tissue that acts to filter the blood, we visualized &gt;1000 virions being produced from one region of an HIV-1–infected cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We calculated that a single infected cell within tissue could produce &gt;6000 virions during a round of virus release, providing insights into the exponential production of HIV-1 within tissues early after infection. The total number of SIV virions produced by an individual infected cell was previously estimated to be 4.0–5.4 × 10<sup>4</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). If a similar number of HIV-1 virions are produced from infected cells within tissue, this implies multiple rounds of virus release from each infected cell, as suggested by our previous ET studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). In lymphoid tissues, the large numbers of target cells combined with high levels of virus production and accessibility to vasculature suggest that HIV-1–infected cells in tissue provide a source of free virus that contributes to blood viral load and systemic spread.</p><p>We previously proposed that distinct densities observed at the base of budding virions during virus release contained VPS4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>), an AAA+ ATPase recruited by polymerized ESCRT-III proteins that acts to recycle ESCRT-III in conjunction with abscission of the nascent virus membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sundquist and Kräusslich, 2012</xref>). Here we showed immuno-EM localization of anti-VPS4A antibodies to equivalent regions of budding virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In cells undergoing prolific budding, we found aggregations of hundreds to thousands of similar densities in adjacent regions of cytoplasm within close proximity (&lt;1 μm) to budding virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). Although we could not conclusively identify these densities as containing VPS4, they differed in size, intensity and shape from ribosomes, which are also distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Notably, the large accumulations of cytoplasmic densities were only present in cells undergoing prolific budding (&gt;100 buds), suggesting they are directly involved in HIV-1 assembly and/or budding. Future immuno-EM studies will be required to directly identify their components and involvement in the HIV-1 replication cycle.</p><p>In summary, the parallel multiscale imaging approaches applied here allowed visualization of early HIV-1 spread in a hu-mouse model of infection at both single cell and subcellular resolution. 3D-IF of optically-cleared tissue allowed us to longitudinally and spatially assess the distribution of human T-cells and virus proteins within volumes of intact lymphoid tissue. ET of adjacent regions of tissue allowed the detection of individual virions, infected cells, and subcellular protein complexes within the context of actively-infected tissues at specific times PI. These approaches are directly applicable to additional lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes, bone marrow, and thymus in infected hu-mouse, NHP, and human patient samples. Future efforts will allow the visualization of discreet biological processes occurring during early HIV-1 spread in lymphoid tissues and enable the development of a quantifiable spatial map of HIV-1 spread in tissues during early infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Primary antibodies for flow cytometry: mouse monoclonal anti-human CD3-FITC (1:13; Biolegend), mouse monoclonal anti-human CD4-PE (1:13; Biolegend), mouse monoclonal anti-human CD8α-APC (1:13; Biolegend).

Gamma levels for DAPI staining in movies only were thresholded to emphasize CD4, CD8, and p24 cell staining throughout the volume.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Brightfield imaging</title><p>Fixed spleen tissues were also used for brightfield imaging. Large slices (~2 mm x 3 mm by x 0.5 mm) of tissue were cut with a microsurgical scalpel and placed on glass slides. Specimens were imaged with a Diaphot-200 microscope (Nikon, Inc.) using a 4x objective lens in brightfield mode. Images were recorded digitally.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>EM sample preparation</title><p>Prefixed lymphoid tissues (described above) were prepared for EM as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, samples were rinsed in cacodylate buffer and trimmed to &lt;~1 mm<sup>3</sup> blocks. One to three tissue blocks were placed into brass freezing planchettes (Ted Pella, Inc.) prefilled with cacodylate buffer containing 10% Ficoll (Sigma). Samples were rapidly frozen in a HPM-010 high pressure freezer (Leica Microsystems) and transferred to liquid nitrogen. The planchettes were placed under liquid nitrogen into cryo tubes (Nunc) containing 2 ml of 2.5% OsO<sub>4</sub>, 0.05% uranyl acetate in acetone, and then transferred to a AFS2 freeze-substitution machine (Leica Microsystems). Samples were freeze substituted for 72 hr at −90°C and then warmed to −20°C over 12 hr. After 24 hr at −20°C, the samples were warmed to room temperature, rinsed with acetone, and infiltrated with Epon-Araldite resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Tissue pieces were flat embedded between two Teflon-coated glass slides and polymerized at 60°C for 48 hr.</p><p>Embedded tissue samples were selected and sectioned as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). 400 nm sections were cut with a UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems) using a diamond knife (Diatome, Ltd.) and placed on Formvar-coated copper-rhodium 1 mm slot grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Sections were stained with 3% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Colloidal gold particles (10 nm) were placed on both surfaces of the grids as fiducial markers. Grids were stabilized with evaporated carbon prior to imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Electron tomography</title><p>Grids were placed in a Dual-Axis Tomography holder (Fischione Instruments, Inc.) and imaged with a Tecnai TF30ST-FEG microscope (FEI) at 300 KeV. Dual-axis tilt series (±64°; 1° intervals) were acquired automatically using SerialEM software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mastronarde, 2008</xref>). Tomographic data were aligned, analyzed and segmented using IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>) on MacPro computers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immuno-EM</title><p>Prefixed lymphoid tissues were cut into ~1 mm<sup>3</sup> blocks and infiltrated with 2.1 M sucrose in cacodylate buffer over 10 hr. Blocks were affixed to aluminum sectioning stubs and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections (100 nm) were cut with a UC6/FC6 cryoultramicrotome using a Cryo-Immuno diamond knife (Diatome, Ltd), transferred in a wire loop containing a drop of 2.3 M sucrose in PBS to Formvar-coated, carbon-coated, glow- discharged 100-mesh copper/rhodium grids, warmed to room temperature, labeled with primary and colloidal gold secondary antibodies, negatively stained, and embedded with 1% uranyl acetate, 1% methylcellulose in dH<sub>2</sub>O. Stained grids were air-dried in wire loops overnight.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Andres Collazo and the Caltech Biological Imaging Center for use of the Zeiss LSM-710 and 880 confocal microscopes and help with image capture and analysis, Carol Garland and Alasdair McDowall for help maintaining electron microscopes, Viviana Gradinaru and Ben Deverman for advice about tissue clearing methodologies, Wesley Sundquist for a rabbit polyclonal anti-HIV-1 p24 antibody, and Michel Nussenzweig for the pNL4-3envYU2 HIV-1.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jeremy Luban (Reviewing Editor) and Wenhui Li (Senior Editor), and four reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jeremy Luban (Reviewer #1) and Lishan Su (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents a set of descriptive experiments that define exciting and technically complex methodology for assessment of acute HIV-1 infection in an in vivo small animal model. What is particularly exciting here is the ability of the authors to follow the virus at multiple levels of scale. While the significance of findings from such a model remains to be determined it has potential to be extremely useful for studying early events of HIV-1 infection in vivo that will be difficult to address using other experimental systems.</p><p>There was significant disagreement among the four reviewers about the significance of this manuscript. All reviewers agree that the mouse model system used here is not &quot;ideal&quot; and that it suffers from significant limitations that confound interpretation of the work. In the end, we have decided that it would be reasonable to go forward with publication, given that the manuscript is modified to clearly explain the limitations of the model.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors introduce the Hu-PBMC model with an emphasis on its utility without acknowledging the potential limitations of the system relative to other humanized mouse models or other animal models. They should note up front that the Hu-PBMC model is a T cell dominant, xenoreactive model where the T cells are all activated, and most other lineages are not represented. The relatively high level of T cell activation of all T cells in this system could lead to high levels of virus production from infected cells in these mice. Overall, the manuscript makes technical advances and acquires images that are novel, but it remains to be seen what one may observe when examining acutely infected human tissues.</p><p>2) PHA blasts-NSG mice can be infected by HIV. However, it is not the most relevant model to study early HIV-1 infection and spread in lymphoid tissues. In this study, human PBMCs were stimulated with PHA/IL-2 for two weeks before adoptive transfer into NSG mice. HIV-1 infection/spread in mice transferred with these mostly activated T cells should be very different from HIV infection of naïve hosts with multiple cell types. The limitation of the PHA blasts-NSG model needs to be discussed. Key findings should be confirmed with BLT or other humanized mice with a quiescent human immune system with multiple immune cells in multiple lymphoid organs.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors show that nearly 50% of infected cell in GALT were hCD3- cells. It is of interest to identify/discuss what such hCD3- p24+ cells are.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The authors should also represent the total CD4 T cell depletion so that we can see to what extent to which the decrease in infected cells at late time points is simply due to target cell depletion.</p><p>5) This study is described as a &quot;parallel&quot; study because &quot;adjacent GALT samples from the colon were fixed with aldehydes for parallel IF and ET analysis&quot;. A stronger effort to correlate the data between the light and electron microscopy would be necessary to allow them to be more conclusive in their observations of non-CD3 associated virus clusters in ET.</p><p>6) One reviewer made the following comment. Perhaps the authors have some additional data that would move the manuscript in the kind of direction that they recommend. The authors do not delve deeply enough into using their imagining techniques to add new knowledge to the field of HIV mucosal transmission and pathogenesis. Using these techniques to compare routes of infection (intravaginal vs. intrarectal vs. intravenous) could be highly informative, as well as testing how various viral isolates, perhaps those with different chemokine receptor tropisms, may disseminate differently throughout the GALT. Even within the data currently presented, additional follow-up could be conducted to fully interrogate the results, such as the imaging of p24+ cells that were interestingly not co-localized with CD3+ T cells. The characterization of these infected cell types or determining whether these images represent cell-free virus warrants significant follow-up experiments.</p><p>7) Again, the authors do not adequately discuss the caveats of their model, which may have significant impact on the interpretation of the results by the reader. Though it has been shown that CD4+ T cells are indeed rapidly depleted from gut tissues during acute HIV infection, the depletion seen here is quite rapid and extensive (virtually permanent) and may be an important caveat of the model. In contrast to natural infection, here new T cells are not being generated from human-derived hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, as would be the case in the BLT or Hu-HSC humanized mouse models. This important caveat needs to be discussed in more detail to give an accurate interpretation of the results, particularly with respect to the time course data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23282.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors introduce the Hu-PBMC model with an emphasis on its utility without acknowledging the potential limitations of the system relative to other humanized mouse models or other animal models.

The revised paper includes a longer discussion of this mouse model, including the important caveats raised by the reviewers.</p><p>We are eager to examine acutely-infected human tissues using the imaging methods described here – the problem with doing this has been that we have been unable to obtain human samples that have been preserved in a way that allows high resolution electron tomography. In addition, even if we had human samples, it is not possible to survey multiple types of infected tissues in humans or to perform equivalent longitudinal studies.</p><p>We were also unable to conduct longitudinal imaging experiments in BLT mice comparable to ones we reported in the submitted paper (which required 23 total mice) because of the prohibitive expense, labor, and time required to generate these mice and the lack of expertise at Caltech in making BLT mice. Our choice of PBMC-NSG mice as the humanized mouse model for our studies was influenced by previous research done at Caltech in David Baltimore’s laboratory. Because my laboratory learned how to make and infect hu-mice from the Baltimore lab, we used their mouse model for our studies: specifically, we used the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model described in the Baltimore laboratory paper demonstrating that AAV delivery of anti-HIV antibodies is protective against HIV infection [1]. In this paper, Balazs et al. showed data demonstrating that the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model exhibits CD4 T cell depletion upon challenge with HIV, and they noted that this had also been shown by others [2]; thus, we were confident that this mouse model could be used to reproduce the T cell-mediated systemic spread and subsequent T cell depletion that occurs in natural HIV infections. The Baltimore laboratory also used the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model for some of the experiments described in their other papers [3,4]. In addition, a recent paper characterizing and describing the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model demonstrated T cell depletion, high virus p24 levels in blood, and the effectiveness of both HAART and passive antibody transfer upon HIV infection in this mouse model, concluding that the model is a relevant infection and pathogenesis model [5].</p><p><italic>2) PHA blasts-NSG mice can be infected by HIV. However, it is not the most relevant model to study early HIV-1 infection and spread in lymphoid tissues. In this study, human PBMCs were stimulated with PHA/IL-2 for two weeks before adoptive transfer into NSG mice. HIV-1 infection/spread in mice transferred with these mostly activated T cells should be very different from HIV infection of naïve hosts with multiple cell types. The limitation of the PHA blasts-NSG model needs to be discussed.</italic></p><p>Please see the first paragraph of the Results section in the revised manuscript for a discussion of the limitations of the hu-mouse model used for our studies. To directly address the concerns of the reviewers, we point out that nearly all of the CD3+ T cells in the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model are activated as compared to ~10% in healthy human patients [6]. The revised manuscript now notes the higher levels of activated T cells in PBMC-NSG mouse model compared with humans could alter the dynamics of HIV spread as compared to other hu-mouse models or human patients with lower levels of activated T cells and a more diverse set of immune cell lineages. However, because (i) activated T cells make up ~10% of the total T cell population in humans, (ii) T cell activation increases to 20-40% during the course of HIV infection [6], and (iii) T cells represent the largest population of HIV target cells in the body [7], our demonstration by ET that individual activated T cells can produce thousands of free virions provides a striking observation that is relevant for understanding the routes and modes of HIV-1 spread in lymphoid tissues.</p><p><italic>Key findings should be confirmed with BLT or other humanized mice with a quiescent human immune system with multiple immune cells in multiple lymphoid organs.</italic></p><p>We would like to conduct comparative imaging studies using tissues from other mouse models, but were unable to obtain BLT tissues other than GALT from our collaborators at the Ragon Institute who constructed the BLT mice we used for our previous imaging studies [8]. However, we have done direct comparisons of HIV-infected GALT from the PBMC-NSG mice used for the current studies and from the Ragon Institute BLT mice. We found that the localization and density of human T cells were equivalent in GALT from the two hu-mouse models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>). In addition, free virions were found at similar levels and locations in GALT from both mouse models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2</xref>). The observation that T cell levels in GALT were comparable between BLT and PBMC-NSG mice suggests that our results in PBMC-NSG mice represent a valid model to look at T cell-mediated spread of HIV. In addition, although we acknowledge that PBMC-NSG mice are reconstituted mainly with activated T cells, we again note that T cells make up a majority of all HIV target cells in humans [7] and T cell activation increases to 20-40% during the course of HIV infection [6]. Thus, the PBMC-NSG model represents a relevant model to study the spread of virus caused by activated T cells within lymphoid tissues.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23282.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Equivalent IF confocal slices of colon crypts from HIV-1-infected BLT (left) or PBMC-NSG (right) hu-mice.</title><p>The density and localization of human CD3+ T cells (green) are similar in both models (blue = DAPI nuclear stain).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23282.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23282.024</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23282-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23282.025</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Equivalent tomographic slices of colon crypt regions from HIV-1-infected BLT (left) or PBMC-NSG (right) hu-mice.</title><p>Free virions are visible at similar levels and locations in both models (red arrows = pools of free virions).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23282.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23282.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23282-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>We’d also like to point that some aspects of the PBMC-NSG and other comparable hu-mouse models might be advantageous for our studies of early HIV spread. A recent review by Marsden and Zack [9] states, “In some respects HIV infection of the original hu-PBL-SCID and SCID-hu models emulate the early stages of HIV infection in humans, with exponential virus replication accompanied by profound CD4 depletion within weeks of infection in the absence of a specific antiviral immune response. In contrast, some of the newer hu-HSC and BLT models provide an environment that is more typical of later stages of HIV infection in humans, with specific primary cellular and (albeit limited) humoral immune responses present and slower CD4 declines.&quot;</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors show that nearly 50% of infected cell in GALT were hCD3- cells. It is of interest to identify/discuss what such hCD3- p24+ cells are.</italic> </p><p>The quantification of fluorescence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> shows that ~50% of the p24+ fluorescence did not localize with hCD3 fluorescence at time points &gt;28 days post-infection. The resolution of light microscopy cannot distinguish whether the p24+/hCD3- fluorescence represents non-T cells that were infected and actively producing virus, or if it represents pools of free virus that accumulated in lateral intercellular spaces surrounding cells. Parallel analysis by ET at late time points post-infection revealed pools of free virions surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, as clarified in the revised manuscript in the first paragraph of the &quot;ET of longitudinal HIV-1 spread in GALT&quot; portion of the Results section, we believe that much of the p24+/hCD3- fluorescence represents pools of free virions.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The authors should also represent the total CD4 T cell depletion so that we can see to what extent to which the decrease in infected cells at late time points is simply due to target cell depletion.</italic></p><p>The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> directly address this point as human CD4+ T cell levels (magenta) drop at the late time point along total with p24+ cells (green), while CD8+ T cells (red) remain constant. We have revised the text in the &quot;Spatial and temporal distributions of HIV-1 in GALT&quot; portion of the Results section to emphasize that target cell depletion is likely occurring at late time points.</p><p><italic>5) This study is described as a &quot;parallel&quot; study because &quot;adjacent GALT samples from the colon were fixed with aldehydes for parallel IF and ET analysis&quot;. A stronger effort to correlate the data between the light and electron microscopy would be necessary to allow them to be more conclusive in their observations of non-CD3 associated virus clusters in ET.</italic></p><p>Although methods for correlative fluorescent and EM imaging of the same sample have been developed (i.e., correlated light and electron microscopy or CLEM) [10], these technologies would not yield useful information in our studies because we used optically-cleared samples in order to image large volumes of tissue. The methods for extracting lipids from cleared tissues for IF eliminates scaffolding within the cell, resulting in destruction of ultrastructural detail at the EM level as evidenced by EM images of cleared samples in a recent paper we co-authored with Viviana Gradinaru’s laboratory [11] and a direct comparison shown here of the loss of ultrastructural information in a CLARITY sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 3</xref>). Thus, we cannot directly image the exact same tissue sample by both IF and ET. By parallel imaging, we mean imaging of pieces of adjacent tissues by IF and for EM, as clarified in the revised text in the first paragraph of the &quot;ET of longitudinal HIV-1 spread in GALT&quot; portion of the Results section.</p><p>Regarding the non-CD3-associated virus clusters, as explained above, ET suggests that these mainly represent pools of free virions.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23282.026</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Equivalent tomographic slices of brush border regions of gut epithelial cells from wild-type mice that were optimally preserved for EM imaging by high-pressure freezing/freeze substitution (HPF/FS) fixation (left) or optically cleared using CLARITY prior to HPF/FS (right).</title><p>Clearing caused drastic loss of ultrastructural detail, likely due to extraction of lipids from the tissue (Term. web = terminal web; ICS = intercellular space).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23282.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23282.026</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23282-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>6) One reviewer made the following comment.

The authors do not delve deeply enough into using their imagining techniques to add new knowledge to the field of HIV mucosal transmission and pathogenesis. Using these techniques to compare routes of infection (intravaginal vs. intrarectal vs. intravenous) could be highly informative, as well as testing how various viral isolates, perhaps those with different chemokine receptor tropisms, may disseminate differently throughout the GALT.</italic></p><p>We would like to compare different routes of infection as the reviewer suggests, but the PBMC-NSG hu-mouse model is not suited for intravaginal or intrarectal routes of infection. For this reason, the Baltimore laboratory at Caltech used BLT mice for the majority of their studies of vaginally-infected hu-mice [3]. Because Caltech does not have a facility to produce BLT mice, the Baltimore laboratory obtained the mice from a collaborator, Dong Sung An, at UCLA. We have recently begun a collaboration with Dr. An to obtain longitudinal BLT tissue samples from mice infected by different routes with either CCR5- versus CXCR4-tropic HIV strains. We are also collaborating with other laboratories to obtain SIV- and SHIV-infected NHP tissue for imaging. However, these are on-going studies that will take at least a year to complete, so we cannot include them in the present manuscript.</p><p><italic>Even within the data currently presented, additional follow-up could be conducted to fully interrogate the results, such as the imaging of p24+ cells that were interestingly not co-localized with CD3+ T cells. The characterization of these infected cell types or determining whether these images represent cell-free virus warrants significant follow-up experiments.</italic></p><p>As described above, our ET results suggest that most of the CD3-/p24+ fluorescence resulted from pools of free virions rather than from CD3-/p24+ infected cells.</p><p><italic>7) Again, the authors do not adequately discuss the caveats of their model, which may have significant impact on the interpretation of the results by the reader.

This important caveat needs to be discussed in more detail to give an accurate interpretation of the results, particularly with respect to the time course data.</italic></p><p>We agree these points are important to consider when interpreting our results and have now included a discussion of these caveats in the first paragraph of the Results section and the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>References</p><p>1) Balazs, AB, Chen, J, Hong, CM, Rao, DS, Yang, L, Baltimore, D (2012) Antibody-based protection against HIV infection by vectored immunoprophylaxis.
