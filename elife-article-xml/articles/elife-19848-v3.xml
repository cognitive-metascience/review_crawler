This continuous model is based upon <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution and <italic>in vivo</italic> ensemble experiments. Here, we characterize the replisome-complex stoichiometry and dynamics with single-molecule resolution in bacterial cells. Strikingly, the stoichiometries of the replicative helicase, DNA polymerase, and clamp loader complexes are consistent with the presence of only one active replisome in a significant fraction of cells (&gt;40%). Furthermore, many of the observed complexes have short lifetimes (&lt;8 min), suggesting that replisome disassembly is quite prevalent, possibly occurring several times per cell cycle. The instability of the replisome complex is conflict-induced: transcription inhibition stabilizes these complexes, restoring the second replisome in many of the cells. Our results suggest that, in contrast to the canonical model, DNA replication is a largely discontinuous process <italic>in vivo</italic> due to pervasive replication-transcription conflicts.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19848.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19848.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>replisome</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>replication-transcription conflicts</kwd><kwd>replication rates</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB1243492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mangiameli</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><name><surname>Merrikh</surname><given-names>Christopher N</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiggins</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name><name><surname>Merrikh</surname><given-names>Houra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Replication-transcription conflicts cause pervasive replisome instability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The rapid and faithful replication of the genome is essential to cell proliferation. Although the replisome, the cellular machinery responsible for DNA replication, has been extensively studied both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Donnell et al., 2013</xref>), fundamental questions remain about the dynamics and stability of the replication complex in the context of the living cell, where replication is one of a number of essential cellular processes competing for the genetic material as a template. This competition results in <italic>replication conflicts</italic>, the stalling or pausing of the replication process in the face of obstacles, including transcription and tightly-bound DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baharoglu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bidnenko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boubakri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brewer, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dutta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marsin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merrikh et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mirkin and Mirkin, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soultanas, 2011</xref>). Genetic evidence from bacterial studies suggests these replication conflicts can routinely necessitate a replication-restart process at highly-transcribed regions and genes transcribed in the opposite orientation to replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Merrikh et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Million-Weaver et al., 2015a</xref>). However, whether the replisome disassembles in response to conflicts, the rapidity of the restart process, and the frequency of such events per cell cycle are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruand et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabbai and Marians, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lovett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marsin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zavitz and Marians, 1992</xref>). The current estimates for the number of replication restart events per cell cycle vary greatly, with numbers ranging from one per cell cycle to one in seven generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beattie and Reyes-Lamothe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maisnier-Patin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGlynn and Lloyd, 2002</xref>). However, estimates of less than one event per cell cycle are in conflict with the essentiality of the restart protein PriA in (<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> essentiality is demonstrated in rapid growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Polard et al., 2002</xref>]), and the synthetic lethality of PriB and PriC proteins in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (PriA mutants as well as PriB PriC double mutants are largely unviable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabbai and Marians, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sandler and Marians, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sandler et al., 1999</xref>]). These observations are consistent with a more frequent requirement for replisome reactivation after conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabbai and Marians, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Polard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sandler and Marians, 2000</xref>) and provide indirect evidence against the canonical model that replication is continuous <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Our previous investigations using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of replication restart proteins determined the chromosomal locations of conflicts in very large ensembles of cells (in the population average) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Merrikh et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2011</xref>). However, due to population averaging over cells in various stages of the replication conflict and restart process, ChIP experiments are poor reporters of potential conflict-induced changes to the structure of the replisome complex, the frequency of conflicts in a single cell, and the rapidity of the replication restart process. Therefore understanding the fundamental character of DNA replication and conflicts necessitates a single-cell approach in which conflicts can be observed and quantitatively characterized one event at a time. The molecular-scale stoichiometry of the replisome further necessitates experiments with single-molecule sensitivity to detect any potential changes to replisome structure.</p><p>We visualized the replication process in single cells by <italic>in vivo</italic> Single-Molecule Fluorescence Microscopy (SMFM). We characterized the stoichiometry and lifetimes of the replicative helicase complexes (and otherÂ replicationÂ proteins) in growing <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. These measurements revealed that a significant percentage of cells only have a single helicase complex and that many of the complexes are short-lived. These results are consistent with pervasive disassembly of replisomes. We find that transcription inhibition both increases the lifetimes and stoichiometry of several core replisome components, suggesting that endogenous replication-transcription conflicts frequentlyÂ lead to disassembly of replisomes, potentially every cell cycle. The replication-conflict induced disassembly model suggests that conflicts may limit the rate of replication. Consistent with this model, we find that the inhibition of transcription, and the amelioration of conflicts, increases the replication rate as measured by thymidine incorporation assays.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Replicative helicase and DNA polymerase stoichiometries are consistent with a single active complex in a large population of cells</title><p>To probe replisome stoichiometry in single cells with single-molecule sensitivity, we employ SMFM. In short, the discrete transitions in fluorophore intensity due to bleaching can be detected and analyzed to deduce the stoichiometry of localized fluorophores with single-molecule resolution. The quantitative characterization of the molecular stoichiometry of the replisome in living <italic>E. coli</italic> cells was recently realized by SMFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2010</xref>), and this SMFM analysis has been applied in many other contexts (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leake et al., 2006</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>]). However, SMFM has not been exploited to determine the impact of conflicts on the replisome, the continuity of the replication process, or frequency of disruptions to the replisome within living cells.</p><p>We analyzed replisome stoichiometry of the replicative helicase DnaC in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. DnaC was chosen due to its essential role in the replication process, extensive biochemical characterization, its relatively large and well-accepted stoichiometry in the replisome, and because it is the first replisome protein reloaded onto the DNA during PriA-dependent replication restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruand et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marsin et al., 2001</xref>). The replicative helicase is responsible for facilitating replication by unzipping the two strands of DNA ahead of the replication forks. <italic>In vitro</italic> biochemical studies, including X-ray crystallography, reveal that the helicase forms a homo-hexameric ring encircling the lagging strand of the DNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fass et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaplan et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> measurements of stoichiometry in <italic>E. coli</italic> further support this model in the context of the living cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2010</xref>). For our studies, we used a DnaC-GFP fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), which was expressed from its endogenous promoter, at its endogenous locus. The fusion protein localized to midcell in a replication-dependent manner, consistent with association with the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lemon and Grossman, 1998</xref>). Under our experimental conditions (minimal arabinose medium), the growth rate (and the replication rateâsee below) of the DnaC-GFP strain was indistinguishable from that in wild-type cells (During rapid growth in Luria-Bertani medium, DnaC-GFP strain has a minor growth defect [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>]).</p><p>To measure the <italic>in vivo</italic> stoichiometry of the replisome proteins, we performed SMFM bleaching analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, and, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Most bacteria have a circular chromosome and a single origin of replication. After initiation, DNA replication progresses bi-directionally around the chromosome, with two active replisomes in each cell. The two forks in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> often localize to a single <italic>replication factory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lemon and Grossman, 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The small fraction of cells (~16%) having focus localization inconsistent with a replication factory were excluded from analysis. It is expected that in cells where the replication forks are co-localized, two replicative helicase complexes, and therefore 12 molecules of DnaC, will be localized to the factory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, stoichiometry analysis of DnaC at the replication factory in cells undergoing active replication reveals that just under half the cells (41%) have a factory with only 6 DnaC proteins, corresponding to a single helicase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The rest of the population (59%) has 12 DnaC proteins, corresponding to two active helicases. Note that incomplete protein labeling cannot account for the low helicase stoichiometry since two sub-populations with an integer multiple of fundamental hexameric stoichiometry are observed, as has also been previously reported in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2010</xref>). Western-blot analyses further confirm thatÂ &gt;98% of DnaC protein in the cell is indeed labeled with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). The incorrect determination of the bleaching step size also cannot account for these observations since results can be reproduced by using an <italic>in vitro</italic> measure of the fluorophore step size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). These results are consistent with a model where elongating replisomes are frequently disrupted and disassembled.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19848.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Estimated stoichiometry distributions for core replisome proteins in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Photobleaching of DnaC-GFP in a replication factory.

The observed distribution of lifetimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>) appears roughly exponential, suggesting that the occurrence of disassembly events in individual cells may be approximated as a Poisson process, providing a method for roughly estimating the number disassembly events per cell cycle. (For simplicity, we will ignore the distinction between focus loss and fork disassembly. We present a more complicated model, that treats the number of forks per focus explicitly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), but this model depends on a number of untested assumptions.) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows the model (dashed gray) and empirical (solid gray) survival curves for the helicase complex as a function of lifetime, where the model survival curve was fit using by maximum likelihood estimation. Multiplying the calculated rate of conflicts by the accepted 40 min long replication cycle predicts five conflicts per cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). It is important to note that this estimate has significant systematic uncertainty since it depends on the length of the replication cycle (which depends on growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helmstetter and Cooper, 1968</xref>) as well as the assumption made in the modeling (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

leaving disassembled replisomes in the majority of cells during a single cell cycle. To test this, we depleted PriA using CRISPR interference and visualized the number of cells with DnaC-GFP foci using snapshot imaging. Consistent with the frequent disassembly hypothesis, after inducing PriA depletion in liquid culture for roughly one doubling time, only 13% of cells had foci compared with the roughly 43% of cells with foci in the precursor strain to the PriA CRISPR, which lacks the sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transcription inhibition increases the lifetimes of DnaC complexes</title><p>The results described support a model in which replication is discontinuous, with pervasive replisome disassembly and assembly dynamics. Our lab and others have shown that transcription, especially at the highly-transcribed rDNA or head-on genes (those transcribed in the opposite orientation relative to replication), results in potentially severe replication-transcription conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Septenville et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merrikh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Million-Weaver et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2007a</xref>). Our previous work measuring chromosomal regions where replication conflicts were most prevalent suggested that transcription is the main obstacle to replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merrikh et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, if transcription-induced conflicts were the principal mechanism responsible for replisome disassembly, we would predict that inhibition of transcription would result in a significant increase in replisome stability, either as assayed by stoichiometry or direct characterization of complex stability. To test this hypothesis, we perturbed transcription by (i) the treatment of cells with rifampicin (Rif), an antibiotic that directly inhibits transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sensi, 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1983</xref>) and (ii) <italic>rpoB</italic>* mutants which destabilize RNA Polymerase - DNA association and/or rDNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartlett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maughan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou and Jin, 1998</xref>). It has been previously shown that <italic>rpoB</italic>* mutations reduce severity of conflicts significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baharoglu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boubakri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guy et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we observed that rifampicin treatment dramatically increases the lifetime of helicase complexes. For instance, the number of complexes that persisted longer than 20 min increased from 9% in untreated cells to 53% in rifampicin treated cells and the calculated number of conflicts per cell cycle decreased by a factor of four (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We also isolated and examined an <italic>rpoB</italic>* mutant strain and found results consistent with those obtained from rifampicin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This second transcription perturbation ensures that the observed increase in replisome stability is not an artifact of rifampicin treatment. In general, the increased stability of the helicase complex is consistent with the increased stability of the replisome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>More cells have helicase and DNA polymerase stoichiometries consistent with two active replisome complexes upon transcription inhibition</title><p>To provide additional support for the transcription-dependence of the observed instability, we measured the stoichiometry of the helicase complexes in cells post transcription inhibition. An increase in replisome stability would predict an increase in the ratio of cells with two helicase complexes (12 DnaC molecules) relative to the number of cells with one helicase complex (6 DnaC molecules). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows the distribution of protein stoichiometry at the factory in cells with transcription inhibited by rifampicin.

To test this model, we introduced an IPTG inducible <italic>lacZ</italic> gene (P<italic><sub>spank(hy)</sub>-lacZ</italic>) onto the chromosome in the head-on orientation (strain <italic>lacZ</italic>). We hypothesized that the induction of this ectopic conflict would further destabilize the replisome, leading to a reduction in the fraction of cells containing two intact helicase complexes relative to the control cells. As predicted, analysis of the single-molecule stoichiometry of DnaC in cells experiencing the additional severe engineered conflict (after addition of IPTG to induce <italic>lacZ</italic> expression) decreases the number of cells containing two intact helicase complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>; &gt;80% of cells contain only 6 rather than 12 molecules of DnaC in the factory), demonstrating that replication-transcription conflicts indeed lead to the disassembly of the replicative helicase complexes.

These results (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>) altogether reveal that the inferred instability and disassembly of the helicase complexes, and potentially the replisome, is transcription-dependent.

DnaC is required for the loading of the replicative helicase (DnaB), and is recruited to rescue stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sandler, 2000</xref>). Here, we disrupted the restart process using a temperature-sensitive version of the helicase loader protein (<italic>dnaC2</italic> allele) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2008</xref>). We visualized DnaB-YPet in the <italic>dnaC2</italic> mutant under non-permissive conditions (37Â°C) using the same technique as in the dynamics experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Helicase complexes observed in the first frame disassembled before the end of the time course in 86% of cases. Furthermore, new complexes rarely developed (15% of the time). To further quantitate this data, we calculate the probability of observing a focus as a function of time in cells that have at least one focus. In the strains containing the <italic>dnaC2</italic> allele, this probability decreases throughout the time series, consistent with failure to restart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). This observed loss of foci is too rapid to be explained by replication termination (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B</xref>, null hypothesis). In contrast, the probability of observing a focus in the wild type strain (at 37Â°C) does not depend strongly on time, indicating that the replisome is in steady state due to its ability to restart. These data are consistent with reports suggesting that <italic>dnaCts</italic> alleles are ineffective for synchronization because replication does not proceed to completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferullo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maisnier-Patin et al., 2001</xref>). Overall, these findings are consistent with both our observations in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and our interpretations of the results of the <italic>E. coli</italic> stoichiometry measurements, suggesting that <italic>E. coli</italic> cells also experience pervasive replisome instability due to transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Transcription inhibition increases the rate of replication</title><p>To test the replisome-instability model, we measured replication rates <italic>in vivo</italic> by radioactive thymidine incorporation assays in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, in both wild-type (without DnaC-GFP) and DnaC-GFP strains. It takes roughly 40 min to replicate 4.2 and 4.6 Mb of DNA in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli,</italic> respectively; at the 500 bp/s â1 kb/sec measurements from <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kornberg, 1992</xref>), which assume replisome stability during a replication cycle. However, our observation of frequent conflicts (during which the replisome stalls) predicts that the <italic>in vivo</italic> rates should increase if conflicts are reduced. To test the prediction of our model, we measured the rate of thymidine incorporation with and without rifampicin treatment, as well as in the <italic>rpoB*</italic> strains â two different conditions where we observed the stabilization of the replisome. As predicted, both transcription perturbations (rifampicin and <italic>rpoB*</italic>) increase the replication rate: Thymidine incorporation rates in rifampicin-treated cells are roughly 60â65% higher than that measured for untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The consistency of the incorporation rate in the <italic>rpoB*</italic> strain with rifampicin treatment suggests that the observed increase in rates is probably <italic>not</italic> an artifact of changes in nucleotide uptake in rifampicin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2007b</xref>). This interpretation is also supported by the insensitivity of <italic>rpoB*</italic> strains to rifampicin treatment with regards to thymidine incorporation rates. In addition, measurements of the thymidine incorporation rates in DnaC-GFP cells provide further evidence that DnaC-GFP is functional during slow growth: We did not detect any difference in thymidine incorporation rates between the wild-type and the DnaC-GFP strain under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These results provide further evidence that the rate of replication is severely inhibited by transcription in wild-type cells.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19848.029</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Thymidine incorporation assays determine the effect of transcription on replication rate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DNA replication rates increase upon transcription-inhibition and in <italic>rpoB*</italic> strains.

We previously showed that replication restart proteins preferentially associate with these regions during fast growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merrikh et al., 2011</xref>). Although somewhat counterintuitive, our model predicts that replication rates should be slower during fast growth due to conflicts with transcription. To test this prediction, we measured replication-rates in slow and fast growth conditions. Despite the faster growth rate of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> on minimal glucose versus arabinose medium, we observe significantly higher thymidine incorporation rates in arabinose compared to glucose, where ribosomal RNA and protein genes are much more highly expressed and are a major source of conflicts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mirouze et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The basic principles underlying the mechanism of genome replication are thought to be well established, especially in bacteria. Yet, a great part of this work has relied on a combination of <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution, from which potentially essential cellular factors and/or processes are absent, or <italic>in vivo</italic> ensemble measurements which are sensitive only to ensemble-averaged cellular behavior. Based primarily on these results and the absence of significant evidence to the contrary, DNA replication was thought to be largely a continuous process that initiates at the origin and moves processively to the terminus. However, there is a contradiction to this widely-accepted model: Our laboratory and others have demonstrated that the replication process can be disrupted from a number of concurrent processes including transcription. The resulting replication conflicts have dire consequences in the absence of rapid and efficient replication restart. If transcription is both an obstacle to the replisome and active throughout the cell cycle, how can the replication process be continuous? If conflicts can occur, what is their frequency? And if these events are frequent, what are the consequences for the replication machinery?</p><p>Using <italic>in vivo</italic> single-molecule fluorescence microscopy techniques in combination with a genetic and cell-biology toolkit developed for studying replication conflicts, we measured the stoichiometry and lifetimes of replication complexes in single cells with single-molecule resolution. The results of the <italic>replicative helicase complex stoichiometry</italic> experiments could be explained by a number of models. It is conceivable that the replisome traverses one of the two arms of chromosome much more rapidly than the other, reaching the terminus and disassembling much earlier than the second replisome complex. However, genomic DNA analyses have already demonstrated that in growing cells, the copy number of the two arms are roughly equal, implying that the average rate of replisome movement on the two arms is about the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Srivatsan et al., 2010</xref>). Another model for the low observed replisome stoichiometry is the observation of individual forks, as has previously been reported in <italic>E. coli</italic>. But, our own quantitative characterization of replisome localization reveals factory-like (co-localized) replisome positioning for 80% of the cell cycle in both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, which cannot account for the low observed stoichiometry in our own experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mangiameli et al., 2017</xref>) or previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2010</xref>). The data presented here is most consistent with the model that elongating replisomes are frequently disrupted (roughly 50% of the time) and disassembled during a single replication cycle.</p><p>The direct visualization of the replisome with SMFM in two different bacterial species strongly suggests that the replisome is frequently destabilized by transcription. The observation that these inferred disassembly events are transcription-dependent not only suggests that these events correspond to replication-transcription conflicts previously observed via biochemical means, but also that vast majority of replication conflicts are the result of transcription.</p><p>Our findings suggest that replicating cells often possess only a single active replisome complex. Together, the stoichiometry and dynamics of the replicative helicase and polymerase complexes as well as the replication rate measurements suggest that the replisome is subject to pervasive disassembly and reassembly events. These observations provide a potential explanation for the essentiality of replication restart proteins â at least under growth conditions where rDNA and ribosomal protein genes are relatively highly expressed and PriA is essential.</p><p>Due to the low intensity of single fluorescent molecules, both the stoichiometry and dynamics experiments are technically challenging. In addition, the bacteria themselves are potentially subject to photo damage at the intensities required to resolve single molecules, and this photo damage itself affects cellular processes and replication in particular. Therefore, it is essential to consider these measurements in the context of additional corroboratory biochemical and genetic evidence. The essentiality of restart proteins and the measurement of the replication rates provide independent lines of evidence for the pervasive disassembly model.</p><p>We propose that the number of replication-transcription conflicts is significantly greater than previously suggested: far from being rare, we infer from the data presented here that conflicts are <italic>generic</italic> and occur multiple times per cell cycle. If so, then these encounters frequently compromise the integrity of the replisome, leading to discontinuity in the process of DNA replication. These observations therefore present a new model for the canonical states of DNA replication, arguing against the well-accepted model that the process of replication is highly continuous <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Growth curves</title><p>Cell cultures were grown for 16 hours in minimal arabinose (or LB) medium supplemented with threonine and tryptophan until cells reached log phase growth.

A Gaussian kernel was used, and the optimal bandwidth was selected by minimization of the asymptotic mean integrated squared error.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Discussion of filtering algorithms</title><p>Because the raw intensity data has too large a variance to directly detect steps by analysis of the pairwise differences, Leake et al. applied an Edge-Preserving Chung-Kennedy (SED) Filter to smooth the intensity data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith, 1998</xref>). Although we could also detect intensity steps using the SED filter, this approach appeared to have two important shortcomings: (i) The filter had what we considered poor performance under many scenarios (described below) and (ii) the filter uses two <italic>ad hoc</italic> filtering parameters which must be optimized. In our hands, the results of the SED filter were not particularly robust to parameter choice.</p><p>To eliminate the need to specify <italic>ad hoc</italic> parameters for the data analysis, we attempted to apply an objective parameter-free step-detection algorithm developed by Kalafut and Visscher (KV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalafut and Visscher, 2008</xref>). The KV filter uses a Change-Point Algorithm for determining steps in a signal. The KV filter, as described, has two important shortcomings with respect to the current application: (i) The signal is assumed to have constant variance for all states (false) and (ii) the statistical test for step determination uses the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), which we have recently demonstrated does not result in optimal performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wiggins, 2015</xref>), resulting in either over or underfitting depending on the application.</p><p>We describe the adaptation of Change-Point Methods to biophysical applications elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wiggins, 2015</xref>). In short, our CP algorithm is parameter free. The performance of the CP Algorithm and the SED filter applied to simulated intensity data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> shows the raw (unfiltered) data. Panel B shows the truth (blue, true mean intensity simulated), the simulated data (blue dots), CP idealization (red) and the SED filter (green). The performance of the CP Algorithm correctly determines the position of all steps except one and is qualitatively superior to the performance of the SED filter.</p><p>Note that in general the step determination at high intensity is imprecise due to the large variance (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf65"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Î´</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). For higher intensities than those shown in the simulation, the CP algorithm cannot reliably determine the steps, although the CP idealization represents an optimal guess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wiggins, 2015</xref>). One might worry that these imprecisely-determined high-intensity steps could result in a significant degradation in the pairwise distribution function, but there are two natural mechanisms for the suppression of their contribution: (i) The short duration of these steps in frames and the large std both result in a small Fisher Information. (ii) Furthermore the weighting in the PPDD is proportional to the lifetime of the step. Therefore these short steps have a much weaker role in determining the single-fluorophore intensity than the long-lived and less noisy steps at the end of the bleaching trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wiggins, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>The KV versus CP filter</title><p>We discovered that the KV filter does not apply a statistical test with suitable frequentist statistical performance to evaluate the existence of new intensity levels. To compare the performance of the KV and CP filters, we simulated intensity data with no transitions. For simplicity, we used a Gaussian process with unit variance for 120 frames for 10,000 independent simulated datasets. We then idealized this data using both the KV and CP filters. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3</xref> for the analysis of 10 typical simulated traces and their idealization using both the KV and CP filters. The KV algorithm has a Type I error (finding at least one false transition) 45% of the time! (See the bar plot of algorithm performance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3B</xref>) This result implies that data analysis is performed with a 55% confidence level in a Neyman-Pearson Hypothesis Test. Such a small confidence level is clearly unacceptable from a canonical frequentist perspective. In contrast, the Type I error rate for the CP filter is 5%, corresponding to a 95% confidence level. (Although the above simulation describes a scenario under which the KV filter leads to significant over-fitting, in other circumstances, the KV filter can result in significant under-fitting and therefore should not be used for quantitative applications.)</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Simulation: Step detection efficiency using the CP filter as a function of step size</title><p>There are a number of important factors that influence the resolution of the CP filter. The ability of the CP algorithm to resolve steps depends principally on the lifetime of the states and the step size between states. To estimate the resolution of the CP filter in step determination, we first simulated transitions from one to zero flours (the final bleaching step) using a constant lifetime equal to the inverse observed intensity decay rate (t<sub>b</sub>Â =Â 41 frames). The Fixed-Lifetime curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7âfigure supplement 4</xref> shows the detection efficiency for the bleaching step as a function of step size. In our experiments, the step-size to the standard deviation ratio (ÎÂµ/Ï) is between 2 and 3. Under these conditions, the step detection efficiency is essentially unity. Of course, the last bleaching step has a distribution of lifetimes, rather than a fixed lifetime equal to the mean lifetime. Next we simulated photobleaching events with variable lifetimes (i.e. stochastic lifetimes with a bleaching rate of kÂ =Â 1/41 frames). The variable-lifetime curve shows the detection efficiency for the bleaching step as a function of step size. Unlike the Fixed-lifetime curve, the variable-lifetime curve never reaches unity due to the existence of a small subset of events that are not long enough to resolve. In spite of the inability to resolve very short-lived states, the detection efficiency is still roughly 90% in the simulation at the observed signal to noise ratio (ÎÂµ/Ï â 2.5).</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Simulation: Data generated by different protein stoichiometries</title><p>To test the overall consistency of the analysis approach, we simulated intensity traces using the observed ratio of step size to standard deviation (ÎÂµ/Ï â 2.5 and assuming linear scaling of the variance with intensity) and state lifetime (kÂ =Â 1/41 frames<sup>â1</sup>) for different stoichiometries between 3 and 15 proteins. The distribution of estimated stoichiometries for selected simulated stoichiometries is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7âfigure supplement 5A</xref>.

The widths of the distributions are roughly consistent with those observed in experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Imaging protocol for replication-complex lifetime</title><p>Cells are imaged at two-minute intervals, taking both a phase and fluorescence image at each time point. For lifetime measurements, where the foci must be tracked over a longer time scale, bleaching is undesirable. In order to minimize both bleaching and possible photodamage to the cells (as indicated by abnormally slowed elongation), we find a longer (600 ms) exposure at lower laser intensity to be optimal. Imaging may continue for aboutÂ 20 min before focus visibility is significantly impaired by photobleaching, and we note that cells were elongating exponentially regardless of laser use (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Analysis of replisome-complex lifetime</title><p>Replisome foci were observed to undergo step-like transitions between on and off states. We attempted to use the same analysis used for the bleaching experiments. But, this analysis is designed around the assumption that the replisome undergoes minimal motion. Over the 20 min timescale, the replisome can undergo significant movement and therefore we needed to find an alternative approach.</p><p>The phase contrast image for each time point is segmented to determine cell boundaries. For analysis of the fluorescence images, we used a locus-tracking engine that we have described previously to track and quantify loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kuwada et al., 2013</xref>). In short, foci are detected and fit to a Gaussian point-spread function in each frame. Up to four foci are identified per cell. Each focus is assigned a score (as described in the section titled âFocus scoresâ above). The larger the score the more confidence the algorithm has identified a true focus (versus a stochastic fluctuation is fluorescence intensity). Trajectories of replication complexes are then constructed by grouping foci based on the following rules: (i) No foci in the trajectory may score lower than 3. (ii) A focus cannot move more than 350 nm between frames. (iii) The mean of all scores in the trajectory must be a minimum of 4. (iv) At least one focus in the trajectory must score five or higher. (v) Trajectories may continue through a single frame with no (or score <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf66"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>â¤</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) focus provided that all of the above conditions are still met. (vi) Trajectories must last more than three frames. (vii) Included foci must show localization consistent with the replisome.</p><p>We have experimented with various rules for grouping foci, but the above best reproduced trajectories qualitatively consistent with the raw images. Foci scoring three or lower appeared randomly throughout the cell, inconsistent with protein bound to the replication factory. Higher cutoffs were found to lead to gaps in the locus trajectories that lasted for a single frame, consistent with stochastic fluctuations in intensity. We have also required that trajectories last a minimum of three frames. Shorter-lived events are consistent with events observed in cells without active replication, and therefore we believe that these events are also predominantly the result of stochastic fluctuations in fluorescence intensity. Note that, regardless of our choice of grouping, trajectories were always longer lived (on average) for rifampicin treatment and the <italic>rpoB*</italic> mutation.</p><p>For a disassembly event, foci must disappear for more than two minutes to be counted as disassembly events. (i.e. we require the off state to last for more than one frame to remove most intensity-fluctuation induced false negative events.) A typical trajectory corresponds to a cell containing a focus track with foci scores 3â7 transitioning to a cell with no foci or low-scoring foci (â¤2 appearing in inconsistent locations in the cell from frame to frame, consistent with false positive focus identification due to photon shot noise (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> for examples of scored trajectories).</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>Controlling for bleaching in replisome-complex lifetime experiments</title><p>To exclude the possibility that disappearance events are due to photobleaching, we image the cells with the same settings as in the replisome-complex lifetime experiment, but remove the delay between frames. Under these conditions the cells will be dosed with the same amount of light, but over the shortened time scale we would expect bleaching to occur before disassembly due to a conflict. The results confirm that minimal bleaching occurs over the time course.

Cells resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 25 mM imidazole were lysed by sonication. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 1 hr at 18,000 x <italic>g</italic>, and proteins were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (ÃKTA System, GE Healthcare) using a metal-chelating affinity column (HisTrap HP, GE Healthcare). YPet-containing fractions eluted at high imidazole concentrations were identified by absorbance at 280 nm and confirmed using a microplate photometer to verify the correct excitation and emission spectra.</p></sec><sec id="s4-33"><title>Preparation and imaging of surface immobilized protein</title><p>For imaging, we dilute purified protein in PBS to the point where individual molecules are visible during fluorescence microscopy. We fill a 10 ÂµL flow cell (constructed by sticking a KOH cleaned coverslip to a base slide with two strips of two sided tape) with the PBS-fluorescent protein solution and allow it to sit upside down for 10 min, binding the proteins to the coverslip. The channel is then rinsed with 400 ÂµL of PBS to clear any remaining fluorescent protein from the background.</p><p>We image and the isolated protein using the same settings as the <italic>in vivo</italic> bleaching experiments, and analysis proceeds as for live cell bleaching experiments (the only difference being that we do not take a phase contrast image and intensity regions are identified from the fluorescent images alone). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref> for example isolated protein bleaching traces. We arrive at the unitary intensity step distribution for known single fluorophores. As a consistency check, we confirm that the <italic>in vivo</italic> unitary intensity step distributions for all strains are highly similar to those found <italic>in vitro</italic>. We find agreement of the peak values for <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> distributions to within 19% for GFP and 18% for YPet.</p></sec><sec id="s4-34"><title>Thymidine incorporation assays</title><p>Exponentially growing cells raised in minimal MOPS medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2007b</xref>) supplemented with either 1% arabinose or glucose, at 30Â°C, were split at OD 0.2 into equal 1.2 ml cultures. Cells continued to grow until they reached OD 0.3., at which point 30 Âµg/ml rifampicin was added to one of the cultures for 2 min. Next, 38 ÂµCi <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine (Perkin Elmer 70â90 Ci/mMol) was added to both cultures, and timepoints were taken at 2 min intervals by pipetting 200 Âµl of cells into 3 ml of ice-cold 10% TCA. Samples were collected on glass microfiber filters (GE Healtthcare #1825â025), and washed 3x with 5% TCA prior to detection on a liquid scintillation counter.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge Dr. Jason Peters for generously sharing the strain containing the <italic>dcas9</italic>Â allele (CAG74209, or HM1500) and sgRNA expression vector (pJMP4) prior to publication of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> CRISPRi system, which we used to construct the <italic>priA</italic> knockdown strains published in our study.Â We are grateful to Seemay Chou for purification of the YPet protein and Patrick Nugent for building of the P<italic><sub>spank(hy)</sub>-lacZ</italic> construct.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Relying on single-molecule fluorescence imaging, the manuscript describes intriguing data suggesting that replisomes are disassembled and reassembled multiple times during each cell cycle in both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Three main lines of evidence are presented to support this claim: the intensities of replisome foci (which typically contain a pair of sister replisomes) are lower than expected in ~40% of cases, consistent with only a single replisome being active; replication foci are observed to disappear and reappear on the tens-of-minutes timescale; the intensities and dynamics of replisome foci are strongly affected by inhibition of transcription. The claimed observation of frequent collisions between replisomes and transcription complexes would represent a significant advance in the field and should be of interest to a wide community.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While all reviewers expressed excitement about the observations, a number of serious concerns were raised during the review process that should be addressed in a revised submission, requiring the introduction of new experimental data. In particular, those described in points 1 and 2 are essential in order for a revised submission to be further considered. I feel it is important to note that one reviewer expressed disappointment in the authors not having implemented suggestions and addressed concerns that were brought up during previous review processes at another journal.</p><p>Reviewers' comments:</p><p>1) As the authors note, replication takes ~30-40 minutes. And they are imaging for ~20 minutes. So, if the replisome really collapses 5-6 times per cell cycle, then they should see multiple collapses and reassembly events during a single imaging experiment. But this is not discussed or reported, as near as I can tell. The authors partially address this issue by stating: &quot;Due to the low intensity of single fluorescent molecules, both the stoichiometry and dynamics experiments are technically challenging. In addition, the bacteria themselves are subject to photo damage at the intensities required to resolve single molecules, and this photo damage itself affects cellular processes and replication in particular.&quot; But then the authors state that there is very little bleaching over the twenty-minute time frame currently used (subsection âReplicative helicase complexes are short-livedâ, first paragraph. These statements are directly contradictory. More importantly, they highlight the fact that the authors don't adequately discuss or present the effects of photobleaching on their experiments â and they don't convincingly show that they can distinguish between photobleaching and disassembly events or use their set up to rigorously observe multiple disassembly events within a single cell cycle, which is absolutely essential to their primary conclusion that disassembly takes place <italic>multiple</italic> times per cell cycle.</p><p>(I will also note that the quote above from the Discussion was modified slightly from the previous version of the manuscript I reviewed â it used to say &quot;The low stoichiometry of DnaC makes it technically difficult to image the same cells throughout their entire cell cycle without significant photobleaching at the same frame rate.&quot;)</p><p>Here's the bottom line: If the photobleaching really isn't an issue, then the authors must examine cells for longer and document multiple assembly and reassembly events over the course of an individual cell cycle. However, if the photobleaching is a major issue over a 20 min time-course, then I'm not convinced that the authors can really safely distinguish bleaching effects from disassembly events, at least based on the analyses currently presented.</p><p>Related to the points above: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref> need to make clear (in the figure, not just the legend) that the number of conflicts per cell cycle is being 'predicted' based on some assumptions about the Poisson distribution of events inferred from the behavior of single events being measured. The graph may lead some readers to believe that these values were measured, which they are not.</p><p>2) The authors need some alternative methods to corroborate their conclusion that replication forks collapse multiple times every cell cycle. Relying exclusively on the single-molecule microscopy is a recipe for disaster. The authors clearly agree, as they state in the second to last paragraph of the manuscript: &quot;Due to the low intensity of single fluorescent molecules, both the stoichiometry and dynamics experiments are technically challenging. In addition, the bacteria themselves are subject to photo damage at the intensities required to resolve single molecules, and this photo damage itself affects cellular processes and replication in particular. Therefore, it is essential to consider these measurements in the context of additional corroboratory biochemical and genetic evidence. The essentiality of restart proteins and the measurement of the replication rates provide independent lines of evidence for the pervasive disassembly model.&quot; I agree fully with the authors here that the photobleaching and photodamage that is occurring during their experiments is indeed likely affecting cellular processes and DNA replication, which means that relying on the single-molecule microscopy alone is extremely dangerous. So, the question then is what data help corroborate the microscopy? The authors cite two things: (1) The authors cite the measurements of replication rates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. These data are fine, but say nothing about the frequency of replication fork collapse per cell cycle. Slower nucleotide incorporation rates could occur from replication slowing down without the replisome fully disassembling and reassembling. In short, these data are loosely consistent with the authors' favored model, but do not incisively probe the issue. (2) The essentiality of restart proteins like PriA. The Polard et al. 2002 study of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PriA did indeed show that cells with mutant priA are quite sick, bordering on essential. But it's still not clear whether it's essential because it's required <italic>every</italic> cell cycle multiple times or because it's required once every few cell cycles. Simply examining plating efficiency only says priA mutants are essential, but it doesn't say how often the protein is required. What is needed is a means of rapidly shutting off PriA activity (via a temp. sensitive allele or induced degradation) and then to examine what happens in individual cells. In other words: The fact that Pri proteins are essential in the sense that mutants cannot be readily recovered on plates does <italic>not</italic> imply that these proteins are required multiple times every single cell cycle. That conclusion requires an analysis of single cells, immediately after the factor of interest has been eliminated. This is a very straightforward experiment that could help to bolster the authors' conclusion (or not).</p><p>3) The IPTG-induced expression of a gene oriented to produce a head-on collision is nice, but is lacking a crucial control, namely the same construct should be inserted at the same location but in the opposite and co-directional orientation.</p><p>In a previous round of review the authors indicated that this had been done and there is some effect, which is puzzling. There are many, many native, co-oriented genes, so if just one extra co-oriented gene has a measurable effect, then how does the replisome ever complete replication?</p><p>4) The lifetime calculation and modeling need more details. How do the authors deal with photobleaching and incomplete capture of the replisome lifetime? How is the Maximum likelihood estimation obtained? Is the lifetime for one replisome, i.e. only a single replisome is followed, or are both replisomes compounded together? Are the assembly/disassembly of the two replisome coupled or independent? How do the authors take into account the possibility in the lifetime measurement that one replisome disassembled, and the other one reassembled immediately after that?</p><p>5) The authors assumed the replication time is 40 min based on literature (subsection âTranscription inhibition increases the rate of replicationâ, first paragraph), and the cell cycle time is close to 65 min. Is the 'number of conflicts per cell cycle' being 5 the number of conflicts per replisome per one 40 min or 65 min? Or is this number the total number of conflict for both replisomes? Is this based on the assumption of that there is only one replication run per cell cycle without multiple rounds of re-initiation? In addition, what's confusing is that the number of conflicts here needs the disappearance of both forks, implying that they are coupled? But the stoichiometry section clearly has many cells with one stable fork, so they are not counted as conflicts in the lifetime measurement? The authors should more clearly address the differences in what's being measured between the lifetime and stoichiometry experiments, and how the numbers add up and any discrepancies here.</p><p>6) The authors monitored replisome dynamics in live cells. Could they provide more information regarding what the off-time of replisome (the time each replisome stays off DNA) is? For example, if the percentage of cells containing only one active replisome is ~ 40-50%, it would translate to an averaged total off time of ~ 20 min for a replication time of 40 min (assuming the probability of a replisome staying off DNA is p at any given moment, then the chance of observing both replisome is p<sup>2</sup>, both replisomes off (1-p)<sup>2</sup>, and only one replisome at any given time is p(1-p) + (1-p)p= 2p(1-p). Therefore, solving 2p(1-p) = 0.5 leads to p = 0.5, hence 20 min per 40 min cycle). How does this translate into the average off-time per replisome given the number of conflicts per replisome cell cycle or replication cycle?</p><p>7) The authors technically cannot measure the stoichiometry of replisomes with two disassembled forks during replication. Is this the fraction of cells (~16%) mentioned in the third paragraph of the subsection âReplicative helicase and DNA polymerase stoichiometries are consistent with a single active complexâ? Or does this fraction also include cells before or at the end of replication where both replisomes are disassembled? Is this population (2 disassembled forks) accounted for the calculation of 40-50% of cells having only one replisome?</p><p>8) Thymidine incorporation: although the authors noted that the higher incorporation rate of thymidine in transcription inhibited strains is unlikely due to changes in membrane permeability, there is still a possibility that inhibited transcription may cause changes in membrane permeability through other mechanism such as the lack of expression of proteins involved in safeguarding membrane integrity. Therefore, the enhanced thymidine incorporation could still be due to an indirect effect of transcription inhibition, but not direct effect of transcription-replication conflict. Different growth conditions could have the same indirect effect as well. Could the authors use some dyes that can monitor membrane potentials such as the live/death kit of Invitrogen or something similar to verify this possibility? Also, they could use the lacZ induction strain to examine whether the thymidine incorporation rate in these strains is indeed lower.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The replisome undergoes multiple rounds of disassembly every cell cycle&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The addition of new experimental evidence and more detail on the analyses have improved the manuscript, but the reviewers still raise significant concerns about the statement that the replisome collapses multiple times per cell cycle, a conclusion that is not based on direct observation, but rather is inferred.</p><p>Nonetheless, your observations of the replisome collapsing as a consequence of transcriptional collisions is of interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic> and we would like to invite the submission of a revised manuscript. For it to be acceptable for publication, a significant revision of the writing is necessary, including change of the title and softening of the major claim that the replisome collapses multiple times per cell cycle.</p><p>Below you will find the reviewers' main points of criticism, with suggestions for additional experiments in case you wish to provide more direct evidence of the original claim. The inclusion of new experimental data may have to be evaluated by the original reviewers, before arriving at a final decision.</p><p>1) If the photobleaching really isn't an issue as the authors strongly claim, there needs to be a better demonstration that there really are 5-6 fork collapses and restarts in a single cell cycle time course. This is still lacking. The authors point to the image strips in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> as showing two disassemblies, but the WT data are not compelling; it's not clear whether there's a collapse and reassembly event or whether the first &quot;collapse&quot; is really a collapse in the first place as the two frames with an apparently disassembled fork have a focus just as intense as in subsequent panels indicating a &quot;reassembled&quot; fork. Even more importantly: the authors make a strong prediction that forks disassemble and reassemble 5-6 times per cell cycle and there's simply no direct demonstration of this occurring.</p><p>As a side note, the rif-treated cells show longer focus lifetimes, which is certainly consistent with the authors' model, but rif-treatment could be affecting the process and focus stability in all sorts of indirect ways, none of which are considered or ruled out.</p><p>2) There needs to be a clear, independent corroboration that forks collapse multiple times per cell cycle, every cell cycle. The new data using CRISPRi to knockdown priA are a step in the right direction but incomplete and inconclusive right now. The authors can clearly knockdown priA, but the timing of knockdown is not characterized, which is important here. There is a single snapshot analysis done suggesting fewer foci in the priA knockdown, but the images shown in the supplement are very, very difficult to interpret; relatively few cells are shown, the foci in both the experiment and control strain are not nearly as clear as in other parts of the paper and the DnaC-GFP levels overall appear substantially reduced in the priA strain. Moreover, there's no demonstration that the loss of priA leads to an immediate loss in viability, only that the priA CRISPRi strain losses plating viability â but as noted previously, this doesn't distinguish between fork restart being required <italic>every</italic> cell cycle vs. once every few cell cycles, which is the key issue here.</p><p>3) The authors did not really address the request of making the calculation of conflict per replication time clear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>, and D). I had to play with the source data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> myself, and arrived at a value similar but not the same, number of conflicts (~ 4.4) per 40 min replication time. Nevertheless, please do add a section in the Materials and methods to explain how the survival probability is calculated, report the mean lifetime of replisome of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the mean survival rate of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, and the corresponding fitting functions and parameters. They will be helpful for the community. In addition, the authors should use experimentally measured survival probability, instead of the theoretical value from the exponential fitting in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> to plot <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Similar comments apply to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19848.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>While all reviewers expressed excitement about the observations, a number of serious concerns were raised during the review process that should be addressed in a revised submission, requiring the introduction of new experimental data.

In the no-delay experiment, the foci are expected to be bleached before conflict-induced disassembly, whereas in the two-minute-delay experiments, conflict-induced disassembly is faster than photobleaching. Since the net dosage of excitation light is the same in the two experiments by frame number, conflict-induced disassembly is expected to shorten lifetime (measured in frames) of the foci in the two-minute-delay experiment relative to the no- delay experiment.</p><p>Results: In the no-delay experiment, 8% of GFP-labeled complexes disappeared during the eleven frame time course; whereas, in the two- minute-delay experiment, 80% of foci disappeared, an order of magnitude increase in the rate, strongly rejecting the photobleaching hypothesis.</p><p>Additional evidence: Experimental evidence was already included in the original manuscript which rejects the photobleaching hypothesis. Rif- treated and <italic>rpoB*</italic> cells are imaged under exactly the same conditions as the wild type cells.

The Polard et al. 2002 study of B. subtilis PriA did indeed show that cells with mutant priA are quite sick, bordering on essential. But it's still not clear whether it's essential because it's required every cell cycle multiple times or because it's required once every few cell cycles.

What is needed is a means of rapidly shutting off PriA activity (via a temp. sensitive allele or induced degradation) and then to examine what happens in individual cells. In other words: The fact that Pri proteins are essential in the sense that mutants cannot be readily recovered on plates does not imply that these proteins are required multiple times every single cell cycle. That conclusion requires an analysis of single cells, immediately after the factor of interest has been eliminated. This is a very straightforward experiment that could help to bolster the authors' conclusion (or not).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be nice to show the reported reassembly events are dependent on a well-established biological mechanism. In addition, we also agree that determining whether restart (PriA or the helicase loaders) are required for the observed reassembly events would provide solid evidence that supports our findings. To address these points, we carried out two additional experiments:</p><p>Additional experiment 1: We first perturbed the restart process in <italic>E. coli:</italic> DnaC<sub>Ec</sub> is required for the loading of the replicative helicase DnaB, and is recruited to stalled replication forks through the action of Pri proteins. The loading process can be perturbed using the <italic>E. coli</italic> temperature sensitive helicase loader mutant allele, <italic>dnaC2</italic>. If the reappearance events we observe in the lifetime experiments are indeed due to restart, we would expect that the <italic>dnaC<sub>Ec</sub></italic>mutant would be defective in reassembly of the helicase (DnaB) or reappearance of the foci. We therefore observed the replisome dynamics in the <italic>dnaC2</italic> allele at both the permissive and the non-permissive temperature. (WT was also analyzed at the high temperature to control for potential artifacts of temperature change on lifetimes).</p><p>Results: We observed qualitatively different DnaB-YPet focus dynamics in the <italic>dnaC2</italic> strain at the nonpermissive temperature, as predicted. Foci that disassemble are typically not observed to reassemble. To quantitate this data, we calculate the probability of observing a focus as a function of time in cells that have at least one focus. In strains containing the <italic>dnaC2</italic> allele, this probability decreases throughout the time course consistent with failure to restart. In the wild type strain, the probability is roughly constant indicating that the replisome is in steady state due to its ability to restart. We observed loss of foci in the <italic>dnaC2</italic> allele strain is too rapid to be explained by replication termination.</p><p>Additional experiment 2: We next perturbed the restart process in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> by depleting the PriA protein. We constructed a CRISPR system to inducibly deplete PriA from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells. Again, the predicted phenotype is the failure of replisome foci to reassemble after disassembly.</p><p>Results: Consistent with the restart hypothesis, we find that after depletion of PriA through the induction of the CRISPR system, helicase (DnaCBs) foci disappear, with 87% of cells now lacking any visible foci. The foci do not reappear after PriA depletion and the initial disappearance.</p><p>In summary, we targeted two successive steps in the restart process, the <italic>dnaC2<sub>Ec</sub></italic>experiments from <italic>E. coli</italic> and the PriA depletion experiments from <italic>B. subtilis,</italic> and found that both strongly support the proposed model.</p><p><italic>3) The IPTG-induced expression of a gene oriented to produce a head-on collision is nice, but is lacking a crucial control, namely the same construct should be inserted at the same location but in the opposite and co-directional orientation.</italic> </p><p><italic>In a previous round of review the authors indicated that this had been done and there is some effect, which is puzzling. There are many, many native, co-oriented genes, so if just one extra co-oriented gene has a measurable effect, then how does the replisome ever complete replication?</italic> </p><p>These data have been added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). There is a slight but significant increase in single-helicase population.</p><p>The observation of some small increase in disassembly is expected given our previous findings. Co-oriented genes do result in conflicts when they are transcribed at high levels and the transcription unit is long, as is the case here (<italic>lacZ</italic> is 3 kb in length) [H. Merrikh et al. 2011, Million-Weaver et al. 2015]. In fact, we have previously demonstrated that conflicts occur at this reporter using ChIP-qPCR experiments. See Merrikh et al. (2015). It should be noted that the length of the lacZ gene, combined with the strength of the promoter used here creates conflicts with similar severity to those observed for the rDNA genes, and thus, this reporter is not surprisingly more problematic than most genes transcribed co- directionally on the chromosome.</p><p><italic>4) The lifetime calculation and modeling need more details. How do the authors deal with photobleaching and incomplete capture of the replisome lifetime? How is the Maximum likelihood estimation obtained? Is the lifetime for one replisome, i.e. only a single replisome is followed, or are both replisomes compounded together? Are the assembly/disassembly of the two replisome coupled or independent? How do the authors take into account the possibility in the lifetime measurement that one replisome disassembled, and the other one reassembled immediately after that?</italic> </p><p>We have now included a new mathematical analysis to address the reviewersâ suggestion to analyze a more detailed model where the forks transition independently. We initially avoided introducing this model explicitly since it relies on a number of assumptions that we have not tested and believe to be incorrect. The model also leads to roughly comparable estimates, but with significantly more complex mathematical expressions. However, there is value in such an analysis and thus, we have modeled it and the results of the independent-fork model are now included in a supplementary note.</p><p><italic>5) The authors assumed the replication time is 40 min based on literature (subsection âTranscription inhibition increases the rate of replicationâ, first paragraph), and the cell cycle time is close to 65 min. Is the 'number of conflicts per cell cycle' being 5 the number of conflicts per replisome per one 40 min or 65 min? Or is this number the total number of conflict for both replisomes?</italic> </p><p>This is an important question. We have now included a brief discussion of the length of the cell cycle in the description of the independent fork model.</p><p><italic>Is this based on the assumption of that there is only one replication run per cell cycle without multiple rounds of re-initiation? In addition, what's confusing is that the number of conflicts here needs the disappearance of both forks, implying that they are coupled? But the stoichiometry section clearly has many cells with one stable fork, so they are not counted as conflicts in the lifetime measurement? The authors should more clearly address the differences in what's being measured between the lifetime and stoichiometry experiments, and how the numbers add up and any discrepancies here.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers about this point. See the discussion of the independent-fork model.</p><p><italic>6) The authors monitored replisome dynamics in live cells. Could they provide more information regarding what the off-time of replisome (the time each replisome stays off DNA) is?</italic> </p><p>We have included a discussion of the estimated off time in the description of the independent-fork model.</p><p><italic>For example, if the percentage of cells containing only one active replisome is ~ 40-50%, it would translate to an averaged total off time of ~ 20 min for a replication time of 40 min (assuming the probability of a replisome staying off DNA is p at any given moment, then the chance of observing both replisome is p<sup>2</sup>, both replisomes off (1-p)<sup>2</sup>, and only one replisome at any given time is p(1-p) + (1-p)p= 2p(1-p). Therefore, solving 2p(1-p) = 0.5 leads to p = 0.5, hence 20 min per 40 min cycle). How does this translate into the average off-time per replisome given the number of conflicts per replisome cell cycle or replication cycle?</italic> </p><p>See the discussion of the independent-fork model.</p><p><italic>7) The authors technically cannot measure the stoichiometry of replisomes with two disassembled forks during replication. Is this the fraction of cells (~16%) mentioned in the third paragraph of the subsection âReplicative helicase and DNA polymerase stoichiometries are consistent with a single active complexâ? Or does this fraction also include cells before or at the end of replication where both replisomes are disassembled? Is this population (2 disassembled forks) accounted for the calculation of 40-50% of cells having only one replisome?</italic> </p><p>While we normally see a single midcell focus representing the both replisomes, occasionally the forks separate enough to be individually resolvable (this is ~16% of the time). We exclude individually resolvable forks since our interpretation of the counting experiments depends on both forks co-localizing to a single diffraction limited spot. We do not report the number of zero focus cells because they can result either from disruption of both forks, or the absence of replication. The 40- 50% refers to the number of cells with a focus that are consistent with having one replisome.</p><p><italic>8) Thymidine incorporation: although the authors noted that the higher incorporation rate of thymidine in transcription inhibited strains is unlikely due to changes in membrane permeability, there is still a possibility that inhibited transcription may cause changes in membrane permeability through other mechanism such as the lack of expression of proteins involved in safeguarding membrane integrity. Therefore, the enhanced thymidine incorporation could still be due to an indirect effect of transcription inhibition, but not direct effect of transcription-replication conflict. Different growth conditions could have the same indirect effect as well. Could the authors use some dyes that can monitor membrane potentials such as the live/death kit of Invitrogen or something similar to verify this possibility? Also, they could use the lacZ induction strain to examine whether the thymidine incorporation rate in these strains is indeed lower.</italic> </p><p>Many independent lines of evidence contradict this proposal: (i) Since the thymidine incorporation experiments are performed over a short time interval (&lt;10 min), protein levels are not expected to change appreciably. (ii) Rif treatment does not increase thymidine incorporation further in the <italic>rpoB</italic>* cells, suggesting that Rif treatment does not change membrane permeability in general. (iii) <italic>rpoB</italic>* cells do not show a significant change in growth rate, which would be expected if membrane integrity was significantly compromised. (iv) The proposed artifact is unlikely to explain the coincident results from three independent experiments: rif, <italic>rpoB</italic>* and changes carbon source. (v) Rif treatment doesnât appear to significantly compromise membrane integrity since normal cell elongation is observed for more than an hour after rif treatment.</p><p>We have not performed the <italic>lacZ</italic> induction experiment since we are not convinced that the effect would be large enough to detect by thymidine incorporation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The addition of new experimental evidence and more detail on the analyses have improved the manuscript, but the reviewers still raise significant concerns about the statement that the replisome collapses multiple times per cell cycle, a conclusion that is not based on direct observation, but rather is inferred.</italic> </p><p><italic>Nonetheless, your observations of the replisome collapsing as a consequence of transcriptional collisions is of interest to the readers of eLife and we would like to invite the submission of a revised manuscript. For it to be acceptable for publication, a significant revision of the writing is necessary, including change of the title and softening of the major claim that the replisome collapses multiple times per cell cycle.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the manuscript title, and softened the language surrounding our statements about multiple collapse events, making it clear that they were inferred. Please find below our responses to the reviewersâ criticisms. Although no new experimental data have been introduced, we clarify some of the points brought up by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Below you will find the reviewers' main points of criticism, with suggestions for additional experiments in case you wish to provide more direct evidence of the original claim. The inclusion of new experimental data may have to be evaluated by the original reviewers, before arriving at a final decision.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) If the photobleaching really isn't an issue as the authors strongly claim, there needs to be a better demonstration that there really are 5-6 fork collapses and restarts in a single cell cycle time course. This is still lacking. The authors point to the image strips in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> as showing two disassemblies, but the WT data are not compelling; it's not clear whether there's a collapse and reassembly event or whether the first &quot;collapse&quot; is really a collapse in the first place as the two frames with an apparently disassembled fork have a focus just as intense as in subsequent panels indicating a &quot;reassembled&quot; fork. Even more importantly: the authors make a strong prediction that forks disassemble and reassemble 5-6 times per cell cycle and there's simply no direct demonstration of this occurring.</italic> </p><p>Although it would be ideal to observe the replisome for entire cell cycles, the components simply arenât present at high enough stoichiometry for this to be technically possible using the tools we currently have available. The ~20 minute time courses were taken at random places during the cell cycle, and should be representative of the cell cycle as a whole. However, drawing specific conclusions about the number of conflicts during the entire cell cycle from the 20 minute time courses does require a number of assumptions as the reviewers suggests, so we have softened the language, making it clear that the conflict number was calculated and not directly observed.</p><p>We would like to add that the fluorescence intensity is relatively spread out in the region where the first collapse event is interpreted to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The fluorescence in the frame where we interpret re-assembly is much more localized. This can be more easily seen in the (larger) reproduction of this image strip in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, where we describe the process of identifying foci. Regardless, the same automated tracking was applied to the wild-type, rif-treated, and <italic>rpoB*</italic> mutant cells. We observed that the focus lifetimes were transcription dependent, and have adjusted the language in the manuscript to focus on the destabilization of the replisome due to transcription rather than the specific inferred number of conflicts.</p><p><italic>As a side note, the rif-treated cells show longer focus lifetimes, which is certainly consistent with the authors' model, but rif-treatment could be affecting the process and focus stability in all sorts of indirect ways, none of which are considered or ruled out.</italic> </p><p>To control for potential artifacts caused by rifampicin treatment, we corroborated our results using an <italic>rpoB*</italic> mutant. Using this independent method for ameliorating replication-transcription conflicts, we observe similarly elongated focus lifetimes relative to those observed in the wild type. These data can be found for the focus lifetime measurement in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) There needs to be a clear, independent corroboration that forks collapse multiple times per cell cycle, every cell cycle. The new data using CRISPRi to knockdown priA are a step in the right direction but incomplete and inconclusive right now. The authors can clearly knockdown priA, but the timing of knockdown is not characterized, which is important here. There is a single snapshot analysis done suggesting fewer foci in the priA knockdown, but the images shown in the supplement are very, very difficult to interpret; relatively few cells are shown, the foci in both the experiment and control strain are not nearly as clear as in other parts of the paper and the DnaC-GFP levels overall appear substantially reduced in the priA strain. Moreover, there's no demonstration that the loss of priA leads to an immediate loss in viability, only that the priA CRISPRi strain losses plating viability â but as noted previously, this doesn't distinguish between fork restart being required every cell cycle vs. once every few cell cycles, which is the key issue here.</italic> </p><p>While the priA snap-shot data supports a model where the replisome is disassembled, we understand that they do not provide additional evidence that disassembly occurs every cell cycle, and have softened the language in our manuscript to reflect this. Nonetheless, we would like to point out that we were able to perform the experiment suggested by the reviewer (visualization of the helicase immediately after disruption of restart) in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We showed that disruption of restart via a temperature sensitive version of the helicase loader protein (<italic>dnaC2</italic> allele) lead to loss of the DnaB-YPet focus before the end of the 20 minute time course in 80% percent of cases. We can infer (but are unable to observe directly) a 96% of focus disassembly before the end of a 40 minute replication cycle. Additionally, we note that 40 minutes is an upper limit on how quickly replication can be completed, and provides the most conservative estimate for the number of conflicts per cell cycle. This strongly supports at least one disassembly event per replication cycle.</p><p>We would have liked to have observed the fate of the DnaC-GFP focus in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> immediately after the depletion of PriA. However, due to leaky expression of the CRISPR system, PriA was already depleted threefold prior to induction (Peters, 2016). Because of this, even the uninduced priA CRISPR strain showed substantially reduced numbers of DnaC-GFP foci. After induction, so few foci remained at the start of imaging that time lapse imaging was not productive.</p><p>Other methods for PriA depletion were attempted, but the cells were highly sensitive to any modification to <italic>priA</italic>. Despite substantial effort, we were not able to construct a better system for PriA depletion in a reasonable amount of time.</p><p>Clearer representative images have been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The authors did not really address the request of making the calculation of conflict per replication time clear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>, and D). I had to play with the source data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> myself, and arrived at a value similar but not the same, number of conflicts (~ 4.4) per 40 min replication time. Nevertheless, please do add a section in the Materials and methods to explain how the survival probability is calculated, report the mean lifetime of replisome of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the mean survival rate of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, and the corresponding fitting functions and parameters. They will be helpful for the community. In addition, the authors should use experimentally measured survival probability, instead of the theoretical value from the exponential fitting in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> to plot <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Similar comments apply to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</italic> </p><p>A section entitled âEstimation of conflict number based on replisome complex lifetimeâ has been added to the manuscript that includes the details suggested by the reviewer. Furthermore, we have now included a summary of the requested parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> (<italic>B. subtilis</italic>) and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> (<italic>E. coli</italic>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
