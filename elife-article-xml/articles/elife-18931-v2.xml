Because Shank is highly enriched in the post-synaptic densities of excitatory synapses, prior studies have focused on the idea that Shank proteins regulate some aspect of synapse formation or function. Through its various domains, Shank proteins bind hundreds of other synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakai et al., 2011</xref>) thereby potentially altering diverse cellular functions. Shank proteins have been implicated in synaptic transmission, synapse formation, synaptic plasticity, and cytoskeletal remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang and Ehlers, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mammals have three Shank genes, each encoding multiple isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang and Ehlers, 2013</xref>). Several mouse Shank knockouts have been described but these mutants exhibit inconsistent (often contradictory) synaptic and behavioral defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang and Ehlers, 2013</xref>), most likely resulting from differences in which Shank isoforms are impacted by each mutation. The biochemical mechanism by which Shank mutations alter synaptic function and behavior has not been determined.</p><p>In humans, Shank mutations and CNVs are linked to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, and mania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peça et al., 2011</xref>). Haploinsufficiency for 22q13 (which spans the Shank3 locus) occurs in Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), a syndromic form of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Phelan and McDermid, 2012</xref>). PMS patients exhibit autistic behaviors accompanied by hypotonia, delayed speech, and intellectual disability (ID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonaglia et al., 2011</xref>). Heterozygous inactivating Shank3 mutations are found in sporadic ASD and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peça et al., 2011</xref>). These genetic studies suggest that decreased Shank3 function likely plays an important role in the pathophysiology of these psychiatric disorders.</p><p>A parallel set of genetic studies suggest that increased Shank3 function also contributes to psychiatric diseases. 22q13 duplications spanning Shank3 are found in ASD, schizophrenia, ADHD, and bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Failla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2013</xref>). These 22q13 duplications involve multiple genes; consequently, the contribution of increased Shank3 to these psychiatric disorders was uncertain. To address this issue, a transgenic mouse model was developed that selectively over-expresses Shank3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2013</xref>). This transgenic mouse exhibited hyperactive behavior and susceptibility to seizures. Taken together, these studies suggest that too little or too much Shank3 is associated with several psychiatric disorders.</p><p>If Shank3 mutations and CNVs are causally associated with these psychiatric disorders, cellular and circuit phenotypes should also be sensitive to Shank3 copy number. Consistent with this idea, several defects have been reported in Shank3<sup>+/-</sup> heterozygotes, including: decreased mEPSC frequency and spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>), decreased I<sub>h</sub> current density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yi et al., 2016</xref>), decreased TRPV1 current density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2016</xref>), increased tactile sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orefice et al., 2016</xref>), and decreased post-synaptic Homer abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Increased Shank expression was associated with increased spine density in hippocampus and decreased inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2013</xref>). In many cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orefice et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>), it was not determined if these phenotypes are a cell autonomous consequence of altered Shank3 copy number. While these studies identify cellular deficits associated with Shank3 CNVs, it remains unclear which Shank binding partners and cellular functions are responsible for psychiatric traits, nor why these traits are sensitive to both increased and decreased Shank gene dosage.</p><p>To further investigate how Shank proteins regulate nervous system development and function, we analyzed Shank function in an invertebrate genetic model.

Because <italic>shn-1</italic> is expressed in muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stefanakis et al., 2015</xref>), we assayed EGL-19/Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channel function by recording voltage-activated calcium currents in body muscle, using salines containing potassium channel blockers (TEA and 4AP). In these conditions, the remaining voltage-activated inward current is entirely blocked by the EGL-19 antagonist nemadipine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lainé et al., 2011</xref>).

We did several experiments to distinguish between these possibilities. First, we utilized CRISPR to isolate two deletion alleles that alter the EGL-19 carboxy-terminus (<italic>nu495</italic> and <italic>nu496</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

The <italic>egl-19(nu496)</italic> mutation had no effect on the voltage-dependence of calcium current activation nor on deactivation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

To further examine the functional impact of the SHN-1 PDZ interaction with EGL-19, we analyzed <italic>shn-1(ok1241)</italic> mutants, which have an in-frame deletion spanning exons encoding the PDZ domain and part of the proline-rich domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

We performed two further experiments to test this idea. First, we measured the gating currents of voltage-activated channels in body muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). The activation of Ca<sub>v</sub> channels is mediated by depolarization-induced movements of positively charged residues in membrane-spanning S4 helices, which are termed gating charges. When there is no net calcium current (by holding the muscle membrane at the reversal potential), gating charge movement can be measured as a small voltage-activated current. The magnitude of gating currents can be used as a measure of Ca<sub>v</sub> channel surface abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hulme et al., 2006</xref>).

This chimeric protein (designated Terrier to indicate the presence of EGL-19’s cytoplasmic tail) was expressed in body muscles. The Terrier protein contains tagRFP in the cytoplasmic domain, and pHluorin (a pH-sensitive GFP) in the ectodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, red fluorescence reports total Terrier protein while green fluorescence reports surface Terrier molecules. When expressed in body muscles, Terrier exhibits a punctate green and red fluorescence in the nerve ring, where body muscles receive synaptic input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). In <italic>shn-1</italic> null mutants, the intensity and size of green Terrier puncta were significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>), indicating decreased surface Terrier protein in the nerve ring.

To test this idea, we first identified activity-induced muscle genes. We analyzed gene expression following depolarization of body muscles with a nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) agonist (levamisole, Lev). Lev-induced genes were identified using the Affymetrix <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene chip. This analysis identified 427 genes whose expression was significantly increased following muscle depolarization (&gt;2 fold change, FDR p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). 67% (287/427) of Lev-induced genes contain binding sites for the myogenic transcription factor HLH-1 (&lt;5 kb from the transcriptional start site, TSS) in chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.modencode.org">http://www.modencode.org</ext-link>), suggesting that these genes are expressed in body muscles. Of the HLH-1 binding genes, 81% (233/287) contain predicted CREB binding sites (&lt;5 kb from the TSS). These results suggest that <italic>C. elegans</italic> body muscles (like other excitable cells) have a large number of activity-induced genes, many of which are potential CREB transcriptional targets.</p><p>Using this Lev-induced gene list, we devised a simple reporter assay for CREB induced gene expression. For this purpose, we focused on the <italic>gem-4</italic>/Copine gene, which was the top hit from our analysis of Lev-induced genes (induced ~30 fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The <italic>gem-4</italic> promoter contains multiple CRH-1/CREB binding sites, implying that it could be a direct CRH-1 transcriptional target. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that Lev treatment increased <italic>gem-4</italic> mRNA levels 8-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We designed a transcriptional reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) that compares expression of the <italic>gem-4</italic> promoter (expressing NLS-GFP) with a control promoter unaffected by depolarization (the <italic>myo-3</italic> promoter, expressing NLS-mCherry) in individual muscle cells.

To determine if synaptic activity induces the <italic>gem-4</italic> reporter, we evoked excitatory synaptic input to muscles by photo-stimulating transgenic animals expressing channel rhodopsin in cholinergic motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In patch clamp recordings of body muscles, spontaneous action potentials are observed at ~1 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao and Zhen, 2011</xref>). Therefore, to mimic a realistic pattern of synaptic input, we photo-stimulated motor neurons (25 ms light pulse) at 1–20 Hz for 20 min. The <italic>gem-4</italic> reporter was significantly induced following 2, 5, 10, and 20 Hz photo-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Induction was not observed at lower frequencies (0.5 and 1 Hz) nor when animals were cultured without all trans-retinal (ATR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Photo-induction of <italic>gem-4</italic> expression was eliminated in <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which have dramatically reduced synaptic vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>). By contrast, <italic>unc-13</italic> mutations did not prevent Lev-induced <italic>gem-4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Similar levels of <italic>gem-4</italic> induction were produced by 20 Hz photo-stimulation and Lev treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Thus, the <italic>gem-4</italic> reporter was induced by both synaptic and Lev-evoked muscle depolarization. Expression of a mouse <italic>gem-4</italic> paralog (N-copine) in hippocampal neurons is also induced by high frequency stimulation of acute brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakayama et al., 1998</xref>); consequently, activity-induced copine expression is observed in both muscles and neurons and is conserved across phylogeny.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SHN-1 is required for <italic>gem-4</italic> induction</title><p>Using this <italic>gem-4</italic> reporter construct, we next asked if SHN-1 is required for CRH-1/CREB-induced gene expression.

Here we provide evidence that Shank regulates Ca<sub>v</sub>1 calcium current density and activity-induced gene expression, and that these two cellular functions are mediated by distinct dosage-sensitive mechanisms.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>SHN-1 promotes EGL-1/Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channel delivery to the cell surface</title><p>We find that SHN-1’s PDZ domain binds the EGL-19/Ca<sub>v</sub>1 carboxy-terminus (like their mammalian counterparts) and that disrupting this interaction decreased muscle calcium current. Mutations deleting SHN-1’s PDZ domain and those deleting EGL-19’s PDZ ligand both decreased EGL-19 calcium current and additive defects were not observed in double mutants. These results suggest that SHN-1’s effects on calcium current are mediated by binding of its PDZ domain to EGL-19’s carboxy-terminus. Analysis of gating currents and Terrier reporter fluorescence suggest that the decreased muscle calcium currents in <italic>shn-1</italic> mutants arises primarily from decreased trafficking of EGL-19/Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channels to the plasma membrane.</p><p>Shank effects on Ca<sub>v</sub>1 current in mammalian neurons or muscles have not been reported. The carboxy-terminus of mammalian Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (-ITTL<sub>COOH</sub>) and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 (-VSSL<sub>COOH</sub>) channels are both predicted to bind PDZ domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). When mutant constructs lacking the carboxy-terminal PDZ ligands of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 or Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels were expressed in hippocampal neurons, no changes in calcium current were observed; however, the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 truncation mutant exhibited decreased synaptic localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). The rat Shank 1 and 3 PDZ domains exhibit strong binding to Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (but not Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2). Thus, Shank proteins could promote synaptic targeting of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3; however, the PDZ protein responsible for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 targeting has not been identified. These studies relied on over-expression of mutant Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channels (rather than knockin mutations altering the endogenous genes); consequently, it remains possible that Shank proteins could also regulate Ca<sub>v</sub>1 current in mammalian neurons or muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>SHN-1 promotes activity-induced expression of <italic>gem-4</italic></title><p>Prior studies of mammalian neurons proposed that Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channel binding to a PDZ scaffolding protein promotes activity-induced CREB phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). These studies showed that deleting the carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 or 1.3, or over-expressing peptides containing the PDZ-ligands diminish activity-induced CREB phosphorylation and transcription of CREB targets. The PDZ protein responsible for these effects was not identified in these studies. Here we show that SHN-1 promotes expression of a CRH-1/CREB transcriptional target in muscles but that this effect does not require binding of SHN-1’s PDZ domain to EGL-19’s carboxy-terminus. In fact, deleting EGL-19’s PDZ ligand significantly enhanced depolarization induced CRH-1/CREB target expression, perhaps by disrupting EGL-19 interaction with another protein.</p><p>Our results suggest that SHN-1’s effects on calcium current density and <italic>gem-4</italic> induction are mediated by distinct mechanisms. Increased calcium current is mediated by SHN-1’s PDZ domain binding to EGL-19’s carboxy-terminus whereas another SHN-1 domain (most likely the Ankyrin or Proline-rich domains) enhances CREB activation.</p><p>A puzzling aspect of our results is that calcium current density and induced <italic>gem-4</italic> expression were poorly correlated. For example, reduced <italic>gem-4</italic> induction was observed in mutants with decreased (<italic>shn-1</italic> null mutants) and increased (<italic>shn-1/+</italic> heterozygotes) EGL-19/Ca<sub>v</sub>1 current density. Similar results were also reported in cultured mammalian neurons, where CREB phosphorylation was poorly correlated with calcium current density and instead was better correlated with Ca<sub>v</sub>1 open probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>). Based on these results (and others), these authors proposed that CREB phosphorylation is mediated by a calcium sensor that is spatially very close to (and possibly physically associated with) activated Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deisseroth et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>). In this scenario, CREB phosphorylation would be strongly correlated with calcium levels in the nanodomain of a Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channel but less correlated with global cytoplasmic calcium. Thus, our results suggest that CRH-1 activation may also be mediated by tight coupling of a calcium sensor to activated EGL-19/Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for understanding psychiatric disorders</title><p>In humans, Shank deletions and duplications both confer risk for ASD and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonaglia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Failla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gauthier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, too little or too much Shank is associated with psychiatric traits. If Shank CNVs are causally linked to these psychiatric disorders, cellular defects linked to ASD should exhibit similar sensitivity to Shank gene dosage. Consistent with this idea, several studies previously reported cellular and behavioral defects in Shank3<sup>m/+</sup> heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orefice et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yi et al., 2016</xref>). Increased Shank3 copy number has been analyzed in a single study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2013</xref>), which reported several behavioral and synaptic phenotypes. None of these studies identified phenotypes that were shared between decreased and increased Shank3 dosage. In most cases, it was not determined if cellular defects were cell autonomous consequences of altered Shank3 dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orefice et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Here we find that changes in <italic>shn-1</italic> gene dosage alter two cell autonomous phenotypes in muscles: L-channel calcium current and expression of CREB target genes. For both phenotypes, similar defects were observed in muscles with decreased and increased <italic>shn-1</italic> dosage. Thus, we identify two cellular phenotypes that exhibit the same pattern of dose sensitivity that is observed for Shank3 in schizophrenia and ASD. Based on these results, we propose that human Shank CNVs also cause cellular phenotypes, which may include altered calcium current and CREB target expression. By contrast, other <italic>shn-1</italic> mutant phenotypes (e.g. evoked EPSCs) were not sensitive to <italic>shn-1</italic> gene dosage. Thus, sensitivity to Shank copy number provides a useful criterion to determine which phenotypes are more likely to contribute to the psychiatric traits associated with Shank CNVs. Two recent studies showed that Shank3 binds directly to I<sub>h</sub> and TRPV1 channels in neurons and that the corresponding currents densities are significantly reduced in Shank3<sup>+/-</sup> heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yi et al., 2016</xref>). These results (together with those reported here) suggest that an important function of Shank proteins is to regulate ion channel densities.</p><p>How does <italic>shn-1</italic> dose alter L-current and CREB target expression? In general, dosage sensitive phenotypes are thought to occur by disrupting the function of multimeric protein complexes. In such cases, under and over-expression of individual subunits alter the stoichiometry of assembled holo-complexes, leading to decreased activity. For example, increased and decreased expression of the yeast histones H2A and H2B results in similar loss of function phenotypes (chromosome loss and altered gene expression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clark-Adams et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meeks-Wagner and Hartwell, 1986</xref>). Shank binds many other synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakai et al., 2011</xref>) and undergoes zinc induced polymerization into large complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baron et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, increased and decreased Shank abundance could disrupt the stoichiometry of post-synaptic complexes. Our results suggest that L-current and CREB activation are sensitive to subtle changes in the stoichiometry of Shank protein complexes. Our results further suggest that dynamic changes in the composition of Shank complexes provides a mechanism to regulate circuit function and plasticity (and potentially psychiatric traits).</p><p>Shank regulation of L-currents and CREB activation could both contribute to the pathophysiology of ASD. Human Shank mutations are particularly linked to ASD associated with intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leblond et al., 2014</xref>). CREB has long been linked to learning and memory in several model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourtchuladze et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dash et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yin et al., 1994</xref>); consequently, Shank’s CREB activation function could directly contribute to cognitive deficits associated humans Shank CNVs. CREB-induced BDNF expression promotes development of inhibitory synapses in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hong et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, Shank’s CREB activation function could alter synaptic inhibition, a phenotype found in several ASD models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>). Finally, L-channels play an important role in calcium signaling in dendrites and spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Higley and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). Thus, Shank’s Ca<sub>v</sub>1 current density function could contribute to cognitive or developmental defects in ASD by adjusting dendritic calcium signaling in CNS neurons. For these reasons, we propose that Shank effects on Ca<sub>v</sub>1 currents and CREB target expression could play an important role in the pathophysiology of ASD (and potentially other psychiatric disorders).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Strains</title><p>Strain maintenance and genetic manipulation were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Stimulus-evoked EPSCs were stimulated by placing a borosilicate pipette (5–10 µm) near the ventral nerve cord (one muscle distance from the recording pipette) and applying a 0.4 ms, 30 µA square pulse using a stimulus current generator (WPI).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Ca<sup>+2</sup> current <italic>recordings</italic> </title><p>The pipette solution contained (in mM): 140 CsCl; 10 TEA-Cl; 5 MgCl2; 5 EGTA; 10 Hepes, pH 7.2, with ~320 mosM CsOH. The extracellular solution contained (in mM): 140 TEA-Cl; 5 CaCl2; 1 MgCl2; 3 4-aminopyridine; 10 glucose; five sucrose; 15 Hepes, pH 7.4, with ~330 mosM CsOH. The voltage-clamp protocol consisted of −60 mV for 50 ms, −90 mV for 50 ms, test voltage (from −60 mV to +4 mV) 200 ms. Access resistance was continuously monitored, and ranged between 7 and 15 MΩ. Series resistance was not compensated. The voltage dependence of the Ca<sup>+2</sup> current density were fitted with the equation: <italic>I</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) = <italic>Gmax</italic>(<italic>V – Vrev</italic>) ⁄ ({1 + <italic>exp</italic>[(<italic>V0.5 – V</italic>) ⁄ <italic>k</italic>]}), where <italic>I(V)</italic> is the density of the current measured, <italic>V</italic> is the test pulse, <italic>Gmax</italic> is the maximum conductance, <italic>Vrev</italic> is the apparent reversal potential, <italic>V0.5</italic> is the half-activation voltage, and <italic>k</italic> is a steepness factor. The decay tau was well fit by a single exponential function and calculated from a test potential of 0 mV fitting the curve from the peak of the current till the end of the pulse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>Gating currents</title><p> The pipet and bath solutions were as described for the calcium current recordings. To resolve gating currents leak and capacitive transients were subtracted using a p/4 protocol, and measured by applying a series of test pulses at 5s intervals from the holding potential of −90 mV to potentials between +40 mV and +50 mV in 2 mV increments and integrating the gating charge movement at the reversal potential for the ionic current.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-4"><title>K<sup>+</sup> current recordings</title><p>The bath solution contained (in mM): NaCl 140, KCl 5, CaCl2 5, MgCl2 5, dextrose 11 and HEPES 5 (pH 7.2, 320 mOsm); and the pipette solution contained (in mM): KCl 120, KOH 20, Tris 5, CaCl2 0.25, MgCl2 4, sucrose 36, EGTA five and Na2ATP 4 (pH 7.2, 323 mOsm). The voltage-clamp protocol consisted of −60 mV for 50 ms, −90 mV for 50 ms, test voltage (from −60 mV to +60 mV) 1000 ms. IK<sub>fast</sub> was defined as the peak current after the capacitance transients, and IK<sub>slow</sub> was defined as the average current of the last 100 ms of each voltage step.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data was assessed for a normal distribution using the D'Agostino-Pearson normality test and equality of variances using the F-Test. For comparisons of normally distributed data with equal variances a two-tailed Student’s t-test was used. For all other comparisons the Mann–Whitney U test was used. For analysis of calcium current-voltage relationships, two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s correction for multiple comparisons was utilized. All statistics were performed in GraphPad Prism 6 and significant differences are indicated as follows: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, and ***p&lt;0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the following for strains, advice, reagents, and comments on the manuscript: <italic>C. elegans</italic> stock center, S Mitani, and members of the Kaplan lab.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Summary of reviewer comments and criticism:</p><p>The manuscript by Pym and colleagues presents phenotypic and molecular/genetic insight into the function of Shank with potential relevance to the pathophysiology of disease. In particular, these insights include potential regulation of calcium currents, downstream transcription and Shank gene dosage effects, a property of human disease biology that has yet to be well-connected to any particular cellular phenotype. For all of these reasons, the reviewers share enthusiasm for the study. However, there are several areas of concern. First, there are technical improvements that should be made and which are clearly specified in the reviews. Second, all three reviewers felt that additional insight into the regulation of the calcium channels was warranted. The extent to which this is possible remains unclear, but should be addressed at some level. Third, reviewers expressed concern by lack of mechanism. After further discussion this focused on several issues. On the one hand, the reviewers expressed concern regarding the broader cellular context for the phenotypic observations. Specifically, to what extent are the observed changes in <italic>gem-4</italic> specific to this gene, versus part of much broader regulatory disruptions? Likewise, to what extent are other channels or ionic currents altered? This is something that may be known to the authors based on their electrophysiological and gene profiling experiments that have been performed to date. If not, these are straightforward additions that could be pursued. On the other hand, there were concerns regarding the connection of Shank gene dosage to the cellular phenotypes. It may not be possible, in this system, to take this analysis to the level of changes in protein abundance, in vivo. But additional information to connect gene dosage to phenotypic severity would go a long way to establishing a model. Finally, the paper reads as a series of phenotypic observations and lacks coherence. It is not obvious to the reviewers how to address this issue. But, this is clearly something that could clearly benefit from additional experimentation as well as a more lengthy treatment in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper begins with the prior observation that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of Shank is expressed in muscle, enabling the authors to examine the effects of this disease associated protein on the synaptic transmission properties and gene expression profile of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The NMJ is a powerful system in the worm, allowing a combination of powerful genetics (dose-dependence of shank) with analysis of ionic currents, in vivo. The authors provide evidence (stated largely in their own words) that &quot;SHN-1's effects on calcium current are mediated by binding of its PDZ domain to EGL-19's carboxy-terminus.&quot; Their results suggest, &quot;that SHN-1's effects on calcium current density and <italic>gem-4</italic> induction are mediated by distinct mechanisms. Increased calcium current is mediated by SHN-1's PDZ domain binding to EGL-19's carboxy-terminus whereas another SHN-1 domain (most likely the Ankyrin or Proline-rich domains) enhances CREB activation.&quot; They find that, &quot;changes in shn-1 gene dosage alter two cellular phenotypes: L-channel calcium current and expression of CREB target genes. Thus, their &quot;results support the idea that human Shank CNVs cause cellular phenotypes that include altered calcium current and CREB target expression.&quot; When taken together, these data amount to an interesting advance with relevance to the cellular underpinnings of disorders caused by dose-dependent effects on expression of Shank that could reasonably be related to the cause or expression of disease related neurological symptoms in human. The manuscript suffers a bit from the brevity of style, presumable a consequence of prior submission at a different journal. Inclusion of additional information, already in the authors possession, or readily attained, could add an important dimension to this work that would increase the study's impact (see below).</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) The authors identify <italic>gem-4</italic> in an expression-array analysis of Lev-treated NMJ. Since the analysis has been completed, it seems reasonable to request that the entire transcriptional profiling data set be deposited in <italic>eLife</italic> as part of this manuscript. Is <italic>gem-4</italic> one of several hundred up-regulated genes, or one of only a few? The implications are important for understanding the degree to which the identified signaling is a simplification of a much broader effect. For example, a major conclusion of this paper is that Shank regulates both Cav1 function and, simultaneously, gene expression. But, the way the paper is written, the effects on gene expression are limited to a single gene.</p><p>2) Are the mechanisms identified by the authors part of a larger ion channel disruption process, or might these data point to differential effects in different cell types? The authors cite recent work from the Sudhof lab linking Shank to Ih. The authors make an effective argument that their observed effects on calcium channels are conserved in other species, and potentially relevant to disease. I suspect that the authors have analyzed additional currents and my have an indication, yes or no, that other channels are also dis-regulated. It may not be necessary to define which channels are dis-regulated, but it would be important to know whether there is a change in outward currents, A-type or delayed rectifiers.

In their work, they decided to focus on the interaction between the Shank-3 ortholog, Shn-1, and the sodium channel subunit Egl-19, as its mammalian ortholog was shown to play a role in a rare form of ASD. Pym and colleagues first show that Egl-19 and Shn-1 can indeed bind, just like their mammalian orthologs. They find that diminished currents in muscles in Shn-1 mutants are likely mediated by defects in Egl-19 expression, localization or function. Then, the authors focus on another Shn-1 mediated process, which is activity regulated expression. They perform a screen to identify the genes upregulated upon neuronal activation of muscle and decided to focus on <italic>gem-4</italic>. They confirm that <italic>gem-4</italic> activation requires Shn-1 activity but not its binding to Egl-19 thereby suggesting both processes are mediated by independent mechanisms. Finally, they determine that both Egl19 dependent currents as well as <italic>gem-4</italic> expression are sensitive to Shn-1 gene dose, something that is know from human patients. While the findings are of interest, especially due to the importance of Shank-3 in autism, I am not sure this paper represents a major step forward in our understanding. The Egl-19 and <italic>gem-4</italic> parts don't fit together and the story remains unfocused. Importantly, the mechanisms by which Shn-1 affects either Egl-19 dependent current or <italic>gem-4</italic> transcription remain unanswered. Finally, how all this is or is not relevant to autism is unclear.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Yeast two hybrid and GST pull down assays can, at best, indicate that two proteins CAN bind to each other (in these very artificial contexts) and definitely do not prove interaction in vivo. I would use more careful words. Probably beyond the scope of this paper but to show that they interact in vivo, even in the non-biochemical organisms such as <italic>C. elegans</italic>, one can perform experiments with tagged transgenic proteins and test their proximity in a wide range of strategies… Also, the experiments shown in Sup 1A+B are quite poorly controlled. So Egl19 does not bind the beads but does it bind other PDZ domains? In the well-referenced paper (Zhang et al., 2005) they performed many required controls to be able to suggest that the mammalian orthologs interact.</p><p>2) I was surprised that the authors did not attempt to describe the sub cellular localization of Egl-19 in WT and mutant worms… The best experiment would be to endogenously tag Egl-19 but even the second best – to follow the localization of transgenic Egl-19 was not performed. The PDZ binding motif has to remain on the C-terminal so one can N-terminally tag or tag C-terminally with the addition of the PDZ binding motif afterwards. This lies at the heart of how Shn-1 affects Egl-19 and is therefore a key question that remains unanswered in this work.</p><p>3) The activity dependent transcription experiment – I was surprised that the raw data are not shown. Is <italic>gem-4</italic> the top hit but one out of many or is it the only one? Ideally one would like to view this.</p><p>4) Figure 3—figure supplement 2 does not exist (or at least I could not find it).</p><p>Taken together, I think this work represents two interesting stories that are currently incomplete and perhaps unfortunately do not fit very well together.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Shank is a dose-dependent regulator of Cav1 calcium current and CREB target expression&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The review provides many helpful suggestions, which have greatly improved our paper. In response to these comments, we added several new experiments: 1) we repeated our analysis calcium current densities using a single protocol (responding to Review #2, comment 2); 2) we show that voltage-activated gating currents in body muscles are significantly reduced in <italic>shn-1</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>), suggesting that SHN-1 regulates delivery of EGL-19/Cav1 to the cell surface; 3) we show that surface delivery of a chimeric membrane protein that contains EGL-19’s cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) is also significantly reduced in <italic>shn-1</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-G</xref>); 4) we show that SHN-1 mutations do not alter other voltage-activated currents in body muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that SHN-1 selectively regulates calcium current density; 5) we provide a full description of Levamisole-induced gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, Table S2); and 6) we show that SHN-1 is required for activity-induced expression of a second muscle gene (<italic>cex- 1</italic>), which supports the idea that SHN-1 controls expression of multiple activity-induced genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I-J</xref>). These results, as well as complete responses to all reviewer comments, are detailed below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] Major issues:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors identify gem-4 in an expression-array analysis of Lev-treated NMJ. Since the analysis has been completed, it seems reasonable to request that the entire transcriptional profiling data set be deposited in eLife as part of this manuscript. Is gem-4 one of several hundred up-regulated genes, or one of only a few? The implications are important for understanding the degree to which the identified signaling is a simplification of a much broader effect. For example, a major conclusion of this paper is that Shank regulates both Cav1 function and, simultaneously, gene expression.</italic> </p><p>As requested, we now provide a complete description of the Lev-induced gene set:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“We analyzed gene expression following depolarization of body muscles with a nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) agonist (levamisole, Lev). […] These results suggest that <italic>C. elegans</italic> body muscles (like other excitable cells) have a large number of activity-induced genes, many of which are potential CREB transcriptional targets.”</p><p><italic>But, the way the paper is written, the effects on gene expression are limited to a single gene.</italic> </p><p>Prompted by this comment, we now show that SHN-1 is also required for expression of a second activity-induced gene:</p><p>Results:</p><p>“To determine if SHN-1 controls expression of other activity-induced genes, we developed a transcriptional reporter for a second Lev-induced gene (<italic>cex-1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5I</xref>). Expression of the <italic>cex-1</italic> reporter in body muscles was dramatically induced following Lev treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Because baseline <italic>cex-1</italic> expression in untreated muscles could not be reliably detected, we were unable to accurately measure the fold-induction of the <italic>cex-1</italic> reporter following Lev treatment. As seen with the <italic>gem-4</italic> reporter, we found that Lev-induced <italic>cex-1</italic> expression in muscles was dramatically reduced in <italic>shn-1</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).”</p><p><italic>2) Are the mechanisms identified by the authors part of a larger ion channel disruption process, or might these data point to differential effects in different cell types? The authors cite recent work from the Sudhof lab linking Shank to Ih. The authors make an effective argument that their observed effects on calcium channels are conserved in other species, and potentially relevant to disease. I suspect that the authors have analyzed additional currents and my have an indication, yes or no, that other channels are also dis-regulated. It may not be necessary to define which channels are dis-regulated, but it would be important to know whether there is a change in outward currents, A-type or delayed rectifiers. Conversely, if there is no change in these additional macroscopic currents, it would underscore the specificity of the effects being observed.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for pointing this out. As requested we now provide analysis of voltage-activated outward currents, finding that they are not significantly altered in <italic>shn-1</italic> mutants. As the reviewer indicates, these results are important because they indicate that SHN-1 selectively alters muscle Ca<sub>v</sub>1 current and has no effect on voltage-activated outward currents:</p><p>“To determine if SHN-1’s effects on calcium currents were specific, we measured voltage- activated potassium currents in body muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Neither the voltage- dependence nor the current density of fast and slow potassium currents were significantly altered in <italic>shn-1</italic> mutants.”</p><p><italic>3) A notable limitation of this system is the inability to associate changes in calcium currents with the synaptic localization and/or function of the calcium channel. It is not immediately clear if this limitation can be solved.

In response to this comment (and related comments in Reviews 2 and 3), we provide two new experiments (analysis of muscle gating currents and trafficking analysis of a chimeric membrane protein). Both of these new experiments support the conclusion that SHN-1 promotes the delivery of EGL-19/Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channels to the plasma membrane.</p><p>These results greatly enhance the significance our findings and are described in the revised text as follows:</p><p>“SHN-1 effects on calcium current could result from a change in EGL-19 delivery to the cell surface.

Prompted by this concern (and related comments in Reviews 1 and 3), we add two new experiments to address the mechanism for Shank alteration of L-current. First, we record voltage-activated gating currents in muscles, finding that the decreased calcium current in <italic>shn-1</italic> results from a decrease in the number of channels in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Second, we find that shn-1 null mutants have decreased trafficking of a chimeric reporter protein to the plasma membrane, again suggesting that SHN-1 promotes delivery of EGL- 19/Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channels to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>). These data are now described in the revised text, as follows:</p><p>“SHN-1 effects on calcium current could result from a change in EGL-19 delivery to the cell surface.

Prompted by this comment, we repeated all recording using a single protocol (which yields larger current densities in all genotypes). All of the original findings were replicated with these new recordings. We apologize for the confusion caused by our use of multiple protocols in the original submission.</p><p><italic>3) The authors look at copy number of SHN-1 but never give insight into the mechanisms of copy number regulation and it remains largely a phenomenological finding. Getting a mechanistic insight in how SHN-1 copy number leads to various changes that are observed in the manuscript is critical. In particular, how does one copy of SHN-1 or four copies of SHN-1 lead to the identical phenotype in Calcium current density? At minimum, the authors should correlate SHN-1 protein expression levels to copy number. What happens if you put in 3 copies, or 8 copies of SHN-1?</italic> </p><p>We agree that it would be very exciting to provide a mechanism to explain how calcium current and CREB target expression are similarly disrupted by decreased and increased Shank gene dosage. Even without a mechanistic explanation for <italic>shn-1</italic> dosage effects, we believe that our paper represents a significant advance for the field. To our knowledge, these phenotypes are the only examples where the same cell autonomous defects have been linked to increased and decreased Shank copy number (which parallels the effects of Shank3 CNVs on risk for Autism and schizophrenia). Now that we have established specific cellular traits that exhibit sensitivity to <italic>shn-1</italic> copy number, it is possible to design experiments asking how this dose sensitivity arises. However, I think it is fair to say that this is a difficult problem that will require many additional experiments. In fact, I am not aware of any good examples where the detailed biochemical mechanism for a haplo-insufficient or duplication phenotype has been determined. (Please let me know if you know of good examples!) Thus, while I agree that this is an important future goal, I hope that the reviewers will agree that describing a mechanism to explain shn-1 dosage sensitivity could be addressed in future publications.</p><p>Prompted by this comment, we made several changes in our revised paper. First, we now clearly list examples where cellular defects were identified in Shank3<sup>+/-</sup> heterozygotes and in transgenic animals containing an extra copy of Shank3:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>“If Shank3 mutations and CNVs are causally associated with these psychiatric disorders, cellular and circuit phenotypes should also be sensitive to Shank3 copy number. […] While these studies identify cellular deficits associated with Shank3 CNVs, it remains unclear which Shank binding partners and cellular functions are responsible for psychiatric traits, nor why these traits are sensitive to both increased and decreased Shank gene dosage.”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“In humans, Shank deletions and duplications both confer risk for ASD and schizophrenia (Bonaglia et al., 2006; Durand et al., 2007; Failla et al., 2007; Gauthier et al., 2010; Han et al., 2013). […] In most cases, it was not determined if cellular defects were cell autonomous consequences of altered Shank3 dosage (Han et al., 2013; Orefice et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016).”</p><p>Second, we provide a model for how increased and decreased <italic>shn-1</italic> copy number could result in the same phenotypes in the revised Discussion:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“How does <italic>shn-1</italic> dose alter L-current and CREB target expression? In general, dosage sensitive phenotypes are thought to occur by disrupting the function of multimeric protein complexes. […] Our results further suggest that dynamic changes in the composition of Shank complexes provides a mechanism to regulate circuit function and plasticity (and potentially psychiatric traits).”</p><p><italic>4) The authors demonstrate that loss of SHN-1 leads to an increase in cholinergic transmission. This is interesting since this there is no change in mEPSC amplitude or frequency. Some insight into how SHN-1 loss effects only evoked release should be done.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the increased evoked release in <italic>shn-1</italic> mutants is interesting and merits further study; however, this evoked release defect does not exhibit sensitivity to <italic>shn-1</italic> dosage. The NMJ transmission phenotype is included here to demonstrate that sensitivity to shn-1 dosage can be utilized to distinguish between different Shank phenotypes. Further experiments analyzing this recessive synaptic defect (although interesting) would not alter our conclusion that some phenotypes are dose sensitive while others are not. Consequently, we hope that the reviewers will agree that this phenotype can be further analyzed in a future study.</p><p><italic>Does the loss of SHN-1 also impact GABAergic transmission in the same manner?</italic> </p><p>The mIPSC frequency was unaltered while mIPSC amplitudes were modestly decreased in <italic>shn-1</italic> null mutants. As detailed in our response to comment #4, we prefer to focus on phenotypes sensitive to shn-1 copy number in this paper. For this reason, we respectfully request that more detailed studies of NMJ defects in shn-1 mutants could be addressed in future studies.</p><p><italic>5) The mutant ok1241 is not an acceptable mutant to just look at PDZ function. This mutant deletes much of the Proline domain in SHN-1.</italic> </p><p>We agree that an allele that selectively deletes the PDZ domain would be preferable and are attempting to isolate such an allele with Cas9 (no luck thus far). Although the <italic>ok1241</italic> allele deletes part of the proline rich domain, we do not believe that this undermines any of our conclusions. Voltage-clamp recordings of body muscles in <italic>ok1241</italic> exhibit a similar decrease in calcium current density to those observed in shn-1 null mutants and in <italic>egl-19(nu496)</italic> mutants (which deletes the c-terminal ligand for the SHN-1 PDZ domain). And shn-1(null) mutations and the egl-19(<italic>nu496</italic>) PDZ ligand mutation did not have additive effects on calcium current in double mutants, implying that SHN-1 alters calcium current via its effects on EGL-19’s c-terminus. Collectively, these results strongly support our conclusion that binding of SHN-1’s PDZ domain to EGL-19’s c-terminal PDZ ligand promotes expression of EGL-19 current. By contrast <italic>gem-4</italic> activation was not decreased after deleting EGL-19’s c-terminal PDZ ligand (i.e. <italic>nu496</italic>) nor after deleting SHN-1’s PDZ domain and part of its Pro-rich domain (i.e. <italic>ok1241</italic>). Thus, the CREB activation function of SHN-1 clearly does not require either the SHN-1 PDZ domain or its ligand (EGL-19’s c- terminus). Does the reviewer suggest that disrupting the proline-rich domain could somehow obscure an effect of the PDZ domain on <italic>gem-4</italic> induction?</p><p>We hope that the revised text explains these results and our interpretations more clearly:</p><p>“SHN-1 effects on calcium current density could result from direct binding of SHN-1 to EGL-19/Ca<sub>v</sub>1 or indirectly via other SHN-1 binding partners. […] Collectively, these results suggest that SHN-1 binding to EGL-19’s carboxy-terminus promotes the expression or function of L-type calcium channels.”</p><p><italic>6) Based on the IV recordings, it appears the SHN-1 copy number and EGL19 PDZ mutants impact EGL19 inactivation. The authors should go back it look at the Calcium current deactivation kinetics and see if there is a difference.</italic> </p><p>As requested, we analyzed deactivation kinetics and found no difference, as shown in: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] Finally, they determine that both Egl19 dependent currents as well as gem-4 expression are sensitive to Shn-1 gene dose, something that is know from human patients.</italic> </p><p>I am not aware of any publication showing that Shank gene dosage alters either CaV1 current or CREB activated gene expression (in any organism including humans). If the reviewer is aware of such studies, please let us know. Identifying these as cell autonomous phenotypes sensitive to Shank gene dosage is the central and most significant finding of our study.</p><p><italic>While the findings are of interest, especially due to the importance of Shank-3 in autism, I am not sure this paper represents a major step forward in our understanding.</italic> </p><p>We apologize if our original text did not clearly state the significance of our findings. Our principal claims for significance are as follows:</p><p>1) Shank gene copy number had not been previously linked to either CaV1 current or expression of CREB target genes (both of which are thought to be linked to Autism and other psychiatric disorders).</p><p>2) No prior studies identified cellular phenotypes that exhibit the unusual pattern of sensitivity to Shank copy number whereby too little and too much Shank produce similar phenotypes (which mirrors the effects of Shank copy number on risk for Autism and schizophrenia).</p><p>3) Most prior studies suggest that Shank’s principal role is to regulate synapse formation or function (whereas our data suggest that non-synaptic functions could be equally important).</p><p>4) Our study represents a significant advance in identifying the cellular consequences of increased Shank copy number, which was analyzed in only a single prior study (the transgenic Shank3 mouse in Han et al., 2013).</p><p>5) Altered CaV1 current and CREB activation are cell autonomous defects associated with Shank copy number changes. By contrast, cell autonomy was not demonstrated in several prior studies of dose sensitive Shank phenotypes (Han, Nature 2013; Wang, Nat. Comm. 2016; Zhou, Neuron 2016; Orefice, Cell 2016).</p><p>6) Shank is linked to CaV1 current and CREB activation by direct biochemical interactions (unlike many other Shank associated phenotypes).</p><p>7) Linking Shank copy number to changes in CREB activation could provide an explanation for why Shank3 mutations are disproportionately found in Autism associated with intellectual disability.</p><p>Prompted by this comment, we revised our paper to highlight the significance of our findings:</p><p>Discussion):</p><p>“Consistent with this idea, several studies previously reported cellular and behavioral defects in Shank3<sup>m/+</sup> heterozygotes (Han et al., 2016; Orefice et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Yi et al., 2016). […] Thus, we identify two cellular phenotypes that exhibit the same pattern of dose sensitivity that is observed for Shank3 in schizophrenia and ASD.”</p><p><italic>The Egl-19 and gem-4 parts don't fit together and the story remains unfocused.</italic> </p><p>For several reasons, we argue that Shank effects on CaV1 current and CREB activated gene expression should be described in a single paper. First, the primary source of calcium activating CREB is mediated by activated CaV1 channels; consequently, it makes sense to analyze both phenotypes in a single paper. Second, changes in CaV1 channels and activity-induced gene expression have both been linked to Autism (and other psychiatric disorders), but neither has been directly linked to Shank copy number. Third, both phenotypes exhibit the same unusual sensitivity to Shank copy number that is observed for risk of Autism and Schizophrenia (i.e. too much and too little Shank cause the same defect). Fourth, no other phenotypes have been described that exhibit this same pattern of sensitivity to Shank copy number. And fifth, our analysis suggests that these two Shank functions can be dissociated by certain mutations, implying that they are mediated by distinct biochemical mechanisms. This contrast would not be as evident if the stories were separated.</p><p>Prompted by this comment, we revised our text to explain why CREB activation is linked to changes in L- channels function:</p><p>“Increased cytoplasmic calcium activates expression of a large number genes, hereafter designated activity-induced gene expression. Although Cav1 channels account for a small fraction of bulk calcium entry in neurons, Cav1 channels account for the majority of activity- induced gene expression (Ma et al., 2013). This privileged ability of Cav1 channels to activate gene expression is thought to be mediated by direct physical coupling of Cav1 channels to the calcium sensors responsible for activating CREB (Deisseroth et al., 1996; Wheeler et al., 2008).”</p><p><italic>Specific comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Yeast two hybrid and GST pull down assays can, at best, indicate that two proteins CAN bind to each other (in these very artificial contexts) and definitely do not prove interaction in vivo.

Probably beyond the scope of this paper but to show that they interact in vivo, even in the non-biochemical organisms such as C. elegans, one can perform experiments with tagged transgenic proteins and test their proximity in a wide range of strategies… Also, the experiments shown in Sup 1A+B are quite poorly controlled. So Egl19 does not bind the beads but does it bind other PDZ domains? In the well-referenced paper (Zhang et al., 2005) they performed many required controls to be able to suggest that the mammalian orthologs interact.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the Y2H and pull down assays show that a direct interaction is plausible and that direct binding studies would be a stronger argument. Binding (i.e. coIP) assays from worm extracts are possible (and we have performed such experiments in several prior papers). However, biochemical analysis of CaV1 channels is difficult in any prep. In fact, no prior study has attempted to comprehensively identify proteins associated with CaV1 channels. CaV1 channels are huge, poorly expressed proteins that are difficult to solubilize. We have attempted to detect tagged EGL-19 channels in worm extracts by IP’s and western blots with no success.</p><p>Given the difficulty associated with biochemical analysis of CaV1 channels, we instead relied on genetic results to support our conclusion that SHN-1 binds to and regulates EGL-19 channels in vivo. Our results are as follows: 1) very similar calcium current defects are observed in <italic>shn-1(null)</italic> mutants, <italic>shn-1(ok1241)</italic> mutants which lack the PDZ domain, and <italic>egl-19(nu496)</italic> mutants which lack the c-terminal ligand for SHN-1’s PDZ domain; 2) the calcium current defects observed in <italic>shn-1(null)</italic> and in <italic>egl-19(nu496)</italic> mutants are both cell autonomous (i.e. both proteins must be present in muscle cells to obtain normal calcium currents), consistent with these proteins altering calcium current by directly binding to each other; 3) <italic>shn-1(null)</italic> mutations and <italic>egl-19(nu496)</italic> mutations do not have additive effects on calcium current in double mutants, implying that SHN-1 alters calcium current in a manner that requires EGL-19’s c-terminal ligand for SHN-1’s PDZ domain; and 4) <italic>shn-1</italic> null mutations cause similar decreases in EGL- 19 calcium current and in the surface abundance of a chimeric membrane protein containing EGL-19’s cytoplasmic tail sequence (Terrier), indicating that EGL-19’s cytoplasmic tail domain is sufficient to confer dependence on SHN-1 for membrane trafficking. We hope that the reviewer will agree that the strength of these genetic results offsets the absence of more direct biochemical analysis of SHN-1 binding to EGL-19.</p><p><italic>2) I was surprised that the authors did not attempt to describe the sub cellular localization of Egl-19 in WT and mutant worms… The best experiment would be to endogenously tag Egl-19 but even the second best – to follow the localization of transgenic Egl-19 was not performed. The PDZ binding motif has to remain on the C-terminal so one can N-terminally tag or tag C-terminally with the addition of the PDZ binding motif afterwards. This lies at the heart of how Shn-1 affects Egl-19 and is therefore a key question that remains unanswered in this work.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this was an important limitation of our original submission. In response to this comment (and related comments in Review 1), we provide two new experiments (analysis of muscle gating currents and trafficking analysis of a chimeric membrane protein). Both of these new experiments support the conclusion that SHN-1 promotes the delivery of EGL-19/Ca<sub>v</sub>1 channels to the plasma membrane. These results greatly enhance the significance our findings and are described in the revised text as follows:</p><p>“SHN-1 effects on calcium current could result from a change in EGL-19 delivery to the cell surface. We performed two further experiments to test this idea. […] Collectively, these results suggest that the decreased calcium current in shn-1 null mutants arises from decreased delivery of EGL-19/Cav1 channels to the cell surface.”</p><p><italic>3) The activity dependent transcription experiment – I was surprised that the raw data are not shown. Is gem-4 the top hit but one out of many or is it the only one? Ideally one would like to view this.</italic> </p><p>As requested, we now provide a summary of the genome wide expression profile associated with Lev- induced muscle depolarization. The complete set of activity induced genes is listed in a supplemental excel file, and is summarized in the revised text as follows:</p><p>Results:</p><p>“We analyzed gene expression following depolarization of body muscles with a nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) agonist (levamisole, Lev). […] These results suggest that <italic>C. elegans</italic> body muscles (like other excitable cells) have a large number of activity-induced genes, many of which are potential CREB transcriptional targets.”</p><p><italic>4) Figure 3—figure supplement 2 does not exist (or at least I could not find it).</italic> </p><p>Thanks for pointing out this error. We deleted the citation of this figure in the text.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…] A remaining issue is one of clarifying new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.
