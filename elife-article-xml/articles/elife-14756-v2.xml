patients. However, no synergistic effects of CTX and ACT on the spatio-temporal dynamics of immunocytes in vivo have been described. Here, we visualized key cell events in immunotherapy-elicited immunoreactions in a multicolor-coded tumor microenvironment, and then established an optimal strategy of metronomic combined-immunotherapy to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. Intravital imaging data indicated that regulatory T cells formed an 'immunosuppressive ring' around a solid tumor. The CTX-ACT combined-treatment elicited synergistic immunoreactions in tumor areas, which included relieving the immune suppression, triggering the transient activation of endogenous tumor-infiltrating immunocytes, increasing the accumulation of adoptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and accelerating the infiltration of dendritic cells. These insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of immunocytes are beneficial for optimizing immunotherapy and provide new approaches for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the involvement of immunocytes in cancer immunotherapy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14756.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14756.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14756.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that is particularly difficult to treat. A new approach that has shown a lot of promise in treating many different cancers, including melanoma, is called “immunotherapy”. This technique harnesses the immune system – the body’s natural defences that help to protect against infections and disease – to combat cancer.</p><p>One powerful type of immunotherapy involves injecting patients with cells called lymphocytes, which form part of the immune system. This is known as adoptive cell therapy and can activate the immune system to fight cancer, helping to shrink tumors. This treatment can be made even more powerful by combining it with a drug called cyclophosphamide and this combination, known as CTX-ACT, is currently one of the most efficient treatments for melanoma. Yet, little information is available to indicate why this treatment is so effective.</p><p>Using mice implanted with melanoma cells, Qi, Li et al. sought to understand how CTX-ACT treatment works, with the goal of optimising it to increase its success. The results showed that a protective barrier of immune cells that suppresses the anti-tumor immune response – called an “immunosuppressive ring” – surrounds untreated tumors. CTX-ACT treatment can breakdown these rings, helping to reactivate the anti-tumor immune reaction in the tumors. This allows both the injected and mouse’s own immune cells to move into the tumor and destroy cancer cells.</p><p>Qi, Li et al. used their findings to optimise treatment and succeeded in controlling tumor growth in the mice for several weeks. These new insights could be used to improve current immunotherapies, and offer new approaches for investigating the involvement of immune cells in the treatment of a wide range of different cancers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14756.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14756.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>intravital imaging</kwd><kwd>regulatory T cells</kwd><kwd>multicolor-coded</kwd><kwd>immunocytes</kwd><kwd>tumor microenvironment</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91442201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Shuhong</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Lisen</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011CB910401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Shuhong</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Qingming</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>61421064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Qingming</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002338</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015ZDTD014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Shuhong</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Lisen</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Director fund of Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Shuhong</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Lisen</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Qingming</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tregs form an &quot;immunosuppressive ring&quot; around solid tumors that is broken down during adoptive cell therapy and cyclophosphamide combination immunotherapy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer immunotherapy has been an area of significant process in recent decades, and is considered a breakthrough in cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Couzin-Frankel, 2013</xref>). Current promising techniques in cancer immunotherapy are the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), tumor vaccines, and adoptive cell therapy (ACT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couzin-Frankel and McNutt, 2013</xref>). ACT has been reported to be one of the most efficient treatments for patients with melanoma because it effectively elicits anti-tumor immune responses and leads to objective tumor regression in more than 50% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pittet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenberg et al., 2008</xref>). During the immunotherapy-elicited immune response, various immune cells, including endogenous and adoptive immunocytes, are activated in the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schreiber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gajewski et al., 2013</xref>). However, the underlying process remains a ‘black box’ because, whereas information is available to describe the input (immunotherapy) and the output (tumor elimination), relatively limited information is available to describe the spatio-temporal changes in the participating immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krummel, 2010</xref>). Traditional biological methods, such as immunohistochemistry methods or flow cytometry, have revealed the type and function of immune cells that play a role at certain time-points during the anti-tumor reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perentes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boissonnas et al., 2013</xref>). Visualization of the dynamic characteristics of immunocytes, including their movement, migration, and recruitment, as well as of the interaction between immunocytes and tumor cells in the systemic environment, is critical for understanding the success or failure of cancer immunotherapy on a mechanistic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krummel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bourzac, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The common strategy used in clinical trials of ACT is to isolate tumor antigen-specific lymphocytes from patients, robustly expand these cells in vitro, and infuse them into cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mackensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benlalam et al., 2007</xref>). The activity and cytotoxicity of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have long been considered the crucial factors for the efficacy of ACT against solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boon, 1994</xref>). However, recent reports have indicated that despite the detection of tumor-reactive CTLs in the bloodstream after the adoptive transfer, most CTLs lost their anti-tumor functions as a result of endogenous immunosuppressive networks in the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zippelius et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baitsch et al., 2011</xref>). Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key immunosuppressive role in the endogenous immunosuppressive networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Curiel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vignali et al., 2008</xref>). Various immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with Tregs have been revealed, including their specific recruitment and accumulation in the tumor stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishikawa and Sakaguchi, 2014</xref>), suppression of the CTL function by TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2005</xref>), and induction of the CTL dysfunction by interactions of Tregs with intratumoral dendritic cells (DCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>). However, the details of the spatio-temporal orchestration of Tregs associated with tumor progression, the contributions of the Treg distribution in tumor stroma to immunosuppressive networks, and the effect of Tregs on the infiltration of adoptive CTLs into solid tumors remain unclear.</p><p>Treg elimination is considered to be an essential component for disrupting the immunosuppressive networks in the tumor microenvironment before ACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antony et al., 2005</xref>). Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is a commonly used alkylating agent in chemotherapy, which has been applied in recent years to selectively suppress, abrogate and deplete Tregs before ACT treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishikawa and Sakaguchi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oleinika et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). Lymphodepletion before ACT by CTX treatment further promoted tumor-specific CTL infiltration into the target tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bracci et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boissonnas et al., 2013</xref>). The migratory behavior of effector T cells in solid tumors has been analyzed by two-photon microscopy, proving that migration presents the critical step for the sufficient infiltration of T cells into the solid tumor and promotes tumor elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mrass et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boissonnas et al., 2007</xref>). However, the influence of CTX treatment on the long-term precise migratory behavior of adoptive CTLs in solid tumors has not been directly observed in vivo.</p><p>In addition to the selective depletion and suppression of Tregs, other immunomodulatory mechanisms of CTX treatment include the systemic activation of DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radojcic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Veltman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakahara et al., 2010</xref>), increase of the infiltration of DCs into the tumor area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schiavoni et al., 2011</xref>), and promotion of the penetration of CTLs into the tumor parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boissonnas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bracci et al., 2007</xref>). Although certain immunomodulatory functions of CTX alone or in combination with immunotherapy have been proposed previously, the synergistically enhanced effects of the combined CTX and ACT (CTX-ACT) treatment on the adoptive and endogenous anti-tumor immunoreactions have not been revealed. In particular, the dynamic effects of the CTX-ACT treatment on endogenous immune cells (such as CTLs, neutrophils and DCs) in the tumor microenvironment have not been well described. Using intravital microscopy and a skin-fold window chamber model, we captured a long-term comprehensive sequence of cellular events associated with multicolor-coded tumor cells, adoptive CTLs, endogenous CTLs, Tregs, DCs and tumor-infiltrating immunocytes in the tumor microenvironment during CTX-ACT combined-immunotherapy for B16 melanoma. The long-term intravital imaging data provided direct evidence for the synergetic anti-tumor immune-enhanced effects of the CTX-ACT combination treatment, including the elimination of Tregs, activation of the endogenous tumor-infiltrating immunocytes, and infiltration of adoptive and endogenous CTLs and DCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Limited effect of adoptive CTLs on B16 tumor cells in vivo</title><p>To assess the curative efficacy of ACT on murine melanoma in vivo, CTLs were obtained from the splenocytes of C57BL/6 mice immunized with mitomycin C pre-treated B16 melanoma cells according to previous protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Restifo and Nicholas, 2011</xref>) and reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>).

Adoptive CTLs stained with the fluorescent dye CFSE (5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester, CFDA SE) were intravenously transferred into tumor-bearing mice on the sixth day after the implantation of tumor cells, which we defined as Day 0. The distribution of the CTLs was assessed in vivo by fluorescence imaging of frozen tissue sections from the naïve lymph nodes (NLNs), tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), spleens and tumors. The data indicated that the CTLs primarily accumulated in the TDLNs but rarely accumulated in the tumors during either the early or the late stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Tregs formed an ‘immunosuppressive ring’ around the solid tumor</title><p>To visualize the immune reaction in the tumor microenvironment under immunotherapy dynamically, we established a murine model of the multicolor-coded tumor microenvironment using fluorescent protein (FP) transgenic C57BL/6 mice with a skin-fold window chamber implanted with CFP-B16 tumor cells. Here, several types of FP transgenic C57BL/6 mice were used to represent the host immunocytes: Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells were labeled with red FP (mRFP), endogenous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were labeled with green FP (GFP), CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells were labeled with yellow FP (YFP), and tumor-infiltrating immunocytes (TIIs) were labeled with enhanced green FP (EGFP).</p><p>The intravital imaging data revealed that only a few CFSE-labeled adoptive CTLs infiltrated into the tumor area, regardless of an early or late stage post-adoptive CTL transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Compared with the rare infiltration of adoptive CTLs, Tregs (<italic>Foxp3</italic>-mRFP cells) were clearly observed infiltrating the tumor microenvironment on Day 1, before they gradually accumulated at the edge of the tumor to form a ring on Day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

This CTX dose was selected on the basis of CFP-B16 tumor inhibition experiments with different CTX doses in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice and immune-deficient BALB/c nude mice. The results of these experiments showed that, compared with other CTX doses (50 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> and 100 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) usually used in tumor immunotherapy, only the dose of 150 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> CTX controlled the CFP-B16 tumor growth successfully when CTX was used alone as well as when it was used in combination with ACT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, a tumor growth inhibition experiment performed on the BALB/c nude mice, confirmed that the effective anti-tumor effect of CTX at the dose of 150 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> is not due to its direct cytotoxicity, because no difference in the inhibition of tumor growth was observed between the PBS control group and the mice treated with different doses of CTX (50, 100 or 150 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Intravital imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) demonstrated that without CTX treatment, the margin of the tumor was surrounded by a layer of Tregs on Day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top left corner). The CTX treatment successfully eliminated most of the Tregs in the tumor area and removed the ‘immunosuppressive ring’ formed by Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom left corner). These imaging results were further confirmed by immunohistochemical staining using the anti-Foxp3 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel). In addition, the number of CFSE-labeled CTLs in the tumor area was clearly increased in CTX-ACT-treated mice, compared with that in mice received the ACT treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Next, long-term large-field intravital imaging revealed the entire immune reaction in the tumor microenvironment after CTX-ACT treatment, from the accumulation of adoptive CTLs to the destruction of the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These images showed that in the combined treatment, few adoptive CTLs infiltrated into the tumor microenvironment during the early stage (Days 1–3). Subsequently, the accumulation of CTLs increased significantly during the late stage (Days 4–6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). By contrast, mRFP-Tregs were rarely observed regardless of the respective stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The elimination of Tregs and the infiltration of CTLs resulted in large-scale tumor death consisting of tumors 'shrinking' from the outside and 'melting' from the inside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, Days 5–6). This finding suggested that the infiltrating CTLs destroyed the solid tumor by applying two approaches: attacking the tumor cells at the periphery according to an 'outside-in' pattern and eliminating tumor cells at the parenchyma according to an 'inside-out' pattern. The anti-tumor effect of the adoptive CTLs peaked at Days 5–6. One day later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, Day 7), the number of adoptive CTLs decreased rapidly in the tumor area because of the death or dysfunction of CTLs, leading to tumor regrowth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Four stages of adoptive CTLs migration in the tumor microenvironment after CTX-ACT treatment</title><p>The migration of adoptive CTLs is the crucial step in accelerating the penetration of CTLs into the solid tumors.

Before the adoptive CTLs were recruited and activated, the motility of the endogenous TIIs transiently increased on Day 1 and then the TIIs efficiently infiltrated into the tumor parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). According to these results, an effective interval time of five days between treatment rounds was determined for the CTX-ACT combined therapy. When the anti-tumor effect of the adoptive CTLs decreased, a second round of treatment was implemented to elicit the transient activity of the endogenous TIIs. This approach maintained a specific immune reaction against CFP-B16 tumors in vivo at high levels.

In particular, it is worth mentioning that we discovered two symbolic cell events that characterize immunosuppression and immunoactivation: the formation of an immunosuppressive ring of Tregs around the solid tumor, which indicates immune suppression, and the chemotactic movement of endogenous TIIs and infiltration of adoptive CTLs and DCs into the tumor parenchyma, which demonstrate immune activation.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14756.058</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Timeline schematic showing the elicitation of anti-tumor immune responses in the tumor microenvironment by CTX-ACT treatment.</title><p>Step 1: CFP-B16 tumor cells grew and Tregs accumulated in the tumor area before CTX treatment. Step 2: CTX treatment depleted most Tregs, blocking the formation of an ‘immunosuppressive ring’.

Tregs are considered to play a crucial role in mediating immunosuppression in anti-tumor immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beyer and Schultze, 2006</xref>). By using large-field intravital imaging, we observed that Tregs not only concentrated at the tumor periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) but also formed an immunosuppressive ring around a solid tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), and adoptive CTLs barely infiltrated solid tumors in the presence of this immunosuppressive ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). CTLs must recognize the cognate antigen of tumor cells before they are able to infiltrate into the tumor parenchyma sufficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boissonnas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mrass et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we propose that the immunosuppressive ring of Tregs blocked the ability of adoptive CTLs to recognize the cognate antigen of tumor cells and decreased the migration of these CTLs into the tumor area. This conclusion is supported by the increased number of adoptive CTLs infiltrating into the tumor parenchyma after the CTX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), which depleted most of the Tregs in the tumor area and blocked the formation of an immunosuppressive ring around the solid tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Additionally, the depletion of the Tregs induced by CTX treatment contributed to the accumulation of adoptive CTLs in the tumor area in three ways: (1) it cleared the immunosuppressive barrier to facilitate the migration of adoptive CTLs into the tumor area; (2) it induced the elevated expression of some chemokines and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment to promote the accumulation of adoptive CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bracci et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schiavoni et al., 2011</xref>); and (3) it provided space to allow the infiltration and homeostatic proliferation of adoptive CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bracci et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sistigu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>As shown in the schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, specific endogenous and adoptive anti-tumor immune reactions were triggered by the synergistic effect of the CTX-ACT combined treatment. Endogenous TIIs were activated and underwent chemotactic movements toward the tumor parenchyma within 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>), before endogenous DCs infiltrated into the tumor parenchyma on Day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>). In addition, adoptive CTLs accumulated at the tumor periphery, arrested in the tumor parenchyma to contact neighboring tumor cells on Day 3 and then resumed their high-speed migration on Day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C and F</xref>). On Day 5, the anti-tumor effect elicited synergistically by CTX and ACT in a combined treatment achieved its maximum and promoted external and internal tumor shrinking and melting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). Our results highlight the importance of metronomic treatments in CTX-ACT therapy, as a designed metronomic CTX-ACT treatment schedule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) alternately accelerates the endogenous and adoptive anti-tumor immune responses and successfully controls the tumor growth for a long duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>).</p><p>The migratory behavior of CTLs in the tumor microenvironment is complicated and changes dynamically. Certain researchers have indicated that T cells need to arrest for a long period at the tumor periphery and that their interaction with tumor cells is crucial for tumor elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boissonnas et al., 2007</xref>). However, other studies have shown that the random, high speed migration of lymphocytes from the tumor periphery to the tumor center is beneficial for tumor elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mrass et al., 2006</xref>). In our study, we observed four different stages of adoptive CTL migration in the same tumor region, which occurred during the tumor destruction process over a period of up to seven days after the CTX-ACT combined treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>). The adoptive CTLs accumulated at the tumor periphery but barely infiltrated into the tumor parenchyma during the first stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Then, the CTLs formed a long-term interaction with the tumor cells in both the tumor periphery and the tumor parenchyma during the second stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Simultaneously with tumor cell death and elimination, the adoptive CTLs resumed their motility during the third stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). Finally, the number and motility of the CTLs rapidly decreased, suggesting CTL dysfunction during the fourth stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). Thus, the differences in the behavior of the adoptive CTLs throughout the four stages provide an explanation for the variations observed in the previous reports. Besides the activities of the adoptive CTLs, the dynamic behavior of endogenous CTLs has also been observed in our study. The CTX-ACT combined treatment depleted most of the endogenous T cells in the tumor area, and most of the remaining endogenous T cells were activated CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). While the adoptive CTLs had complex migratory behaviors during the four different stages, the endogenous CTLs arrested at the tumor area for a long time and showed confined movement so that they formed stable interactions with tumor cells and then effectively destroyed them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C–F</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, the interest in tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) has increased, and accumulating data have demonstrated that TANs play dichotomous roles because they exhibit both pro-tumor and anti-tumor effects during tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mantovani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Piccard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandau et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that during the early stage of tumor progression, accumulating TANs with high motility ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yao et al., 2015</xref>), also described as TENs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Granot et al., 2011</xref>)), play an important role in the anti-tumor response by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hicks et al., 2006</xref>), enhancing antibody-induced anti-tumor effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albanesi et al., 2013</xref>), and having a stimulatory effect on T cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eruslanov et al., 2014</xref>). In the present study, more than 50% of the TIIs were neutrophils at a very early stage (Day 1) after the CTX-ACT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and exhibited a high motility. Thus, we assumed that these neutrophils were TENs with anti-tumor effects. After the CTX-ACT combined treatment, the endogenous TENs transiently moved (within 24 hr) with high speed via chemotaxis toward the tumor parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), and their motility increased before the accumulation of adoptive CTLs and DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). Intravital imaging showed that the number of DCs increased significantly on Day 3 after the CTX-ACT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Some DCs displayed mature phenotypes in the tumor tissues of CTX-ACT-treated mice and presented high MHC-II and CD86 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). A large number of DCs infiltrating into the tumor parenchyma has been shown to have a positive association with longer survival of cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chaput et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pagès et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, the recruitment of DCs into the tumor area occurred earlier than the solid tumor ‘melting’ from the inside. This phenomenon suggests that the infiltrated DCs may take up tumor antigens and present them to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Restifo et al., 2012</xref>) to further elicit the anti-tumor immune response.</p><p>Most previous studies applied the OT-I system with K<sup>b</sup>-OVA as a model antigen in T lymphoma cells to observe the migratory behavior of antigen-specific CTLs in solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boissonnas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boissonnas et al., 2013</xref>). However, cancer cell antigens are expressed at a low level in most patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Restifo et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the K<sup>b</sup>-OVA antigen tumor model could not completely mimic the clinical presentation. In the present study, by contrast, we designed an experimental system to mimic ACT immunotherapy using whole tumor cell antigens to prime and activate the CTLs.</p><p>In summary, the CTX-ACT combined treatment displayed synergistic anti-tumor effects by blocking the formation of an immunosuppressive ring around solid tumors by Tregs, eliciting the transient migratory activity of TIIs toward the tumor parenchyma, and accelerating the infiltration of adoptive CTLs and endogenous DCs into the tumor. The CTX-ACT treatment not only promoted the anti-tumor effects of adoptive CTLs but also elicited endogenous anti-tumor immune responses. Guided by the results obtained by intravital imaging, three rounds of metronomic CTX-ACT treatments successfully controlled the tumor growth for several weeks. Thus, our long-term intravital imaging of the multicolor-coded tumor microenvironment provides new perspectives regarding the cellular mechanisms underlying the success or failure of cancer immunotherapies,and will facilitate improvements in the efficacy of combination immunotherapy. Furthermore, the method of long-term intravital imaging of various immune cells in the tumor microenvironment in vivo is also suitable for monitoring multiple immune reactions, studying the spatio-temporal cellular events of other immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors (CTLA-4 antibody and PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies), and comparing the efficacy of classical immunotherapies (such as the CTX-ACT combined treatment) and checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of different tumor models.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 female mice and BALB/c nude mice (of 6–12 weeks old) were obtained from Hunan Slack King of Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd (Hunan, China).

They also showed the dynamic process of the migration of adoptive CTLs into the tumor after selective depletion of Tregs by CTX treatment, and combined chemoimmunotherapy could also activate endogenous neutrophils and mature dendritic cells to infiltrate the tumor.

What about the activation of endogenous CTLs by the combined immunotherapy, and how can you distinguish the infiltration of adoptively transferred CTLs and the endogenous CTLs? This also must be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper uses in vivo fluorescence imaging of a multi-color coded fluorescent mouse tumor model to study immunotherapy with adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) and low dose cyclophosphamide (CTX). The main finding was that Tregs could form an immunosuppressive ring around the tumor that could be prevented by ACT and CTX. They also found that the treatment could activate endogenous neutrophils and mature dendritic cells to infiltrate the tumor.</p><p>1) They obtained the CTLs for adoptive transfer from mice that had been immunized using mitomycin C treated CFP-B16 cells. However, they have ignored a large body of work that treatments that produce damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in the tumor cells are more effective when used in vaccination protocols. DAMPs on the killed tumor cells are better able to activate dendritic cells.</p><p>2) As the authors will be aware there is considerable disagreement on the best dose for low-dose cyclophosphamide. Here they used 150 mg/kg which in my experience is quite high. In mice 50 mg/kg is more usual.</p><p>3) They have ignored several papers that have shown that fluorescent proteins (GFP) expressed in the tumor can act as tumor-associated antigens. How do they know that the CFP in the B16 tumor did not play a major role in the response?</p><p>4) They did not mention the activation of endogenous CTLs by the treatment. However, they did stain the tumors with anti-CD3 but it is not clear if they could distinguish between adoptive and endogenous T-cells.</p><p>5) If all the endogenous nucleated cells were stained with EGFP how could they distinguish between fibroblasts and endothelial cells and TIIs?</p><p>6) They have not mentioned the use of checkpoint inhibitors which is somewhat strange considering the enormous impact they have made in immune-oncology.</p><p>7) I think the Abstract needs more hard information; for instance about which cells were fluorescently labeled and something about the widow chamber and cell tracking. &quot;immunosuppressive ring&quot; is repeated twice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Dr. Zhang and colleagues focuses on spatio-temporal dynamics of immunocytes in B16 tumor bearing mice. Using intravital microscopy and a skin-fold window chamber model, the authors observed an &quot;immunosuppressive ring&quot; formed by Tregs surrounded the CFP-B16 tumor. This is an interesting paper addressing the dynamic process of the migration of adoptive CTLs into the tumor after selective depletion of Tregs by CTX treatment. Its principal finding is to demonstrate that the four stages migratory behavior of adoptive CTLs, including the mean velocity, confinement ratio and arrest coefficient, in the tumor microenvironment after CTX-ACT treatment. According to this finding, the authors designed a metronomic schedule of CTX-ACT treatment improving the anti-tumor efficacy of the combined immunotherapy, which has translational potential in cancer therapy. The comments are listed below for the authors' consideration.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors isolated splenic and lymph node cells from B16 cell-vaccinated mice and cultured them in vitro with B16 lysates to amplify the cells for melanoma-specific CTL preparation. This method is rough. The authors should use CTLs from OT-I transgenic C57BL/6 mouse and OVA-B16 melanoma cells to further confirm the result.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, CTX is an immunosuppressive reagent and only low-dose CTX may function to selectively deplete Treg cells. The authors did not use low dose metronomic CTX but selected high dose CTX (150mg/kg) for the treatment. The authors should at least show the change of Treg cells and conventional T cells after 150 mg/kg CTX treatment.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors used TII to instead TIL, which was weird.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors emphasized the infiltration of DCs with mature phenotype. The data were not very strong.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors designed the metronomic schedule of CTX-ACT treatment by 150 mg/kg CTX for treatment on day 4, day 9 and day 14. The author should provide more data to separate two possible consequences in order to explain the combined treatment. One was such dose CTX treatment only targeted Treg cells, thus relieving immune suppression. Another was such dose CTX resulted in much decrease of total T cell number, thus providing space for amplification of those adoptively transferred T cells.</p><p>6) Recognition of cognate antigen is essential for T cell to contact and attack tumor cell, however, chemokine is the most important factor regulating the T cells infiltration into tumor site. Please provide the rationale for why Treg cell depletion resulted in CTL accumulation.</p><p>7) Please provide more evidence to distinguish neutrophils and PMN-MDSCs.</p><p>8) In Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, the morphology of tumor cells between the PBS/ACT group and the CTX/CTX+ACT group is different. Was the scale bar different?</p><p>9) The English needs much improvement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study by Qi et al. is very interesting!

It seems there is no difference, which suggests that neutrophil infiltration is the result of CTX. It seems there are not so many endogenous CD3+ T cells in the tumor. Does this mean that tumor elimination is mainly due to ACT?</p><p>In the subsection “Both CTX and ACT treatments are the essential factors for the chemotaxis and recruitment of TIIs into the tumor parenchyma”: &quot;Among all of these groups, only the CTX-ACT treatment group resulted in the TIIs moving toward the tumor parenchyma…&quot;. It is hard to understand why only CTX-ACT, but neither CTX nor ACT treatment alone, induces this. Is it because those endogenous cells recognized something on the adoptively transferred CTLs or the transferred cells produced some factors to activate endogenous cells or promote their migration?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14756.074</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>The authors should select low-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg, but not 150 mg/kg) to repeat the</italic> in vivo <italic>therapeutic regimen and then observe the spatio-temporal dynamics of immune cell subset infiltration in B16 tumor.

The dose of cyclophosphamide (CTX) was the first thing we considered for designing the CTX-ACT combined treatment for CFP-B16 tumors. Previous reports used CTX doses between 30 and 200 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for the CTX-mediated Tregs suppression in mice (Ghiringhelli et al. 2004, Ercolini et al. 2005, Lutsiak et al. 2005, Motoyoshi et al. 2006). In different mouse tumor models, effective CTX doses between 50 and 150 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> were applied for enhancing anti-tumor immune effects (Machiels et al. 2001, Le and Jaffee 2012), while a CTX dose range between 100 and 250 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> was used in B16 melanoma chemoimmunotherapy (Sistigu et al. 2011).</p><p>In order to select a suitable CTX dose for CFP-B16 treatment, we determined the optimal dose experimentally. Therefore, we performed CFP-B16 tumor growth inhibition experiments with different CTX doses (50, 100, and 150 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) on 4 days after 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFP-B16 cells implanted into immuno-competent C57BL/6 mice and immuno-deficient BALB/c nude mice. These experiments confirmed that the anti-tumor effect of the CTX treatment with CTX doses between 50 and 150 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> is not caused by the direct cytotoxicity of CTX, as no difference in the inhibition of tumor growth in immune-deficient mice (nude) was observed between the PBS control group and mice treated with different doses of CTX (50, 100, and 150 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). In immune-competent mice (C57BL/6), the CFP-B16 tumor growth was significantly inhibited by treatment with 150 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> CTX with or without adoptive T cells (ACT) in comparison to treatment with lower CTX doses of 50 and 100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> with or without ACT as well as PBS control groups. More importantly, CTX in lower doses (50 and 100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) with or without ACT failed to control the tumor growth and showed no significant difference to the PBS control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that the efficacy of the CTX treatment for CFP-B16 tumors depends on the enhanced anti-tumor immune response, but not on the direct cytotoxicity of CTX. According to the results of the CFP–B16 tumor growth inhibition experiments, we finally selected a CTX dose of 150 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for the CTX and CTX-ACT combined treatment.</p><p>To address this question, we added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and sentences in the Results to illustrate this question:</p><p>“This CTX dose was selected based on CFP-B16 tumor inhibition experiments with different CTX doses.

We analyzed endogenous GFP cells in tumors of mice treated with PBS, ACT, CTX, and CTX-ACT on Day 5 (five days after ACT treatment and 11 days after implantation of CFP-B16 cells) by flow cytometry. This analysis showed that: (1) the number of endogenous GFP cells in the tumors of the CTX treatment group was significantly decreased with respect to the non-CTX treatment groups (1.31% versus 3.57%) and (2) most GFP cells (more than 60%) were CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs expressed with the activation marker CD69 in the tumors of CTX-ACT treated mice.</p><p>In order to distinguish adoptive and endogenous CTLs by intravital imaging, the adoptive CTLs were labeled with the red fluorescent dye CMTPX and transferred into <italic>Cxcr6<sup>+/gfp</sup></italic> transgenic mice with CFP-B16 tumor cells implanted into the window chamber. The imaging data showed that the number of endogenous GFP T cells in the tumor areas of CTX treatment mice was much less than that in non-CTX treatment mice. The analysis of the dynamic behavior of the endogenous T cells showed that the mean velocity of the endogenous GFP T cells in CTX-ACT-treated mice was significantly decreased compared with ACT-treated mice (3.80 ± 2.56 μm min<sup>-1</sup> in the CTX-ACT group versus 4.6 ± 2.0 μm min<sup>-1</sup> in the ACT group).</p><p>Thus, both ex vivo characterization and intravital imaging suggest that the combined CTX–ACT treatment deleted most of the endogenous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and retained the activated endogenous CTLs in the tumor area.

To answer this question, we performed the Western blot to detect the released DAMPs (including HMGB1 and Hsp70) in the supernatant and whole-cell lysates (as positive control) of CFP-B16 cells and B16 cells treated with or without mitomycin C (MMC).

This is an interesting paper addressing the dynamic process of the migration of adoptive CTLs into the tumor after selective depletion of Tregs by CTX treatment. Its principal finding is to demonstrate that the four stages migratory behavior of adoptive CTLs, including the mean velocity, confinement ratio and arrest coefficient, in the tumor microenvironment after CTX-ACT treatment. According to this finding, the authors designed a metronomic schedule of CTX-ACT treatment improving the anti-tumor efficacy of the combined immunotherapy, which has translational potential in cancer therapy.

This method is rough. The authors should use CTLs from OT-I transgenic C57BL/6 mouse and OVA-B16 melanoma cells to further confirm the result.</italic></p><p>As mentioned in our manuscript, various reported studies have used the OT-I system with K<sup>b</sup>-OVA as a model antigen in T lymphoma cells and also in B16 melanoma cells. According to these reports, CTLs separated from OT-I transgenic C57BL/6 mice that displayed efficient tumor-killing abilities when they were transferred to mice bearing OVA-tumors (Kircher et al. 2003, Boissonnas et al. 2007, Shurin et al. 2009). Our unpublished results also confirmed that the adoptively transferred CTLs from OT-I mice completely eliminated the OVA-B16 tumors without any CTX treatment. However, unlike OVA are expressed in OVA-tumor cells, tumor antigens are usually expressed at a low level in most patients (Restifo, Dudley, and Rosenberg 2012). Thus, to mimic ACT immunotherapy in clinic, we chose an experimental system by using whole tumor cell antigens to prime and activate the CTLs. The method of generation B16-specific CTL refers to the book “Current protocols in Immunology” (Restifo 2011) and previous reports (Liu et al. 2006, Bauer et al. 2014). In response to this concern, we re-phrased the sentence in the Results as follows:</p><p>“To assess the curative efficacy of ACT on the murine melanoma <italic>in vivo</italic>, CTLs were obtained from the splenocytes of C57BL/6 mice immunized with mitomycin C pre-treated B16 melanoma cells according to previous protocols (Restifo 2011) and reports (Liu et al. 2006, Bauer et al. 2014).”</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, CTX is an immunosuppressive reagent and only low-dose CTX may function to selectively deplete Treg cells.

The mice were metronomically treated with 150 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> CTX (intraperitoneally injected on days 4, 9, and 14) or PBS.

One was such dose CTX treatment only targeted Treg cells, thus relieving immune suppression. Another was such dose CTX resulted in much decrease of total T cell number, thus providing space for amplification of those adoptively transferred T cells.</italic></p><p>Thank you for this good suggestion. Based on our previous data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>) and new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2</xref>), we think both consequences are suitable for explaining the effective anti-tumor immune response of the CTX-ACT combined treatment. The combined treatment not only deleted most Tregs in the tumor areas to block the formation of immunosuppressive ring, but also provided some space for the amplification of adoptive CTLs in the tumor areas. In response to this suggestion, we rewrote the corresponding part in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Additionally, the Tregs depletion induced by CTX treatment contributed to the accumulation of adoptive CTLs in the tumor area by three ways: (1) it cleared the immunosuppressive barrier to facilitates the migration of adoptive CTLs into the tumor area; (2) it induced the high expression of some chemokines and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment to promote the accumulation of adoptive CTLs (Bracci et al. 2007, Schiavoni et al. 2011); and (3) it provided space to allow the infiltration and homeostatic proliferation of adoptive CTLs (Bracci et al. 2007, Sistigu et al. 2011).”</p><p><italic>6) Recognition of cognate antigen is essential for T cell to contact and attack tumor cell, however, chemokine is the most important factor regulating the T cells infiltration into tumor site. Please provide the rationale for why Treg cell depletion resulted in CTL accumulation.</italic></p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We consider three possible reasons for the CTX treatment-induced Treg depletion, which results in the accumulation of CTLs in the tumor area.</p><p>Reason 1: As mentioned in our manuscript, the Tregs formed an “immunosuppressive ring” around the solid tumor, which blocked the ability of adoptive CTLs to recognize the cognate antigen of the tumor cells and decreased the number of adoptive CTLs migrating into the tumor area. The depletion of Tregs in the tumor area successfully broke this immunosuppressive ring so that adoptive CTLs efficiently penetrated into the tumor area without any barrier formed by immunosuppressive Tregs.</p><p>Reason 2: It has been reported that the Treg depletion due to CTX treatment resulted in the upregulated expression of some chemokines/chemokine receptors and cytokines (e.g., CXCL10/CXCR3 and IL–7) in the tumor area, which promoted CTL infiltration and homeostatic proliferation (Bracci et al. 2007, Schiavoni et al. 2011).</p><p>Reason 3: It has been reported that the proliferation of Tregs proceeds more vigorously than that of CTLs in the tumor area (Taylor, Neujahr, and Turka 2004, Sakaguchi et al. 2008, Sistigu et al. 2011). Thus, the CTX treatment induced the depletion of Tregs and the decrease of other endogenous T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B and C</xref>) in the tumor area, probably providing space for the infiltration and homeostatic proliferation of adoptive CTLs (Bracci et al. 2007, Sistigu et al. 2011).</p><p>In response to this question, we added new sentences in the Discussion to illustrate this question. The additional sentence is presented below.</p><p>“Additionally, the Tregs depletion induced by CTX treatment contributed to the accumulation of adoptive CTLs in the tumor area by three ways: (1) it cleared the immunosuppressive barrier to facilitates the migration of adoptive CTLs into the tumor area; (2) it induced the high expression of some chemokines and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment to promote the accumulation of adoptive CTLs (Bracci et al. 2007, Schiavoni et al. 2011); and (3) it provided space to allow the infiltration and homeostatic proliferation of adoptive CTLs (Bracci et al. 2007, Sistigu et al. 2011).”</p><p><italic>7) Please provide more evidence to distinguish neutrophils and PMN-MDSCs.</italic></p><p>Neutrophils and PMN-MDSCs share the same markers and very hard to distinguish.

Although there was no significant difference in tumor growth control between CTX treatment and CTX-ACT combination treatment group, through intravital imaging, we found that the killing tumor effect were maximized, as well as the increased infiltration and motility of adoptive CTLs, in the CTX-ACT treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Reason 2: According to our new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), the percentage of activated endogenous CD8<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>+</sup> CTLs in both tumors and TDLNs of the mice treated with CTX-ACT was higher than that of the mice treated with CTX alone (62% versus54% in the tumors, and 25% versus 19.3% in the TDLNs).</p><p>Reason 3: The intravital imaging data revealed that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), compared with CTX treatment, only CTX-ACT treatment induced a rapid and direct movement of the endogenous TIIs toward the tumor parenchyma, which is beneficial for further anti-tumor immune response.</p><p>Reason 4: The intravital imaging data also confirmed that, compared with CTX treatment, only CTX-ACT combined treatment increased the amount of endogenous DCs infiltrating into the tumor area. Some of the infiltrating DCs were mature, which are beneficial for inducing the anti-tumor immune response.</p><p>Reason 5: The three rounds of the metronomic CTX-ACT combined treatment were designed according to intravital imaging information from a single round of the combined treatment. The results showed that the metronomic CTX-ACT treatment successfully controlled the growth of the tumor during its entire course, with a significant difference in the tumor growth control compared with the metronomic CTX treatments (P &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p>For these five reasons, we considered that, besides the CTX treatment, the ACT treatment is also very important for controlling tumor growth. Combining the CTX with the ACT treatment gave synergistic effects on the anti-tumor immune response, which comprised in deleting most of the endogenous immunosuppressive Tregs, increasing the infiltration of adoptive CTLs and endogenous DCs, and accelerating the chemotactic movement of endogenous TIIs toward the tumor parenchyma.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>: it would be helpful to quantify the Tregs and CTLs, as well as tumor &quot;shrinking&quot; and &quot;melting&quot;, not only in CTX +ACT group but also other treatment groups.

We added the confocal imaging and immunofluorescence analysis of CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 4</xref>, which the frozen-sections of tumors were incubated with Alexa Fluor 647 anti-mouse CD4 antibody and Alexa Fluor 647 anti-mouse CD8 antibody to identify the endogenous EGFP CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14756.072</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Representative tumor sections stained with CD3, CD4, CD8, Ly6G and F4/80.</title><p>Most of the EGFP TIIs at the tumor periphery were Ly6G<sup>+</sup> and F4/80<sup>+</sup>.

It seems there is no difference, which suggests that neutrophil infiltration is the result of CTX. It seems there are not so many endogenous CD3+ T cells in the tumor. Does this mean that tumor elimination is mainly due to ACT?</italic></p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Here are the answers to the two questions:</p><p>1) The percentage of neutrophils in the CTX–ACT treatment group was slightly higher than in the CTX treatment group, but without significant difference. Although no significant difference was detected between the numbers of neutrophils in the tumor areas of CTX- and CTX-ACT treated mice, the mean velocity of neutrophils was significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>). More importantly, only the CTX-ACT combined treatment elicited the chemotactic movement of neutrophils toward the tumor parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). All these results confirmed that the efficient infiltration of neutrophils is induced by the synergistic effect of CTX and ACT.</p><p>2) Our immunofluorescence analysis of the tumor tissues showed only a small amount of endogenous CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells in the tumor area (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). According to our new data, the CTX-ACT treatment deleted most of endogenous T cells and only retained activated endogenous CD8<sup>+</sup> CD69<sup>+</sup> CTLs in the tumor areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B,C</xref>). These remaining activated endogenous CTLs also exhibited efficient tumor-killing abilities. Besides endogenous T cells, the activated endogenous neutrophils that infiltrated into the tumor area were also directly cytotoxic to the tumor cells (Piccard, Muschel, and Opdenakker 2012). As described in more detail in the answer to the first question of reviewer #3,the elimination of the tumor is due to the synergistic effects of the CTX-ACT combined treatment and failed upon the ACT treatment alone.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Both CTX and ACT treatments are the essential factors for the chemotaxis and recruitment of TIIs into the tumor parenchyma”: &quot;Among all of these groups, only the CTX-ACT treatment group resulted in the TIIs moving toward the tumor parenchyma…&quot;. It is hard to understand why only CTX-ACT, but neither CTX nor ACT treatment alone, induces this. Is it because those endogenous cells recognized something on the adoptively transferred CTLs or the transferred cells produced some factors to activate endogenous cells or promote their migration?</italic></p><p>Thank you for posing this stimulating question. According to the intravital imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), the synergistic effect of CTX and ACT treatments contributes to trigger the transiently increased chemotactic movement of TIIs toward the tumor parenchyma. The CTX treatment relieved the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the tumor, and promoted the expression of many cytokines (such as GM-CSF and IL-1β)(Bracci et al. 2007) to prime (Yao et al. 2015) the neutrophils and recruit the mature neutrophils into the tumor area. On the other hand, few adoptive CTLs infiltrated into the tumor area as early as 24 h after the ACT treatment; some adoptive CTLs killed tumor cells partially and also released some inflammatory cytokines to further promote the infiltration of endogenous neutrophils. According to the previous reports, the mature neutrophils exhibited high motility and efficient anti-tumor effects (Fridlender et al. 2009, Piccard, Muschel, and Opdenakker 2012, Sagiv et al. 2015). We think that this phenomenon observed by intravital imaging is worth further studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
