pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01641.001</object-id><p>When the nucleolus disassembles during open mitosis, many nucleolar proteins and RNAs associate with chromosomes, establishing a perichromosomal compartment coating the chromosome periphery. At present nothing is known about the function of this poorly characterised compartment. In this study, we report that the nucleolar protein Ki-67 is required for the assembly of the perichromosomal compartment in human cells. Ki-67 is a cell-cycle regulated protein phosphatase 1-binding protein that is involved in phospho-regulation of the nucleolar protein B23/nucleophosmin. Following siRNA depletion of Ki-67, NIFK, B23, nucleolin, and four novel chromosome periphery proteins all fail to associate with the periphery of human chromosomes. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) images suggest a near-complete loss of the entire perichromosomal compartment. Mitotic chromosome condensation and intrinsic structure appear normal in the absence of the perichromosomal compartment but significant differences in nucleolar reassembly and nuclear organisation are observed in post-mitotic cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01641.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01641.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01641.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic information of an organism is found in the nucleus of each cell in the form of DNA organised into chromosomes. The exact structure of those chromosomes changes as the cell moves through the different stages of the cell division cycle. During the stage called mitosis, where the DNA of a cell (which has previously been duplicated) is shared into two daughter cells, the chromosomes become tightly packed structures that can be readily moved through the cytoplasm. Since the late nineteenth century, it has been known that a layer of proteins, called the perichromosomal layer, coats the condensed chromosomes. However, virtually nothing was known about the role this layer performs.</p><p>One of the first proteins to join the perichromosomal layer after mitosis begins is called Ki-67. This is only found in the cell nucleus when a cell is actively growing and dividing, and so is widely used as a marker in experiments investigating these processes: for example, Ki-67 is used to detect growing tumour cells amongst the normal cells in tissues of the body, and to measure the effectiveness of drugs designed to stop the growth of tumours. Again, however, little is known about what Ki-67 actually does.</p><p>Booth et al. now reveal that when Ki-67 is not present in a cell, chromosomes do not have a perichromosomal layer—or at best, have a small remnant of one. This allowed Booth et al. to investigate the role of the perichromosomal layer as well. When the chromosomes first go through mitosis without a perichromosomal layer, no changes to the shape or the behaviour of the chromosomes are seen. However, the new nuclei are smaller than normal and their contents are arranged differently. This causes problems with the ability of daughter cells to synthesise protein building blocks and leads to an increased rate of spontaneous cell death when daughter cells try to undergo the next mitosis. Further research is needed to understand why this happens.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

This perichromosomal layer includes pre-rRNA, U3 snoRNAs, and over 20 ribosomal proteins, including nucleolin and Nopp140, NPM/B23, Bop1, Nop52, PM-Scl 100, and Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gautier et al., 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hernandez-Verdun and Gautier, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Van Hooser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fomproix et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelier et al., 2005</xref>). The perichromosomal layer represents 1.4% of the chromosome proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohta et al., 2010</xref>). At present, its functional significance remains unstudied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Van Hooser et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Ki-67 is one of the earliest proteins to bind the perichromosomal layer in mitosis. Ki-67 is an antigen recognised by a monoclonal antibody generated by immunizing mice with nuclei of Hodgkin lymphoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerdes et al., 1983</xref>). Because Ki-67 is nuclear only in proliferating cells, it is widely used as a marker to assess cell proliferation. For example, immuno-histochemical assessment of the proportion of cells staining for nuclear Ki-67 is used to predict the responsiveness or resistance of tumours to therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dowsett et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Ki-67 protein is predominantly localised in the cortex and dense fibrillar components of the nucleolus during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kill, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacCallum and Hall, 2000b</xref>). During mitosis it relocates to the periphery of the condensed chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verheijen et al., 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isola et al., 1990</xref>). It has been reported that Ki-67 is associated with the nuclear matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verheijen et al., 1989b</xref>), preribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isola et al., 1990</xref>), satellite DNA in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bridger et al., 1998</xref>), and with the chromosome scaffold of mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Verheijen et al., 1989a</xref>). Approximately 40% of the cellular pool of protein is present on isolated mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohta et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies suggested that Ki-67 is regulated by phosphorylation. Hyperphosphorylated Ki-67 does not bind DNA during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Endl and Gerdes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacCallum and Hall, 1999</xref>) and is characterized by increased mobility, on mitotic chromosomes measured by FRAP. In interphase, non-phosphorylated Ki-67 binds DNA and does not recover after FRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saiwaki et al., 2005</xref>). Its localisation and cell-cycle behaviour suggest that Ki-67 could be involved in the organisation of nucleolar chromatin during interphase in proliferating cells. Recently, it was reported that Ki-67 also functions in mitosis in stabilisation and maintenance of the mitotic spindle by recruiting Hklp2 to mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have identified Ki-67 as ancestral to the PP1 targeting subunit Repo-Man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006</xref>) and have shown that Ki-67 is a PIP (PP1 Interacting Protein) that contributes to the phospho-regulation of nucleophosmin/B23 by CKII. Ki-67 is also a major organiser of the perichromosomal layer, possibly acting as an interaction platform. Remarkably, Ki-67 depletion prevents all nucleolar proteins tested from accumulating around the chromosomes in mitosis. Thus, chromosomes in cells depleted of Ki-67 appear to lack most or all of their perichromosomal layer. This enabled us to gain insights into the function of this enigmatic chromosomal compartment. Interestingly, loss of the perichromosomal layer does not detectibly compromise the condensed morphology or intrinsic structure of mitotic chromosomes but does result in significant changes in nucleolar morphology and nuclear organization in the following interphase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ki-67 is a PP1-interacting protein in vivo</title><p>We used a phylogenetic approach to identify putative functional regions within the sequence of Repo-Man, a targeting protein that binds PP1 in a cell-cycle specific manner regulated by a phospho-switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vagnarelli et al., 2011</xref>).

Indeed, a possible connection between Ki-67 and PP1 was previously identified in two large scale screens for PP1 interactors. In one, in silico-screening based on a stringent definition of the RVxF motif (the PP1 binding motif) identified Ki-67 as putative interactor, however no in vivo interaction was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendrickx et al., 2009</xref>). Another study identified Ki-67 in a displacement affinity chromatography analysis of PP1 nuclear interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moorhead et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To analyse if Ki-67 was a cell-cycle regulated PIP in vivo, we performed a tethering/recruitment experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vagnarelli et al., 2011</xref>). Ki-67<sup>301–700</sup> wild type (wt) and a PP1 non-binding RASA mutant were fused to GFP:Lac repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and co-expressed with RFP:PP1γ or β in DT40 cells carrying a lacO array integrated on a single chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vagnarelli et al., 2011</xref>). GFP:Lac repressor on its own was used as a control in this experiment.</p><p>All GFP:Lac repressor fusion constructs accumulated at the LacO integration site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C1′–3′</xref>). Furthermore, the Ki-67 wt construct recruited PP1 to the same spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C2″</xref>). Quantification of the PP1 signal intensity at the GFP:Lac repressor spot compared to the general nuclear distribution (excluding nucleoli) revealed that Ki-67 recruitment of PP1 is more efficient in interphase than in mitosis and that PP1γ is recruited more efficiently than PP1β during interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These data suggest that Ki-67 is a PIP in vivo and the interaction with PP1γ is cell-cycle regulated.</p><p>In order to determine whether Ki-67 is required to target PP1γ to any of its known locations in vivo, we used RNAi to deplete Ki-67 in human cells and determined the effects that this had on the distribution of PP1γ. A previous report described the successful depletion of Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>). However, the target sequence recognised by the published siRNA lies within a repeated stretch and rescue experiments to validate the phenotype were not reported. We therefore identified two new siRNAs that could deplete the protein as efficiently as the published siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both new siRNAs yielded comparable phenotypes and we used siRNA 5 (Ki5) for the depletion experiments presented below.

This is remarkable, as an ever-increasing list of chromosome periphery proteins has been compiled over the years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chaly et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McKeon et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gautier et al., 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hernandez-Verdun and Gautier, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Van Hooser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gassmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohta et al., 2010</xref>). Some of these are among the most abundant proteins associated with mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohta et al., 2010</xref>).

Indeed, nucleolin failed to accumulate at the chromosome periphery in the absence of Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The phenotype was observed using all of the siRNAs that we have tested and was rescued by an siRNA-resistant cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether Ki-67 depletion affected the behaviour of other chromosome periphery proteins, we next examined the behaviour of NIFK, a known KI-67 interactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takagi et al., 2001</xref>). During normal mitotic exit, NIFK concentrates around the segregating chromosomes before associating with nucleolar-derived foci (NDF–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dundr et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C3</xref>). NDF formation varies between cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dundr et al., 2000</xref>), but in the HeLa cells that we have used for RNAi studies, prominent NDFs are seldom observed during unperturbed mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C1–4</xref>).</p><p>To follow NIFK behaviour, we transiently expressed GFP-tagged hNIFK in HeLa cells after control or Ki-67 RNAi. The nucleolar localisation of GFP-NIFK in interphase was unaltered after Ki-67 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C8</xref>), but in early mitosis the protein failed to properly accumulate around the mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C5–7</xref>). Instead, in metaphase cells, it accumulated in large cytoplasmic aggregates, one of which was frequently found to ‘cap’ one end of the cluster of chromosomes on the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C5</xref>). This extraordinary behaviour was also seen for endogenous NIFK phosphorylated on Thr234 using a phospho-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3[3′]</xref>). During mitotic exit, in the absence of Ki-67, GFP-NIFK accumulated in NDF-like cytoplasmic aggregates that persisted until the reformation of the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C5–7</xref>).</p><p>In view of the striking similarity of the behaviour of nucleolin and NIFK in the absence of Ki-67, we tested the generality of this effect by localizing four novel cPERPs identified in our proteomics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohta et al., 2010</xref>). Remarkably, all were mislocalised in Ki-67-depleted cells, and all were frequently observed to ‘cap’ one end of the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D3,7,11,15</xref>).

Correlative light-microscopy/Electron microscopy (CLEM) analysis of cells transfected with both GFP-cPERP-C and the indicated siRNA oligos eliminated this hypothesis.

Indeed, all candidate proteins that we have tested to date have failed to localise to the chromosomal periphery in Ki-67-depleted cells. Although analyses of individual proteins can provide part of the story, it is difficult or impossible to make conclusions about the compartment as a whole since the chromosome periphery has a complex and as-yet undefined protein and RNA composition. Nonetheless, further analysis of our CLEM images strongly suggests that depletion of Ki-67 causes a loss of most or all of the perichromosomal compartment.</p><p>Examination of electron micrographs of control and Ki-67-depleted cells at higher magnification revealed a subtle difference in the appearance of the edge of the chromosomes. In control cells there was a ‘fuzzy’ transition zone between the electron-dense chromatin and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This transition appeared to be more abrupt in Ki-67-depleted chromosomes. This was confirmed by line scans across the chromosome-to-cytoplasm boundary, which showed that there is normally a gradual decrease in density at the edge of mitotic chromosomes. This transition was significantly more abrupt in the absence of Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>These experiments suggest that Ki-67 directs the binding of nucleolar components to the chromosome periphery, perhaps by acting as a scaffold. Alternatively, the macromolecular network at the chromosomal periphery could be delicately balanced, such that removal of any single component causes the entire structure to fail. However, depletion of cPERP-B, -D, or -E using RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) failed to alter the striking perichromosomal localization of Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Alternatively, Ki-67, which is a very large protein with multiple repeated domains, might function as a scaffold linking together key components at the chromosome periphery. To begin to distinguish between these two hypotheses, we generated constructs expressing mRFP coupled to either wild-type Ki-67 or a Ki-67 RASA mutant that is incapable of binding PP1 at the conserved site shared with Repo-Man (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A3</xref>).

Furthermore, proteomic analysis revealed a substantial reduction in levels of Ki-67 associated with isolated mitotic chromosomes depleted of KIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Samejima et al., 2012</xref>). The converse is not true, however, as neither the localisation nor abundance (as determined by immunostaining) of KIF4A was altered in the absence of Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, Ki-67 depletion does not affect the known mitotic chromosome structural proteins.</p><p>Mitotic chromosomes have an intrinsic metaphase structure (IMS) that can be probed using a specialized assay, in which chromosomes are induced to unfold down to the level of 10 nm fibres by removal of divalent cations, and then induced to re-fold by re-addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earnshaw and Laemmli, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hudson et al., 2003</xref>).

Ki-67-depleted cells tended to be smaller and to have smaller nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was not due to an accumulation of the cells in G1, as shown by FACs analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), but could potentially be due to ribosomal insufficiency.</p><p>We have made several observations that are consistent with this. First, if we calculate the total nucleolar area in optical sections of Ki-67-depleted nuclei, we find that these nuclei tend to have a smaller aggregate nucleolar area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). If we assume total nucleolar area to be a proxy for the number of genes involved in rDNA transcription, this suggests that reactivation of ribosomal clusters following mitotic exit may be less efficient in Ki-67-depleted cells. This is consistent with the results of a Northern analysis of total rRNA in control and Ki-67-depleted cells, which revealed decreased levels of pre-rRNA species, consistent with lower levels of rRNA transcription in the depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).</p><p>To further examine NOR reactivation following mitotic exit, we exploited the fact that chromosomes bearing re-activated NORs are associated with nucleoli. We used a HT1080 cell line carrying a LacO array integrated on chromosome 13p next to the NOR and expressing GFP fused to Lac repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chubb et al., 2002</xref>). In this cell line the 13p locus (visualized as a GFP spot) tends to localise in the nuclear interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A1</xref>) where it is usually closely associated with a nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B1</xref>). A nuclear erosion script developed by Bickmore and Perry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Croft et al., 1999</xref>) was used to divide the nucleus into 5 concentric rings of equal area in order to score the position of the locus within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A2</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01641.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Ki-67 depletion affects nuclear architecture.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The position of a chromosome 13p (marked by a LacO array:LaciGFP) in HT1080 cells (1) was assessed in control and Ki67 RNAi experiments. 150 nuclei from three independent experiments were imaged and analysed with an erosion script software to locate the position of the locus (2).

In cells depleted of Ki-67, the tagged 13p locus tended to move from the nuclear interior towards the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A3</xref>). This reorganization of chromosome 13p was correlated with a disengagement from the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B2,3</xref>). Both phenotypes are consistent with a decreased efficiency of reactivation of the 13p NOR.</p><p>Thus, although Ki-67 depletion and loss of much or all of the perichromosomal compartment has little obvious effect on chromosome structure or segregation in the first mitosis after depletion, after mitotic exit the nucleus undergoes fundamental changes consistent with decreased activity of the ribosomal gene clusters and with altered interactions between chromosomes.

All of these hypotheses remained purely speculative, however, as no technique was available to perturb the formation of this layer.</p><p>In this study, we have shown that depletion of Ki-67 causes all nucleolar proteins tested to no longer associate with the chromosome periphery during mitosis. Instead they often form enormous aggregates that cap one end of the metaphase plate of aligned chromosomes. Correlative light and electron microscopy confirmed that these ‘caps’ were neither remnants of partially disassembled nucleoli nor cytoplasmic nucleolus-derived bodies (NDBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dundr et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Although it is not practical to obtain specific antibodies to stain for all known components of the perichromosomal layer, we have shown that at least six different proteins fail to localise to the chromosome surface when Ki-67 is depleted. We also confirmed a previous cryoelectron microscopy study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gautier et al., 1992b</xref>) and visualized this layer as a dense ‘cloud’ at the periphery of condensed mitotic chromosomes by thin section electron microscopy. This entire “cloud” surrounding chromosomes is apparently lost when Ki-67 is depleted. Thus, our studies suggest that Ki-67 is required for assembly of many or most components of this layer. It had previously been published that depletion of nucleolin resulted in the loss of both fibrillarin and nucleophosmin (NPM/B23) from the perichromosomal layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2007</xref>). Our studies reveal that nucleolin association with mitotic chromosomes depends on Ki-67, and therefore begin to define a pathway for assembly of the perichromosomal compartment.</p><p>How Ki-67 functions in assembly of the perichromosomal layer is not yet determined. We have shown that Ki-67 is a cell-cycle regulated PP1-targeting subunit that is required for regulation of the phosphorylation of nucleophosmin/B23 on S125. Casein kinase II phosphorylation of B23 at S125 is important for regulating its dynamics and molecular chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szebeni et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Negi and Olson, 2006</xref>). However, PP1-binding by Ki-67 is not required for its role in assembly of the mitotic chromosome periphery. Ki-67 has been reported to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacCallum and Hall, 2000a</xref>) and to interact with HP1 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kametaka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scholzen et al., 2002</xref>). These properties could mediate Ki-67 interaction with the mitotic chromosomes and then provide a platform for the recruitment of other perichromosomal components.</p><p>Remarkably, loss of the perichromosomal layer has a dramatic effect on the behaviour of its constituent proteins, but little effect on the mitotic chromosomes themselves during the first mitosis following its loss. After 48 hr of Ki-67 depletion, the mitotic chromosomes appear to be no more susceptible to DNA damage than normal, have a normal morphology in cytogenetic spreads, and behave normally in our intrinsic metaphase structure assay, which can detect defects in chromosome architecture that are not readily apparent by simple examination of the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hudson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Samejima et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, nuclei that reassemble following Ki-67 depletion are smaller than control nuclei, the location of at least one chromosomal locus within the nucleus is altered and they possess a single large nucleolus. All of these observations can be explained by two effects of Ki-67 depletion. First, the loss of Ki-67 and the perichromosomal layer apparently allows acrocentric chromosomes to cluster during nuclear reformation with resultant formation of a single nucleolus as a result of fusion of several nucleolus organizing regions (NORs).</p><p>Second, the loss of Ki-67 and the perichromosomal compartment also causes a decrease in the efficiency of NOR reactivation during mitotic exit. Thus, the combined nucleolar area of Ki-67-depleted is &gt;44% less than in control cells, the overall level of rRNA transcription is decreased and the NOR-bearing chromosome 13p frequently loses its association with nucleoli. Although the link between NOR reactivation and association with nucleoli is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalmarova et al., 2007</xref>), it is clear that in cells where 13p is distant from nucleoli, its NOR must not be reactivated.</p><p>We note that despite having a normal cell-cycle profile at 48 hr, Ki-67 depleted nuclei and cells are also significantly smaller than their control counterparts. This is consistent with components of the translational machinery becoming limiting. For example, mutations in the TOR pathway, an important regulator of protein translation, tend to give rise to smaller cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miron and Sonenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jewell and Guan, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Why would NOR reactivation and rDNA transcription be decreased in the absence of Ki-67? Although the nucleolar components we examined exhibit a highly abnormal distribution in mitotic cells following Ki-67 RNAi, all of them ultimately find their way back into nucleoli during the subsequent interphase. Thus, the pathway of nucleolar reassembly exhibits a remarkable degree of plasticity. Furthermore, the segregation of at least one major nucleolar component is noticeably more variable following Ki-67 depletion, suggesting that association with the chromosomes may contribute to the accurate and efficient segregation of the ribosome synthesis machinery at cell division.</p><p>In addition to a role in partitioning the protein synthesis machinery, we suggest that association of nucleolar components with the mitotic chromosome periphery is important for NOR reactivation and nucleolar assembly during mitotic exit. During nuclear envelope reassembly, vesicle association and fusion on the chromosomal surface to make the double membrane bilayer precede the assembly of functional nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kutay and Hetzer, 2008</xref>). Thus, during mitotic exit, there is a brief period during which the chromatin is insulated from contact with the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Their association with the chromosomal surface as the nuclear envelope is laid down at the end of mitosis, means that the ribosomal components of the perichromosomal compartment are inside the membrane barrier when it forms. This early access to NOR chromatin and the high protein concentration within small decondensing G1 nuclei may be critical factors in NOR reactivation, thereby ‘jump starting’ nucleolar reassembly. Indeed, it has previously been shown that assembly of prenucleolar bodies, an early step in nucleolar reassembly takes place on the chromosome periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Savino et al., 2001</xref>). In the absence of Ki-67 and of the chromosomal periphery there will be a period of time during mitotic exit when nucleolar components in the cytoplasm are denied access to the chromosomes, and this could then explain the decreased efficiency of nucleolar reassembly.</p><p>Remarkably, although the abnormalities in the dispersal and re-aggregation of nucleolar components during mitosis appear quite dramatic, Ki-67-depleted cells appear to survive with their single nucleolus and can proceed to another cell cycle. This second division becomes more problematic and we have observed an increase of apoptosis together with mitotic delay. The mitotic defects that occur at the second mitosis after loss of the perichromosomal layer, could be related to a necessary interphase function of Ki-67 or reflect decreased synthesis of a key component required for chromosome segregation, and therefore will require future investigation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Perspectives</title><p>Our studies have revealed for the first time that Ki-67 functions as a structural/scaffolding protein required for assembly of the perichromosomal compartment on condensed mitotic chromosomes. Thus, Ki-67 has an important role in determining the behaviour of many nucleolar components during mitosis. Interestingly, this method of segregating nucleolar components means that nucleolar reassembly can begin immediately after CDK activity declines and before the re-establishment of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport during mitotic exit. Ki-67 is a PP1-interacting protein, however the biological role of this activity remains elusive and indeed the protein could execute this function during another phase of the cell cycle rather than mitosis. How the various activities of Ki-67 combine to determine the nucleolar morphology in proliferating cells and whether the perichromosomal layer has a subtle role in chromosome dynamics during mitosis or nuclear reformation remain to be determined in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and RNA interference</title><p>HeLa Kyoto and MRC5 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% and 15% FBS respectively.

Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor (Tony Hyman), and 2 peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. We regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication at this stage.</p><p>As you can see, both reviewers and the editor found the work putting KI67 in a molecular context very interesting, but we felt that as currently presented, there is not enough phenotype data to really understand what is going on, even though we appreciate that you have already put a lot of effort into phenotypic analysis. In general, <italic>eLife</italic> strives to give a clear picture of experiments that are needed for publication, and to ask for experiments that can be completed within a reasonable time frame. The reviewers made a number of suggestions of experiments to strengthen your conclusions, but it seems likely that these will take a significant time to complete, and could not be done within the required time frame. Therefore, we have decided to reject the paper as it currently stands.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#1:</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors analyze the chromatin-associated protein Ki-67. Ki-67 is the subject of numerous papers in which it is used as a marker for actively dividing cells, but there is very little known about its molecular function. Here the authors demonstrate the Ki-67 is a direct PP1 binding protein in vitro, and that Ki-67 is required for proper PP1 targeting to chromosomes and the dephosphorylation of at least some substrates. In addition, the authors demonstrate that Ki-67 is required for the localization of peripheral chromatin proteins (PERPs) and nucleolar organization. This appears to be a separate function for Ki-67 where it acts apparently as a scaffold rather than a PP1-targeing protein. In general, I found this to be an interesting paper that provides a useful contribution, but there are a number of things that could be done to improve this paper.</p><p>1) In the text, there is an inappropriate balance in the amount of space used to describe the different experiments. For example, there are many negative results (i.e., Ki-67 is not involved in something) that receive substantial space. I would suggest that the authors reduce their description of the lack of effect on nucleolin and NIFK phosphorylation to a single sentence. Similarly, they could dramatically reduce their description of the lack of effect on chromatin structure.</p><p>2) Instead of focusing on these negative results (even though they are important for framing what Ki-67 does and doesn't do), it would be helpful to have additional information about the key observations that they have focused their title on – the role of Ki-67 in organizing the chromosome periphery and nucleolar organization. Some key functions where the authors establish a role for Ki-67 are less completely explored. The paper is written as if the authors are expecting a key mitotic defect, and then are somewhat surprised that this is not the case. Although this may accurately reflect the nature of the actual experiments, in retrospect it should now be possible to frame a paper that more explicitly analyzes the nature of this new role.</p><p>3) In addition to analyzing the potential mitotic roles for Ki-67 (which don't seem that critical based on the data presented in this paper), it would be very helpful to test what else Ki-67 might be doing. For example, the authors show very striking defects in nucleolar organization. Does Ki-67 compromise ribosome biogenesis or growth in some way? What about some aspect of gene expression? Basically, is there a functional consequence to the defective nuclear organization that they identify?</p><p>4) The binding assay analyzing the interaction between PP1 and Ki-67 needs to be better controlled. In addition to a positive control for PP1 binding, the authors need to show a negative control (GST alone). There is also not a very complete description of the biochemistry (including the buffers used). I am particularly concerned as PP1 has specific buffer requirements (the presence of metals <italic>–</italic> Maganese) that will affect the behavior of this protein is in their assays.</p><p>5) The authors analyze the localization of multiple peripheral chromatin proteins. This is an important addition to the paper. In this case, they tested both known proteins and “novel” proteins that their lab previously identified. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any description of these proteins, including their identity. As this information is central to the paper, they need to provide the ORF or accession numbers for these.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#2:</italic></p><p>In this study Earnshaw and colleagues examine the cell cycle function of the Ki-67 protein that was identified by a monoclonal antibody raised in mice to the nuclei of Hodgkin lymphoma cells. Although little is known about the Ki-67 protein it is found in the nucleus (specifically the nucleolus) of proliferating interphase cells and to a poorly understood region surrounding anaphase chromosomes, which they refer to as the perichromosomal compartment.</p><p>The authors note that Ki-67 shares considerable overall homology with RepoMan, a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) interacting protein and known regulator of chromosome function. Indeed the strongest stretch of homology between the two protein is within a domain of RepoMan that mediates its interaction with PP1. The authors report that Ki-67 is also a PP1 interacting protein but that the cell cycle distribution of RepoMan and Ki-67 are distinct and do not influence each other, suggesting the two proteins control distinct cellular processes. The authors confirm that Ki-67 is located in the nucleolus in interphase and to the perichromosomal compartment in anaphase. Notably, the localization of six other proteins, including cPERP-B, cPERP-C, cPERP-D, cPERP-F, B23 and NIFK (some of which were identified in a previous proteomic analysis of mitotic chromosomes), to the periphery of anaphase chromosomes is severely reduced when the expression of Ki-67 is repressed by RNAi. They suggest from this that Ki-67 may be a scaffold for establishment of the perichromosomal compartment. These results are novel, interesting and believable.</p><p>The authors go on to show that the number of nucleoli observed in interphase nuclei is reduced from 3-4 in control cells to only one in cells in which Ki-67 expression is repressed. Disappointingly, however, they find no obvious phenotypic consequence for this effect, although one might expect the 3D architecture of interphase chromosomes to be affected. Rather disarmingly, they also admit to being disappointed with the lack of effect of Ki-67 knockdown on mitotic chromosome structure. Thirdly, they observe no effect on recruitment of other perichromosomal proteins to the periphery of anaphase chromosomes when the association of PP1 to Ki-67 is abolished. Unfortunately, this reviewer is not persuaded by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> that Ki-67 controls the phosphorylation status of nucleolin or nucleophosmin/B23. This data set requires considerable further clarification. The reader is left to wonder what the perichromosomal compartment is for, how recruitment of the above mentioned proteins is regulated, and why.</p><p>It would seem to this reviewer that one possibility is that the perichromosomal compartment is a vector for the segregation of certain nucleolar components to daughter cells, perhaps akin to the fragmentation of Golgi apparatus during M phase. If this is the case live cell imaging of multiple cells may reveal asymmetric inheritance of nucleolar material. Alternatively, since Ki-67 is exported from nuclei in quiescent cells perhaps Ki-67 is important for nucleolar function on re-entry to the cell cycle? In the absence of such insight this reviewer is unfortunately left somewhat underwhelmed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01641.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We have performed a number of additional experiments and substantially rewritten the manuscript in order to address all the referee comments. This has resulted in the addition of three new authors, all of whom contributed important experimental results. We thank the referees for giving us useful suggestions that have enabled us to develop a very significant insight into the function of the chromosome periphery in the transition from mitosis to interphase.</p><p>In brief, we now provide three independent lines of evidence supporting the novel conclusion that the perichromosomal compartment is required for efficient nucleolar organizer region (NOR) reactivation during mitotic exit. We speculate that by being associated with chromosomes, key nucleolar components are inside the reforming nucleus even before nuclear transport is re-established, thus giving them an opportunity to jump-start nucleolar reactivation. We believe that this is a highly novel and exciting idea that will be tested and expanded upon in many future studies that we believe will be inspired by our present manuscript.</p><p>The editorial response before resubmission advised us to focus on two specific aspects:</p><p><italic>“One idea suggested by the reviewers, it would be particularly nice if the authors could conduct additional phenotypic experiments that specifically relate to nucleolar function</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript includes several experiments showing that Ki-67 and/or the perichromosomal compartment are required for nucleolar reactivation during mitotic exit. For example, we observed decreased rRNA transcription in Ki-67-depleted cells, the aggregate nucleolar size is smaller in those cells, and the localization of the chromosome 13p NOR is altered in interphase nuclei. All of these changes are consistent with a defect in NOR reactivation.</p><p><italic>“It would also be helpful to show that RNAi knockdown of cPERP-B, cPERP-C, cPERP-D, cPERP-F does not influence Ki-67 localisation to the chromosome periphery. If this is the case it would strengthen their argument that Ki-67 is the key scaffold for assembly of the perichromosomal compartment</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p><p>We have conducted the suggested experiment and have shown that the knockdown of 3 other cPERPs does not displace Ki-67 from the chromosome periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that Ki-67 acts upstream during the assembly of this chromosome compartment.</p><p>We have now addressed all comments, as described below, and hope that our revised manuscript will engender enthusiasm in both referees and editors alike.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>In this paper, the authors analyze the chromatin-associated protein Ki-67. […] In general, I found this to be an interesting paper that provides a useful contribution, but there are a number of things that could be done to improve this paper</italic>.</p><p>We are pleased that the referee felt that this was an interesting paper that provides a useful contribution, and we have attempted to follow the suggestions given for its improvement.</p><p><italic>1) In the text, there is a somewhat inappropriate balance in the amount of space used to describe the different experiments. For example, there are many negative results (i.e., Ki-67 is not involved in something) that receive substantial space. I would suggest that the authors reduce their description of the lack of effect on nucleolin and NIFK phosphorylation (down to a single sentence). Similarly, they could dramatically reduce their description of the lack of effect on chromatin structure</italic>.</p><p>We have removed all the negative data on phospho-regulation by Ki-67 as suggested. We have also significantly abbreviated our description of the lack of a role for the perichromosomal compartment in mitotic chromosome structure. We have not totally eliminated the latter, however, as this is the FIRST functional analysis of a chromosomal compartment that comprises some 60 or more proteins and a substantial percentage of the chromosome mass. However we no longer focus on these negative results.</p><p><italic>2) Instead of focusing on these negative results (even though they are important for framing what Ki-67 does and doesn't do), it would be helpful to have much more information about the key observations that they have focused their title on</italic> – <italic>the role of Ki-67 in organizing the chromosome periphery and nucleolar organization. Some key functions where the authors establish a role for Ki-67 are less completely explored. The paper is written as if the authors are expecting a key mitotic defect, and then are somewhat surprised that this is not the case. Although this may accurately reflect the nature of the actual experiments, in retrospect it should now be possible to frame a paper that more explicitly analyzes the nature of this new role</italic>.</p><p>This is exactly what we have done, as described below. We have attempted to re-focus the paper so that it is clearly about a functional analysis of the perichromosomal compartment.</p><p><italic>3) In addition to analyzing the potential mitotic roles for Ki-67 (which don't seem that critical based on the data presented in this paper), it would be very helpful to test what else Ki-67 might be doing. For example, the authors show very striking defects in nucleolar organization. Does Ki-67 compromise ribosome biogenesis or growth in some way? What about some aspect of gene expression? Basically, is there a functional consequence to the defective nuclear organization</italic> <italic>that they identify?</italic></p><p>With the caveat that our paper is about the role of this previously un-studied chromosomal compartment in mitosis, this suggestion turned out to be right on the money. The perichromosomal compartment only exists during mitosis, but it turns out to serve an extremely important function during mitotic exit and early interphase, and we have now developed that story much more completely.</p><p>We looked at ribosome biogenesis, and were inspired when we noticed that there is a substantial defect in rRNA transcription. Following on from this we have provided data (all new figures in the revision) that clearly show that not only is ribosomal transcription compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), the segregation of nucleolar material is more uneven (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 B,C</xref>), the aggregate nucleolar size is smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure. 6D-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure S6B</xref>) and the interphase nuclear position of chromosome 13p is altered as its adjacent NOR is frequently not reactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure. 7A,B</xref>). Presumably as a consequence of those ribosomal defects, the nuclear and overall cell size of Ki-67-depleted cells is small (Figure. A-C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure. S6A</xref>). We believe that together, this new evidence strongly supports a key function of Ki-67 (and presumably the chromosomal periphery) during the transition from mitosis to G1.</p><p><italic>4) The binding assay analyzing the interaction between PP1 and Ki-67 needs to be much better controlled. In addition to a positive control for PP1 binding, the authors need to show a negative control (GST alone). There is also not a very complete description of the biochemistry (including the buffers used). I am particularly concerned as PP1 has specific buffer requirements (the presence of metals – Maganese) that will affect the behavior of this protein is in their assays</italic>.</p><p>Taking into consideration the quantity of exciting new data inserted in the manuscript we have removed this in vitro study. In fact indications of a possible in vitro binding activity of Ki-67 to PP1 were previously reported (Hendrickx et al, Chem. Biol., 2009 vol. 16 (4) pp. 365-371). We have retained the in vivo tethering and recruitment experiments that clearly show that Ki-67 can recruit PP1 in vivo and also provide information on the cell-cycle regulation of the interaction.</p><p><italic>5) The authors analyze the localization of multiple peripheral chromatin proteins. This is an important addition to the paper. In this case, they tested both known proteins and “novel” proteins that their lab previously identified. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any description of these proteins, including their identity. As this information is central to the paper, they need to provide the ORF or accession numbers for these</italic>.</p><p>We have added the accession numbers for those proteins.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>In this study Vagnarelli et al. examine the cell cycle function of the Ki-67 protein that was identified by a monoclonal antibody raised in mice to the nuclei of Hodgkin lymphoma cells.

The negative results showing, amongst other things, that Ki-67 does <italic>not</italic> influence the phosphorylation status of nucleolin have now been removed from the manuscript. Hopefully in the very much slimmed-down description of the role of Ki-67 in phosphoregulation, the ambiguities have been removed.</p><p><italic>This data set requires considerable further clarification. The reader is left to wonder what the perichromosomal compartment is for, how recruitment of the above mentioned proteins is regulated, and why</italic>.</p><p>We feel that as a result of our many additional experiments, we can now propose a novel – and reasonable – hypothesis for the function of the perichromosomal compartment.</p><p><italic>It would seem to this reviewer that one possibility is that the perichromosomal compartment is a vector for the segregation of certain nucleolar components to daughter cells, perhaps akin to the fragmentation of Golgi apparatus during M phase.

In our opinion, the reviewer is half right in each case, and when those two halves are put together, then an exciting proposal for the role of the perichromosomal compartment emerges.</p><p>Yes, the perichromosomal compartment is a vector for the segregation of many key nucleolar components, but we believe that this is not solely so that daughter cells get equal amounts. At the suggestion of the referee we looked at this in live imaging experiments (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). In the absence of Ki-67, nucleolin segregation does become slightly more random. So we believe that the chromosomes are vectors, but the key thing is that the perichromosomal compartment is associated with the chromosomes, and therefore <italic>inside</italic> the reforming nuclear envelope.</p><p>Concerning nuclear import/export of Ki-67. For us this is the key to our model. We demonstrate clearly that in the absence of Ki-67 (therefore the absence of most or all of the perichromosomal compartment) NOR reactivation is less efficient during mitotic exit and subsequent ribosomal transcription is reduced. This leads us to propose the model stated on the first page above, that having nucleolar components INSIDE the reforming nuclear envelope, before nuclear pores reassemble and the envelope becomes transport-competent allows those components to act – either early, or in a more concentrated environment, or at an appropriate cell cycle stage – more efficiently and promote more efficient NOR reactivation.</p><p>We believe that this is a fundamental and exciting hypothesis that will interest many people who study ribosomal transcription and nucleolar assembly. However, given the weight of experiments already presented here and our desire to focus this manuscript on the first ever (and hopefully definitive) characterization of the function of the mitotic chromosome periphery compartment, we argue that tests of the hypothesis should occupy future studies and are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
