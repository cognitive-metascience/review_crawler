However, the functions of ubiquitinated Rab proteins remain unexplored. Here we show that Rab5 is monoubiquitinated on K116, K140, and K165. Upon co-transfection with ubiquitin, Rab5 exhibited abnormalities in endosomal localization and EGF-induced EGF receptor degradation. Rab5 K140R and K165R mutants restored these abnormalities, whereas K116R did not. We derived structural models of individual monoubiquitinated Rab5 proteins (mUbRab5s) by solution scattering and observed different conformational flexibilities in a site-specific manner. Structural analysis combined with biochemical data revealed that interactions with downstream effectors were impeded in mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub>, whereas GDP release and GTP loading activities were altered in mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub>. By contrast, mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub> apparently had no effect. We propose a regulatory mechanism of Rab5 where monoubiquitination downregulates effector recruitment and GDP/GTP conversion in a site-specific manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Rab5</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>SAXS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2015R1A2A1A15055951</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Donghyuk</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Gyuhee</given-names></name><name><surname>Baek</surname><given-names>Jiseok</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sangho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003627</institution-id><institution>Rural Development Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJ009106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Donghyuk</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Gyuhee</given-names></name><name><surname>Baek</surname><given-names>Jiseok</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sangho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012-0009597</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Donghyuk</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Gyuhee</given-names></name><name><surname>Baek</surname><given-names>Jiseok</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sangho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SRC-2017R1A5A1014560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Donghyuk</given-names></name><name><surname>Na</surname><given-names>Wooju</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Ji-Hyung</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Gyuhee</given-names></name><name><surname>Baek</surname><given-names>Jiseok</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Seok Hee</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Cheol Yong</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sangho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>With monoubiquitination sites of Rab5 identified and structural and biochemical studies using chemically synthesized ubiquitinated Rab5, Rab5 monoubiquitination is found to downregulate the function of Rab5 in a site-dependent manner.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rab GTPases, the largest family of small GTPases, regulate various vesicular trafficking processes such as endocytosis, exocytosis, and ER to Golgi transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hutagalung and Novick, 2011</xref>). Rab GTPases are activated by GTP binding and inactivated by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pfeffer, 2005</xref>). This regulatory cycle of Rab is facilitated by other regulators. A GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) stabilizes GDP-bound Rab in the inactive state. Binding of a GDI displacement factor (GDF) to the GDI:GDP-Rab complex releases GDI, freeing GDP:Rab for subsequent activation. A guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) binds to GDP:Rab5 and catalyzes GDP release and GTP loading for Rab. The activated GTP-bound Rab exerts its effects by binding to various effector proteins. Inactivation of GTP:Rab is aided by a GTPase activating protein (GAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013</xref>), rendering the Rab GTPase ready for another cycle.</p><p>Ubiquitination, a major post translational modification, is associated with various cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hochstrasser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). Both the number of ubiquitin moieties and their chain linkage types, such as polyubiquitination and monoubiquitination, can provide the molecular bases for the regulation of diverse cellular activities. Two representative polyubiquitination linkages have been studied extensively. K48-linked polyubiquitination guides the substrate to the proteasome, resulting in degradation of the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hochstrasser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akutsu et al., 2016</xref>). By contrast, K63-linked polyubiquitination regulates cellular signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bhoj and Chen, 2009</xref>). Monoubiquitination modulates histone modification, virus budding, and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hicke, 2001</xref>). Although ubiquitination in endocytosis is well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Piper et al., 2014</xref>), little is known about ubiquitination of Rab GTPases, the master regulators of endocytic trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hutagalung and Novick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mizuno-Yamasaki et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Evidence is mounting that ubiquitination can alter the functional consequences of small GTPases, which has been well documented for Ras GTPases. Site-specific monoubiquitination of K147 of Ras leads to activation of signaling by impairing its interaction with GAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sasaki et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, monoubiquitination of K117 of Ras facilitates GDP release from Ras, independent of a GEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2013b</xref>). Ubiquitination of Rab has also been recently reported. HACE1, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, ubiquitinates Rab6A, Rab8A, and Rab11A in conjunction with the Î²2-adrenergic receptor (Î²2AR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lachance et al., 2014</xref>). Ubiquitination of K145 of Rab11A activates Rab11A. Atypical serine ubiquitination through the formation of a phosphodiester bond independent of E1 and E2 enzymes has been reported for Rab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhogaraju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhogaraju and Dikic, 2016</xref>). Rab33b is monoubiquitinated through this atypical serine ubiquitination by SdeA, a pathogenic effector protein of <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ubiquitination of Rab regulates Rab function remain largely unexplored.</p><p>Rab5 regulates formation of early endosomes and maturation to late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hutagalung and Novick, 2011</xref>). Three isoforms of mammalian Rab5 - Rab5a, Rab5b and Rab5c regulate endocytosis in a co-operative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bucci et al., 1995</xref>). However, recent studies suggest that these three isoforms may have differential roles. Rab5a is required for EGF-induced EGFR degradation while Rab5b and Rab5c are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barbieri et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Rab5c is involved in cell migration whereas Rab5a and Rab5b are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>). Proteomic studies have suggested that the Rab5 isoforms can be differentially ubiquitinated in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>). Since Rab5a has been extensively studied for its involvement in endosomal fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bucci et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gorvel et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barbieri et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoffenberg et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rybin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stenmark et al., 1994</xref>), we decided to focus on Rab5a for our studies (hereafter referred to as âRab5â). Here, we identified monoubiquitination sites of Rab5 in cultured cells. Moreover, a modified chemical conjugation method enabled us to produce pure monoubiquitinated Rab5 proteins (mUbRab5s) in large quantities. Structural information about the mUbRab5s obtained from small-angle X-ray scattering and biochemical studies revealed that mUbRabs have different functions according to the site of ubiquitination. This research sheds light on how ubiquitination can regulate the function of Rab GTPases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rab5 undergoes monoubiquitination at multiple sites</title><p>To determine whether Rab5 is ubiquitinated in cells as proteomics studies have suggested, we performed ubiquitination assays using HEK 293T cells. Rab5 was predominantly monoubiquitinated when FLAG-Rab5 was overexpressed with HA-ubiquitin in HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Because Rab5 is not known to be ubiquitinated by certain E3 ubiquitin ligases that can ubiquitinate other Rab proteins, such as the Î²2AR-HACE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lachance et al., 2014</xref>) and the bacterial effector protein SdeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhogaraju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhogaraju and Dikic, 2016</xref>), monoubiquitination of Rab5 is likely to be performed by an as yet unidentified E3 ligase(s). Monoubiquitinated Rab5 migrated in a gel as doublet bands, implying that monoubiquitination of Rab5 can occur at multiple sites. Appearance of doublet bands from monoubiquitination was previously noted for caveolin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ritz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kirchner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayer et al., 2010</xref>). To explore the possibility that double bands might have been caused by prenylation of Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu and Nagy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wojtkowiak et al., 2011</xref>), we treated cells with a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI-198) and then conducted ubiquitination assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Double bands from the monoubiquitinated Rab5 remained unchanged in cells treated with GGTI-198, demonstrating that the double bands are the result of monoubiquitination of Rab5 at multiple sites. These double bands were not observed when a high percentage polyacrylamide gel (12%) was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,eâf</xref>). Next, we examined whether ubiquitination is dependent on the nucleotide binding state of Rab5. Ubiquitination assays with GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Rab5 mutants (S34N and Q79L, respectively) revealed that the monoubiquitination of Rab5 is not dependent on the nucleotide binding state of Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29154.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rab5 is monoubiquitinated in the cellular environment.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Monoubiquitination of FLAG-Rab5 in HEK 293T cells.

To verify whether those ubiquitination sites are monoubiquitinated and to examine if other lysine residues of Rab5 can be ubiquitinated, we mutated each of the 13 lysine (K) residues of Rab5 to arginine (R) and repeated the ubiquitination assay for each K-to-R mutant in HEK 293T cells. We found that the upper band of the doublet was completely abolished in the K140R mutant, while the monoubiquitination bands of Rab5 were not altered in the other K-to-R mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This result suggests that K140 is a major monoubiquitination site of Rab5, and that at least two or more sites are responsible for the lower band.. To identify the ubiquitination sites on Rab5 comprehensively, we prepared a lysine zero mutant in which all 13 lysine residues of Rab5 were mutated to arginine (13KR). However, the 13KR mutant was not expressed in HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).We reasoned that this was due to mutation of both K33 and K134 based on previous structural studies of Ras and EF-Tu GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pai et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">BrÃ¼nger et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jurnak, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berchtold et al., 1993</xref>). Two lysine residues, the P-loop lysine in the GxxxGKS/T motif and the invariant lysine in the NKxD motif, are crucial because they form direct contacts with the guanine nucleotide. Similarly, for Rab5, K33 and K134 form direct contacts with both GDP and GTP molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b and c</xref>, PDB ID: 1TU4 and 3MJH, respectively). K33, which sits in the nucleotide-binding site, performs two polar interactions with GDP/GTP: the NÎ¶ atom and amide nitrogen interact with the OÎ² and OÎ³ atoms of guanine nucleotides (2.7â3.4 Ã for GDP; 2.8â3.5 Ã for GTP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b and c</xref>). K134 also contacts GDP/GTP through two interactions: NÎ¶ atom interacts with O4â of the ribose ring (3.3 Ã for GDP and 3.0 Ã for GTP), and the amide nitrogen interacts with O6 of the guanine base (3.4 Ã for both cases). Subsequently, we generated an 11KR mutant with intact K33 and K134 and examined its function by observing Rab5-positive endosome puncta in HeLa cells to visualize Rab5-positive endosomes more efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miaczynska et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kajiho et al., 2003</xref>). First, we checked whether Rab5 is monoubiquitinated in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Rab5 was monoubiquitinated in HeLa cells, confirming that ubiquitination of Rab5 is conserved in the two cell lines. Whereas Rab5 puncta were not observed for the 13KR and the two 12KR mutants, puncta were formed as clearly in 11KR mutant cells as in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), suggesting that the functionality of the 11KR mutant is preserved. No monoubiquitinated Rab5 band was detected for the 11KR mutant in the ubiquitination assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), suggesting that K33 and K134 are not responsible for monoubiquitination of Rab5. Considering that K134 was previously reported to be ubiquitinated by proteomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>), it is plausible that K134 may undergo polyubiquitination. Given the crucial role of K134 in the structural integrity of Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b and c</xref>), we hypothesized that ubiquitination of K134 might be related to disruption/degradation of Rab5, thereby preventing us from observing ubiquitination of K134 in the current experimental conditions.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29154.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Putative ubiquitination sites of Rab5A based on published studies.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Lysine site</th><th>Peptide from mass spectrometry</th><th>Predicted protein</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>116</td><td>RAKNWVKELQRQA</td><td>hRab5a (K116/215)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>134</td><td>IALSGNKADLANK</td><td>mRab5a (K134/215)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>140</td><td>KADLANKRAVDFQ</td><td>mRab5a (K140/215)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Using the 11KR mutant as a negative control, we introduced single R-to-K back-mutations in the background of the 11KR mutant and performed ubiquitination assays. Monoubiquitination bands were present for R116K, R140K, and R165K mutants in contrast to the 11KR mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). These results verified the previously known ubiquitination sites (K116 and K140) and revealed a novel ubiquitination site (K165). Interestingly, K165 corresponds to K147 of a Ras GTPase whose monoubiquitination activates Ras signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013a</xref>). Notably, R22K, R112K, and R183K mutants exhibited polyubiquitination patterns. Because no such polyubiquitination patterns were present in the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1aâf</xref>), these polyubiquitination patterns are likely artifacts from using the 11KR mutant as the background.</p><p>We analyzed these putative ubiquitination sites using the crystal structures of Rab5:GDP and Rab5:GTP (PDB ID: 1TU4 and 3MJH, respectively). None of the three lysine residues are located in the Rab5 switch regions (SW I and SW II; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). In addition, all of the lysine residues are surface-exposed and accessible to ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that, among the three lysine residues known to be ubiquitination sites of Rab5, K116 and K140 are monoubiquitinated, while K134 is not. We also identified K165 as a novel monoubiquitination site of Rab5.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Monoubiquitination of K140 and K165 of Rab5 plays a negative role in the endocytic pathway</title><p>To elucidate the consequences of monoubiquitinated Rab5, we examined the effects of monoubiquitination on the formation of Rab5-positive puncta, because Rab5 itself is widely used as an early endosome marker protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexopoulou et al., 2016</xref>). We performed immunofluorescence assays in HeLa cells to examine the formation of endogenous Rab5-positivie puncta upon overexpression of ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2aâb</xref>). Upon transfection of ubiquitin into HeLa cells, endogenous Rab5-positive puncta diffused to the cytosol and failed to co-localize with early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1) protein, another early endosome marker protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). These results raise two possibilities: (i) monoubiquitinated Rab5 failed to be recruited to endosomal membranes or (ii) monoubiquitinated Rab5 disrupt Rab5-positive endosomal formation while it localized on the endosomal membranes. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we conducted a fractionation assay followed by immunoprecipitation to enrich for mUbRab5 in cytosolic and membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We observed that the monoubiquitinated Rab5 was predominantly localized in the membrane fraction. These results prompted us to hypothesize that monoubiquitinated Rab5 could disrupt Rab5-positive endosomal formation while it was localized on the membrane. Together with the immunofluorescence assay results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2aâb</xref>), these findings strongly suggest that ubiquitination of Rab5 has negative effects on the regulatory cycle of Rab5.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29154.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Endosome delocalization of Rab5 through overexpression of ubiquitin.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) HeLa cells were transfected with HA-ubiquitin or HA vector.

We conducted EGF-induced EGF receptor (EGFR) degradation assays to examine the effects of monoubiquitinated Rab5 on the endocytic trafficking pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoeller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balaji et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). EGFR was gradually degraded in EGF-treated HeLa cells, and complete degradation was observed after 90 min of EGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> upper-left panel). Overexpression of Rab5 apparently facilitated EGF-induced EGFR degradation, as judged by earlier complete degradation after 60 min of EGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> upper-right panel). Interestingly, overexpression of ubiquitin and Rab5 attenuated the degradation of EGFR, supported by the retention of some EGFR after 90 min of EGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> middle-left panel). These results are consistent with the disruption of endosomal localization of Rab5 under ubiquitin overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2aâb</xref>). Thus, ubiquitination of Rab5 is likely to play a negative role in the Rab5-mediated endocytic pathway. When the K140R mutant was overexpressed with ubiquitin EGFR degradation was completely restored and no attenuation was observed and almost all of the EGFR were degraded after 90 min of EGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> lower-left panel), while the other mutants (K116R and K165R) still possesses such attenuation. This result suggests that ubiquitination of K140 of Rab5 has a crucial role in downregulating the Rab5-mediated endocytic pathway. To examine the effects of the three putative ubiquitination sites in the endosomal localization of Rab5, we conducted immunofluorescence assays. Consistent with the results obtained using endogenous Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2aâb</xref>), Rab5-positive endosomal puncta were abolished when Flag-Rab5 WT was co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,g</xref>). Similarly, no puncta were observed for the K116R mutant upon co-transfection with HA-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,g</xref>), indicating that monoubiquitination of K116 does not affect Rab5-positive endosomal formation. By contrast, Rab5-positive endosomal puncta were detectable when either K140R or K165R mutants were co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,g</xref>). These observations suggest that monoubiquitination of K140 or K165 inhibits the Rab5-positive endosomal formation. To further investigated, we performed immunofluorescent assays using Rab5-11KR and three single-K-mutants (11KR-R116K, 11KR-R140K, and 11KR-R165K). Rab5-11KR mutant still displayed Rab5-positive endosomal puncta when it was co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). 11KR-R116K also showed Rab5-positive endosomal formation consistent with the previous finding that ubiquitination of K116 does not have an adverse effect on Rab5 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2eâh</xref>). However, no endosomal puncta were observed for either 11KR-R140K or 11KR-R165K mutants upon co-transfection with HA-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f,h</xref>). These results confirm the inhibitory role of monoubiquitination of either K140 or K165. These observations indicate that Rab5 monoubiquitination has functional consequences opposite those of Ras monoubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2013b</xref>): monoubiquitination of Rab5 on either K140 or K165 disrupts its function, whereas that of Ras on either K117 or K147 activates it. Taken together, our data demonstrate that monoubiquitination of K140 and K165 downregulates Rab5-mediated endocytic pathway, establishing monoubiquitination at specific sites of Rab5 as inhibitory signals, while monoubiquitination of K116 has no apparent effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Modified chemical ubiquitination with iterative ubiquitin addition to obtain fully monoubiquitinated Rab5 protein</title><p>To understand how monoubiquitinated Rab5s negatively affect the Rab5 regulatory cycle at molecular level, we undertook biochemical studies of monoubiquitinated Rab5s. Structural, biophysical, and biochemical characterization of monoubiquitinated Rab5 proteins requires a large quantity of sample of the highest purity. Among the previously reported methods for generating ubiquitin-protein covalent linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merkley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McGinty et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freudenthal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Virdee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">RÃ¶sner et al., 2015</xref>), we adopted a chemical conjugation method where a disulfide bond is formed in place of the isopeptide bond, using K-to-C mutants of Rab5 (K116C, K140C and K165C) and the C-terminal G-to-C mutant of ubiquitin (G76C). A known problem with existing chemical conjugation methods is the incompleteness of conjugation. Because Rab5 and monoubiquitinated Rab5s have similar molecular masses and isoelectric points (25 kDa and pI 7.81 for Rab5; 34 kDa and pI 7.72 for monoubiquitinated Rab5), the presence of unmodified Rab5 would prevent separation of the two species by either size exclusion chromatography or ion exchange chromatography. Therefore, we modified the published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merkley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013a</xref>) to overcome incomplete monoubiquitination of Rab5 by introducing iterative ubiquitin<sup>G76C</sup> addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). First, we altered four native cysteine residues in Rab5 to prevent non-specific disulfide bond formation: two cysteine residues on the surface of Rab5 were mutated to serine (C19S and C63S), and four C-terminal residues, including two cysteine residues (CCSN; residues 213â216), were removed, inspired by a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013a</xref>). GEF assays confirmed that the engineered Rab5 Del_Cys (C19S/C63S/Î213â216) had the similar functionality as WT Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1a,b</xref>). The production of chemically conjugated monoubiquitinated Rab5 (hereafter referred to as âmUbRab5â) at a specific lysine residue by iterative addition of ubiquitin<sup>G76C</sup> at regular intervals was monitored by SDS-AGE under reducing (R) and non-reducing (NR) conditions. Increments in mUbRab5 and decrements in Rab5 band intensities were observed as more cycles of ubiquitin<sup>G76C</sup> addition were completed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1c,d</xref>).

This might be due to the difficulties in purifying ubiquitinated proteins and the dynamics of the ubiquitin moiety; the ubiquitin moiety in ubiquitinated proteins has been reported to be able to adopt multiple conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ye et al., 2012</xref>). Consistently, structural simulations of ubiquitin moieties of mUbRas have predicted flexibility of these moieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013a</xref>). Because of the inherent flexibility of the ubiquitin moiety of ubiquitinated proteins, we opted to employ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Three mUbRab5s (mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub>, mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub>, and mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub>) were subjected to dynamic light scattering to evaluate whether the chemically synthesized mUbRab5s were stable and monodisperse in solution.

To conduct SAXS experiment mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub>, mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub>, and mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub> were concentrated up to 2.9, 7.3, and 2.6 mg/ml, respectively, and subjected to SAXS measurements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

To check whether the ubiquitin moieties of Rab5 are flexible, we performed flexibility analysis using the Porod-Debye method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rambo and Tainer, 2011</xref>). SAXS curves from the three mUbRab5s did not have a plateau in the Porod-Debye plot, implying that all of the mUbRab5s were flexible in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). To understand the conformational dynamics of the mUbRab5s, we analyzed SAXS data using an ensemble-optimized method (<italic>EOM</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tria et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>EOM</italic> was originally designed for multi-domain proteins with a flexible linker. Input files for <italic>EOM</italic> are a single linear protein sequence covering entire protein, atomic coordinates for each domain, and SAXS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tria et al., 2015</xref>). Because ubiquitinated proteins are not single polypeptides but branched ones, we generated the sequences and atomic coordinates of mUbRab5s as described in the Materials and methods. A pool of 10,000 independent models was generated based on the sequence and structural information from SAXS curve by <italic>RANCH</italic> (embedded in <italic>EOM</italic>, <italic>ATSAS</italic> package). Then, a genetic algorithm for the selection of an ensemble was performed by <italic>GAJOE</italic> with 100 times (embedded in <italic>EOM</italic>, <italic>ATSAS</italic> package). Finally, the best ensemble matched with the SAXS curve with lowest Ï<sup>2</sup> was selected. Distribution of conformational ensembles of mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> was clearly distinct from those of mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub> and mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub>. Two distinct populations of conformational ensembles were evident for mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub>, with a radius-of-gyration (<italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub>) of 23 and 27 Ã, respectively, and maximum distance (<italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub>) of 75 and 90 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,e</xref>). By contrast, mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub> and mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub> comprised a single population with an <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> of 25 Ã and <italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub> of 80 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,d and and c,f</xref>). These results strongly suggest that monoubiquitination at these three lysine sites has different functional consequences. <italic>EOM</italic>-derived structural models of mUbRab5s revealed specific orientations of the ubiquitin moiety. Three major conformations were derived for mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>) and two conformations for each of mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub> and mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g,i</xref>). This was in contrast to K147-monoubiquitinated Ras (mUbRas<sub>K147</sub>) that exhibited different orientations of the ubiquitin moiety in the top 10 lowest-energy models from simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013a</xref>). The number of relative orientations of the ubiquitin moiety appears to be less than that of the major conformations derived: essentially, two orientations for mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> and a single orientation each for mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub> and mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub>. This indicates that the ubiquitin moiety on K140 is more flexible than those on K116 and K165. Our results suggest that the ubiquitin moieties on multiple lysine residues of Rab5 can assume different conformations, resulting in different modes of regulation. Similar to the molecular dynamics simulation of mUbRas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013a</xref>), none of the ubiquitin molecules from the <italic>EOM</italic> models were located proximal to Rab5.

if monoubiquitination affected the interaction of Rab5 with its partners, we superimposed our mUbRab5 models with known complex structures of Rab5:Rabex-5 (a GEF), RabGAP-5 (a GAP), and Rabaptin5 and EEA1 (effector proteins). In the mUbRab5:Rabex-5 complex models obtained by superpositioning of mUBRab5 and the Rab5:Rabex-5 structure (PDB ID: 4DQU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), none of the ubiquitin moieties of mUbRab5s appeared to clash with Rabex-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We speculated that the ubiquitin moieties might not interfere with activities related to a GEF, such as GDP release and GTP loading. Next, we generated structural models of mUbRab5:Rabaptin5 and mUbRab5:EEA1 by superposition on Rab5:Rabaptin5 and Rab5:EEA1 structures (PDB IDs: 1TU3 and 3MJH, respectively). The ubiquitin moieties of mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub> and mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub> were far from both Rabaptin5 and EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). However, the switch I (SWI) region of Rab5 was juxtaposed with the flexible ubiquitin moiety of mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub>, raising the possibility that a flexible ubiquitin moiety could cause a conformational change in the SWI. Because this conformational change of SWI is required for activation of Rab5 through interactions with downstream effector proteins, potential interruption of the SWI by mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> could have a severe impact on the Rab5 regulatory cycle. Finally, we generated a structural model for mUbRab5:RabGAP-5 by superposition to a known Rab:GAP structure (PDB ID: 4HLQ). The ubiquitin moiety of mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub> did not clash sterically with RabGAP-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4a</xref>). Both mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> and mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub> seemingly bring the ubiquitin moieties close to RabGAP-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4b,c</xref>), suggesting that neither mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> nor mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub> would have enhanced interactions with RabGAP-5. Taken together, our structural analyses of mUbRab5s with partner proteins such as GEF, GAP, and effector proteins strongly suggest that the inhibitory effects of some mUbRab5s are highly likely to be caused by impedance of interactions with effector proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>mUbRab5s retain GEF-mediated guanine nucleotide conversion</title><p>To dissect the inhibitory role of mUbRab5s at the molecular level, we examined whether monoubiquitination of Rab5 could interfere with guanine nucleotide conversion, because the major regulatory mechanism of Rab GTPase is the conversion between a GDP-bound state (inactive) and GTP-bound state (active) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Novick, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mizuno-Yamasaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013</xref>). Rab5 guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (Rabex-5) mediates the conversion from GDP to GTP for Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomas and Strutt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aikawa et al., 2012</xref>). We measured GDP dissociation and GTP association rates of the mUbRab5s in the presence and absence of a GEF (Rabex-5<sub>132-393</sub>). Guanine nucleotide analogues 2â-(or-3â)-<italic>O</italic>-(<italic>N</italic>-methyl-anthraniloyl) GDP (MANT-GDP) and MANT-GTP were used to detect the interaction between guanine nucleotides and Rab5. GDP release from either Rab5 or mUbRab5 was measured by monitoring the decrease in the amount of fluorescence from MANT-GDP when non-fluorescent GDP was added in the presence and absence of Rabex-5, a GEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Both mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub> and mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> showed similar GDP-release activities to WT Rab5 in the presence of Rabex-5, indicating that monoubiquitination of K116 and K140 does not interfere with the GEF function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>). Notably, mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub> exhibited reduced GDP release in the presence of GEF, and the curve could not be fitted by a one-phase decay linear regression model. Next, GTP loading was monitored using MANT-GTP and Rabex-5. Again, mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub> and mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> showed similar levels of GTP loading to Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>). However, the fluorescence signal from mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub> decreased continuously after it reached a maximum. This observation indicates that monoubiquitination of K165 does not block GTP loading of Rab5, but can weaken the interaction between GTP and Rab5. Our data support the structural analyses that predicted that monoubiquitination of Rab5s would have no effect on the Rab5-GEF interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2aâc</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that monoubiquitination of Rab5 on K116 and K140 does not affect GEF activity, while monoubiquitination of K165 interferes with the GEF-mediated conversion cycle, as indicated by this proteinâs reduced response to GDP release and leakage during GTP loading.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29154.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Intrinsic and GEF-mediated GDP release and GTP loading activities of mUbRab5s.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) MANT-GDP release assay with (green) or without aÂ GEF (orange; Rabex-5<sub>132-393</sub>).

Notably, we found that mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub> showed reduced GDP release activity and weakened GTP loading. However, the GEF activity of mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> remained unchanged relative to WT. We then conducted downstream effector protein binding assays with Rab5 and mURab5s. Several studies have reported that monoubiquitination of a target protein can alter its interactions with other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duan et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies of Ras monoubiquitination have revealed that monoubiquitinated Ras has different binding affinities to its effector proteins compared to WT Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sasaki et al., 2011</xref>). This prompted us to examine the interactions between mUbRabs and effector proteins. We determined the dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of Rab5 and mUbRab5s for two Rab5 effector proteins, Rabaptin5 and EEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mishra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2004</xref>), using bio-layer interferometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Each of the Rab5 binding domains of Rabaptin5 and EEA1 (Rabaptin5<sub>551-862</sub> and EEA1<sub>36-91</sub>) was highly purified as a GST fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Rabaptin5, a well-characterized Rab5 effector protein, has been widely used to study biochemical and biophysical mechanisms involved in Rab5-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> for Rabaptin5 was five-fold higher than that of unmodified Rab5 (37.7Â Â±Â 4.9 Î¼M <italic>vs.</italic> 8.0Â Â±Â 3.4 Î¼M; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>), indicating the reduced affinity of mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> for Rabaptin5. However, mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub> and mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub> showed little change in the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values: 8.0Â Â±Â 0.6 Î¼M and 4.4Â Â±Â 0.2 Î¼M, respectively. These results strongly suggest that monoubiquitination of K140 of Rab5 inhibits its binding to downstream effector proteins. Because effector proteins bind to Rab5 via similar binding modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mishra et al., 2010</xref>), it is plausible that mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> can inhibit interactions with other Rab5 effector proteins. To evaluate this possibility, we determined the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values of Rab5 and mUbRab5s for early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1), another well-known Rab5 effector protein. EEA1 recognizes phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-positive membranes and recruits Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Christoforidis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rubino et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray et al., 2016</xref>). mUbRab<sub>K140</sub> exhibited an approximately 20-fold increase in <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for EEA1 compared to unmodified Rab5 (108.0Â Â±Â 22.0 Î¼M <italic>vs.</italic> 5.8Â Â±Â 0.3 Î¼M, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of unmodified Rab5 for EEA1 was similar to that reported previously (5.8Â Â±Â 0.3 Î¼M <italic>vs.</italic> 2.4Â Â±Â 0.23 Î¼M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mishra et al., 2010</xref>). mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub> showed a modest increase in <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value for EEA1 (18.4Â Â±Â 0.8 Î¼M), while mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub> showed virtually no change (4.7Â Â±Â 0.5 Î¼M) in <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value relative to that of unmodified Rab5. These data are consistent with the structural models, which suggested a possible clash of mUbRab<sub>K140</sub> with effector proteins but no such clash for mUbRab<sub>K116</sub> and mUbRab<sub>K165</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2dâi</xref>).

However, the functional roles of ubiquitinated Rab GTPases have not been explored yet. Here, we demonstrated that Rab5 is monoubiquitinated at K116, K140, and K165 in two different cell lines (HEK 293T and HeLa). We also obtained structural ensemble models of the mUbRab5s by solution scattering. While the ubiquitin molecule on mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> was flexible, it was not flexible from the other two mUbRab5s. mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> shows decreased binding affinity to downstream effectors such as Rabaptin5 and EEA1, but its GEF-mediated GDP release and GTP loading activities were not changed. Through GDP release and association assays, we found that mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub> had altered binding to GDP/GTP. Based on our data, we propose a molecular mechanism for how site-specific monoubiquitination of Rab5 acts as an inhibitory signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The canonical regulatory mechanism of Rab5 involves a GEF- and GAP-mediated GDP/GTP conversion cycle and interaction between activated Rab5 and downstream effector proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Monoubiquitination of K116 of Rab5 does not interfere with any part of the functional cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). By contrast, monoubiquitination of either K140 or K165 of Rab5 negatively regulates the functional cycle by either reducing the interaction of Rab5 with downstream effector proteins (K140 monoubiquitination; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>) or altering the intrinsic GDP/GTP conversion cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29154.025</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of Rab5 regulation by site-specific monoubiquitination.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Canonical Rab5 regulatory cycle. Inactive GDP-bound Rab5 is activated by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF such as Rabex-5) through the exchange of GDP to GTP. The activated GTP-bound Rab5 interacts with various effector proteins to form early endosomes. Activated Rab5 is switched-off by a GTPase activating protein (GAP) through the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. (<bold>b</bold>) Monoubiquitination on K116 has no effect on the regulatory cycle. Thus, mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub> is regulated in the same way as unmodified Rab5. (<bold>c</bold>) Monoubiquitination of K140 causes the ubiquitin moiety to impair the interaction of Rab5 with its effector proteins. Therefore, mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> cannot form early endosomes.

Therefore, monoubiquitination seems to play different roles in Rab and Ras GTPases: monoubiquitination in Rab5 serves as an inhibitory signal, whereas it serves as a stimulatory or activating signal in Ras. It will be interesting to determine the ubiquitination sites of other Rab GTPases and to investigate how ubiquitination alters the intrinsic functions of these proteins. Proteomics studies to screen for ubiquitination sites of Rab5 have also indicated that other Rab GTPases are ubiquitinated. As Rab5 monoubiquitination is different from Ras monoubiquitination, other Rab GTPases might be regulated differently by site-specific ubiquitination. For these studies, the optimized chemical ubiquitination method described here will be useful. Recently, atypical serine ubiquitination was reported for Rab33b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhogaraju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhogaraju and Dikic, 2016</xref>), but the underlying molecular mechanism has not been clarified. Our chemical ubiquitination method can be used to determine the functional role of serine ubiquitination in RabÂ GTPases. Further investigation is required to evaluate the diversity of roles of monoubiquitination among different small GTPase super families and/or among members of the same superfamily.</p><p>Advances in proteomic techniques have revealed the ubiquitination sites of a small number of Rab proteins. Analysis of published proteomics data revealed that 28 of 63 human Rab GTPases (including isoforms) are ubiquitinated in cells. When we compiled ubiquitination sites of Rab proteins reported by proteomic studies, we found that ubiquitination sites of Rab5 found in the current study - K116 and K140 - are located in non-conserved regions, while K165 is in the conserved G5 motif (xxxETSxâKâ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). It is plausible that ubiquitination of non-conserved lysine residues in Rab proteins and possibly small GTPases in general exhibits different functionalities. We noticed ubiquitination of K33 and K134 (numbering based on the Rab5 sequence) in some Rab proteins; both of these residues are critical for structural integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Analysis of Rab5 proteins from eukaryotic species revealed different degrees of conservation of the three ubiquitination sites discovered in this study: both K116 and K165 are strictly conserved from yeast to human, whereas K140 is less conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). K140 is replaced by isoleucine in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and glutamate in yeast, implying that K140 might be a point of functional differentiation in these organisms. In contrast to eukaryotic Rab5 proteins, the three ubiquitination sites were not conserved in Rab5 homologue from <italic>Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus</italic> (APMV). Recent crystal structure of APMV Rab5 revealed that K165 of hRab5a is substituted to F152 in APMV Rab5 and plays aÂ major role for binding to GTP molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ku et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it seems that monoubiquitination of Rab5 is aÂ subsidiary signal for its regulation in eukaryotic cells. It is also intriguing that ubiquitination of a conserved site can have different functional consequences in Rab and Ras GTPase proteins. Monoubiquitination of K165 of Rab5 has an inhibitory effect, whereas ubiquitination of the corresponding K147 of Ras has a stimulatory effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2013b</xref>). Therefore, monoubiquitination appears to be a versatile modification tool.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29154.026</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Multiple sequence alignment of human and mouse Rab GTPases reported to be ubiquitinated.</title><p>Rab GTPases in the ubiquitination database (mUbSiDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>]) were obtained, and their sequences were aligned to human Rab5A (this study) using <italic>Clustal X2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larkin et al., 2007</xref>).

Despite the relative simplicity of this method in comparison with enzymatic conjugation, oxidative conjugation often suffers from incompleteness of the process, rendering subsequent separation of the ubiquitinated protein from unreacted protein very challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merkley et al., 2005</xref>). Such an inseparable mixture can obscure correct interpretation of biochemical and structural data. Here, we modified a pre-existing method by iterative addition of ubiquitin<sup>G76C</sup> to drive the chemical synthesis to completion. Our optimized method for chemical synthesis of ubiquitinated proteins will facilitate studies on the effects of protein ubiquitination at the molecular level when no identified E3 ubiquitin ligase is available or a large quantity of ubiquitinated protein is desired.</p><p>In this study, we found that monoubiquitination of Rab5 had an inhibitory effect on the regulatory cycle of Rab5. However, we did not find a stimulus signal or E3 ligase(s) responsible for monoubiquitination of Rab5. As result, only a small portion of Rab5 could be ubiquitinated when ubiquitin was overexpressed. These results suggest that ubiquitination of Rab5 occurs rarely in cells under basal conditions and mayÂ explain why the ubiquitination of Rab GTPases has not been studied until recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de la Vega et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the small population of monoubiquitinated Rab5, the effects of monoubiquitination of Rab5 were strong. We observed dramatic failure of localization of Rab5 to the endosome and EGFR degradation pathway. This suggests that monoubiquitination of Rab5 is tightly regulated in the cell through specific E3 ligase or DUB enzymes. It will be of great interest to determine how monoubiquitination of Rab5 is regulated in cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and cell culture</title><p>The pCDNA-GFP-Rab5 clone was provided by Dr. Yoshikatsu Aikawa at Doshisha University, Japan.

Since <italic>EOM</italic> accepted only single polypeptide chain with multiple domains, we generated the sequences and atomic coordinates of the mUbRab5s in the following four steps. Firstly, the input sequence started with the ubiquitin sequence followed by the partial Rab5 sequence which covered from the target lysine of Rab5 to the C-terminus and then the remaining Rab5 sequence ranging from the N-terminus to the residue before the target lysine of Rab5. For example, the input sequence for mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> was as follows: (N-[Ubiquitin residues 1â76]-[K140-C-term of Rab5]-[N-term to residue 139 of Rab5]-C). Using this sequence, we were able to use <italic>EOM</italic> to analyze the ubiquitin moiety of mUbRab5 as a domain of a single polypeptide chain. Secondly, the input coordinates were prepared following the same way as in the preparation of the input sequences. Crystal structures of ubiquitin and Rab5 were used as the coordinates for domains 1 and 2, respectively (PDB ID: 1UBQ, 3MJH). The residues of Rab5 were re-numbered so that the new numbering was the same as the numbering of the prepared sequence. For example, K140 of Rab5 was re-numbered K77. Thirdly, we determined how many residues in the C-terminal region of ubiquitin should be allowed to be flexible. To define flexible residues in ubiquitin, we analyzed crystal/NMR structures of ubiquitin (PDB IDs: 1UBQ and 1D3Z). In both cases, the C-terminal five residues of ubiquitin (residues 72â76) after the Î²3 strand were not assigned to secondary structures, which imply that those residues are flexible. Since Arg 72 of ubiquitin is juxtaposed at the end of the Î²3 strand, Arg 72 was retained in the input coordinate file. Subsequently, four residues of ubiquitin (residues 73â76) were allowed to be flexible and removed in the input coordinate file. These C-terminal four residues of ubiquitin were used for flexibility analysis through <italic>EOM</italic> in our previous study on linear ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thach et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, we used the native isopeptide linkage for ensemble model calculations in <italic>EOM</italic> since a disulfide bond linkage is known to resemble the native ubiquitination linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>GEF-mediated GDP release and GTP loading assays</title><p>GDP release from Rab5 or mUbRab5 was measured using 2â-(or-3â)-<italic>O</italic>-(<italic>N</italic>-methylanthraniloyl) (MANT)-GDP (Molecular Probes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Delprato and Lambright, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013a</xref>). One micromolar Rab5 or mUbRab5 was loaded with 1 Î¼M MANT-GDP for 30 min at room temperature in buffer F in the presence or absence of 1 Î¼M Rabex-5<sub>132-391</sub>. To initiate MANT-GDP release, 1 mM GDP was added to the solution. Fluorescence intensities were measured (excitation at 360 nm and emission at 450 nm) on a TECAN M200 multi-plate reader, analyzed, and fitted to a one-phase exponential decay curve with <italic>GraphPad Prism</italic> software. GTP loading was measured using MANT-GTP. Two micromolar Rab5 or mUbRab5 was mixed with 1 Î¼M of MANT-GTP in buffer F and stabilized for 10 min. To facilitate GTP loading by GEF, 1 Î¼M Rabex-5<sub>132-391</sub> was added to the solution. Fluorescence intensities were measured (excitation at 360 nm and emission at 450 nm) on a TECAN M200 multi-plate reader, analyzed, and fitted to a one-phase exponential association curve using <italic>GraphPad Prism</italic> software. These experiments were repeated three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Effector protein binding assay by biolayer interferometry (BLI)</title><p>BLI experiments were performed on a BLitz system (ForteBio). For this, 0.5 ÂµM GST-Rabaptin5<sub>551-862</sub> or GST-EEA1<sub>36-91</sub> was immobilized on anti-GST sensors. After baseline stabilization with reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate, a non-hydrolysable GTP analog (GppNHP, JenaÂ Bioscience,Â Germany)), GppNHP-loaded Rab5 or mUbRab5 at different concentrations was loaded until signal saturation, and this experiment was repeated twice. To initiate dissociation, the sensor was then placed into in reaction buffer again. Association rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub>), dissociation rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>), and SEM (standard error of mean) values were calculated by <italic>BLItz Pro</italic> (ForteBio) based on sensorgram results. Dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) and SEMs of dissociation constants were calculated by the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Î</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msqrt><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Î</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Î</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where Î refers to the SEMs of <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub>, and <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>After transfection, cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Siteâspecific monoubiquitination downregulates Rab5 by disturbing effector binding and guanine nucleotide conversion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marino Zerial (Reviewer #2); David Lambright (Reviewer #3).</p><p>You will see that the reviewers believe that the work is potentially suitable for presentation in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, they describe a number of aspects that need to be fully addressed and they noted that the manuscript needs rewriting, perhaps with help from a native English speaker. I enclose the full reviews to help in recrafting this story for submission and reâevaluation for presentation in <italic>eLife</italic>. We hope you find the comments constructive; note that the ubiquitination of Rab5 is already reported in PhosphoSite Plus mass spec database (when you respond to reviewer 3); the Rab7 story can be omitted.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>This is an interesting paper reporting the consequences of Rab5 and Rab7 monoubiquitynation on Rab protein function. The authors try to combine cell biological assays and biochemical analysis with SAXS structural analysis, the kind of broad mix of approaches that <italic>eLife</italic> would like to present. They present a method for efficient in vitro generation of pure monoâubiquitin conjugates. It is likely that the authors have shown that monoâubiquitination decreases Rab activity when driven in cells by artificial expression of extra HAâubiquitin. This is shown with direct binding assays for Rab5 effectors and some light microscopy.</p><p>Unfortunately, it appears that the figures were photographs of drawings and are of too poor resolution for publication and in some cases even for reviewer evaluation. This reviewer cannot see any EEA1 staining for example, as the images are out of focus or off too low a resolution to see even blown up on a computer screen. Also, the language is difficult to understand and the manuscript will need significant editing and rewriting for clarity. The EGFR degradation needs to be presented graphically so that half times for degradation relative to time zero can be compared.</p><p>I will await the other referee comments and hope that this story can be presented more clearly so that its findings can be appreciated by the scientific community and brought up to the standard required for presentation in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>(Please use photoshop, high resolution and a drawing program to label figures such as Adobe Illustrator)</p><p>Quantitation of the cell biology data is missing</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>In this study, the authors employ a range of techniques to investigate Rab5 monoubiquitination both functionally and structurally, culminating in a model of how differential monoubiquitination of Rab5 has different effects on the downstream Rab5 machinery and dynamics at the early endosome. While the premise of this manuscript is highly interesting and is in the scope of <italic>eLife</italic>, I do not believe that the manuscript in the current form meets the standards of this journal. With sufficient revisions, however, this could be a conceptually novel and compelling paper.</p><p>In general, the story presented here is not very coherent. The authors have performed all the right experiments to present a good case for their model. However, the experiments are often poorly described and presented in an order that is only logical if you already know the outcome of later experiments. The authors should take care to present their story in a stepwise and logical manner and to explain in detail both the experimental approaches and underlying logic.</p><p>General points:</p><p>1) It is essential to be clear about which cell lines are used and also provide the rationale for using two different cell lines for the biochemistry and microscopy experiments. This approach is not coherent. Similarly, the change from cell work to recombinant proteins is not made explicit in the text.</p><p>2) The authors should go through the manuscript carefully to fix grammatical mistakes. Especially in the case of subsection âMonoubiquitination on K140 of Rab5 decreases its binding affinity to effector protâ, grammatical errors may confuse the message the authors are trying to convey.</p><p>There are several Rab5 isoforms and it must be made clear from the start which one is being used and provide a sound rationale for using that specific isoform alone, as the three isoforms show differential ubiquitination patterns.</p><p>Next, the authors use GGTIâ198, a GGTase inhibitor, to rule out prenylation as the source of the double bands upon ubiquitination. However, this experiment is not sufficiently described in the figure legend or in the text. What are the two different IP FLAG plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, what do the labels short and long mean?</p><p>Importantly, it is not clear to the reader why out of all lysines in Rab5, K33 and K165 were chosen in addition to the known K116, K134 and K140 sites from prot<italic>EOM</italic>ics. There is some explanation for K165 in sequence homology to K147 in Ras, but otherwise the authors make no effort to explain their rationale. This section should be reordered to make it more logical. I would suggest reordering the first part of the manuscript: the story would flow better if the validation of prot<italic>EOM</italic>ics hits preceded the investigation of the now proven ubiquitination sites. For example, instead of starting with candidate ubiquitination sites and an analysis of crystal structures in subsection âRab5 undergoes monoubiquitination at multiple sitesâ, it would be more logical to begin the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> as a validation of published prot<italic>EOM</italic>ics data. From there the story can then focus on the relevant monoubiquitination sites and their location on the Rab5 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the experiments done with K to E mutations and protein expression are not essential and should be moved to the supplement or left out entirely so as not to distract from the more sophisticated K to R mutation experiments.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the authors show that monoubiquitinated Rab5 (mUbRab5) localises to membranes. This raises many questions: mUbRab5 is a very small percentage of total membrane Rab5, why do the authors observe such a dramatic effect on recycling/degradation? This would seem to be a highly significant result but is not addressed at all. In addition to this, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows a dramatic removal of Rab5 from EEA1 positive endosomes upon ubiquitination and indeed in the text the authors refer to this as 'diffusing to cytosol' which would not agree with the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>.</p><p>If K134 mutations are not viable, how has this been identified as a ubiquitination site in vivo? The authors should comment on this.</p><p>The authors introduce the immunofluorescence of Rab5 endosomes and justify the use of HeLa cells in subsection âMonoubiquitination on K140 and K165 of Rab5 plays negative roles in endocytic pathwayâ, but results from these experiments had already been shown in subsection âRab5 undergoes monoubiquitination at multiple sitesâ without explanation of what Rab5 puncta are or what cell line was used.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>, UbRab5 does not appear as a double band as in other blots, why is this?</p><p>Subsection âMonoubiquitination on K140 and K165 of Rab5 plays negative roles in endocytic pathwayâ is a bit of a reach of interpretation at this point in the manuscript and are only logical in hindsight, knowing the results that are still to come.</p><p>From the SAXS analysis the authors derive that mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> features two conformations while mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub> and mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub> have only one conformation. However, the authors also state in the text that mUbRab5 is structurally very flexible, contradicting the existence of distinct conformations. To better evaluate the data, the authors need to explain in detail how distinct conformations were extracted from the data using ensembleâoptimized methods (<italic>EOM</italic>) and how the final models were derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H and I</xref>). Furthermore, the authors need to show the shape of the particle derived from the SAXS data, not only the model. In general, the unprocessed SAXS data are missing and the reader is presented immediately with something highly processed. For a more coherent story, the intermediate stages of deriving these structural models must be presented.</p><p>From structural models the authors derive that the close proximity of the ubiquitin moieties in mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub> to the switch I region of Rab5 might disturb Rabaptinâ5 and EEA1 binding, while interaction of Rab5 with GEF (Rabexâ5) and GAP (RabGAPâ5) is unchanged. This especially needs clarification, because the switch I region is involved in nucleotide binding as well, and hence prone to be influenced by changes in nucleotide state. Knowing the outcome of the binding experiments described later, this conclusion makes sense, but when reading this manuscript for this first time this appears a somewhat illogical conclusion.</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>This manuscript describes experiments examining monoubiquitination of Rab5 when overexpressed with ubiquitin and affects of monoubiquitination of the specificâlysine residues on Rab5 structure, localization, EGFR degradation, intrinsic and Rabexâ5 catalyzed nucleotide exchange, and binding of effectors (Rabaptin5 and EEA1). Similar cellâbased experiments were performed to examine Rab7 ubiquitination. The identification of putative monoubiquitination sites, the characterization of homogenously monoubiquitinated Rab5 by SAXS, and the effects of monoubiquitination on GEF activity, effector binding affinity, localization, and EGFR degradation suggest that monoubiquitination of at least two lysines could potentially roles regulate Rab5 and Rab7 functions.</p><p>All of the experiments involve either purified proteins or transfections of cell lines. There are no experiments assessing whether the endogenous Rab proteins are monoubiquinated (i.e. without ubiquitin overexpression) and under what conditions. This limitation should be discussed, and conclusions about the potential biological significance appropriately qualified.</p><p>Subsection âRab5 undergoes monoubiquitination at multiple sitesâ, K33 and K134 are indeed crucial but this is already known, indeed from the very first structures of EFâTu and Ras. K33 is the Pâloop lysine in the GxxxxGKS/T motif; K134 is the invariant lysine in the NKxD G4 motif. The role and interactions of these residues in GTPases in general has been extensively documented. Its not clear why these invariant residues were chosen for mutational analysis. Expression in inclusion bodies in bacteria isn't particularly informative or unexpected. The rationale for generating lysineâtoâglutamate mutations is also unclear as these mutations don't mimic ubiquitination.</p><p>How can anything be concluded about inhibition of Rab5 activation (subsection âMonoubiquitination on K140 and K165 of Rab5 plays negative roles in endocytic pathwayâ) from the IF and fractionation experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>? These experiments do not indicate whether ubiquitination affects the nucleotide status of Rab5. Perhaps the authors meant inhibition of a Rab5 function rather than activation of Rab5 per se. Needs clarification.</p><p>Overexpression of ubiquitin presumably affects the function of many targets including proteins other than Rab5 that are also important for endocytic trafficking. Does overexpression of ubiquitin alone have any effects on (for example) EGFR degration?</p><p>The cell-based experiments lack quantification and analysis of statistical significance.</p><p>The resolution of the images in the PDF is low, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of these experiments.</p><p>The bufferâsubtracted SAXS curves should be shown somewhere in the main or supplemental figures. Accurate modeling of SAXS data, in particular by ensemble approaches, requires data with high signal to noise that typically extends to a high resolution cutoff near the first Porod minimum. The data and calculated curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are truncated in the Kratky region and the signalâtoânoise does not appear to be very high. Are the data of sufficient quality for ensemble modeling?</p><p>No details are provided regarding the <italic>EOM</italic> modeling. For example, how many residues we're allowed to be flexible and what criteria where to determine which residues show be flexible? Do the results change if additional residues are allowed to be flexible? A narrow selected distribution near the high <italic>R<sub>g</sub></italic> and <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> tails of the pools in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> suggest that the number of flexible residues used to generate the pool might not be adequate to represent the flexibility in solution. Also unclear is how the linkage between Rab5 and ubiquitin is modeled. Does the <italic>EOM</italic> model disulfide linkages? If not, how was the linkage modeled? The details of the modeling are important and how they affect the results needs to be evaluated and discussed.</p><p>&quot;Interestingly, none of the <italic>EOM</italic>âderived structural models for mUbRab5s implicates any direct interaction between ubiquitin and Rab5&quot; (subsection âStructural models of mUbRab5s derived by solution scatteringâ). Is <italic>EOM</italic> capable of producing models with direct interactions? Even if it could, what would it mean at the low resolution of SAXS?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>: KratkyâDebye and PorodâDebye plots indicate how extended a molecule is. Flexibility is inferred. Presumably the same results would be obtained from the calculated <italic>EOM</italic> curves that fit the data. The question is whether the SAXS data can distinguish flexible vs. extended.

However, recent studies suggest that these three isoforms may have differential roles. Rab5a is required for EGFâinduced EGFR degradation while Rab5b and Rab5c are not (Barbieri et al., 2000a, Chen et al., 2009). Rab5c is involved in cell migration whereas Rab5a and Rab5b are not (Chen, Schauer, et al., 2014). Prot<italic>EOM</italic>ic studies have suggested that the Rab5 isoforms can be differentially ubiquitinated in cells (Chen, Zhou, et al., 2014, Wagner et al., 2011, Wagner et al., 2012). Since Rab5a has been extensively studied for its involvement in endosomal fusion (Bucci et al., 1992, Gorvel et al., 1991, Barbieri et al., 2000b, Hoffenberg et al., 1995, Rybin et al., 1996, Stenmark et al., 1994), we decided to focus on Rab5a for our studies (hereafter referred to as âRab5â).

There is some explanation for K165 in sequence homology to K147 in Ras, but otherwise the authors make no effort to explain their rationale. This section should be reordered to make it more logical. I would suggest reordering the first part of the manuscript: the story would flow better if the validation of protEOMics hits preceded the investigation of the now proven ubiquitination sites. For example, instead of starting with candidate ubiquitination sites and an analysis of crystal structures in subsection âRab5 undergoes monoubiquitination at multiple sitesâ, it would be more logical to begin the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> as a validation of published protEOMics data.

Briefly, ubiquitination sites from prot<italic>EOM</italic>ics studies (K116, K134 and K140) were validated with ubiquitination assay. We found that K116 and K140 were monoubiquitinated. By contrast, K134 was not responsible for monoubiquitination on Rab5, implicating that K134 might undergo polyubiquitination. Another monoubiquitination site K165, homologous to K147 of Ras, was identified. Finally the three putative monoubiquitination sites (K116, K140 and K165) were chosen for further studies. These changes have been implemented in the lines 78â152 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the experiments done with K to E mutations and protein expression are not essential and should be moved to the supplement or left out entirely so as not to distract from the more sophisticated K to R mutation experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Pursuant to the reviewerâs suggestion, the results on K to E mutation and their expression are now omitted from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the authors show that monoubiquitinated Rab5 (mUbRab5) localises to membranes. This raises many questions: mUbRab5 is a very small percentage of total membrane Rab5, why do the authors observe such a dramatic effect on recycling/degradation? This would seem to be a highly significant result but is not addressed at all. In addition to this, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows a dramatic removal of Rab5 from EEA1 positive endosomes upon ubiquitination and indeed in the text the authors refer to this as 'diffusing to cytosol' which would not agree with the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>The dramatic effects of a small percentage of monoubiquitinated Rab5 on recycling/degradation is now discussed in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>(Discussion) âIn this study, we found that monoubiquitination of Rab5 had an inhibitory effect on the regulatory cycle of Rab5. However, we did not find a stimulus signal or E3 ligase(s) responsible for monoubiquitination of Rab5. As result, only a small portion of Rab5 could be ubiquitinated when ubiquitin was overexpressed. These results suggest that ubiquitination of Rab5 occurs rarely in cells under basal conditions and might the reason why the ubiquitination of Rab GTPases has not been studied until recently (de la Vega et al., 2011). Despite the small population of monoubiquitinated Rab5, the effects of monoubiquitination of Rab5 were strong. We observed dramatic failure of localization of Rab5 to the endosome and EGFR degradation pathway. This suggests that monoubiquitination of Rab5 is tightly regulated in the cell through specific E3 ligase or DUB enzymes. It will be of great interest to determine how monoubiquitination of Rab5 is regulated in cells.â</p><p>The confusions for describing localization of Rab5 upon ubiquitin transfection is now clarified as follows:</p><p>(Subsection âMonoubiquitination of K140 and K165 of Rab5 plays a negative role in the endocytic pathwayâ) âWe observed that the monoubiquitinated Rab5 was predominantly localized in the membrane fraction.

Since K134 was previously reported as an ubiquitination site by prot<italic>EOM</italic>ic studies, it is likely that K134 may be polyubiquitinated, although we have no direct evidence for it. Polyubiquitination of K134 would destabilize the structural integrity of Rab5, ultimately leading to its degradation. We have commented about this concern as follows:</p><p>(Subsection âRab5 undergoes monoubiquitination at multiple sitesâ) âNo monoubiquitinated Rab5 band was detected for the 11KR mutant in the ubiquitination assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), suggesting that K33 and K134 are not responsible for monoubiquitination of Rab5. Considering that K134 was previously reported to be ubiquitinated by prot<italic>EOM</italic>ic studies (Chen, Zhou, et al., 2014, Wagner et al., 2011, Wagner et al., 2012), it is plausible that K134 may undergo polyubiquitination. Given the crucial role of K134 in the structural integrity of Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>), we hypothesized that ubiquitination of K134 might be related to disruption/degradation of Rab5, thereby preventing us from observing ubiquitination of K134 in the current experimental conditions.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors introduce the immunofluorescence of Rab5 endosomes and justify the use of HeLa cells in subsection âMonoubiquitination on K140 and K165 of Rab5 plays negative roles in endocytic pathwayâ, but results from these experiments had already been shown in subsection âRab5 undergoes monoubiquitination at multiple sitesâ without explanation of what Rab5 puncta are or what cell line was used.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised our manuscript guided by the reviewerâs suggestion as follows:</p><p>(Subsection âRab5 undergoes monoubiquitination at multiple sitesâ) âSubsequently, we generated an 11KR mutant with intact K33 and K134 and examined its function by observing Rab5âpositive endosome puncta in HeLa cells to visualize Rab5âpositive endosomes more efficiently (Miaczynska et al., 2004, Borg et al., 2014, Kajiho et al., 2003).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>, UbRab5 does not appear as a double band as in other blots, why is this?</p></disp-quote><p>Different percentage of gel was used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C</xref> (10% gel for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, 12% gel for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C</xref>) since we already confirmed that both double bands are responsible for monoubiquitinated Rab5.

Since the data will be released after acceptance on publication, you can only access them through the link below.</p><p>mUbRab5<sub>K116</sub>: https://www.sasbdb.org/data/SASDCM6/tkmwsdjl7l/</p><p>mUbRab5<sub>K140</sub>: https://www.sasbdb.org/data/SASDCN6/0ec25yspdo/</p><p>mUbRab5<sub>K165</sub>: https://www.sasbdb.org/data/SASDCP6/7wnrjfzgyv</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>No details are provided regarding the EOM modeling. For example, how many residues we're allowed to be flexible and what criteria where to determine which residues show be flexible? Do the results change if additional residues are allowed to be flexible? A narrow selected distribution near the high R<sub>g</sub> and D<sub>max</sub> tails of the pools in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> suggest that the number of flexible residues used to generate the pool might not be adequate to represent the flexibility in solution. Also unclear is how the linkage between Rab5 and ubiquitin is modeled. Does the EOM model disulfide linkages? If not, how was the linkage modeled? The details of the modeling are important and how they affect the results needs to be evaluated and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We added details for <italic>EOM</italic> analysis in the revised manuscript as described below. We believe that the preparation steps of input files for ubiquitinated proteins in <italic>EOM</italic> analysis are key steps, and it will be very useful to other scientists who wish to apply <italic>EOM</italic> to similar cases. The detailed description for <italic>EOM</italic> analysis is now described as follows:</p><p>(Subsection âStructural models of mUbRab5s derived by solution scatteringâ) â<italic>EOM</italic> was originally designed for multiâdomain proteins with a flexible linker. Input files for <italic>EOM</italic> are a single linear protein sequence covering entire protein, atomic coordinates for each domain, and SAXS data (Tria et al., 2015). Because ubiquitinated proteins are not single polypeptides but branched ones, we generated the sequences and atomic coordinates of mUbRab5s as described in the Materials and methods. A pool of 10,000 independent models was generated based on the sequence and structural information from SAXS curve by <italic>RANCH</italic> (embedded in <italic>EOM, ATSAS</italic> package). Then, a genetic algorithm for the selection of an ensemble was performed by <italic>GAJOE</italic> with 100 times (embedded in <italic>EOM, ATSAS</italic> package). Finally, the best ensemble matched with the SAXS curve with lowest Ï<sup>2</sup> was selected.&quot;</p><p>(Subsection âSmall angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurement and data processingâ) âSince <italic>EOM</italic> accepted only single polypeptide chain with multiple domains, we generated the sequences and atomic coordinates of the mUbRab5s in the following four steps. [â¦] Finally, we used the native isopeptide linkage for ensemble model calculations in <italic>EOM</italic> since a disulfide bond linkage is known to resemble the native ubiquitination linkage (Baker, Lewis, et al., 2013).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Interestingly, none of the EOMâderived structural models for mUbRab5s implicates any direct interaction between ubiquitin and Rab5&quot; (subsection âStructural models of mUbRab5s derived by solution scatteringâ). Is EOM capable of producing models with direct interactions? Even if it could, what would it mean at the low resolution of SAXS?</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the sentence as follows:</p><p>(SubsectionâStructural models of mUbRab5s derived by solution scatteringâ) âSimilar to the molecular dynamics simulation of mUbRas (Baker, Lewis, et al., 2013), none of the ubiquitin molecules from the <italic>EOM</italic> models were located proximal to Rab5.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>: KratkyâDebye and PorodâDebye plots indicate how extended a molecule is. Flexibility is inferred. Presumably the same results would be obtained from the calculated EOM curves that fit the data. The question is whether the SAXS data can distinguish flexible vs. extended. The interpretation should be more nuanced.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer commented, it is very important to characterize a sample when performing SAXS experiments. Since any kinds of SAXS curve could be used for obtaining ab initio or ensemble model, one should be extremely careful in preparing the sample and initial data assessment. If the sample is homogenous and rigid, SAXS curve can be used for ab initio modeling. In contrast, if the sample is homogenous and flexible, ensemble analysis should be chosen for the method of choice. Judgement of flexibility of the sample is really important in the initial data assessment. From a SAXS curve, we can analyze whether the protein is folded or unfolded (extended) through traditional Kratky analysis (s vs. s<sup>2</sup>*I(s)). However, it was challenging to analysis of flexible versus unfolded protein using traditional Kratky analysis. Rambo and Tainer described a new analysis, called PorodâDebye law (s<sup>4</sup> vs. s<sup>4</sup>*I(s)), for obtaining information of flexibility of a protein from a SAXS curve (Rambo &amp; Tainer, 2011). Briefly, PorodâDebye plot can distinguish discrete conformational change (apo vs holo form of a protein with a substrate) and flexibility of the protein, while traditional Kratky analysis cannot. To obtain this information, one should take a look whether there is a plateau in PorodâDebye plot. If there is a plateau, it implies that the protein is compact or rigid, while loss of plateau reflects flexibility of the protein. The graphical explanation for this analysis is also wellâpresented in a website (http://www.bioisis.net/tutorial/12). In addition the PorodâDebye law has another advantage over Kratky analysis. While Kratky analysis requires relatively high angle data (0.01 &lt; s &lt; 0.3 Ã<sup>â1</sup>), the PorodâDebye analysis can be done with similar low angular range as Guinier region. To make it easier for a reader to understand, we inserted the interpretation of flexibility analysis in our revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>(Subsection âStructural models of mUbRab5s derived by solution scatteringâ) âTo check whether the ubiquitin moieties of Rab5 are flexible, we performed flexibility analysis using the PorodâDebye method (Rambo &amp; Tainer, 2011). SAXS curves from the three mUbRab5s did not have a plateau in the PorodâDebye plot, implying that all of the mUbRab5s were flexible in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
