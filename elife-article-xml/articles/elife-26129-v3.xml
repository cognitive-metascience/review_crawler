Homozygous <italic>TP53</italic> deletion occurs in various types of human cancers for which no therapeutic strategies have yet been reported. TCGA database analysis shows that the <italic>TP53</italic> homozygous deletion locus mostly exhibits co-deletion of the neighboring gene <italic>FXR2,</italic> which belongs to the Fragile X gene family. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of the remaining family member FXR1 selectively blocks cell proliferation in human cancer cells containing homozygous deletion of both <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>FXR2</italic> in a collateral lethality manner. Mechanistically, in addition to its RNA-binding function, FXR1 recruits transcription factor STAT1 or STAT3 to gene promoters at the chromatin interface and regulates transcription thus, at least partially, mediating cell proliferation.

For example, they produce proteins known as tumor suppressors, which sense if a cell shows early signs of cancer and instruct the cell to die. A gene known as <italic>TP53</italic> produces one of the most important tumor suppressor proteins, and this gene is inactive or missing in many types of human cancer.</p><p>Treating cancers that have completely lost the <italic>TP53</italic> gene is particularly difficult. One way to develop new treatments for these conditions would be to target other proteins that these cancers need to survive; but these proteins first need to be identified.</p><p>Fan et al. have now identified one such protein in human cancer cells lacking <italic>TP53</italic>. Searching databases of DNA sequences from human cancer cells revealed that those without the <italic>TP53</italic> gene often also lose a neighboring gene called <italic>FXR2</italic>. Cancer cells survive without <italic>FXR2</italic> because a similar gene, called <italic>FXR1</italic>, can compensate. Fan et al. therefore decided to experimentally lower the activity of the <italic>FXR1</italic> gene and, as expected, cancer cells without <italic>TP53 and FXR2</italic> stopped growing. Normal cells, on the other hand, were unaffected by the deletion of the <italic>FXR1</italic> gene since <italic>FXR2</italic> is still there. This phenomenon, in which cancer cells become vulnerable after the loss of certain genes but only because they have already lost important tumor suppressors, is called “collateral lethality”. Further experiments showed that the protein encoded by <italic>FXR1</italic> coordinates with other proteins to activate genes that contribute to cell growth.</p><p>These findings suggest new ways to treat human cancers that have lost <italic>TP53</italic>. For example, if scientists can find small molecules that inhibit the protein encoded by <italic>FXR1</italic> and show that these molecules can block the growth of tumors lacking <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>FXR2</italic>, this could eventually lead to a new anticancer drug. However, like any new drug, these small molecule inhibitors would also need to be extensively tested before they could be taken into human clinical trials.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FXR1</kwd><kwd>p53 deletion</kwd><kwd>collateral lethality</kwd><kwd>fragile X family</kwd><kwd>STAT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004336</institution-id><institution>Novartis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004336</institution-id><institution>Novartis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoc program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Yichao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors declare that there was no funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional and mechanistic analyses of cancer cells containing homozygous deletion of <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>FXR2</italic> reveal that inhibition of FXR1 blocks cell proliferation in a collateral lethality manner, opening an avenue to develop therapies targeting such cancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>p53, a critical tumor suppressor, primarily serves as a transcription factor to control various cellular stress-response signaling pathways, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vousden and Lane, 2007</xref>). Loss of p53 function through mutation or deletion of its encoding <italic>TP53</italic> is a common feature in a majority of human cancers, resulting in the escape from tumor-suppressor activities. Numerous strategies have been explored to reverse dysregulated p53 suppressor function, including stabilizing p53 expression by antagonizing the p53–MDM2 interaction in cancers harboring normal <italic>TP53</italic> copy number, and restoring p53's tumor suppressor activity in <italic>TP53-</italic>mutated cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khoo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Soragni et al., 2016</xref>). In cancer, tumor suppressor genes are often inactivated by genomic deletions that encompass the deletion of neighboring genes. Such bystander genes often belong to multigene families; therefore, their deletion is tolerated due to genetic redundancy. The newly proposed ‘collateral lethality’ concept suggests that such passenger deletion predisposes cancer cells to vulnerabilities that are induced by further inhibition of the remaining genes in the family, whose functions are essential and redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muller et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nijhawan et al., 2012</xref>). This concept therefore opens the avenue to anti-cancer drug development targeting cancers containing co-deletion of tumor suppressor genes and neighboring genes without affecting wild-type cells. Drugging <italic>TP53-</italic>deleted cancers had been a challenging task until a recent report demonstrated inhibition of a neighboring gene <italic>POLR2A,</italic> which is located about 200 kb downstream of <italic>TP53</italic> on chromosome 17 and undergoes heterozygous deletion in colorectal cancers containing <italic>TP53</italic> heterozygous deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Homozygous deletion, resulting in inactivation of both alleles, occurs less frequently and is more focal than heterozygous deletion. There is no documented therapeutic strategy targeting homozygous <italic>TP53-</italic>deleted cancers. <italic>POLR2A</italic> is co-deleted in a majority of tumors with <italic>TP53</italic> homozygous deletion, and thus its inhibition would not be relevant. <italic>FXR2</italic> (Fragile X-related Protein 2, also known as FXR2P), located 100 kb downstream of <italic>TP53</italic>, is also a neighboring gene of <italic>TP53</italic> at chromosome 17p13.1. It belongs to the fragile X gene family that has essential functions in binding and regulating mRNA stability, transportation and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siomi et al., 1996</xref>). In this study, we investigated whether <italic>FXR2</italic> passenger deletion at the <italic>TP53</italic> homozygous deletion locus would result in subsequent cancer-specific vulnerability to inhibition of its family member, FXR1 (Fragile X-related Protein 1, also known as FXR1P).</p><p>The fragile X gene family contains three mammalian members, including fragile X mental retardation protein FMR1 (also called as FMRP) and its structural homologs FXR1 and FXR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Siomi et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">1995</xref>). These proteins are highly conserved in many species and share a high degree of sequence similarity in major functional domains, including tandem Tudor, KH and RGG box domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kirkpatrick et al., 2001</xref>). They all participate in RNA-binding, regulation of mRNA metabolism, ribosome-binding, and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siomi et al., 1996</xref>). These proteins contain nuclear localization and nuclear export signals which allow them to be shuttled between cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eberhart et al., 1996</xref>). FMR1, which is highly expressed in neurons, plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and its silencing results in Fragile X Syndrome, an inherited intellectual disability and the major cause of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Consortium, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Santoro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verkerk et al., 1991</xref>). FXR1 is ubiquitously expressed and has potential roles in cardiac and skeletal muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huot et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mientjes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van't Padje et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Whitman et al., 2011</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that FXR1 and FXR2 possess both common and distinct functions in post-transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavallaro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darnell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Say et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). FXR1 copy number was amplified and demonstrated oncogenic activity in lung squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Comtesse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qian et al., 2015</xref>). A recent study suggested that FXR1 downregulates p21 by binding and reducing its mRNA stability and/or by modulating p53 expression to avoid senescence in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Majumder et al., 2016</xref>). At the N-terminus, all three members of the FMR1 family contain a tandem Tudor domain belonging to the Royal family of chromatin-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams-Cioaba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Myrick et al., 2015</xref>). The tandem Tudor domain in FMR1 was reported to recognize methylated lysine on histones at the chromatin interface, thus resulting in the protein's subsequent localization to the DNA damage loci, thereby facilitating the repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams-Cioaba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alpatov et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the function of FXR1 in cancer and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive.</p><p>From an analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) databases, we observed that <italic>FXR2</italic> undergoes concomitant homozygous deletion in combination with <italic>TP53</italic> homozygous deletion in a significant proportion of human cancers. Our data show that FXR1 inhibition blocks cell growth in <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>FXR2</italic> co-deletion cell lines, but not in copy number normal or single deletion cell lines. The results were further confirmed in CRISPR-Cas9-generated <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>FXR2</italic> knockout cell clones. Through a comprehensive analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS) and ChIP coupling with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), we uncovered the molecular mechanism through which FXR1 regulates cell proliferation. FXR1 is located in the gene promoter region together with histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), and recruits transcription factor STAT1 or STAT3 at gene promoters to facilitate transcription regulation. In an agreement with a role in the FXR1-assocaited mechanism, inhibition of STAT1 or STAT3 target genes can also reduce cell proliferation. Taken together, our findings not only demonstrate the possibility of inhibiting FXR1 in <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>FXR2</italic> homozygous co-deletion cancers as a potential treatment option, but also reveal the novel role of FXR1 in gene transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>FXR1</italic> knockdown inhibits cell proliferation in <italic>TP53/FXR2</italic> co-deletion cancers</title><p>Copy number data in various human tumors published in TCGA database (access through cBioPortal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org">http://www.cbioportal.org</ext-link>; accessed 18 Aug 2016) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2013</xref>) show that homozygous <italic>TP53</italic> genomic deletion occurs in various human cancers, at frequencies ranging from 1% to 15% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). One of the neighboring genes, <italic>FXR2</italic>, located around 100 kb downstream of <italic>TP53</italic> at chromosome 17p13.1, undergoes concomitant deletion in most tumors carrying <italic>TP53</italic> homozygous deletion with only a few exceptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Consistently, in the CCLE database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>), the majority of cancer cell lines carrying <italic>TP53</italic> homozygous deletion also contain <italic>FXR2</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, <italic>FXR2</italic> single deletion is rarely observed in human tumors. In <italic>TP53/FXR2</italic> co-deletion tumors, the copy number of <italic>FXR1</italic> and <italic>FMR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) is largely unaltered. Of note, <italic>FXR1</italic> or <italic>FMR1</italic> copy number gain was also observed in tumors, although this wasmutually exclusive with <italic>TP53</italic>/<italic>FXR2</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The recent discovery of the collateral lethality concept prompted us to hypothesize that concomitant deletion of passenger <italic>FXR2</italic> in <italic>TP53-</italic>deleted cancer cells might make cell growth dependent on FXR1. We therefore tested whether TP53/<italic>FXR2</italic> co-deletion renders cancer cells sensitive to FXR1 inhibition. We selected four cancer cell lines harboring co-deletion of <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>FXR2</italic>: KATOIII, HL-60, H358, and KMS-11, as well as four cell lines harboring the normal copy number of <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>FXR2:</italic> MKN45, AGS, HepG2, and A549. The mRNA and protein level of p53, FXR2, FXR1 and FMR1 were assessed using q-RT-PCR and Western Blot (WB), respectively. Our data showed that cancer cells with homozygous co-deletion of <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>FXR2</italic> exhibit either absent or significantly lower mRNA and protein levels of p53 and FXR2. By contrast, the copy-number-normal and co-deleted cell lines have comparable FXR1 and FMR1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We selected shRNA 2 and 3 (FXR1-sh2, FXR1-sh3), which showed profound knockdown efficiency for the following studies. Consistently, FXR1 inhibition only suppressed cell proliferation in the cell lines with <italic>TP53/FXR2</italic> co-deletion (H358, HL-60, KATOIII and KMS-11) but not in the copy-number-normal cells (AGS, A549, MKN45 and HepG2), as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and also in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. Furthermore, we used cell imaging and Matrigel assays to confirm FXR1-knockdown-induced anti-proliferative effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). To determine whether the observed cell growth reduction is attributed to FXR1 inhibition, we rescued FXR1 expression by ectopic expression of shRNA-resistant FXR1 (harboring mutations on the shRNA-targeting sequence, FXR1m) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). In multiple cancer cell lines, the growth rate was recovered to a level comparable to that of the control, indicating that FXR1 inhibition was responsible for the growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, Figure 3B). Consistent with the FXR1m data, expression of FXR2 also rescued the anti-proliferative phenotype induced by FXR1 inhibition, suggesting that FXR2 and FXR1 have redundant functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, ectopic expression of FXR2 only showed partial rescue compared with FXR1m, suggesting that the proteins may also have some distinct functions. Interestingly, FMR1 did not rescue FXR1 knockdown-induced anti-proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

To investigate whether <italic>TP53/FXR2</italic> co-deletion is essential in determining cells’ sensitivity to FXR1 inhibition, we monitored cell growth rate upon FXR1 downregulation in cell lines carrying homozygous deletion of either <italic>TP53</italic> (H1299, L540, MG-63, SKOV3) or <italic>FXR2</italic> (Hep3B) alone. The levels of p53, FXR2 and FXR1 were confirmed by q-RT-PCR and WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the tested cell lines, the proliferation rate was unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that concomitant deletion of <italic>FXR2</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic> is necessary for triggering FXR1 inhibition-induced cell lethality. The role of FXR1 in controlling cell proliferation in <italic>TP53/FXR2</italic> co-deleted cancer cells was further confirmed in an <italic>in vivo</italic> xenograft. Dox-induced FXR1 downregulation significantly reduced tumor growth in the <italic>TP53/FXR2</italic> co-deleted cell line HL-60-derived xenograft model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), but had no impact on growth in the copy-number-normal cell A549-derived xenograft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the above observations, we engineered the copy-number-normal cell line AGS that is suitable for use with CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)/Cas9 to generate the isogenic homozygous <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>FXR2</italic> double knockout (DKO) cell clone, a <italic>TP53</italic> single KO (<italic>TP53</italic> KO) cell clone, and a <italic>FXR2</italic> single KO (<italic>FXR2</italic> KO) cell clone. The knockout strategy is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. Both the mRNA and the protein levels of p53 and FXR2 in the individual knockout clones were determined by WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and q-RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Consistent with the phenotypes observed in cancer cell lines, shRNA-induced FXR1 downregulation significantly inhibited cell proliferation only in the <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>FXR2</italic> double knockout clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and had no effect on the <italic>TP53</italic> single KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) or <italic>FXR2</italic> single KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) clones. The FXR1-inhibition-induced anti-proliferative activity observed in <italic>TP53/FXR2</italic> double knockout cells was confirmed in the Matrigel assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Resistance to FXR1 inhibition in both <italic>FXR2</italic> single knockout clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and the <italic>FXR2</italic> homozygous deletion cell line Hep3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) suggested that p53 deficiency is required for FXR1 to function in regulating cell proliferation. We downregulated p53 using RNAi in <italic>FXR2</italic> KO cells that stably expressed FXR1 shRNA to further investigate the necessity for p53 deficiency in FXR1’s function in proliferation control. In line with its tumor suppressor function, <italic>TP53</italic> knockdown by siRNA enhanced cell growth in the tested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

We used the histone methyl lysine analog (MLA) protein pulldown assay to examine whether histones are bound to the FXR1’s tandem Tudor domain.

The enrichment analysis using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) clustered the potential FXR1-interacting proteins according to their function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Proteins involved in mRNA binding, stability, splicing/metabolism, transportation, and translation were most enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), consistent with the known function of FXR1.

Next, we confirmed the protein interactions using ChIP followed by WB (ChIP-WB). In agreement with our DAVID enrichment analysis, FXR1 interacted with multiple proteins that are involved in chromatin and transcriptional signaling, including the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3, the chromatin regulator CHD4, SNF2H, histone H2B and H3K4me3, and DNA topoisomerase TOP2A in H358 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Data from H358 cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. Using ChIP-PCR, we further investigated whether FXR1 directly occupies the promoter of these target genes. On the basis of the ChIP-seq peak position, we designed and selected two PCR primer pairs against each target gene’s promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>) to capture FXR1’s localization in the ChIP-PCR assay. The promoter regions of the target gene were detected in the FXR1 ChIP pull-down complex, indicating that FXR1 is located at the target gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, shCtrl/Dox- and FXR1-sh3/Dox-). Dox treatment did not reduce FXR1’s occupancy in the shRNA control cells (shCtrl/Dox+, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), but it evicted FXR1 from the gene promoter in FXR1-shRNA-expressing H358 cells (FXR1-sh3/Dox+, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), confirming the specificity of the FXR1 ChIP assay. Using the same approach, STAT1 or STAT3 were located in the vicinity of FXR1 at the target gene promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). More interestingly, FXR1 knockdown resulted in STAT1 and STAT3 eviction from the gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting that FXR1 is required to recruit or stabilize STAT1 and STAT3 at gene promoters. On the other hand, STAT3 did not affect FXR1’s occupancy of sites at gene promoters because its knockdown had no effect on the localization of FXR1 at promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm the redundant function shared between FXR1 and FXR2 as well as to investigate the interaction between FXR1/2 and STAT1/3, we conducted FXR1, FXR2, STAT1, STAT3, and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq in AGS cells. The data indicated that the four proteins were enriched at TSS regions in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). FXR1 peak-associated genes had 89.95% (2935/3263 FXR1-peak-associated genes) overlap with FXR2 peak-associated genes in AGS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), and this percentage increased when we focused on TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), suggesting a shared function of FXR1 and FXR2 at gene promoters. Only a small percentage of FXR2 binding-site-associated or peak-associated genes overlapped with those similarly associated with FXR1 in AGS cells. The difference is probably due to the weaker capability of the FXR1 ChIP antibody in pull down assay when compared to the FXR2 ChIP antibody, as reflected by the difference in the peak-associated gene numbers for FXR1 and FXR2 (3263 and 15,346), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). There was also significant overlapbetween FXR1-associated genes and STAT1/3-associated genes, suggesting at least partially, that FXR1 mediates STAT1/3 transcriptional activity in AGS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The ChIP-seq peaks at the promoter region of the representative gene <italic>ARID1A</italic> in AGS cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C</xref>. Our ChIP-PCR results revealed a similar localization pattern for FXR2 as for FXR1, with both proteins occupying the promoters of target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> upper panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Furthermore, the expression levels of target genes remained constant after FXR2 knockdown except for a slight inhibition of <italic>CASC4</italic> and <italic>TRAPPC9 </italic>expression, further confirming the redundant function shared by FXR1 and FXR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, lower panel). Taken together, our data confirm that FXR1 is required to recruit or stabilize STATs on gene promoters, thus facilitating FXR1’s transcriptional activity, and also show that FXR1 and FXR2 share similar function.</p><p>Our study showed that only a small portion of STAT1/3 peaks in the genome (0.7–1.57%) overlap with FXR1 peaks, indicating that FXR1 cooperates with STAT1/3 in a small number of STAT target genes’ transcription in H358 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). By contrast, 24.38–25.74% of FXR1 peaks overlap with STAT1 and STAT3 peaks, suggesting a significant role for STATs in FXR1’s transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). As STAT1 and STAT3 participate in FXR1 transcriptional activity, we hypothesized that a JAK inhibitor could repress FXR1 target gene expression. Indeed, we found that the JAK inhibitor S-Ruxolitinib suppressed STAT1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the expression of some but not all FXR1 target genes in H358 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Note that JAK inhibitor didn’t suppress FXR1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). These data confirm the involvement of STAT in FXR1’s transcriptional activity.</p><p>We performed RNA-seq to analyze gene expression in H358 cells with biological triplicates. We selected FXR1-knockdown-induced gene expression changes using fold change log<sub>2</sub> &gt;0.6 as the cutoff (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Among the seven FXR1 target genes identified by ChIP-seq, five showed significant downregulation upon FXR1 knockdown. The remaining two genes showed moderate downregulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Among the genes whose promoters are occupied by FXR1, 45 out of 210 genes showed regulation upon FXR1 knockdown in RNA-seq assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). RNA-seq revealed significantly more genes regulated by FXR1 than ChIP-seq. The discrepancy may be attribute primarily to the fact that FXR1 is a well-known mRNA-binding protein, regulating RNA metabolism and stability in addition to the newly discovered function in transcription regulation revealed in this study. Therefore, FXR1 knockdown could impact on both populations of genes, those regulated by FXR1’s transcriptional activity and those regulated by FXR1’s RNA-binding function. In addition, the scope and limitation of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq could also contribute to the discrepancy.</p><p>In order to assess whether target genes mediate FXR1’s function in proliferation regulation, we utilized siRNAs to knockdown target genes and monitored the change in cell proliferation. The knockdown efficiency of the target genes by siRNAs was assessed using q-RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Among the seven target genes, knockdown of <italic>GLI1</italic> showed the most consistent anti-proliferative effect whereas <italic>ARID1A</italic>, <italic>CITED1</italic>, or <italic>SSBP2</italic> knockdown showed less inhibitory effect in a 7-day proliferation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We further evaluated the combinatorial effect on cell proliferation of downregulation of both FXR1 and its target genes. We performed combinatorial partial knockdowns of both FXR1 and its target genes by applying lower concentration of siRNA (5 nM) and shortening Dox treatment duration (to 4 days). As shown in the cell image and MTS detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the combined knockdown of both the target genes and FXR1 showed an additive effect on cell growth inhibition.

In this study, several lines of evidence confirmed the redundant function between FXR1 and FXR2: 1) both FXR1 and FXR2 can rescue FXR1 shRNA-inhibited cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), 2) FXR1 and FXR2 share a significant portion of overlapping binding sites in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B–C</xref>), and 3) knockout of either protein sensitizes <italic>TP53</italic> homozygous deletion-containing cancer cells for the inhibition of the remaining member (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although another family member, FMR1, shares structural and functional similarity with FXR1 and FXR2, our data suggest that FMR1 does not participate in the regulation of proliferation or in rescuing the FXR1 inhibition in the tested cell models. <italic>TP53</italic> homozygous deletion is observed in 1–15% of human tumors, the majority of which have <italic>FXR2</italic> homozygous deletions according to the TCGA database. This study therefore opens the avenue to the development of FXR1-based targeted therapies to treat <italic>TP53</italic> homozygous deletion cancers, in which there is a significant unmet medical need.</p><p>Interestingly, we have found that <italic>TP53</italic> deletion is required for cancer cells to respond to FXR1 inhibition. This was confirmed in our engineered <italic>FXR2</italic> single knockout cell clones which were only sensitive to FXR1 knockdown when p53 was downregulated. However, the mechanism of action remains elusive. There have been reports suggesting that p53 deficiency promotes the activation of JAK/STAT signaling, which may lead to cellular dependency on FXR1 because it regulates the localization of STAT1/3 at gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spehlmann et al., 2013</xref>). Considering that FXR1 can both suppress p53 to escape senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Majumder et al., 2016</xref>) and activate gene transcription (evidence from this study), p53 deletion may augment FXR1’s role in transcription regulation in controlling cancer cell proliferation. Given the various critical functions of p53 in governing cellular behavior, its deficiency may create a cell dependency on FXR1 and FXR2 activities. The underlying molecular mechanism requires further investigation. Some studies have explored the oncogenic property of FXR1 in lung cancer with FXR1 overexpression or amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Comtesse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qian et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>FXR1</italic> copy number gain occurs in some types of cancers, particularly in lung squamous carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Comtesse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qian et al., 2015</xref>) and its occurrence is mutually exclusive with <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>FXR2</italic> homozygous deletion according to TCGA database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Together with our study, this evidence suggests that FXR1 controls tumor growth in cancers with either <italic>TP53</italic>/<italic>FXR2</italic> homozygous deletion or <italic>FXR1</italic> amplification.</p><p>Furthermore, we reveal a novel function of FXR1 in transcriptional regulation and elucidate its molecular mechanism in regulating cell proliferation, in addition to its well-established role in mRNA binding. Our ChIP-MS study revealed that FXR1 interacts with chromatin regulators and transcription factors. In addition, about a half of FXR1’s peaks in the ChIP-seq assay co-localize with H3K4me3 peaks at gene promoters, suggesting a new role for FXR1 in facilitating active transcription. FXR1 interacts with and recruits or stabilizes STAT1 or STAT3 at the target gene promoters, suggesting that cooperation with STATs is required for its transcriptional activity. Indeed, the inhibitor of the STAT upstream kinase JAK suppressed some of FXR1’s target genes expression. Reciprocally, FXR1 is required for the localization of STATs on its target gene promoters. Generally, it is believed that JAK-catalyzed STAT1/3 phosphorylation drives their shuttling to the nucleus and localization at gene promoters in order to regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levy and Darnell, 2002</xref>). Our findings advance the current views about the regulation of transcription by STAT1/3 by revealing the necessity for FXR1 in regulating STAT occupancy at promoters. STAT is well established in regulating cytokine gene transcription. We have also observed that FXR1 knockdown inhibited the expression of multiple cytokines (data not shown), consistent with a recent report of FXR1 function in positively regulating cytokine expression in monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le Tonqueze et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, only about 0.7–1.57% of the STAT1/3 peaks overlap with FXR1 peaks in our ChIP-seq study, suggesting that FXR1 only participates in the transcription of a very small fraction of JAK-STAT target genes. Although JAK inhibition suppressed the expression of some FXR1 target genes, it had no effect on inhibiting cancer cell proliferation in FXR1 shRNA-sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). This is in line with the fact that JAK-STAT signaling pathway governs a much broader spectrum of gene expression and cellular behaviors. It w worth investigating whether other epigenetic regulators are involved in STAT transcriptional activity. Among the FXR1 peaks, approximately 25% overlapped with STAT peaks according to our study in H358 cells. FXR1 may also cooperate with other transcription factors in regulating transcription; examples include BTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2014</xref>) which was also identified in an FXR1 protein complex in our ChIP-MS study. In addition, we identified several other FXR1-interacting proteins that have essential function in transcription regulation, including TOP2A/2B, GTF2A, and FACT80. Further investigations are needed to dissect the underlying mechanism of FXR1 in transcription regulation.</p><p>FXR1 is an RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA stability, transportation of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and translation through its functional KH domains and RGG box. Our ChIP-MS data confirmed the established role of FXR1, which binds to and regulates mRNA processing and translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed ChIP-MS findings and discovered that FXR1 binds to the mRNA of target genes such as<italic> CASC4</italic>, <italic>TRAPPC9</italic>, <italic>GLI1</italic>, and <italic>SSBP2</italic> in the mRNA binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Our study confirmed that, in addition to its direct function in transcription, FXR1 binds to some but not all of its target gene mRNAs, which may contribute to its role in proliferation regulation. This raises the possibility that FXR1 has dynamic functions in transcription and subsequent mRNA processing.</p><p>The newly discovered N-terminal tandem Tudor domain has a high degree of similarity among the three Tudor family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams-Cioaba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Myrick et al., 2015</xref>). The Tudor domain in FMR1 was reported to bind to multiple methylated lysine at histone H3 and to participate in DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alpatov et al., 2014</xref>). Our study shows that the tandem Tudor in FXR1 binds to methylated lysine in histone H3 in a similar manner as that in FMR1 and it is required for FXR1’s function in regulating cancer cell proliferation. Further investigation is needed to study the amino acid residues and the structure of the aromatic cage within the FXR1 tandem Tudor domain that are responsible for histone binding, which might provide the foundation for development of Tudor domain inhibitors. The observation that FXR1 knockout mice die shortly after birth and knockdown of FXR1 causes abnormalities in striated muscle and heart in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mientjes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zarnescu and Gregorio, 2013</xref>) raise potential safety concerns with regard to inhibiting FXR1 in cancer patients. However, the inducible FXR1 knockout in adult mice didn’t display the lethal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34"> Mientjes et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting the potential of FXR1 as a drugging target. Overall, this study provides an important approach to targeting human cancers with <italic>TP53</italic> homozygous deletions. The novel function of FXR1 in transcription advances our knowledge regarding FXR1’s function in gene expression on top of its known roles in mRNA processing and translation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>TCGA and CCLE data analysis</title><p>Copy-number analysis in human tumor tissues was performed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org/cross_cancer.do">http://www.cbioportal.org/cross_cancer.do</ext-link>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2013</xref>).

FXR1 binding genomic regions (called ChIP-seq peaks) were identified by the Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) algorithm using the default p-value cutoff of 1 × e<sup>−5</sup>. The distribution of FXR1 ChIP-seq peaks were investigated by the annotations on the human genome. The peaks were binned into eight groups according to the positions relative to annotated genes: 5’ Distal (up to 100 kb upstream TSS), 5’ Proximal (up to 10 kb upstream TSS), 5’ TSS (5 kb upstream TSS to 1 kb downstream TSS), Intragenic (1 kb downstream TSS to 1 kb upstream TTS), 3’ TTS (1 kb upstream TTS to 5 kb downstream TTS), 3’ Proximal (up to 10 kb downstream TTS), 3’ Distal (up to 100 kb downstream TTS), and the remaining sequence defined as Intergenic region. The aggregation signals of FXR1, H3K4me3, STAT1, and STAT3 at genebody (TSS to TTS) plus upstream and downstream 5 kb region were extracted and plotted using in-house perl and MATLAB code. A hub for the UCSC genome browser was constructed in order to investigate the detailed information of the peaks. The summit positions of the FXR1 ChIP-seq peaks were extended to 100 bp both upstream and downstream as input region for HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) to call known and de novo motifs. The overlap between ChIP-seq peaks was determined by 1 bp overlap of two peaks that were extended by 500 bp both upstream and downstream. The TSS associated genes in each ChIP-seq were determined by overlapping peaks to refseq genes coordinates. Venn diagrams were generated using online web tool VENNY 2.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html">http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html</ext-link>).

After washing with 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (Sigma Aldrich) for 10 mins, the gel pieces were digested with trypsin solution (0.01 g/L trypsin in 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>) (Promega) at 37°C for 12 hr. The digested peptides were extracted using 300 μl of 50% ACN-0.1% FA. The extracted solution was collected and concentrated with SpeedVac. The samples were resolved with 0.1% FA and analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS (Thermofisher). MS/MS was performed in a data-dependent mode in which the top 10 most abundant ions (S/N &gt; 30) for each MS scan were selected for MS/MS analysis by HCD. Parameters used during searching included enzyme, trypsin; missed cleavages, One; dynamic modifications, oxidation (M); static modifications, Carbamidomethyl (C); precursor mass tolerance, 10 ppm; fragment mass tolerance, 0.1 Da.

RNA isolation was performed using Trizol and RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit from cells. Following extraction, RNA quantity was assessed using Nanodrop and the integrity of total RNA using the RNA 6000 Nano Kit on an Aligent 2100 Bioanalyzer. An RNA library was constructed using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit. The first step in the workflow involved purifying the poly-A containing mRNA molecules using oligo-dT-attached magnetic beads. Following purification, mRNA was fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature. The cleaved RNA fragments were copied into first-strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. Second-strand cDNA synthesis followed, using DNA PolymeraseI and RNase H. The cDNA fragments then went through an end repair process, involving the addition of a single ‘A’ base, and then ligation of the adapters. The products were then purified and enriched with PCR to create the final cDNA library. The clusters of the cDNA library were generated on HiSeq X HD PE flow cell. Then the clusters were sequenced on a HiSeq X system. RNA-seq data quality was analyzed using FastQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews, 2010</xref>). Reads in the fastq files were trimmed by five base pairs at the 5´-end, and then mapped to the reference human genome (HG19) with the algorithm STAR using default parameters.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Irwin Davidson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Pierre Massion (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study reports that FXR1 plays an essential role in the proliferation of tumour cells bearing a homozygous double TRP53-FXR2 deletion. The paper shows that knockdown of FXR1 in cells with the double deletion arrests their proliferation. The authors go onto show that FRX1 binds to a small number of promoters and facilitates the recruitment of STAT1 that activates their expression and that some of these target genes are essential for the proliferation of the TRP53-FXR2 deleted cells. The reviewers found that the data are novel and move the field forward, strengthening the evidence for targeting FXR1 in cancers where TRP53 and FXR2 are deleted.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The additional experiments that should be provided concern two main points. The relationship between FXR1 and FXR2 function and secondly the crosstalk between FXR1 and STAT1/3 that is not properly established. The reviewers are aware that these may take more than two months to complete, but they will be required.</p><p>Cells with a double TRP53/FXR2 double deletion are dependent on FXR1. The authors should use CRISPR/Cas9 to make a TRP53/FXR1 double deletion and show that the resulting cells are now FXR2 dependent. This would strengthen the idea that FXR1 and FXR2 fulfill at least partially redundant and essential functions. For example, the authors show that depletion of FXR2 reduces expression of the FXR1 target gene CASC4 in cells where FXR1 is normally expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). This result rather suggests that FXR1 cannot compensate for FXR2 depletion at this gene and that there would appear to be no redundancy between FXR1 and FXR2 at least for expression of this gene.</p><p>Along the same lines: the authors performed FXR1 ChIP-seq and they performed FXR2 ChIP-qPCR. As they have a ChIP-grade FXR2 antibody, they should perform FXR2 ChIP-seq to determine the overlap in genomic binding and function of FXR1 and FXR2.</p><p>According to the ChIP-seq experiments FXR1 has only a limited number of binding sites around half of which were also marked by H3K4me3. What about the sites that showed no H3K4Me3, what do these sites correspond to, promoters of repressed genes? Also, as only 37-49% of FXR1 sites correspond to STAT-binding sites, what do the others correspond to? The authors should perform motif enrichment analyses (like for example MEME ChIP) to identify other transcription factors that may be enriched at these sites. Also without performing STAT1/3 ChIP-seq how can the authors be sure that there is no STAT protein present at these sites in these cells? More importantly, the authors state that only a small subset of STAT sites is co-occupied by FXR1. The relationship between FXR1 and the STATs is therefore not clear and the factors that dictate FXR1 genomic binding remain unknown. There are perhaps other factors that recruit FXR1, that may or may not have been detected by mass-spectrometry. A more thorough bioinformatic analyses of the FXR1 binding sites is required. Otherwise one could argue that FXR1 acts as a cofactor for a transcription factor, other than STAT1/3, present at almost all target genes.</p><p>In relation to this, there is some inconsistency between the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>/B. Treatment of H358 cells with the JAK1 inhibitor at 1 µM completely blocks GLI1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) and knocking down GLI1 partly inhibits cell growth. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, incubating the cells with the JAK1 inhibitor does not affect cell proliferation. Does this mean that STAT1/3 activity is not needed for the proliferation of these cells? Also, does suppression of STAT1/3 affect FXR1 expression?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>: The authors state: 'some FXR1 target genes are inhibited by the JAK1 inhibitor'. Are these the genes in which both STAT1/3 and FXR1 can be found on the promoter? Is, for example, FXR1 binding to the SSBP2 promoter but not STAT1/3? Or why is expression of SSBP2 not down-regulated by S-Ruxolitinib?</p><p>Some of these issues could be clarified by performing RNA-seq to get an idea of the overall effects of FXR1 silencing on gene expression. Are there a small number of affected genes perhaps in line with the small number of occupied sites? Or alternatively, FXR1 silencing may have widespread effects on gene expression that go well beyond the small number of affected genes investigated. If so how could this be explained?</p><p>According to IARC database (http://p53.iarc.fr/CellLines.aspx), and the literature (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2155427), Hep3B should be a p53-null cell line. Can the authors comment on this and have they verified the identity of the Hep3B cells they used?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26129.056</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>The additional experiments that should be provided concern two main points.

To further strengthen the redundant function shared between FXR1 and FXR2, we generated AGS <italic>TP53/FXR1</italic> double knockout (DKO) cells using CRISPR-Cas9, and stably expressed FXR2 shRNA-2 or FXR2 shRNA-3 in these DKO cells. We observed that knockdown of FXR2 upon Dox induction suppressed proliferation in these cells (added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), confirming the redundant function shared between FXR1 and FXR2. Such redundancy was also observed in previous study of FXR1 knockdown-induced anti-proliferation effect in <italic>TP53/FXR2</italic> DKO cells.</p><p>As pointed out by the reviewer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, FXR2 knockdown (KD) partially inhibited the expression of target gene <italic>CASC4</italic> in AGS cells where FXR1 was normally expressed.

This suggested that FXR1 in AGS cells compensated for FXR2 KD at least partially on regulating the target genes transcription.

The data indicated that the four proteins were enriched at TSS region in the genome (added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). 89.95% (2935/3263 FXR1 peak-associated genes) FXR1 peak-associated genes overlap with FXR2-occupied genes in AGS cells (added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), and the percentage increased when we focused at TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>) suggesting a shared function of FXR1 and FXR2 at gene promoters. However, only a small percentage of FXR2 binding site or peak genes overlap with FXR1’s in AGS cells. The gap is likely due to the weaker capability of FXR1 ChIP antibody in pull down assay comparing to FXR2 ChIP antibody which is reflected by the difference in in peak-associated gene numbers of FXR1 and FXR2 (3,263 and 15,346), respectively in AGS ChIP-seq study (added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). However, this doesn’t change the conclusion that FXR1 binding sites largely overlap with FXR2 sites.</p><p>Furthermore, we examined FXR1 and FXR2 co-localization at promoters of target genes by ChIP-PCR (added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). We observed overlapped binding of FXR1, FXR2, STAT1, and STAT3 at promoters of seven target genes in AGS cells (added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, evidences supporting redundant function shared between FXR1 and FXR2 in this study include: 1) both FXR1 and FXR2 can rescue FXR1 shRNA-inhibited cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), 2) They share a significant portion of overlapping binding sites in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H-J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), 3) Knockout of either one sensitizes TP53 homozygous deletion-containing cancer cells for the inhibition of the remaining member(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Their redundancy is also supported by previous reports from other labs that FXR1 and FXR2 have common function in mRNA binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>According to the ChIP-seq experiments FXR1 has only a limited number of binding sites around half of which were also marked by H3K4me3. What about the sites that showed no H3K4Me3, what do these sites correspond to, promoters of repressed genes? Also, as only 37-49% of FXR1 sites correspond to STAT-binding sites, what do the others correspond to? The authors should perform motif enrichment analyses (like for example MEME ChIP) to identify other transcription factors that may be enriched at these sites. Also without performing STAT1/3 ChIP-seq how can the authors be sure that there is no STAT protein present at these sites in these cells? More importantly, the authors state that only a small subset of STAT sites is co-occupied by FXR1. The relationship between FXR1 and the STATs is therefore not clear and the factors that dictate FXR1 genomic binding remain unknown. There are perhaps other factors that recruit FXR1, that may or may not have been detected by mass-spectrometry. A more thorough bioinformatic analyses of the FXR1 binding sites is required. Otherwise one could argue that FXR1 acts as a cofactor for a transcription factor, other than STAT1/3, present at almost all target genes.</p> </disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point that only about half of FXR1 binding sites overlapped with H3K4me3. We found that the majority of the overlapped peaks located at TSS region (added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We analyzed FXR1 sites with no H3K4me3 localization and revealed that these sites more correspond to 5’ distal, intergenic, and 3’ distal region (added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). From the Go analysis results, we found that while the FXR1-H3K4me3 overlapped genes function in multiple pathways, there is no significant pathway clustering result for the non-overlapped genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p>Upon the reviewer’s comment on our conclusion regarding FXR1 and STAT relationship, we conducted STAT1 and STAT3 ChIP-seq in the same H358 cells to re-evaluate FXR1 and STAT genomic binding instead of using STAT ChIP-seq database as in the original manuscript. Our ChIP-seq results are in an agreement with our previous results obtained from Encode database. STAT1 and STAT3 showed sporadic binding in the genome of H358 cells. In the same cells, about 24.38% (215 in 882) and 25.74% (227 in 882) of FXR1 binding sites overlap with STAT1 and STAT3 binding, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Especially at TSS, 64.65-65.66% of FXR1 peaks overlap with STAT binding suggesting that FXR1 mainly engage in STAT1/3 in transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Overall, a total of 493 peak-associated genes were identified for FXR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Among them, 319 and 373 peak-associated genes overlapped with STAT1 and STAT3 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Overall, a total of 493 FXR1 peak-associated genes were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

At TSS, a total of 210 peak-associated genes were identified for FXR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Among them, 145, 147 and 200 peak-associated genes overlapped with STAT1, STAT3 and H3K4me3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). More analyses of FXR1 and STAT relationship in H358 cells were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Further, the majority of the FXR1-STATs overlapped peaks located at TSS region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We also found that FXR1 sites with no STAT binding more correspond to 5’ distal, intragenic, and 3’ distal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">supplementary file 3</xref>). Motif analysis identified STAT-binding motif in FXR1- and STAT-shared binding sites (added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). And, the no STAT binding sites contain GATAs and other binding motif (added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>ChIP-MS and follow-up assays revealed a novel function of FXR1, mediating transcription by interacting with transcription factor STAT1/3. We conducted more studies to determine FXR1’s role in regulating STAT binding at gene promoters in H358 cells. Consistent with the observation in the original manuscript, knockdown of FXR1 inhibited the binding of FXR1, STAT1, and STAT3 at the promoter regions of all seven target genes in ChIP-PCR study (revised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Our data suggested that FXR1 participates in STAT1/3 transcription likely by recruiting or stabilizing STAT to the promoter of genes. In regions where co-localization of FXR1 and STAT was not observed, FXR1 may interact with other transcription factor(s) such as GATAs indicated from the binding motif analysis (added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We cannot rule out the possibility that our ChIP-seq didn’t capture all binding sites of FXR1 and STAT due to the assay limitations. In our ChIP-MS study, another transcription factor BTF (BCl<sup>-</sup>2-associated transcription factor 1) was revealed in FXR1 protein complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Further investigation is needed to determine whether FXR1 interacts with BTF to regulate transcription at gene promoters. It is also possible that our ChIP-MS study missed other transcription factor(s) that interacts with FXR1 at non STAT binding sites in regulating transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In relation to this, there is some inconsistency between the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>/B. Treatment of H358 cells with the JAK1 inhibitor at 1 µM completely blocks GLI1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) and knocking down GLI1 partly inhibits cell growth. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, incubating the cells with the JAK1 inhibitor does not affect cell proliferation. Does this mean that STAT1/3 activity is not needed for the proliferation of these cells? Also, does suppression of STAT1/3 affect FXR1 expression?</p> </disp-quote><p>Our ChIP-seq results revealed that STAT1/3 have 15639 or 28739 binding sites cross the genome in H358 cells, suggesting that STATs regulate the expression of a spectrum of genes.

GLI1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation suggesting that the cells are dependent on FXR1-GLI1 signaling. JAK inhibitor didn’t block cell proliferation in the same cells suggesting that the cells are not dependent on JAK-STAT signaling for cell growth. While GLI1 expression was inhibited, JAK inhibitor could impact on many genes whose function in regulating cell growth in the tested cells are not investigated. The different effects of JAK inhibitor or GLI1 siRNA on cell proliferation do not necessarily suggest inconsistency, rather it indicates the complexity of JAK-STAT signaling in regulating cell growth.

Are these the genes in which both STAT1/3 and FXR1 can be found on the promoter? Is, for example, FXR1 binding to the SSBP2 promoter but not STAT1/3?

Are there a small number of affected genes perhaps in line with the small number of occupied sites? Or alternatively, FXR1 silencing may have widespread effects on gene expression that go well beyond the small number of affected genes investigated.

Among the 7 FXR1 target genes identified by ChIP-seq, 5 showed significant downregulation upon FXR1 knockdown in H358 cells (added in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). The remaining two genes (<italic>SSBP2</italic> and <italic>NPAS3</italic>) showed moderate downregulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).

RNA-Seq revealed significantly more genes regulated by FXR1 than the number of genes revealed by ChIP-seq. The discrepancy may primarily attribute to the fact that FXR1 is a well-known mRNA-binding protein regulating RNA metabolism and stability in addition to the newly discovered function in transcription regulation in this study. Therefore, FXR1 knockdown could impact on both populations of genes that regulated by FXR1’s transcriptional activity and RNA-binding function. In addition, the scope and limitation of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq could also contribute to the discrepancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>According to IARC database (http://p53.iarc.fr/CellLines.aspx), and the literature (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2155427), Hep3B should be a p53-null cell line.
