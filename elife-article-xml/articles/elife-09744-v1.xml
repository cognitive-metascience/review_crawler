of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). We report that delamanid (OPC-67683), an approved drug for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, is a potent inhibitor of <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> both in vitro and in vivo. Twice-daily oral dosing of delamanid at 30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for 5 days resulted in sterile cures in a mouse model of VL. Treatment with lower doses revealed a U-shaped (hormetic) dose-response curve with greater parasite suppression at 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> than at 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (5 or 10 day dosing). Dosing delamanid for 10 days confirmed the hormetic dose-response and improved the efficacy at all doses investigated. Mechanistic studies reveal that delamanid is rapidly metabolised by parasites via an enzyme, distinct from the nitroreductase that activates fexinidazole. Delamanid has the potential to be repurposed as a much-needed oral therapy for VL.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09744.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09744.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09744.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Better, safer, oral drugs are desperately needed for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis, a parasitic infectious disease that causes an estimated 40,000 deaths a year, predominantly in South America, East Africa and the Indian subcontinent. The parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis is transmitted between individuals by blood-sucking sandflies, and there are currently no vaccines that protect against the disease. In addition, all currently available drug treatments have serious limitations – they are expensive, toxic, have to be applied over a long period of time (mainly by injection) and may become ineffective as the parasites adapt to resist the drug.</p><p>A cost-effective way to find a new treatment for a disease is to repurpose existing clinically approved drugs that are used to treat other diseases. Patterson, Wyllie et al. now report that a drug called delamanid, which was recently approved for the treatment of tuberculosis, can cure visceral leishmaniasis in mice. The drug worked when applied orally at doses that might be achievable in human patients, and can also kill parasites obtained from human patients.</p><p>Patterson, Wyllie et al. also provide evidence that suggests that delamanid is processed in the parasites by an unknown enzyme. However, this enzyme is not the one that activates a different class of drugs that are used to treat visceral leishmaniasis. Future studies now need to identify the enzyme that is targeted by delamanid, and could investigate combinations of drugs that slow the emergence of resistant parasites and improve delamanid’s safety and effectiveness. Clinical trials are required to test how well delamanid treats visceral leishmaniasis in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09744.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09744.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Leishmania donovani</kwd><kwd>Visceral leishmaniasis</kwd><kwd>drug repurposing</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>pharmacodynamics</kwd><kwd>OPC-67683</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>079838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fairlamb</surname><given-names>Alan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>092340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fairlamb</surname><given-names>Alan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biological and pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the anti-tubercular drug, delamanid, could be repurposed for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The repurposing of drugs and clinical candidates offers an attractive alternative to de novo drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischbach and Walsh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cragg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peters, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Law et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Novac, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aube, 2012</xref>), particularly in terms of reducing research and development costs for neglected diseases of poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews et al., 2014</xref>). Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a neglected tropical disease resulting from infection with the protozoan parasites <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> or <italic>L. infantum</italic> is a case in point, with the two anti-leishmanial front-line therapies miltefosine and amphotericin B both originally developed for other indications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stuart et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the anti-trypanosomal clinical candidate fexinidazole was recently discovered to have potent activity in a murine VL model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wyllie et al., 2012</xref>), resulting in a phase II proof of concept clinical trial (NCT01980199) against VL being conducted in Sudan.</p><p>There are approximately 50,000 reported cases of VL per year, with the vast majority of infections in South America, East Africa and the Indian subcontinent. However, the number of cases is likely to be vastly underreported, with the actual annual incidence estimated to be between 200,000 and 400,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvar et al., 2012</xref>). VL is fatal if untreated and, in the absence of effective vaccines and vector control methods, efficacious chemotherapy is required to combat the disease. Each of the currently available drugs has one or more drawbacks, including the need for hospitalization, prolonged therapy, parenteral administration, high cost, variable efficacy, severe toxic side-effects and resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Croft et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, there is an urgent need for better, safer efficacious drugs that are fit-for-purpose in resource-poor settings.</p><p>Given the success of repurposing fexinidazole for use in the treatment of VL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wyllie et al., 2012</xref>), there is now a renewed interest in the anti-parasitic potential of nitroaromatic drugs. Recently, we demonstrated that the anti-tubercular clinical candidate (<italic>S</italic>)-PA-824 possesses moderate activity against <italic>L. donovani</italic> parasites both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>). Although (<italic>R</italic>)-PA-824, the enantiomer of the candidate showed superior activity, this compound has not entered pre-clinical development, precluding a rapid move to a VL clinical trial. In addition, a recently reported screen of anti-tubercular nitroimidazoles against <italic>L. donovani</italic> identified DNDI-VL-2098 as a suitable compound for further preclinical evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mukkavilli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>).

Parameters such as C<sub>max</sub>/MIC, AUC/MIC and T<sub>&gt;MIC</sub> are important for achieving drug efficacy in an in vivo model of disease.

To address this issue, the concentration of delamanid was determined by UPLC-MS/MS in cultures of promastigotes over a 24 hr period. Delamanid is known to be primarily metabolised in plasma by albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shimokawa et al., 2015</xref>) and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4, CYP1A1, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sasahara et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the concentration of delamanid in culture medium without parasites was measured over the same time period as a control. In the presence of medium alone, delamanid decreased linearly in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, in the presence of <italic>L. donovani</italic> promastigotes the rate of disappearance of delamanid was markedly increased, such that the drug had essentially disappeared by 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The net amount of delamanid metabolised by parasites as a function of time is also linear and dependent on the initial concentration in the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Linear regression of these data revealed that the rate of cell metabolism is not saturated up to the top concentration tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Analogous experiments using mouse peritoneal macrophages and THP-1 monocytes found no evidence of delamanid metabolism by these host cell lines.

Delamanid is rapidly leishmanicidal with a cell-density dependent potency and as expected, demonstrated no observable toxicity in a mammalian cell assay. The observed shift in drug sensitivity with increasing serum concentration is likely due to increased metabolism by albumin to inactive metabolites, rather than changes in free drug concentration due to protein binding.</p><p>Delamanid is orally bioavailable, well tolerated, shows dose linearity up to 10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and accumulation with repeated administration in agreement with previous pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matsumoto et al., 2006</xref>). However, the pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship is not straightforward.</p><p>First, the PK/PD relationship does not fit with the free drug hypothesis, which states that, in the absence of energy-dependent transport processes, the extracellular and intracellular free drug concentrations are equal after steady-state equilibrium has been achieved, and that only the free drug is able to bind to the target to exert its pharmacological effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohnert and Gan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). Based on the in vitro intra–macrophage amastigote EC<sub>90</sub> value (120 ng ml<sup>-1</sup>), the high PPB of delamanid (F<sub>u</sub> 0.0045) results in an adjusted intra macrophage <italic>L. donovani</italic> EC<sub>90</sub> of 26,700 ng ml<sup>-1</sup>, a concentration that is not achieved in whole blood at any point in the efficacy study. Therefore, the efficacy of delamanid in the VL animal model is unexpected. However, there are exceptions to the free drug theory, such as drugs that form active metabolites resulting in inactivation (covalent or otherwise) of multiple targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). The parasite-specific metabolism presented here is entirely consistent with this exception.</p><p>Second, the pronounced bi-phasic suppression of parasite burden at high and low doses of delamanid in vivo is highly unusual. This U-shaped dose-response curve is reminiscent of hormesis in toxicology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2002</xref>), but, to our knowledge, is unprecedented in microbiology. This effect is not observed in dose response curves in vitro, so must be related to a physiological or metabolic threshold response in the infected drug-treated animal. In vivo delamanid is proposed to undergo primary metabolism with loss of the nitro group, mainly catalysed by albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shimokawa et al., 2015</xref>). Further metabolism to seven other metabolites is thought to occur via hydrolysis reactions and oxidation by CYP3A4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sasahara et al., 2015</xref>). The cause of this U-shaped dose-response curve is currently not known. One possibility is that a drug metabolite of delamanid antagonises the bio-activation of delamanid, or antagonises the downstream effects in the leishmania parasite. The formation of a putative antagonist metabolite would have to show a saturable sigmoidal dose response, such that at higher concentrations, delamanid, or an active parasite-specific metabolite thereof, are able to displace the antagonist from the bio-activating enzyme, or proteins related to the downstream effect respectively. It should be noted that in the same VL animal model the related nitroimidazole (<italic>S</italic>)-PA-824 was also more efficacious at a lower dose (30 vs 100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>). Further studies with (<italic>S</italic>)-PA-824 should be conducted to determine if this compound also displays a hormetic PK/PD relationship and establish if this is a chemotype-related characteristic.</p><p>Plots of C<sub>max</sub> versus parasite suppression and calculated AUC<sub>(0–24 hr)</sub> versus parasite suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) suggest that the delamanid blood levels required for cure in the VL model exceed those observed in TB patients receiving the drug. Increasing the dosing duration in the in vivo VL model from 5 to 10 days improved the mean parasite suppression at all investigated doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and resulted in some mice with no detectable liver parasites when dosed at 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). As it known that delamanid is tolerated for up to six months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, 2013</xref>) further extending the duration of the VL model beyond 10 days should be considered. The VL target product profile calls for a treatment regimen of &lt;10 days. However, in the current VL therapy, miltefosine is dosed orally for 28 days, so extended dosing should be clinically acceptable. Note, the study mice dosed twice-daily at 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> have drug levels lower than that achieved in human TB patients dosed once daily at 100 mg. Given that this low dose is more efficacious than any other dose below 30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, model studies of extended duration should focus around this dosing level.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09744.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>PK/PD relationships in mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Mean suppression of parasite burden as a function of C<sub>max</sub> for the penultimate dose (panel <bold>A</bold>) and extrapolated AUC<sub>(0–24 hr)</sub> for the last day of the 10-day treatment regimen (panel <bold>B</bold>).

Indeed, careful examination of parasite suppression versus C<sub>max</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) shows that the mean C<sub>max</sub> in delamanid-treated TB patients corresponds to an efficacy minimum in the VL model. Given that delamanid is rapidly metabolised by leishmania-infected macrophages in vitro, we examined the effect of delamanid with a 5 day exposure with daily drug and medium change. This gave an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 28.0 ± 1.6 nM (slope 2.7) from which an EC<sub>90</sub> could be calculated (62.7 nM or 33.5 ng ml<sup>-1</sup>). This concentration is lower than the lowest observed C<sub>max</sub> in the efficacy studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Thus, careful design of the dosing regimen for VL patients may avoid the risk that treatment will lack efficacy due to reaching a C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>(0–24 hr)</sub> within the higher ineffective concentration range.</p><p>The nature of the parasite-specific metabolising / activating enzyme(s) is not known, but is clearly distinct from the deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manjunatha et al., 2006</xref>) and the nitroreductase in leishmania involved in the activation of fexinidazole metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wyllie et al., 2012</xref>). The identification of this target, and the metabolites that it produces, are the focus of our current work. The cell-density dependent potency of delamanid is consistent with the formation of a putative reactive, covalent metabolite. In addition, the rapidly cytocidal activity of delamanid is consistent with the rapid rate of drug metabolism by <italic>L. donovani</italic> in culture. In terms of drug development the divergent modes of action for fexinidazole and delamanid are advantageous, as the likelihood of cross-resistance developing is reduced, and the potential for their co-administration as a combination therapy is retained.</p><p>The current practice in the pharmaceutical industry is to avoid developing compounds containing a nitro-aromatic group due to the known liabilities of this class, particularly potential mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. As a result, outside the anti-infectives there are relatively few nitro-aromatic drugs. Indeed, nitro-aromatic moieties are relatively common in drugs or clinical candidates for kinetoplastid diseases compared to chemotherapies for other indications. This over-representation is linked to the mechanism of action of nitro-drugs; selective bio-activation by parasitic bacterial-like NTRs leading to selective anti-parasitic activity. The studies presented herein are consistent with delamanid also being activated by a parasite-specific enzyme absent from host cells. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that delamanid is not mutagenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matsumoto et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, repeated oral administration in mice or rats for up to 104 weeks showed no evidence of carcinogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, 2013</xref>). Taken together these points alleviate some of the concerns ordinarily associated with the development of nitro-drugs, although long term safety can only be established after extensive clinical use in relevant populations.</p><p>While revising this manuscript, Thompson and co-workers reported the structure-activity relationships for an extensive series of bicyclic nitro-compounds, including delamanid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>). These authors observed partial efficacy in <italic>L. infantum-</italic>infected hamsters dosed with delamanid, not inconsistent with our findings. The lower efficacy observed by these authors could be due to one or more of the following: inadequate dosing (once versus twice per day); different animal model (hamster versus mouse); or different species of leishmania (<italic>L. infantum</italic> is less sensitive than <italic>L. donovani</italic>). Although this paper found VL-2098 to have superior efficacy in a once daily treatment regimen, pre-clinical development of this compound has been abandoned due to testicular toxicity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dndi.org/diseases-projects/portfolio/completed-projects/vl-2098/">http://www.dndi.org/diseases-projects/portfolio/completed-projects/vl-2098/</ext-link> last accessed 3<sup>rd </sup>April 2016). Importantly, this reproductive toxicity has not been observed with delamanid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Delamanid meets many of the criteria specified in the target product profile (TPP) for VL [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dndi.org">http://www.dndi.org</ext-link>]. It is rapidly cytocidal and thus potentially efficacious in immunocompromised patients such as those co-infected with HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvar et al., 2008</xref>) particularly since delamanid is not associated with any clinically relevant anti-retroviral drug-drug interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ryan and Lo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair and Scott, 2015</xref>). Due to the prevalence of TB-VL coinfection in Ethiopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hurissa et al., 2010</xref>) and Sudan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El-Safi et al., 2004</xref>) the TPP also specifies that any new treatments should be compatible with TB medications, a stipulation met by delamanid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair and Scott, 2015</xref>). Delamanid can be administered orally, an important requirement for patients who have limited access to even the most basic of health care facilities, whereas liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) has to be administered intravenously and requires cold storage for stability. Perhaps the most challenging issue may be cost of goods. Assuming an efficacious dose of 100 mg once-daily for in excess of 10 days and the market cost of delamanid in developed countries (US$42 per 50 mg tablet) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lessem, 2014</xref>), the predicted cost per patient would be over US$840, significantly higher than that specified in the VL TPP (&lt;US$10 or &lt;$80 per course) and predicted to be more expensive than other current treatment strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meheus et al., 2010</xref>). However, differential pricing or financial arrangements may reduce the cost for this neglected disease of poverty. Additional factors also support the development of delamanid as a VL therapy. Importantly, the results presented here demonstrate that delamanid is active against a number of clinically-relevant field isolates. In addition, we are currently investigating the potential of delamanid to be repurposed for Chagas’ disease.</p><p>In summary, these data suggest that delamanid has the potential to be repurposed as a VL therapy. Additional VL animal model studies exploring the effect of extended delamanid dosing beyond 10 days should be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>All leishmania strains follow the WHO International Code designating the animal from which the parasite was isolated, country, date of isolation and strain designation (see International Leishmania Network <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://leishnet.net/site/?q=node/5">http://leishnet.net/site/?q=node/5</ext-link>).

Alfa Aesar (UK), Apollo Scientific (UK), Fisher Chemicals (UK), Tokyo Chemical Industry (UK) and VWR (UK) and were used as received. Air and moisture sensitive reactions were carried out under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using pre-coated TLC plates (layer 0.20 mm silica gel 60 with fluorescent indicator UV254, from Merck, UK). Developed plates were air-dried and analysed under a UV lamp (UV254/365 nm), and/or with chemical stains where appropriate. Flash column chromatography was performed using prepacked silica gel cartridges (230-400 mesh, 35-70 μm, from Teledyne ISCO) using a Teledyne ISCO CombiFlash Rf. <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, <sup>19</sup>F-NMR, and 2D-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DPX 500 spectrometer (<sup>1</sup>H at 500.1 MHz, <sup>13</sup>C at 125.8 MHz, <sup>19</sup>F at 470.5 MHz), or a Bruker Avance III HD (<sup>1</sup>H at 400.1 MHz, <sup>13</sup>C at 100.6 MHz,). Chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in ppm recorded using the residual solvent as the internal reference in all cases. Signal splitting patterns are described as singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), multiplet (m), broad (br), or a combination thereof. Coupling constants (<italic>J</italic>) are quoted to the nearest 0.5 Hz. LC-MS analyses were performed with either an Agilent HPLC 1100 series connected to a Bruker Daltonics MicrOTOF or an Agilent Technologies 1200 series HPLC connected to an Agilent Technologies 6130 quadrupole LC/MS, where both instruments were connected to an Agilent diode array detector. LCMS chromatographic separations were conducted with either a Waters XBridge C18 column, 50 mm × 2.1 mm, 3.5 μm particle size, or Waters XSelect C18 column, 30 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.5 μm particle size; mobile phase, water/acetonitrile +0.1% HCOOH, or water/acetonitrile +0.1% NH<sub>3</sub>. High-resolution electrospray measurements were performed on a Bruker Daltonics MicrOTOF mass spectrometer. Preparative HPLC separations were performed with a Gilson HPLC (321 pumps, 819 injection module, 215 liquid handler/injector) connected to a Gilson 155 UV/vis detector. HPLC chromatographic separations were conducted using a Waters XBridge C18 column, 19 × 100 mm, 5 μm particle size; mobile phase, water/acetonitrile +0.1% NH<sub>3</sub>, or HCOOH. Optical rotation measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer model 343 polarimeter.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s24" sec-type="appendix"><title>Synthesis of delamanid (7)</title><p>Delamanid was synthesised according to published procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

All current therapies have significant liabilities. The authors have adopted a repurposing strategy to screen drugs for other indications for their potential to treat leishmaniasis, and through that approach they identified delamanid as a potential oral treatment. The manuscript addresses pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of delamanid and concludes that it could be a useful therapeutic agent.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers noted the importance of improved treatments for visceral leishmaniasis, appreciated the benefits of a drug-repurposing strategy, and enthused about the potency of delamanid. They also recommended publication with revisions focusing on the following points:</p><p>1) The authors and reviewers are experienced in drug development, but almost all <italic>eLife</italic> readers are not. It would be useful in revising the manuscript to keep this in mind and provide clues to what the various tests are trying to determine. For example, most readers will be unfamiliar with a term like 'area under the curve (AUC)’ in pharmacology, and adding a brief note that it measures the total dose of drug and is useful for comparing different formulations would help enormously. It's a challenge, but a challenge worth addressing. The report as written is informative to a specialist and almost unintelligible to anyone else.</p><p>2) It would be useful to add some clarification about different developmental stages of the parasite: the difference between a promastigote and amastigote, delamanid's efficacy against different stages, possibility of host metabolism of delamanid altering efficacy, and the possibility of different targets for different stages.</p><p>3) The presence of a nitro group, which is common in this field and quite familiar to the authors, should be addressed for the general reader. Why are nitro groups relatively rare in other drugs but (almost) indispensable in drugs for these parasites? What have the authors done to address concerns about the presence of nitro groups? A very informative review is referenced, but again just a few sentences would help.</p><p>4) The hormetic or U-shaped dose response curve is somewhat unusual, and the addition of blood concentration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and 3B</xref> might help. It's also possible that this issue could be left undiscussed as it doesn't seem to have any ready interpretation that would help the reader or provide any insights that would illuminate the main points of the article.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript presents compelling data to support the conclusion that the tuberculosis drug delamanid-can be repurposed as an inhibitor of <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>. The compound is very effective in vitro versus <italic><underline>L. donovani</underline></italic> promastigotes. More importantly it is effective in vivo when given twice daily, orally, at 1 mg per kilogram for 10 days. I am not concerned with the U-shaped dose response curve or issues of drug cost. I agree with the authors that delamanid represents a potential oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis but also conclude that the manuscript would be strengthened by attention to the following points:</p><p>1) The experiments illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4 – 6</xref> were carried out with <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes. Did the authors also determine in vitro activity of the delamanid versus amastigotes within macrophages? Given the efficacy of this drug in the mouse model of infection one would expect efficacy in vitro as well versus intracellular amastigotes. The focus of this proposed experiment should be the effect of drug not against axenic amastigotes, but against amastigotes within macrophages.</p><p>2) Because metabolism of amastigotes differs from that of promastigotes, it would also be important to reevaluate whether the mechanism of action of delamanid is distinct from fexinidazole in amastigotes harvested from macrophages. This is important because the macrophage itself may modify the drug as well as the parasite.</p><p>3) A concern commonly voiced in the pharmaceutical industry with any nitro containing drug is the potential for genotoxicity and carcinogenesis. Was an Ames test carried out on delamanid? While this drug has been approved for use against tuberculosis, its potential for genotoxicity or cancer induction will not really be known until it has been used extensively in different populations &quot;post market&quot;. While the TPP for leishmaniasis dictates a relatively short course of the drug, the length of treatment is only one variable and again, unfortunately, only extensive use clinically will reveal if delamanid is truly safe. The authors should at least comment on this possibility in the Discussion.</p><p>Also in this regard it should be noted that proponents of fexinidazole for the treatment of sleeping sickness have argued that although fexinidazole is positive in the Ames test, it is negative in mammalian genotoxic tests. They also argue that the nitroreductases necessary to produce free radicals from fexinidazole were not present in some bacteria. Nevertheless, one will not be certain that the positive Ames test is of the concern until fexinidazole has been used in several clinical settings. A major concern is the difference in the microbiome between a patient in India, Africa, and Europe. One cannot assume that the absence of an enzyme like a nitroreductase in one microbiome means it will be absent in all. Again this is not a criticism of the current manuscript, but at least a warning or recognition of this potential issue should be stated in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript describes in vitro and in vivo activity against leishmania of a nitroimidazole-containing TB drug that has recently been EMA approved for the treatment of MDR tuberculosis. The most important and exciting finding is that delamanid is 30-50 times more active in vivo than either the current standard of care or one of the most promising clinical candidates for the treatment of VL. The authors have reported on analogs of this class of molecule before, with the rather disappointing finding that the other TB drug candidate in this class (PA-824) had only moderate activity. PA-824 is a chiral molecule with an S configuration on the oxazine ring; the surprising finding was that the opposite stereoisomer (which is not being developed for clinical use) was considerably more active. Additional screening revealed another molecule with similar stereospecificity that was similar to delamanid and the crucial insight in this work was that delamanid, (R)-PA-824, and the screening hit all presented similar stereochemical configurations suggesting delamanid might be potent against VL.</p><p>On balance the work is well done, carefully and thoughtfully presented and convincing that delamanid should be a strong candidate for repurposing for the treatment of VL – which is an extremely important bit of news in this disease.</p><p>There are a couple of things that could be improved upon particularly around the discussion of the &quot;hormetic&quot; dose-response curve which is very confusing and needs to be clarified – specifically I would suggest that they add the blood-concentration curve for the 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>dose to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> and show that this is not due to differences in accumulation rates for the lower dose. This is a really confusing piece of information and it is not clear if they have looked for this effect in vitro at the relevant concentration ranges in vitro to see if this is metabolism by the organism or metabolism by the host (if in fact their explanation of the antagonistic metabolite is correct).</p><p>There have been two (very) recent publications on the in vivo metabolism of delamanid (Shimokawa et al., Drug Metabol Dispos 2015 Aug;43(8)1277-83 and Sasahara et el in the same issue pp 1267-76) that should be cited and discussed. It seems at least plausible that the antagonistic metabolite is the molecule referred to as M1 in those publications that is formed by cleavage of the nitroimidazooxazole. They describe a simple looking procedure for producing M1 from human serum albumin that might allow the authors to more definitively address the plausibility of this pharmacodynamic mechanism.</p><p>My only other complaint is in the subsection “Delamanid – mode of action studies” where they discuss the lack of cross-resistance between fexinidazole resistant LV9 promastigotes and delamanid but state that the data will be published elsewhere. Either show the data or take this out of the Results section. Personally I don't think this is necessary as the lack of hypersensitivity of the NTR overexpressing parasite is already pretty convincing evidence that the drugs act by different mechanisms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09744.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>1) The authors and reviewers are experienced in drug development, but almost all eLife readers are not.

However, we have carried out an additional experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) showing that overexpression of NTR does not affect the efficacy of delamanid against the intra macrophage amastigote. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and Results section “Delamanid – mode of action studies”. Thus NTR is not involved in either stage of the life cycle.</p><p>3) The presence of a nitro group, which is common in this field and quite familiar to the authors, should be addressed for the general reader. Why are nitro groups relatively rare in other drugs but (almost) indispensable in drugs for these parasites?</p><p>There are a number of potential explanations for the “over representation” of nitroaromatic-containing drugs/clinical candidates for kinetoplastid diseases relative to other indications: 1) as for other drugs against these diseases both nifurtimox and benznidazole were developed &gt;40 years ago before there was a general (justifiable) aversion to the development of nitro drugs by the pharma industry; 2) the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative made a strategic decision to investigate the efficacy of nitroaromatic-containing compound collections against kinetoplastid parasites (leading to the development of fexinidazole and DNDI-VL-2098); and 3) the kinetoplastids possess a bacterial-like NTR which activates nitroaromatic prodrugs. Bacterial-like and mammalian-like NTRs have different substrate specificities; therefore, there is the potential for nitro drugs to be <italic>selectively</italic> toxic to parasites over mammalian cells.</p><p>A paragraph discussing this question is included in the Discussion (seventh paragraph).</p><p>What have the authors done to address concerns about the presence of nitro groups? A very informative review is referenced, but again just a few sentences would help.</p><p>We have not conducted any experiments of our own to specifically address concerns relating to the nitro functionality of delamanid. However, reference to the work of Matsumoto et al. is cited in the eighth paragraph of the Discussion, showing that there is no evidence for mutagenicity based on a comprehensive series of bacterial reverse mutation experiments.</p><p>4) The hormetic or U-shaped dose response curve is somewhat unusual, and the addition of blood concentration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and 3B</xref> might help.</p><p>See response to reviewer #3 below.</p><p><italic>It's also possible that this issue could be left undiscussed as it doesn't seem to have any ready interpretation that would help the reader or provide any insights that would illuminate the main points of the article.</italic> Although we do not know why the U-shaped dose response curve is observed, we feel that it is so unusual that it merits some level of discussion, including hypotheses as to why it might occur. Therefore, we propose to leave the discussion as it is. Note, as our additional studies showed some variation in the efficacy at lower delamanid doses we have amended the abstract to reflect that doses of 30 mg/kg (5 days) are curative and those at 1 mg/kg (10 days) on average suppress parasite burden by 79%.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) The experiments illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4 – 6</xref> were carried out with Leishmania promastigotes.

Again this is not a criticism of the current manuscript, but at least a warning or recognition of this potential issue should be stated in the Discussion.</p><p>Text has been inserted into the manuscript to highlight some of the known liabilities of nitro drugs (see above), specifically “although long term safety can only be established after extensive clinical use in relevant populations.”</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>On balance the work is well done, carefully and thoughtfully presented and convincing that delamanid should be a strong candidate for repurposing for the treatment of VL – which is an extremely important bit of news in this disease.</p><p><italic>There are a couple of things that could be improved upon particularly around the discussion of the &quot;hormetic&quot; dose-response curve which is very confusing and needs to be clarified – specifically I would suggest that they add the blood-concentration curve for the 1</italic> mg kg<sup>-1</sup>dose to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> and show that this is not due to differences in accumulation rates for the lower dose.</p><p>The blood concentration data for the 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> b.i.d. 5 day study has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> &amp; B. In addition the delamanid blood concentration data for a new 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> b.i.d. 10 day study has been added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C &amp; D</xref>). This data demonstrates that the U-shaped dose-response curve is not due to non-linear drug accumulation when dosed at 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p>This is a really confusing piece of information and it is not clear if they have looked for this effect in vitro at the relevant concentration ranges in vitro to see if this is metabolism by the organism or metabolism by the host (if in fact their explanation of the antagonistic metabolite is correct).</p><p>We did not perform any specific experiments to look for the hormetic effect in vitro. However, as mentioned in the Discussion, analysis of the EC<sub>50</sub> curves from assaying delamanid against promastigotes and intra macrophage amastigotes showed no hormetic effect at the drug concentration range used in the assays.</p><p>There have been two (very) recent publications on the in vivo metabolism of delamanid (Shimokawa et al., Drug Metabol Dispos 2015 Aug;43(8)1277-83 and Sasahara et el in the same issue pp 1267-76) that should be cited and discussed. It seems at least plausible that the antagonistic metabolite is the molecule referred to as M1 in those publications which is formed by cleavage of the nitroimidazooxazole. They describe a simple looking procedure for producing M1 from human serum albumin that might allow the authors to more definitively address the plausibility of this pharmacodynamic mechanism.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the relevance of these recent publications to this study, and we have included citations to them in the manuscript. As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we do intend to investigate the effect of M1 on the metabolism of delamanid. However, the suggested experiments will probably take some time to complete, and so we intend to report them in an additional publication focussing on the metabolism of delamanid/mechanism of action, rather than be appended to the current manuscript.</p><p>My only other complaint is in the subsection “Delamanid – mode of action studies” where they discuss the lack of cross-resistance between fexinidazole resistant LV9 promastigotes and delamanid but state that the data will be published elsewhere. Either show the data or take this out of the Results section. Personally I don't think this is necessary as the lack of hypersensitivity of the NTR overexpressing parasite is already pretty convincing evidence that the drugs act by different mechanisms.</p><p>The following text has been removed as suggested, “In addition, in studies to be published elsewhere, LV9 promastigotes which had been selected for resistance to fexinidazole retained sensitivity to delamanid (3.24 ± 0.04 and 3.09 ± 0.03 nM for WT and resistant lines, respectively).”</p><p>Other alterations not suggested by the referees, or editor:</p><p>An additional affiliation has been added for some of the authors.</p><p>We have conducted two additional delamanid VL animal model studies since the original submission of this manuscript. The relevant efficacy and DMPK data from these studies has been aggregated with that included originally. This has resulted in small changes to the mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC values throughout, which is reflected by minor alterations to some figures.</p><p>The unusual U-shaped dose response is still visible despite changes in the mean parasite suppression. The only significant finding is that dosing at 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for 10 days is not curative in every instance (n has doubled from 5 to 10 mice) giving a new mean parasite suppression of 79%. Due to this observation, we have removed any writing which states that this dose is curative, and any resultant extrapolation as to what a curative human dose of delamanid might be. For example; 3 sentences have been removed from the Discussion; “However, plots of C<sub>max</sub> versus […] observed in humans”.</p><p>Discussion, tenth paragraph. As we are no longer predicting that once daily 100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> dosing of delamanid will be efficacious, we have amended the treatment cost per patient to be &gt;US$840.</p><p>Our summary statement at the end of the Discussion has been amended to reflect other changes in the Discussion section – see above.</p><p>As a substantial amount of data from six individual animal studies is now included in this manuscript we have produced a spreadsheet which shows detailed efficacy and DMPK data for each individual animal. This is to ensure the transparent communication of this large set of results. This spreadsheet is reported as a supplementary file.</p><p>Whilst this manuscript was under revision a paper describing the in vivo and in vitro activity of delamanid and analogues against <italic>Leishmania spp</italic>. has been published (Thompson et al. J Med Chem 2016). A paragraph has been added (Discussion, ninth paragraph to discuss the relevance of their results in relation to our own.
