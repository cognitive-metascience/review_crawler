is critical for life. The principal mechanism through which this is achieved in mammals is the respiratory chemoreflex whose circuitry is still elusive. A candidate element of this circuitry is the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a collection of neurons at the ventral medullary surface that are activated by increased CO<sub>2</sub> or low pH and project to the respiratory rhythm generator. Here, we use intersectional genetic strategies to lesion the RTN neurons defined by <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Phox2b</italic> expression and to block or activate their synaptic output. Photostimulation of these neurons entrains the respiratory rhythm. Conversely, abrogating expression of Atoh1 or Phox2b or glutamatergic transmission in these cells curtails the phrenic nerve response to low pH in embryonic preparations and abolishes the respiratory chemoreflex in behaving animals. Thus, the RTN neurons expressing <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Phox2b</italic> are a necessary component of the chemoreflex circuitry.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07051.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07051.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07051.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>An adult at rest will typically breathe in and out up to 20 times per minute, inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide in a process that, for the most part, occurs automatically. While we can choose to override this process and exert voluntary control over our breathing, we cannot suppress it indefinitely. Attempting to do so will ultimately trigger a reflex that forces us to start breathing again.</p><p>This reflex is mostly a response to the rise of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the blood, which lowers the pH of the blood. This rise in CO<sub>2</sub> is toxic and triggers an increase in breathing so that the excess CO<sub>2</sub> is exhaled. The majority of the sensors that detect CO<sub>2</sub> are in the brainstem, which is at the junction of the brain and the spinal cord. However, the precise location of these sensors is not clear. Ruffault et al. now argue that the sensors are in a region called the ‘retrotrapezoid nucleus’, and that they can be identified by the presence of two proteins, Atoh1 and Phox2b<italic>.</italic></p><p>In the brains of foetal mice, Ruffault et al. recorded cells in the retrotrapezoid nucleus and found that they fired in a rhythmic pattern, as would be expected for cells that control breathing. Moreover, the firing rate of these cells increased when the pH was lowered.</p><p>Ruffault et al. then created genetically modified mice with mutations in genes for Atoh1 or Phox2b. The retrotrapezoid nucleus was either absent or abnormal in these mutant mice. Moreover, new-born pups with these mutations were not able to increase their breathing when the level of CO<sub>2</sub> in their blood rose.</p><p>These results shed light on the respiratory distress experienced by patients with a rare disorder called congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) that is caused by mutations in Phox2b. More commonly, unstable or irregular breathing is seen in human infants that are born prematurely, and sometimes in infants born at full term. In the light of the new findings by Ruffault et al., it is possible that abnormal development or immaturity of the retrotrapezoid nucleus is the cause.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07051.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07051.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>hindbrain</kwd><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>genetic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-BLAN1410-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunet</surname><given-names>Jean-François</given-names></name><name><surname>Fortin</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-32-BSV5-0011-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fortin</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-54 MEMO LIFE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunet</surname><given-names>Jean-François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR11-IDEX-0001-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunet</surname><given-names>Jean-François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20130326472</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fortin</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20120323709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunet</surname><given-names>Jean-François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The location of neurons responsible for increasing the breathing rate upon detecting elevated levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood has been pinpointed to the retrotrapezoid nucleus in the brainstem.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammals, breathing is the prime homeostatic process that regulates CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure (PCO<sub>2</sub>) in the blood. The respiratory chemoreflex modulates ventilation in response to deviations in arterial or brain PCO<sub>2</sub>, mainly through the detection of changes in pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guyenet et al., 2010</xref>). These changes are sensed by central chemosensors located in the brainstem and by the carotid bodies in the periphery, but most of the CO<sub>2</sub> chemosensory drive to breathe is thought to arise centrally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duffin, 2010</xref>). The nature of the central chemosensors and of the circuits that mediate the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guyenet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huckstepp and Dale, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nattie, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guyenet et al., 2013</xref>). Two sites have been proposed to play a dominant role in the central CO<sub>2</sub> response: serotonergic neurons in the medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teran et al., 2014</xref>) and the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a loose collection of neurons located ventral and immediately caudal to the facial nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goridis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guyenet et al., 2013</xref>). RTN neurons—defined by their location, by the expression of Phox2b and of the vesicular glutamate transporter-2 Vglut2 (also known as Slc17a6) and by the absence of markers for the nearby motor and catecholaminergic neurons—are vigorously activated by increases in CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mulkey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Onimaru et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Neurons with the molecular characteristics of RTN neurons are already present ventral of the facial nucleus in the late embryo. The embryonic RTN neurons, previously termed embryonic parafacial cells, were found to have endogenous bursting properties and to couple with and increase the frequency of the respiratory rhythm generating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>) pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Impairment of RTN development or function correlates with a blunted response to hypercapnia or acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nattie and Li, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takakura et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2014</xref>), and mouse models of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), which phenocopy the blunted or absent chemoreflex of the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weese-Mayer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rossor et al., 2014</xref>), have an atrophic RTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dubreuil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>). However, the part played by the RTN in the respiratory chemoreflex is still highly debated, and the fraction of the CO<sub>2</sub> response that is relayed through RTN neurons is undetermined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guyenet, 2014</xref>). In a recent study, mutants with a damaged RTN displayed a normal CO2/pH sensitivity at embryonic stages in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To resolve the issue of the requirement for RTN neurons in the respiratory chemoreflex, we selectively impaired RTN development or function using intersectional genetic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dymecki et al., 2010</xref>) and assessed the functional consequences at pre- and post-natal stages. To target the Phox2b-expressing RTN neurons with utmost specificity, we exploited the fact that the majority of them belongs to the small set of neurons that co-express the Phox2b and Atoh1 transcription factors in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rose et al., 2009b</xref>).

Optogenetic activation of these cells entrained ongoing respiratory rhythm. Together our findings imply that the RTN neurons that express or have expressed <italic>Phox2b</italic> and <italic>Atoh1</italic> are essential for the activation of breathing by increased CO<sub>2</sub> or low pH, and that other contributors to the chemoreflex must act via the RTN or in partnership with it.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Photoactivation of the embryonic RTN entrains the respiratory motor output</title><p>We first verified the ability of embryonic RTN neurons to entrain the respiratory-like motor output using channelrhodopsin-based optogenetics. The Phox2b<sup>+</sup> RTN neurons are glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bochorishvili et al., 2012</xref>) and express the glutamate transporter <italic>Vglut2</italic> already at embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>). We could thus use expression of the channelrhodopsin-2-YFP (ChR2-YFP) fusion protein driven by the <italic>Vglut2</italic> promoter in <italic>Vglut2::ChR2-YFP</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hägglund et al., 2010</xref>) to stimulate embryonic RTN neurons by light. In the transgenic embryos, cells co-expressing ChR2-YFP and Phox2b were concentrated at the medullary surface ventral to the ChR2-YFP-negative facial neurons, thus well accessible to light delivered from the ventral surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). At embryonic-day 14.5 (E14.5), single light pulses (473 nm, 70 ms, 1–5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) applied to the RTN region in brainstem preparations systematically evoked a burst of action potentials in ChR2-YFP expressing cells (n = 5) that resembled the spontaneous rhythmic bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A latency of 192 ± 12 ms (n = 51 stimulations in three cells) was measured from the time of onset of the light stimulus to that of the first action potential of the burst response suggesting the requirement of a still unknown, slow obligatory process for burst initiation in the RTN. 1 day later, when the preBötC is coupled to the RTN oscillator and drives a respiratory-like motor outflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>), single light pulses (473 nm, 150 ms, 1–5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) delivered to the medullary surface triggered motor bursts in the C4 phrenic nerve roots (hereafter C4). When the light pulses were set to activate the RTN in a rhythmic manner at about twice the frequency of the ongoing endogenous rhythm, the C4 motor bursts could be entrained to the stimuli and followed the light-imposed rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). C4 motor bursts could not be evoked when the preBötC excitability was depressed by the μ-opiate agonist D-Ala<sup>2</sup>-<italic>N</italic>-Me-Phe<sup>4</sup>-Glycol<sup>5</sup>-enkephalin (DAMGO, 0.3 μM, n = 4 preparations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mellen et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) or its development impaired genetically in <italic>Dbx1</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>) (n = 5 preparations) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) indicating that the motor outputs require an intact preBötC. These data suggest that malfunction of the RTN will result in lack of entrainment of the preBötC and thus of the motor output and in a slowed-down C4 activity.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07051.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of photostimulating Vglut2::Chr2-expressing embryonic retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) neurons on membrane potential and motor output.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of a ventral view of the hindbrain showing the position of nVII (dotted line), RTN (red outline), the preBötC and the C4 phrenic nerve roots.

Single light pulses of 150 ms duration, delivered to the RTN region in E15.5 brainstem-spinal cord preparations at a fixed delay of 4 s after a spontaneous C4 burst, triggered a motor burst response in C4 and facial neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) in around 70% of the cases (130 out of 188 stimulations from 4 preparations). The parameters of spontaneous and evoked bursts measured on 150 spontaneous and 123 evoked C4 bursts, respectively, were not significantly different (spontaneous vs evoked: amplitude: 201 ± 152 arbitrary units (a.u.) vs 183 ± 117 a.u., p = 0.08; time to peak: 228 ± 17 ms vs 242 ± 14 ms, p = 0.53; half-width: 450 ± 21 ms vs 442 ± 17 ms, p = 0.76; decay time: 510 ± 25 ms vs 519 ± 22 ms, p = 0.79). The latency of the C4 response and its variability (666 ± 20 ms for 123 photostimulations), which cannot be easily explained by the time required for polysynaptic propagation of activity, probably reflect the delays caused by processes necessary for burst intitiation in the RTN (192 ± 12 ms, see above) and in the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kam et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><bold><italic>on</italic></bold></sup><italic>/Atoh1</italic><sup><bold><italic>on</italic></bold></sup> subset of RTN neurons is able to entrain phrenic nerve activity and thus inspiration as previously reported in adult rats of neurons in the RTN region defined by <italic>Phox2b</italic> expression alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abbott et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2011</xref>). In the latter experiments, activation of breathing could not be unambiguously traced back to RTN neurons classically defined as non-catecholaminergic and non-cholinergic, since as many nearby catecholaminergic as non-catecholaminergic and some cholinergic neurons also expressed ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2011</xref>). These results are consistent with our data obtained in reduced preparations. Together, they show that the RTN regulates inspiration, not only expiration as postulated by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</xref>). In fact, opinions vary regarding the role of Phox2b-expressing RTN neurons in active expiration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al. (2011)</xref> found that activation of Phox2b<sup>+</sup> cells in the RTN region also triggered active expiration and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marina et al.

By contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pagliardini et al. (2011)</xref> reported that photostimulation of cells expressing ChR2 from a pan-neuronal promoter in the RTN region generated mainly active expiration with little effect on inspiration. These authors attributed the effect seen in their experiments to neurons that did not express Phox2b and are thus not targeted by our approach. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tupal et al.

We found that periV neurons are not essential to CO<sub>2</sub> chemosensitivity. To show this, we compared phrenic nerve activity in a standard brainstem-spinal cord preparation with one from which the pons and thus periV cells have been removed by sectioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). At E16.5, in baseline conditions, sectioning accelerated C4 discharges by suppressing the inhibitory influence on the respiratory rhythm generator (RRG) exerted by pontine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ito et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hilaire et al., 2004</xref>). However, the response to a pH challenge was fully preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>) (p = 0.1, n = 34). Hence, at least in vitro, periV neurons do not seem to contribute to the CO<sub>2</sub>/pH response.

It has, however, proved difficult to pinpoint the contribution of individual classes of neurons to defined behaviors. One example is the RTN. The RTN neurons have been implicated in breathing regulation by CO<sub>2</sub>, but their importance for the respiratory chemoreflex in the intact brain remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huckstepp and Dale, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nattie, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guyenet et al., 2013</xref>). Here we reexamined this issue using novel genetic backgrounds inspired by prior evidence that RTN neurons express and require the Phox2b and Atoh1 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rose et al., 2009b</xref>). We first established that the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><bold><italic>on</italic></bold></sup><italic>/Atoh1</italic><sup><bold><italic>on</italic></bold></sup> subset of RTN neurons are (i) rhythmically active, (ii) are activated by low pH, and (iii) both necessary and sufficient for optogenetic entrainment of the phrenic nerve. These neurons thus have the functional signatures of RTN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abbott et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>). We then show that an <italic>Atoh1</italic> constitutive null mutation and three conditional mutations specifically targeting <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><bold><italic>on</italic></bold></sup><italic>/Atoh1</italic><sup><bold><italic>on</italic></bold></sup> neurons and disrupting RTN formation or function abolish the CO<sub>2</sub>-evoked ventilatory response in neonates. Finally, we provide evidence that periV neurons, the only other group of neurons targeted by the conditional mutations, are not involved in the chemoreflex. We conclude that the neurons in the RTN region that have a history of both <italic>Phox2b</italic> and <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression are obligatory elements of the circuitry for breathing regulation by CO<sub>2</sub> in neonates.</p><p>While our phlethymosgraphic data in adults is in line with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al. (2012)</xref>, our in vitro data on embryos contrasts with theirs and we find a lack of chemoreflex at birth. Using a distinct Phox2b::Cre line to delete Atoh1 in Phox2b lineage cells, Huang et al. reported a slowed down basal respiratory rhythm, a hallmark of RTN impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>), but a fully preserved response to acidification in brainstem-spinal cord preparations at late gestation. They did not test the chemoreflex in behaving pups, but it is only in the latter that we find a complete abrogation of the reflex. A possible explanation is that in vitro the RTN precursors misrouted to the dorsal site of the facial nucleus in the conditional <italic>Atoh1</italic> mutants are able to mount a motor response to bath acidification whose magnitude may depend on the precise experimental conditions. In support of this, we found that the ectopic dorsal cells in the mutants respond to low pH by accelerating their firing rate.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that the blunted CO<sub>2</sub> response at later postnatal stages in <italic>P2b::CreBAC1;Atoh1</italic><sup><italic>lox/lox</italic></sup> mice is a recovery from an absent chemoreflex at birth. We found a very similar recovery of the chemoreflex in adult <italic>Egr2</italic><sup><italic>Cre/+</italic></sup><italic>;Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>27Alacki/+</italic></sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>). The partial recovery of the CO<sub>2</sub> response in adults could be due to late compensation by residual RTN neurons, to a strengthening of peripheral chemoreceptor input that bypasses the RTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basting et al., 2015</xref>) or to some of the multiple sites proposed to function as CO<sub>2</sub> sensors in the brain which would now also bypass the RTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nattie and Li, 2009</xref>). The lack of the chemoreflex in many human CCHS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Straus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weese-Mayer et al., 2010</xref>) suggests that these putative compensatory sites also have a history of <italic>Phox2b</italic> expression.</p><p>Our findings are compatible with two explanations for the loss of the chemoreflex: the Phox2b<sup>+</sup>/<italic>Atoh1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> RTN neurons could be the main CO<sub>2</sub> sensors in the brain or obligatory relays funneling the chemosensory input from other cells to the RRG—or both. On the one hand, RTN neurons are exquisitely sensitive to small changes in CO<sub>2</sub>/pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mulkey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Onimaru et al., 2008</xref>), also when synaptically isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2013</xref>) and, in close apposition to numerous capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onimaru et al., 2012a</xref>), well positioned to sense PCO<sub>2</sub> in the blood. On the other, they receive afferences from many brainstem sites that contain putative chemosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosin et al., 2006</xref>) and respond with depolarization to activation of nearby acid-sensitive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gourine et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, RTN neurons receive excitatory connections from the carotid bodies via the nucleus of the solitary tract and increase their firing rates in response to carotid body stimulation by hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takakura et al., 2006</xref>). The carotid bodies are not only the main PO<sub>2</sub> sensors, but provide also a substantial fraction of the overall CO<sub>2</sub> response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forster et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). Still, we observed a complete loss of the chemoreflex in neonates with impaired RTN function. The implication is that in the perinatal period, the RTN is an obligatory relay for all forms of respiratory chemoreception whether mediated by central or peripheral chemoreceptors.</p><p>Because of its extensive connections with other chemosensory sites and the observation that its stimulation activates breathing, the RTN has been suggested to be a crucial hub for respiratory chemoreception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guyenet et al., 2013</xref>). However, the results of previous loss-of-function experiments to assess the part played by RTN neurons in the chemoreflex circuitry are not entirely conclusive. In previous work, we have monitored the chemoreflex in mice in which subsets of <italic>Phox2b</italic> expressing neurons including the RTN were genetically lesioned. In these genetic backgrounds, RTN neurons were deleted and the chemoreflex lost, but the effect could not be unambiguously attributed to the RTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dubreuil et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>). Others have impaired RTN function in behaving adult rats using pharmacological or pharmacogenetic approaches, but similar data are not available for the newborn period. Bilateral lesions of the neurokinin1 receptor-expressing neurons in the RTN region by injection of saporin conjugated to a substance P analogue have produced variable results, ranging from a modest attenuation of the chemoreflex in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nattie and Li, 2002</xref>) to a substantial decrease in recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takakura et al., 2014</xref>). Silencing the neurons in the RTN region by the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist muscimol also yielded a large reduction of the hypercapnic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takakura et al., 2013</xref>). These experiments, however, lack specificity and the extent of the lesion or inhibition is difficult to control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marina et al. (2010)</xref> used a pharmacogenetic approach to silence RTN neurons. Administration of allatostatin to rats which had received local injections of a lentivirus vector expressing the allatostatin receptor from an artificial <italic>Phox2b</italic> promoter reduced the hypercapnic response by an average of 60%. However, the approach used by Marina et al. targets the neurons in the rostral ventro-lateral medulla defined by Phox2b expression alone. They include C1 adrenergic and A5 noradrenergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stornetta et al., 2006</xref>), whose contribution to the observed effect was not assessed.</p><p>RTN neurons express the vesicular glutamate transporter Vglut2 and establish synapses with preBötC neurons that resemble classic glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mulkey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bochorishvili et al., 2012</xref>), but this does not prove that they use glutamate and not other transmitters such as galanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bochorishvili et al., 2012</xref>) to excite RRG neurons.

Briefly, brainstem-spinal cord and slice preparations were dissected in 4°C a-CSF of the following composition (in mM): 128 NaCl, 8 KCl, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 30 glucose, pH 7.4. E15.5 transverse slices for optically recording of dorsally located periVII neurons were obtained by cutting 100 μm thick sections from caudal to rostral until a slice contained unambiguously the facial nucleus. Then a 600 μm slice was made and its caudal surface imaged.</p><p>For calcium imaging, brainstem-spinal cord or slice preparations were incubated at room temperature for 40–45 min in oxygenated a-CSF containing the cell-permeant calcium indicator dyes Calcium Green-1 AM (10 μM; Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), or Fluo-8 AM (10 μM; Teflabs, Austin, TX). Preparations were then transferred to a recording chamber (30°C) and let to recover for 30 min prior to start optical recordings using a conventional epifluorescence configuration with a FITC filter cube. Fluorescence images were captured from the slice surface and from the ventral surface of brainstem-spinal cord preparations exposing the RTN region, with a cooled Neo sCMOS camera (Andor Technology Ltd., Belfast, UK) using 10×, 20× and 40× objectives, an exposure time of 100 ms and bin size of 4 × 4 for periods of 180 s using Micro-Manager software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/">https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/</ext-link>). When calcium imaging was combined with photostimulation of <italic>Vglut2::ChR2-YFP</italic> preparations, the calcium imaging back-illumination was set at a minimal level using neutral density filters in the light-path, which caused no noticeable changes in the rhythmic activity of the RTN.

E18.5 pups delivered by Caesarean sections or P0 pups were placed under a heating lamp and were gently touched for 10 min until their breathing had stabilized. After a 7 min familiarization period in the plethysmograph chambers, breathing parameters (breath duration [T<sub>TOT</sub>], tidal volume [V<sub>T</sub>], and ventilation [V<sub>E</sub>] calculated as V<sub>T</sub>/T<sub>TOT</sub>) were continuously monitored in apnea-free periods. E18.5 to P2.5 animals were placed in a 30 ml chamber and their ventilation was recorded continuously for a period of 800 s composed sequentially of a 200 s exposure to normal air followed by a 200 s exposure to hypercapnic air (8%CO<sub>2</sub>/21%O<sub>2</sub>/71%N<sub>2</sub>) before normal air was resumed for the remaining 400 s. Adult animals were recorded in a larger chamber, first for 100 s in normal air, then the animals were exposed to the hypercapnic mix for 3 min before initiation of a 100 s period of recording prior to returning to normal air breathing. Calibrations were performed at the end of each recording session by injecting 2.5–5 μl of air in the chamber with a Hamilton syringe. In plots showing the continuous evolution of respiratory parameters before, during and after the hypercapnic challenge, each circle represents the mean, across all animals of a given genotype, of the parameter values binned in 20 s intervals. To quantify breathing parameter changes induced by hypercapnia, we first calculated for each animal the ratio of the mean parameter value during the last 100 s of the hypercapnic period over that during the last 100 s of the preceding normocapnic period, and then calculated the mean of these ratios in the population of control and mutant animals and expressed them as percentage (ΔV<sub>E</sub> graphs and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

To determine the changes in calcium activity we first calculated a ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> time-series using a plugin of PhysImage that implements a running moving average for baseline subtraction.

To identify rhythmic RTN cells and establish RTN maps of activity we performed cycle-triggered averages (CTAs) using the anatomical location of the RTN to define the region of interest (ROI) that represents broad RTN activity. Using the built-in ImageJ Z-project function, we calculated the image representing the standard deviation (SD) of the CTA and used an iterative thresholding algorithm to identify potential ROIs representing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayes et al., 2012</xref>). A trace representing each ROI's activity was extracted and then the ROIs were validated by calculating the power spectral density of these traces. If the peak power of each trace was not in the range 0.1–0.4 Hz, the corresponding ROI was discarded. For mutant backgrounds with no discernable RTN activity, the same strategy of detection was used except that the SD image of the full ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> time-series was taken into account rather than SD of the image after CTA.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Véronique Dubreuil for early data on periV cells, Marie-Rose Hirsch and Zoubida Chettouh

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall the reviewers were very positive about the study (very thorough and stringent analysis; major advance in the field). There were no essential disagreements among the reviewers, so comments and minor criticisms are therefore included in their full length below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>In this study, the authors examined whether cells of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) are needed for CO<sub>2</sub>/pH sensitivity at birth. This works contrast a previous paper from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al. 2012</xref> proposing that these neurons are dispensable for CO<sub>2</sub>/pH sensitivity. By using intersectional genetic strategies and imaging of population activity in the RTN, the authors find that invalidation of <italic>Atoh1</italic> in <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, or <italic>Phox2b</italic> in <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells or invalidation of glutamatergic transmission in <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells changes the response of the cells to acidification in slices of the brainstem and abolishes responses to CO<sub>2</sub> in newborn mice. Optogenetic activation of the cells restored and entrained respiratory rhythms indicating that <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Phox2b</italic> are required for the activation of breathing by increased CO<sub>2</sub> or low pH. In summary, I do like the study. It combines genetic and imaging techniques to examine the role of RTN cells in respiration and brings in new information on the role of a subset of RTN cells in respiration. Overall a very nice piece of work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic>:</p><p>The relevance of the retrotrapezoid nucleus in the CO<sub>2</sub>-chemoreflex is still unresolved. Previous work by the authors and others suggested the retrotrapezoid nucleus to be critical in CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dubreuil et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2009</xref>; Ramastosoa et al., 2011; Rose et al; 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, previous approaches have lacked specificity. Previous work of the authors mainly relied on the use of <italic>Phox2b</italic> mutant mice, and since <italic>Phox2b</italic> is expressed in served central and peripheral neuron types the unambiguous correlation between of physiological response, or lack thereof, and a particular neuronal class was not possible. The authors now use and elegant intersectional strategy (i.e. a combination of Cre and FlipO) to activate or to eliminate the RTN or RTN activity.</p><p>Overall I find this a very thorough and stringent analysis that in my opinion should settle the long lasting controversy. In addition, the manuscript reports new and interesting findings: Phenic nerve activity is entrained by the RTN, and the RTN is an obligatory relay station for the chemoreflex/CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity at birth and mediates other central and peripheral input. In the postnatal period, some chemoreflex/CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity is recovering in the absence of the RTN. Thus, in the mature animal additional centers participate chemoreflex/CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity, although the importance of these might be overestimated due to compensatory responses/mechanisms. A further finding is the identification of <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup> periV cells, and the elimination of these as candidates in the chemoreflex circuitry. The findings are of relevance for human pathology, i.e. congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, and has an impact on the understanding of more general respiratory problems in newborns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3</italic>:</p><p>Within the reticular formation of the lower brainstem nuclei can only be defined by the congruence of multiple criteria such as location, axonal connections, transmitter phenotype, function and, ideally, genetic lineage. The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is no exception but what makes this topic of particular interest is the mounting evidence that this nucleus might be the nodal point for the homeostatic regulation of arterial PCO<sub>2</sub> through breathing and that its abnormal development underpins CCHS (congenital central hypoventilating syndrome). Originally, RTN was rather vaguely identified as a collection of neurons located at the ventral surface of the brainstem. At present we know that the critical pH-activated neurons express various transcription factors such as <italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Egr2</italic>, <italic>Phox2b</italic> etc. during development and we suspect that these neurons are glutamatergic. However, a definitive identification of the neurons responsible for the regulation of breathing by CO<sub>2</sub> is still lacking and the study of these neurons is hampered by the impossibility to transduce them selectively with contemporary excitatory or inhibitory actuators (<italic>ChR2</italic>, etc).</p><p>In my view, the present study represents a major advance in the field because:</p><p>a) It provides both the definitive identification of the RTN neurons that are critical for the regulation of breathing by CO<sub>2</sub>, a question that has been of interest to physiology since the very beginning of the 20th century and;</p><p>b) It also provides the means to manipulate these neurons with complete selectivity. Using an elegant combination of intersectional genetics and integrative neurobiology (calcium imaging, whole cell recording, histology), the authors demonstrate that the critical neurons require both <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Phox2b</italic> for their correct development by describing the adverse consequences of knocking out Atoh1 or conditionally knocking out <italic>Phox2b</italic> in <italic>Atoh1</italic> expressing neurons on these neurons and the breathing response of the mice to CO<sub>2</sub>. The intersectional genetic strategy provides a mouse line in which the <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase is expressed almost exclusively by the RTN chemoreceptors. These mice will undoubtedly become the gold standard for future studies of these neurons. Using these mice, the authors show for the first time that the <italic>Phox2bon/Atoh1on</italic> RTN neurons use glutamate as transmitter and that these neurons and the embryonic parafacial oscillator are one and he same. The latter observation provides definitive evidence that the RTN chemoreceptors exhibit group pacemaker properties during the late developmental stages and function as an oscillator that is coupled to the preBotzinger complex.</p><p>Finally, the study shows that, at least in the perinatal period, the breathing network has essentially zero sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> in the absence of RTN. This observation seems to put another nail in the coffin of prior theories according to which the chemoreflex is an emergent property of the entire respiratory pattern generator.</p><p>In conclusion, this is an outstanding study, worthy of being published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>The imaging part of the study should be better documented in the Materials and methods section. Too often references to published work are mentioned.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic>:</p><p>1) The authors use many abbreviations for anatomical terms which, if avoided, would improve the reading of the paper.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> might be confusing. Since <italic>Cre</italic> is only expressed after <italic>Phox2b</italic> recombination, the blue structures should not exist in the scheme, only the intersection of <italic>Phox2b</italic>/<italic>Atoh1</italic> that is shown in purple.</p><p>3) I do not understand <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, left panel. What is delta F?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9 B-D</xref> is lacking a quantification if the CO<sub>2</sub>/pH response.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3</italic>:</p><p>The manuscript is clear, fairly presented and very well illustrated. The following are very small points.</p><p>1) Results section, second sentence: please add the word potentially before “glutamatergic”. The present work verifies what is currently only a hypothesis.</p><p>2) Section “Designing a genetic strategy to target RTN neurons”, third paragraph. Can the authors be more specific and indicate the percentage.</p><p>3) Section “Designing a genetic strategy to target RTN neurons”, last line in fourth paragraph. The authors may already have the answer to this question (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) by examining the latency of the activation of <italic>ChR2</italic>-transduced RTN neurons.</p><p>4) Same section, fifth paragraph. This discussion is fine but the last statement should be somewhat modified because active expiration is actually triggered by activating <italic>Phox2b</italic> neurons in intact rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al. 2011</xref>) and is suppressed by silencing these neurons in a reduced preparation, the arterially perfused juvenile rodent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marina et al, 2010</xref>). The differences that the authors discuss are probably caused by the fact that the connections between RTN and the rest of the RPG are very complex in fully developed rodents and the effects produced by RTN activation depend on which part of the whole network is functional. For example, the effect of RTN activation on inspiration (frequency and amplitude) is very strong in conscious rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al. 2011</xref>), mediocre in arterially perfused preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marina et al, 2010</xref>) and essentially absent in some anesthetized preparations (Huckstepp et al., J of N 2015).</p><p>5) Reference 6: the TauGFPnLacz mouse is a rosa 26 line but it is not specifically mentioned in the Srinivas paper.

The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “The retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons expressing <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Phox2b</italic> are essential for the respiratory response to CO<sub>2</sub>” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that this version of the manuscript will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We have carefully reviewed your manuscript and are very enthusiastic about your novel findings. However, both reviewers feel that additional experiments are needed, to clarify that <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Pho2b</italic> neurons have indeed rhythmogenic properties and are absolutely necessary for chemosensation. The reviewers felt that this study contains some highly novel and therefore ‘provocative’ findings which due to this novelty need further experimental verification. For example, further evidence is needed to show that indeed <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Pho2b</italic> neurons are intrinsically rhythmically active and chemosensitive because this could mean that cells sensitive to acidification could also be involved in rhythm generation. Moreover, that the response of the cells to acidification is intrinsic needs further experimental proof. Finally, it should be clarified what precisely ontogenetic activation does to <italic>Atoh1</italic>/<italic>Phox2b</italic> cells. If they are as shown in the paper to generate C4 motor responses, this would mean that they are active during inspiration. In general quantitative analysis should be better presented in form of values (mean, SEM, P, N). If you are willing to perform the requested experiments, we would happily entertain a revised paper. As you know, it is <italic>eLife</italic>'s policy to not ask for substantial new experiments as part of a revision, and you are certainly welcome to take this manuscript to another journal at this time. That said, our interest is quite strong, so if you agree that the requested experiments would strengthen the paper, we hope you will resubmit it to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>Ruffault et al test the functional role of neurons located in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) in the control of constant CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup> concentrations in the arterial blood by genetic strategies allowing them to functionally ablate or restore the activity of a subset of RTN cells expressing the transcriptional factors <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Phox2b</italic>. They show that light-mediated stimulation of those neurons entrains the respiratory rhythm whereas eliminating the expression of both transcription factors or reducing their synaptic transmission abolishes the respiratory chemoreflex. The study uses state-of-the art imaging and electrophysiological techniques and addresses an important question. I have only few questions and comments:</p><p>1) The reasons explained in the Results for the development of new transgenic mouse lines are insufficiently explained. Please provide more concrete reasons (which <italic>Atoh1</italic>-dependent structures are here referred to).</p><p>2) The link between results related to Ca2<sup>+</sup> imaging as well as optophysiological stimulation is weak. Provide in the Results section the information on how cells were loaded, which Ca2<sup>+</sup> indicators were used and how the cells were stimulated by light (frequency, pulse duration). Moreover, I miss mean {plus minus} SEM values and P values throughout the main Results text to get a better idea on the overall quantitative changes. For example statement such as ‘triggered a more robust response’ need a value to understand what is meant by ‘more robust’. This criticism applies as already mentioned to the entire Results section. Since I cannot name all occasions were values, including the number of animals tested, should be included, I ask the authors to perform a detailed revision on this aspect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic>:</p><p>This is an interesting and provocative study by Ruffault et al. It will certainly stir the field of respiration as it is claims that the RTN neurons expressing <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Phox2b</italic> are “absolutely” necessary for chemosensation in neonates. Even though it has previously been postulated that <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Phox2b</italic> neurons are important for chemosensation, this is a new finding, because this complete and very specific knockout has never been done before. Nor has it ever been postulated that these neurons are obligatory for chemosensation. Previous studies attributed approximately 60% of the chemosensory response to these neurons. This left open the possibility that for example serotonin neurons are also involved in the response.</p><p>Despite my enthusiasm for this paper there are several open questions that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) The authors claim that most of the <italic>Atoh1</italic>/<italic>Phox2b</italic> neurons are intrinsically rhythmic and respond to acidification. The data shown are not convincing. To show they are intrinsically active needs additional experiments. The neurons need to be synaptically isolated, and ideally it should be demonstrated that the intrinsic discharge can be reset or somehow be altered by current injections. The trace shown is “absolutely” not enough. Indeed this is a major statement, since it would mean that the same neurons that are chemosensitive are also likely involved in rhythm generation. The authors state “most”; what is exactly meant with this? Please quantify.</p><p>The question of intrinsic rhythmicity is a very important conclusion, it is novel and it needs to be demonstrated very clearly, and unambiguously. Also Paul Gray and coworkers showed in a recent paper (in <italic>eLife</italic>) that <italic>Atoh1</italic> neurons are important in coordinating the generation of the rhythm. A functional discussion of how these authors envision the role of these neurons in the context of the Gray study would be important.</p><p>2) Along the same lines, the response to acidification and to demonstrate that this is intrinsic is actually a big deal. Some researchers go as far as “demanding” that such experiments are done with isolated cells to exclude indirect input from glia cells. Of course isolating cells comes with its own set of caveats. But, irrespective how this will be done, it is important to demonstrate an intrinsic chemosensitivity, and it is important to assess how sensitive these cells really are. Extreme acidification will likely affect all cells… 8% CO<sub>2</sub> is very high. This is OK and actually very good to show the absence of a chemoresponse, but then one would also like to know how sensitive these neurons are.</p><p>3) The authors claim that optogenetic activation of the <italic>Atoh1</italic>/<italic>Phox2b</italic> neurons initiates a C4 burst. This is also new and indeed surprising. RTN/PFRG neurons have been implicated in the control of active expiration. If these neurons activate a C4 motor response it means that they likely activate inspiration. Did I miss something? Clearly, the figure shown is not enough, and I can't tell from the figure what optogenetic activation really does. The traces need to be expanded, and the motor response needs to be quantitatively characterized. This point is too important to be left as a qualitative mention with a figure that is too small.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07051.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>The imaging part of the study should be better documented in the Materials and methods section.

The methods used for preparing brainstem–spinal cord and transverse slice preparations from embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5)-16.5 mouse embryos and maintaining them in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (a-CSF) have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>; Thoby-Brisson, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, brainstem-spinal cord and slice preparations were dissected in 4°C a-CSF of the following composition (in mM): 128 NaCl, 8 KCl, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 30 glucose, pH 7.4. E15.5 transverse slices for optically recording of dorsally located periVII neurons were obtained by cutting 100 µm thick sections from caudal to rostral until a slice contained unambiguously the facial nucleus. Then a 600 µm slice was made and its caudal surface imaged. For calcium imaging, brainstem spinal cord or slice preparations were incubated at room temperature for 40-45 minutes in oxygenated a-CSF containing the cell-permeant calcium indicator dye Calcium Green-1 AM (10µM; Life Technologies), or Fluo-8 AM (10µM; Teflabs).</p><p>Preparations were then transferred to a recording chamber (30°C) and let to recover for 30 minutes prior to start optical recordings using a conventional epifluorescence configuration with a FITC filter cube. Fluorescence images were captured from the slice surface and from the ventral surface of brainstem-spinal cord preparations exposing the RTN region, with a cooled Neo sCMOS camera (Andor Technology Ltd.) using 10X, 20X and 40X objectives, an exposure time of 100 ms and bin size of 4x4 for periods of 180s using Micro-Manager software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/">https://www.micro-manager.org/wiki/</ext-link>). When calcium imaging was combined with photostimulation of <italic>Vglut2::ChR2-YFP</italic> preparations, the calcium imaging back-illumination was set at a minimal level using neutral density filters in the light-path, which caused no noticeable changes in the rhythmic activity of the RTN.

It will certainly stir the field of respiration as it is claims that the RTN neurons expressing Atoh1 and Phox2b are “absolutely” necessary for chemosensation in neonates. Even though it has previously been postulated that Atoh1 and Phox2b neurons are important for chemosensation, this is a new finding, because this complete and very specific knockout has never been done before. Nor has it ever been postulated that these neurons are obligatory for chemosensation. Previous studies attributed approximately 60% of the chemosensory response to these neurons. This left open the possibility that for example serotonin neurons are also involved in the response</italic>.</p><p><italic>Despite my enthusiasm for this paper there are several open questions that need to be addressed</italic>.</p><p>The studies referred to by the reviewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2012</xref>) are on adults. We agree with them since also in our hands around 60% of the chemoresponse in adult mice is contributed by the <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup> subset of RTN neurons. However, we focus on the critical newborn period where the chemoresponse is completely abolished when these cells are lesioned.</p><p><italic>1) The authors claim that most of the</italic> Atoh1/Phox2b <italic>neurons are intrinsically rhythmic and respond to acidification. The data shown are not convincing. To show they are intrinsically active needs additional experiments. The neurons need to be synaptically isolated, and ideally it should be demonstrated that the intrinsic discharge can be reset or somehow be altered by current injections. The trace shown is “absolutely” not enough</italic>.</p><p>We now include whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on the tdTomato+ cells of <italic>P2b::FLPo;Atoh1</italic><sup><italic>FRTCre</italic></sup><italic>;R26</italic><sup><italic>tdTomato</italic></sup> embryos, i.e. on <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>on</sup>/<italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>on</sup> cells, and demonstrate that the spontaneous bursts are altered by current injections, as requested by the reviewer (panels E and F of the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This shows that the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons behave like the embryonic parafacial oscillator described by Thoby-Brisson et al. , i.e. the global population of embryonic RTN neurons defined by their oscillating properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>): the rhythmic burst discharges of both populations appear as all-or-none voltage-dependent events and spontaneous bursts are curtailed by short negative current pulses applied during the burst (panel G of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, we already showed in panel C of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (formerly panel F of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that the global population of oscillating RTN neurons and the tdTomato+ cells in <italic>P2b::FLPo;Atoh1</italic><sup><italic>FRTCre</italic></sup><italic>;R26</italic><sup><italic>tdTomato</italic></sup> embryos have identical burst frequencies and pH responses. We thus feel justified in concluding that the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>on</sup>/<italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>on</sup> cells are indistinguishable from the intrinsically active network of embryonic RTN neurons characterized electrophysiologically and pharmacologically by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thoby-Brisson et al. (2009)</xref>. These results are now described in the text as follows:</p><p>“We then used calcium imaging to show that all tdTomato<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> cells in the RTN region analyzed […] and thus are part of the intrinsically rhythmic network of embryonic RTN cells characterized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thoby-Brisson et al. (2009)</xref>.”</p><p><italic>Indeed this is a major statement, since it would mean that the same neurons that are chemosensitive are also likely involved in rhythm generation. The authors state “most”; what is exactly meant with this? Please quantify</italic>.</p><p><italic>The question of intrinsic rhythmicity is a very important conclusion, it is novel and it needs to be demonstrated very clearly, and unambiguously. Also Paul Gray and coworkers showed in a recent paper (in</italic> eLife<italic>) that Atoh1 neurons are important in coordinating the generation of the rhythm. A functional discussion of how these authors envision the role of these neurons in the context of the Gray study would be important</italic>.</p><p>We have quantified this and found that 100% of the tdTomato+ cells (297/297 cells from 7 different preparations) were rhythmic and respond to acidification, as now stated in the text.</p><p>Also Paul Gray and coworkers showed in a recent paper (in <italic>eLife</italic>) that <italic>Atoh1</italic> neurons are important in coordinating the generation of the rhythm. A functional discussion of how these authors envision the role of these neurons in the context of the Gray study would be important.</p><p>Tupal et al. (who are not concerned with chemosensitivity) find that the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup> RTN neurons which are the focus of our paper are not important for the temporal delay between cervical and lumbar motor outputs (the topic of their paper), so that the <italic>Atoh1</italic>+ cells incriminated in active expiration are distinct from <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup> RTN neurons. We now cite this evidence starting: “Similarly, Tupal et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tupal et al., 2014</xref>) reported that in E18.5 brainstem-spinal cord preparations, a lumbar motor output and thus active expiration persisted after the depletion of <italic>Atoh1</italic> in <italic>Phox2b</italic> expressing neurons, giving further weight to the notion that at least in reduced preparations, active expiration depends on <italic>Phox2b</italic> -negative cells”.</p><p><italic>2) Along the same lines, the response to acidification and to demonstrate that this is intrinsic is actually a big deal. Some researchers go as far as “demanding” that such experiments are done with isolated cells to exclude indirect input from glia cells. Of course isolating cells comes with its own set of caveats. But, irrespective how this will be done, it is important to demonstrate an intrinsic chemosensitivity, and it is important to assess how sensitive these cells really are</italic>.</p><p>Concerning the role of RTN in CO<sub>2</sub> chemosensitivity one should distinguish two questions: (i) the intrinsic chemosensitivity of the RTN and (ii) its overall contribution to the chemoreflex (through its intrinsic sensitivity and/or as a relay of the CO<sub>2</sub> response of other neurons). Our paper is concerned with the second question. In the Introduction we changed the sentence “The number, location and cellular nature of the central chemosensors are still controversial” into: “The nature of the central chemosensors and of the circuits that mediate the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> is still controversial”, to dispel the impression that our aim is to provide evidence for the sites and types of cells that detect changes in PCO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Regarding the issue of intrinsic chemosensitivity, Guyenet and co-workers have already demonstrated that acutely dissociated <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup> RTN neurons are intrinsically chemosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Since 79% of the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup>, Vglut2+ isolated cells did respond to low pH, they necessarily include the <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>on</sup>/<italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>on</sup> neurons studied in our paper, which represent over 70% of the RTN neurons defined by co-expression of <italic>Phox2b</italic> and <italic>Vglut2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>). However, the extent to which the intrinsic chemosensitivity of RTN neurons, or indeed of serotonergic neurons, also demonstrated in culture (Corcoran et al., 2009), contributes to the chemoreflex is unknown and not our focus. What our paper shows is that the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>on</sup> / <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>on</sup> RTN neurons are an obligatory relay to transmit any response of the chemosensors (RTN neurons themselves, 5HT neurons or other cells) to the respiratory rhythm generator in the newborn period and around 60% (this paper and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2012</xref>) in the adult.</p><p>Our interpretation of the results is clearly stated at the end of the Abstract (”Thus, the RTN neurons expressing <italic>Phox2b</italic> and <italic>Atoh1</italic>are a necessary component of the chemoreflex circuitry”), at the end of the Introduction (“Together our findings imply that the RTN neurons that express or have expressed <italic>Phox2b</italic> and <italic>Atoh1</italic> are essential for the activation of breathing by increased CO<sub>2</sub> or low pH, and that other contributors to the chemoreflex must act via the RTN or in partnership with it”) and at the end of the first paragraph of the Discussion ( “We conclude that the neurons in the RTN region that have a history of both <italic>Phox2b</italic> and <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression are obligatory elements of the circuitry for breathing regulation by CO<sub>2</sub> in neonates”). Furthermore, we state in the Discussion: “Our data are compatible with two explanations for the loss of the chemoreflex: the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>+</sup> RTN neurons could be the main CO<sub>2</sub> sensors in the brain or obligatory relays funneling the chemosensory input from other cells to the RRG—or both”.</p><p><italic>Extreme acidification will likely affect all cells… 8%</italic> CO<sub>2</sub> <italic>is very high. This is OK and actually very good to show the absence of a chemoresponse, but then one would also like to know how sensitive these neurons are</italic>.</p><p>We explored the pH sensitivity of the oscillating RTN neurons in E14.5 brainstem preparations.

This is also new and indeed surprising. RTN/PFRG neurons have been implicated in the control of active expiration. If these neurons activate a C4 motor response it means that they likely activate inspiration</italic>.</p><p>Activation of phrenic nerve motor output and thus of inspiration by optogenetic stimulation of <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons in the RTN region has been shown before in adult rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abbott et al., 2009</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2011</xref>). The drawback of the prior results is that the effect cannot be unambiguously traced back to RTN neurons since nearby catecholaminergic and some cholinergic neurons are also activated. Regarding the control of active expiration, Pagliardini et al. (2011) use non-selective optogenetic activation of neurons in the parafacial region to elicit increases in expiratory muscle activity with little effect on inspiration. However, these authors attribute the effects to the activation of neurons that do not express <italic>Phox2b</italic> and thus do not belong to the subset of RTN neurons targeted in our study, and similar results have been reported by Tupal et al. The paragraph concerning this issue now reads as follows:</p><p>“Therefore, the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><bold><italic>on</italic></bold></sup><italic>/Atoh1</italic> <sup><bold><italic>on</italic></bold></sup> subset of RTN neurons is able to entrain phrenic nerve activity and thus inspiration as previously reported in adult rats of neurons in the RTN region defined by <italic>Phox2b</italic> expression alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abbott et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2011</xref>).

Clearly, the figure shown is not enough, and I can't tell from the figure what optogenetic activation really does. The traces need to be expanded, and the motor response needs to be quantitatively characterized</italic>.</p><p>We have added whole -cell patch-clamp recordings of the spontaneous and light-evoked bursts of RTN neurons from <italic>Vglut2::Chr2-YFP</italic> embryos to show the cellular response to photostimulation (panel D of the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This Figure regroups the new results with those showing the requirement for an intact pre-BötC. The results are described in a new paragraph entitled “Photoactivation of the embryonic RTN entrains the respiratory motor output”:</p><p>“We first verified the ability of embryonic RTN neurons to entrain the respiratory-like motor output using channelrhodopsin -based optogenetics. The <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup> RTN neurons are glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bochorishvili et al., 2012</xref>) and express the glutamate transporter <italic>Vglut2</italic> already at embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>).
