exemplars. However, over-generalization, resulting in excessive and inappropriate avoidance, has been implicated in a variety of psychological disorders. Here, we use reinforcement learning modelling to dissect out different contributions to the generalization of instrumental avoidance in two groups of human volunteers (<italic>N</italic> = 26, <italic>N</italic> = 482). We found that generalization of avoidance could be parsed into perceptual and value-based processes, and further, that value-based generalization could be subdivided into that relating to aversive and neutral feedback − with corresponding circuits including primary sensory cortex, anterior insula, amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Further, generalization from aversive, but not neutral, feedback was associated with self-reported anxiety and intrusive thoughts. These results reveal a set of distinct mechanisms that mediate generalization in avoidance learning, and show how specific individual differences within them can yield anxiety.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34779.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>People apply what they have learned from past experiences to similar situations, a phenomenon known as generalization. For example, if eating a particular food caused illness, a person will likely avoid foods that look or smell similar in the future. Generalization can be helpful because it allows people to decide how to act in new situations. But over-generalizing after a bad experience could lead an individual to fear benign scenarios. This may lead to unnecessary anxiety. It can also create a negative cycle where people avoid certain situations or objects, which prevents them from learning that they are safe.</p><p>Now, Norbury et al. show what happens in the brain when making decisions that involve generalization. In the experiments, volunteers were told seeing a particular flower design would lead to a painful electric shock, unless they pushed a button to ‘avoid’ that image. Individuals completed this task in a magnetic resonance imaging machine so Norbury et al. could observe their brain activity while they completed the task. A second group of individuals were asked to complete a similar task online, but instead of being shocked they lost money if they failed to hit a key when they saw the ‘dangerous’ flower. The online participants also filled out a survey about their experience of various psychological symptoms.</p><p>Norbury et al. used computer modeling to reconstruct how people decided whether or not to avoid images that looked similar to the harm-associated images but were in fact safe (did not lead to pain or losing money). The experiments showed that different parts of the brain were involved in different parts of the generalization process. Areas of the brain that interpret vision, fear, and safety played distinct roles. People who generalized more from harmful outcomes were more likely to report feeling anxious and having intrusive negative thoughts in their everyday lives. A better understanding of the brain processes that cause these symptoms in different situations might help scientists develop better treatments for conditions like anxiety in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>generalization</kwd><kwd>aversive learning</kwd><kwd>reinforcement learning</kwd><kwd>avoidance</kwd><kwd>anxiety disorders</kwd><kwd>obsessive-compulsive disorder</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097490/Z/11/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seymour</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104631/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robbins</surname><given-names>Trevor W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Individual differences in generalization of aversive value (but not safety information) during human active avoidance learning specifically predict experience of anxiety and intrusive thoughts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During aversive decision-making, generalization allows application of direct experience with a limited subset of dangerous real-world stimuli to a much larger set of potentially related stimuli. For example, if eating a particular foraged fruit has led to food poisoning in the past, it may be adaptive to avoid similar-appearing fruit in the future. As an evolutionarily well-conserved process, generalization enables safe and efficient navigation of a complex and multidimensional world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghirlanda and Enquist, 2003</xref>). However, <italic>over-</italic>generalization, resulting in inappropriate avoidance of safe stimuli, actions or contexts, has been suggested as a possible pathological mechanism in a range of psychological disorders including anxiety, chronic pain, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duits et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dymond et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vlaeyen and Linton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harvie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pearson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous work on aversive generalization has focused on predicting punishments in passive (Pavlovian) designs. Such studies have revealed evidence of heightened subjective, physiological and neural responses to stimuli that bear perceptual similarity to learned exemplars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dymond et al., 2015</xref>). However, the extent to which these observations extend to a decision-making context − that is whether or not to make an avoidance response in the face of certain stimuli, allowing us to exert <italic>control</italic> over experience of aversive outcomes − is unclear. Although Pavlovian processes can influence avoidance learning, the latter involves acquisition of a fundamentally distinct set of values relating to actions themselves. This is a clinically important distinction, as theories of many psychological disorders relate specifically to excessive avoidant behaviour over and above subjective fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krypotos et al., 2015</xref>) − for example, by reducing opportunities for extinction of inappropriate fear or allowing unnecessary avoidance to transfer to habit-based control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnaudova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LeDoux et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gillan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>There are a number of potential mechanisms by which avoidance generalization could be implemented by the brain. As emphasised in some accounts, perceptual uncertainty in stimulus identity alone can effectively yield generalization. Although there is debate about how well discriminative ability is controlled for in many generalization experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Struyf et al., 2015</xref>), there is good evidence that experience with aversive outcomes alters the representation of predictive stimuli in primary sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weinberger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sasaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wigestrand et al., 2017</xref>), and that this may result in changes to absolute stimulus discriminability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Resnik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laufer and Paz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aizenberg and Geffen, 2013</xref>). On the other hand, generalization may also occur at the level of <italic>value</italic> representations, by the transfer of acquired value to similar, but discriminable cues during learning. In the Pavlovian case, several well-established behavioural phenomena implicate value-related processes at play in generalization across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanson, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schechtman et al., 2010</xref>). That both perceptual and value processes might operate in parallel may explain why recent neuroimaging studies have highlighted different brain areas (e.g. limbic cortex vs primary sensory regions) as being key to Pavlovian aversive generalization in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Onat and Büchel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laufer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A further important factor in the control of avoidance learning is reinforcement by neutral (or ‘safety’) states, that signal omission of punishment. It is likely that generalization over these states can also influence behaviour: for example in the Pavlovian case, evidence for this is seen in ‘peak-shift’ effects, whereby the presence of a perceptually similar safety cue appears to inhibit response to nearby aversive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanson, 1959</xref>). It is therefore possible that under-generalization of safety cues, as opposed to over-generalization of aversive cues, might be a contributing factor to susceptibility to disorders such as generalized anxiety in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grupe and Nitschke, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we address three key questions: first, is there good evidence for generalization in avoidance learning in humans?; second, can we distinguish behavioural and neural components relating to perceptual, aversive value, and safety value?; and third, which if any component predicts relevant psychological symptoms? We used a custom-designed perceptual task in conjunction with reinforcement learning modelling to study two groups: a laboratory-based sample (<italic>N</italic> = 26) who performed a pain avoidance task with concurrent neuroimaging (fMRI), and a larger cohort of individuals (<italic>N</italic> = 482), who performed a monetary loss avoidance task online alongside a battery of questionnaires designed to probe relevant psychological symptom dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillan and Daw, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The overall study design is summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>. In both groups of participants, generalization of instrumental responding was tested using a costly avoidance paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Briefly, participants were instructed that they would see a series of flower-like shapes on their screen, some of which were ‘safe’, and some of which were ‘dangerous’. If they saw a dangerous shape and made no response, there was a high chance that they would receive a painful electric shock (fMRI sample), or lose 10 cents from their cash stake (online sample using Amazon Mechanical Turk, AMT). If they saw a safe shape, they would never receive a shock (or lose money) on that trial. In order to escape the possibility of a painful shock (or monetary loss) when they thought a dangerous shape had been presented, participants were told they could press the ‘escape’ button on their keypad. Participants were instructed that the aversive outcome would never occur on a trial when they had pressed the ‘escape’ button – but – that, importantly, pressing the button was associated with a small cost. Specifically, each time they pressed the escape button, it would be registered on a counter at the bottom of their screen. At the end of each block of the task, they would receive additional painful shocks (or lose additional cash) depending on how many times they had pressed the button during that block (one extra shock or 10 cent loss per every five button presses). The optimal strategy (in order to minimise the amount of pain received or money lost) would therefore be to press the button if they thought they saw a dangerous shape, but <italic>not</italic> press if they thought a safe shape was on the screen.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34779.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Study design and overall behaviour summary.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Study design and protocol for the two participant groups; fMRI, laboratory and functional imaging sample; AMT, Amazon Mechanical Turk (web-based) sample.

GSs were individually generated using precise estimates of perceptual ability (as measured on the first study session for the fMRI group) to be 75% reliably perceptually distinguishable from the task stimuli associated with aversive outcomes (CS+ s). (Due to time constraints and lack of control over testing environment, GS were generated based on average perceptual acuity from a pilot study in the online group.) The perceptual task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) was custom designed based on the recommendations of a recent review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Struyf et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, in order to provide a fair test of perceptual performance during the generalization task, stimuli were not instantly comparable (in order to ensure that GSs would be reliably discriminable in an absolute sense, when presented in isolation; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Slivinske and Hall, 1960</xref>]), and testing occurred in the same emotional context (i.e. under threat of painful shock).</p><p>Importantly, the task stimulus array (in terms of arrangement of CS+ and CS- stimuli in perceptual space) was specifically chosen to probe asymmetries in generalization behaviour that result from value-based mechanisms – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>. One such potential asymmetry is a characteristic shift in peak responding from the CS+ to surrounding GSs, away from the direction of the CS- in perceptual space (known as ‘peak shift’), that has been proposed to result from the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory generalization gradients around CS+ and CS- stimuli following Pavlovian conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanson, 1959</xref>). Crucially, the asymmetric array used here allowed us to compare responses to CS+ GSs both near and far in perceptual space from the CS- – enabling detection of gradient interaction effects such as peak shift in instrumental avoidance, and allowing the separation of oppositely signed generalization gradients around CS+ and CS- stimuli.</p><p>We conducted a series of analyses on data from our two cohorts in order to address our key questions. First, we used reinforcement learning modelling to investigate whether there was evidence of value-based generalization in avoidance behaviour. Next, we used univariate fMRI data analysis to identify brain regions that encoded modelled internal quantities specific to value-based generalization processes. We then took a multivariate approach to investigate how the distributed representation of generalization stimuli in these regions changed over the course of the task, and how this related to individual differences in generalization. Finally, we used data from our online questionnaire battery to determine whether specific elements of avoidance generalization were related self-reported psychological symptoms.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evidence for generalization in avoidance behaviour</title><p>For both groups of participants, the frequency of avoidance in response to generalization stimuli was intermediate to that evoked by CS- and CS+ stimuli (all p&lt;0.0001, paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests; fMRI: GS <italic>vs</italic> CS- <italic>t</italic><sub>25</sub> = 7.57, mean difference = 0.18 [95%CI 0.14–0.24], GS <italic>vs</italic> CS+ <italic>t</italic><sub>25 </sub>= −17.6, mean difference = −0.60 [95%CI −0.67 to −0.54]; AMT: GS <italic>vs</italic> CS- <italic>t</italic><sub>481</sub> = 27.0, mean difference = 0.35 [95%CI 0.33 – 0.38], GS <italic>vs</italic> CS+ <italic>t</italic><sub>481 </sub>= −26.6, mean difference = −0.20 [95%CI −0.19 to −0.21]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>). Despite never having been associated with the aversive outcome, participants also rated GSs significantly higher than CS- (but lower than CS+) stimuli on post-task pain/loss expectancy scales (all p&lt;0.0001, paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests; fMRI: GS <italic>vs</italic> CS- <italic>t</italic><sub>25</sub> = 5.69, mean difference = 24.1 [95%CI 15–33], GS <italic>vs</italic> CS+ <italic>t</italic><sub>25 </sub>= −8.14, mean difference = -52 [95% CI −39 to −66]; AMT: GS <italic>vs</italic> CS- <italic>t</italic><sub>481</sub> = 29.4, mean difference = 41.7 [95%CI 40.0–44.6], GS <italic>vs</italic> CS+ <italic>t</italic><sub>481 </sub>= −16.5, mean different = -18 [95% CI −16.0 to −20.3], on visual analogue scales ranging 0–100; [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>]).</p><p>There was also a significant positive relationship between relative GS avoidance and relative GS pain/loss expectancy rating post-task in both groups (fMRI, Spearman’s ρ = 0.655, p=0.00027; AMT, Spearman’s ρ = 0.432, p=2.2e-16; both measures within-participant z-transformed, for relationships between raw scores see [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>]). This suggests that a higher frequency of avoidance responding (plus associated lack of extinction) translated into higher conscious negative expectancy beliefs for generalization stimuli. There was no relationship between proportionate avoidance on GS trials and perceptual acuity at session 1 (individual θ values) or absolute intensity of the painful electrical stimulation (current amplitude) in the fMRI sample (all p&gt;0.2).</p><p>This raises the question as to whether the observed avoidance on the GS trials was over and above that which would be expected from perceptual uncertainty alone. Notably, mean proportionate avoidance on GS trials in the fMRI group was around 0.2 (or ~0.25 when scaled relative to individual mean CS+ avoidance) – which, given that GSs were generated to be 75% reliably distinguishable from CS+s, is what might have been predicted from a purely perceptual account of task performance. Mean reaction times for making avoidance responses were also significantly slower for GS compared to CS+ stimuli in both groups, suggesting greater uncertainty on these trials (p=0.006, p=2.07e-11, paired sample <italic>t</italic> tests; fMRI: <italic>t</italic><sub>25</sub> = 3.00, mean difference = 167 ms [95% CI 51.2–282], AMT: <italic>t</italic><sub>481</sub> = 6.87, mean difference = 38.8 ms [95% CI 27.7–49.9]; [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>]). To resolve this issue, we tested for the presence of additional value-based generalization processes in both datasets using a principled model comparison approach.</p><p>Simply, we fitted a series of reinforcement learning models to avoidance data from both samples (modified Q-learning algorithms, with trial-by-trial varying learning rates determined by the Pearce-Hall associability rule, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Le Pelley, 2004</xref>] – see Materials and methods). Firstly, we fit a model with perceptual ‘generalization’ only (modelled as 25% chance of perceptual confusion between GSs and the adjacent CS+) – that is where all task stimuli were treated as independent states, with no transfer of value across states. Secondly, we fit a model with perceptual generalization plus an additional value-based generalization process. As there is some evidence that generalization functions are approximately Gaussian in shape, at least along a single perceptual dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghirlanda and Enquist, 2003</xref>), this was implemented as a Gaussian smoothing of stimulus value across perceptual space, with a single free parameter (σ) governing the width of this function. Thirdly, we fit a model with perceptual generalization plus two additional free parameters governing width of additional value-based generalization processes – one for aversive (shock/loss) and one for neutral (no shock/no loss) feedback (σ<sub>A</sub> and σ<sub>N</sub>, respectively). This model was informed by previous empirical observations that generalization functions vary in gradient or width for aversive, neutral, and rewarding feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schechtman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Resnik and Paz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laufer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The above models were fit to avoidance data from both groups using a variational Bayes approach to model inversion, under a mixed-effects framework (whereby within-subject priors are iteratively refined and matched to the inferred parent population distribution; see Materials and methods).

In both samples, σ<sub>A</sub> values were significantly larger than values of the parameter governing width of generalization from neutral (safe) feedback, σ<sub>N</sub>, indicating wider generalization for aversive compared to neutral outcomes (p=3.0e-8, p=2.2e-16, related-samples Wilcoxon signed rank tests; fMRI: mean σ<sub>A</sub>=0.752 ± 0.29, mean σ<sub>N</sub>=0.028 ± 0.03; AMT: mean σ<sub>A</sub>=0.695 ± 0.23, mean σ<sub>N</sub>=0.057 ± 0.05).

Further, example traces for two representative participants from the fMRI group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) illustrate that stimulus values tend to asymptote – i.e. that under this model generalization of value across stimuli is assumed to be relatively constant over time. This assumption is consistent with our behavioural data, in that a time-on-task analysis showed that after initial period of exploratory learning (blocks 1–2), generalization in terms of GS avoidance remains fairly stable. In both groups of participants, there were significant effects of both CS type and block number, and a CS type*block interaction, on proportionate avoidance responding (fMRI: <italic>F</italic><sub>2,50</sub>=406.3, <italic>F</italic><sub>4,100</sub>=6.14, <italic>F</italic><sub>8,200</sub>=8.68, respectively; AMT: <italic>F</italic><sub>2,962</sub>=1077.9, <italic>F</italic><sub>4,196</sub>2=24.3, <italic>F</italic><sub>8,3848</sub>=263.0, respectively; all p&lt;0.001, repeated-measures ANOVA). In the fMRI sample, the CS type*block interaction was driven by lower avoidance for CS+ stimuli in block one compared to the rest of the task (p≤0.004; other CS types no significant differences between blocks; pairwise comparisons Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons). This suggests a strategy of exploratory non-avoidance to enable proper learning of CS+ stimuli in block 1, but fairly constant generalization of avoidance across later blocks. In the AMT sample, there was also lower avoidance for CS+ stimuli in block one vs other blocks (all p&lt;0.001), but a decrease in avoidance for CS- stimuli in later blocks (3-5) vs earlier blocks (1 and 2; all p&lt;0.001). Overall GS avoidance showed small increases then decreases over first three blocks (p&lt;0.001), before stabilising between blocks 4 and 5 (p&gt;0.5, Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons; see [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Evidence for effects of conditioning on perceptual acuity</title><p>In the fMRI group, perceptual acuity for task stimuli was tested both before and after carrying our the generalization of instrumental avoidance paradigm, in order to test for possible effects of aversive conditioning on discriminability of the generalization stimuli (the three test sessions were carried out on three consecutive days for all participants, so any detected changes would likely reflect post-consolidation changes in perceptual performance).</p><p>There was no strong evidence for change in perceptual acuity in terms of θ value (difference in shape ‘spikiness’ parameter rho for 75% reliable perceptual discrimination) pre- <italic>vs</italic> post- conditioning (mean θ 0.071 ± 0.015 on session 1, 0.065 ± 0.019 on session 3; non-significant trend towards greater acuity on session 3, p=0.061, related-samples Wilcoxon signed rank test; [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>]).

One potential explanation for this difference is that there was lower absolute discriminability of generalization stimuli for the AMT participants. Although θ values (difference in ρ between CS+ and GS stimuli) were similar for the online and lab-based cohorts (0.071 ± 0.015 for the MRI group, and 0.065 for all AMT participants), we were unable to control factors such as participant distance from screen, and experimental window minimisation, that may have led to GSs being less discriminable than estimated in our pilot study (see Materials and methods). In addition, it is possible that participants conducting the study online paid less attention to the task than supervised lab-based participants (e.g. were multi-tasking), resulting in higher rates of stimulus-independent responding. Finally, it is possible that there were group-level differences in decision bias for the monetary loss compared to the pain reinforcer – for example due to differences in overall aversiveness between the two outcomes. Indeed, there was evidence of a difference in decision bias, as captured by the softmax bias parameter, between groups. The mean bias against deciding to avoid was 0.415 ± 0.14 in the MRI sample, and 0.315 ± 0.15 in AMT sample (p=0.0013, 95% CI for difference 0.04–0.16, <italic>t</italic><sub>28.5</sub>=3.56; Welch-Satterthwaite two-sample <italic>t</italic> test; <italic>nb</italic> large difference in <italic>N</italic> between groups).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Brain regions encoding model quantities specific to value-based generalization</title><p>As our behavioural data provided evidence for the presence of generalization in instrumental avoidance in both groups, we next employed a univariate analysis approach to our functional imaging data in order to investigate whether model quantities specific to <italic>value</italic>-related generalization processes were encoded in regional blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals.</p><p>In addition to work highlighting the role of the insula, amygdala, and primary sensory cortex in aversive generalization following Pavlovian conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosh and Chattarji, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Onat and Büchel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Resnik and Paz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laufer et al., 2016</xref>), previous functional imaging studies have identified the striatum and prefrontal cortex as encoding generalization gradients in healthy human volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunsmoor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lissek et al., 2014</xref>).

Notably, this bi-directional relationship persisted if individual σ<sub>A</sub> values were re-calculated using a behavioural model that took into account potential conditioning-induced changes in perceptual acuity (i.e. perceptual discriminability of generalization stimuli changed linearly across trials from pre- to post- generalization test measured values; amygdala: β = −0.353, SE = 0.07, <italic>t</italic> = −5.42, p=2.65e-5; V1: β = 0.204, SE = 0.04, <italic>t</italic> = 5.08, p=5.77e-5).

(A summary of scores on these measures and other demographic information for both samples is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To enable comparison with the findings of Gillan et al., self-report information was first compared to individual parameter estimates using precision-weighted linear regression models, controlling for age and gender identity (see Materials and methods). This approach was then complemented by the implementation of cross-validated regularised regression models (CV LASSO regression), as in the previous section (these models also included age and gender identity as regressors of no interest).</p><p>First, we sought to identify whether individual values of the parameter governing width of generalization from aversive feedback (σ<sub>A</sub>) were related to symptom scores on any measure. Total scores across measures exhibited good to excellent internal reliability (mean Cronbach’s α = 0.882, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), and, as might be expected, covaried significantly across participants (mean absolute <italic>r</italic> for inter-correlation between scores = 0.479). Regression of total scores against parameter estimates was therefore implemented in separate models for each measure, in order to enable meaningful partition of variance. The Nyholt-Bonferroni corrected p value for significance across these separate models of non-independent measures was p&lt;0.010 to maintain an alpha of 0.05 (effective number of independent variables = 5.0, see Materials and methods).</p><p>Parameter estimates governing width of generalization from aversive feedback were found to be significantly positively associated with trait anxiety scores (greater width with greater anxiety), and significantly negatively associated with trait apathy (smaller width with greater apathy; anxiety, p=0.009, apathy, p&lt;0.001, individual precision-weighted linear regression models controlling for age and gender; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

In particular, we demonstrate that generalization involves a number of distinct processes relating to different components of avoidance: perceptual uncertainty, aversive value generalization, and neutral (safety) value generalization. These processes each relate to different patterns of neural representations in the brain. Finally, we show that aversive value generalization is a specific predictor of trait anxiety in a large population sample.</p><p>Examining instrumental avoidance behaviour allows us to investigate how individuals learn about and attribute value to the set of <italic>actions</italic> they can take when faced with a particular stimulus or situation (as distinct from passively learnt Pavlovian stimulus-value associations). Using reinforcement learning modelling, we found behavioural evidence for additional value-based contributions to avoidance generalization (i.e. over and above that which might be expected from perceptual uncertainty alone) in two independent groups of participants (sampling different populations, and using two different kinds of aversive reinforcer). Notably, choice data from both groups supported an account of value-generalization that allowed for different widths of generalization from aversive (pain or monetary loss) vs neutral (no pain or loss) feedback. Consistent with previous evidence from studies of generalization of Pavlovian conditioning in humans and non-human primates, we observed larger width generalization functions for aversive compared to neutral feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schechtman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Resnik and Paz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laufer et al., 2016</xref>). In both groups, estimates of free parameters governing widths of these two processes were uncorrelated, suggesting they might relate to at least partially separable mechanisms.</p><p>Taking an explicit model-based approach enabled us to identify brain regions where BOLD signal was related to variance in modelled quantities specific to value-based generalization (namely, expected value and prediction error signals). When potential perceptual confusion between visually similar task stimuli was properly accounted for, we found evidence for encoding of value-related generalization signals in the anterior insula and dorsal striatum. The anterior insula and striatum (more ventrally) have previously been implicated in representing expected value and prediction error signals in higher-order pain conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Seymour et al., 2004</xref>), and the dorsal striatum is implicated in prediction error signals in avoidance learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palminteri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seymour et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eldar et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting an important role for these structures in aversive learning (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delgado et al., 2009</xref>). Dorsal, rather than more ventral striatal control has also been implicated in the transfer from goal-directed to habit-based avoidance in instrumental paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LeDoux et al., 2017</xref>). Greater understanding of habitual control in excessive avoidance has particular clinical relevance as it may explain why maladaptive avoidance can persist following extinction (e.g. contributing to treatment-resistance in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Treanor and Barry, 2017</xref>]), and has been proposed as core mechanism in obsessive-compulsive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gillan et al., 2014</xref>). We found no evidence of univariate encoding specific to value-based model quantities in the amygdala, primary visual cortex (V1), or ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). However, this may be because this kind of analysis is not ideally suited to detect distributed representations involved in associative learning.</p><p>In previous studies of Pavlovian aversive conditioning, it has been demonstrated that positively conditioned stimuli come to be more closely represented to the primary aversive outcome in multivariate space (e.g. across neural ensemble activity in the basolateral amygdala, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grewe et al., 2017</xref>]). Here, we used a robust, cross-validated measure of representational distance to analyse data across all voxels in regions of interest, and found that increased similarity of representation of GS to CS +stimuli over the course of the task in primary sensory cortex was related to higher overall behavioural generalization (higher proportionate avoidance on generalization trials). Individuals for whom GS stimuli came to be more closely represented to CS +s in these brain regions (despite never having been directly associated with the aversive outcome) chose to avoid more in the face of GS stimuli − and vice versa. This change in representational geometry, in association with the lack of opportunity for extinction of inappropriately generalized value in an avoidance context, may have contributed towards the stability of generalization (in terms of overall GS avoidance) we observed over the later phases of the task.</p><p>Consistent with perceptual accounts of generalization, a post-hoc analysis suggested that representational change for GSs relative to CS +stimuli over the course of the task in primary visual cortex might account for some of the generalisation in avoidance we observed (in addition or parallel to value-based mechanisms identified above). Individuals who avoided more frequently on generalization trials, and who showed associated increases in GS−CS +representational similarity in V1, exhibited decreased perceptual acuity for task stimuli on next day perceptual testing - with the opposite pattern observed in participants who showed lower GS avoidance. Absolute decreases in discriminability for task stimuli result in increased generalization ‘for free’ (without having to involve additional mechanisms), and therefore may contribute to maintenance of generalization in some participants.</p><p>However, consistent with accounts that favour the involvement of a wider network of brain regions in coordinating generalization across stimuli, we also found a role for multivariate anterior insula and amygdalar representations in individual differences in aversive value generalization. Individuals who had higher estimates for the model parameter governing value generalization specifically from aversive feedback showed greater increases in similarity of GS−CS +representation in these regions. Somewhat surprisingly, the opposite relationship was observed in primary visual cortex, such that increases GS-CS +similarity in this region were associated with <italic>lower</italic> individual aversive generalization parameter estimates. One potential explanation for this finding is that some kind of compensatory mechanism exists between perceptual and value-based generalization processes, acting at the brain rather than behaviour level. Interestingly, changes in discriminative ability following aversive conditioning have recently been associated with altered insula and amygdalar processing of visual stimuli in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shalev et al., 2018</xref>). However, this result was unexpected and would therefore benefit considerably from further investigation in future work.</p><p>Although less well optimised under our design, we also conducted an analysis to probe whether changes in GS relative to CS- stimuli might be associated with individual estimates of the model parameter governing width of generalization specifically from neutral (or ‘safe’) outcomes (in this case, omission of painful shock). Individuals with higher values of the parameter governing extent of generalization from neutral feedback exhibited greater increases in GS−CS- similarity over the course of the task in both the amygdala and vmPFC. This adds to a body of work suggesting that amygdalar function is not only important for the generalization of fear responses, but that it is also involved in safety learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Genud-Gabai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Likhtik et al., 2014</xref>). A recent study in rodents suggests that the lateral amygdala may be particularly important region for understanding individual differences in fear behaviour towards perceptually ambiguous novel stimuli, with different neuronal sub-populations involved in successful discrimination of novel safe stimuli and inappropriate fear responses – in a way that would be hard to detect by averaging signal across this region as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grosso et al., 2018</xref>). Although the vmPFC has previously been demonstrated to show inverse perceptual similarity-derived generalization gradients following aversive conditioning (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lissek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Onat and Büchel, 2015</xref>), it is not always clear from the experimental design whether this represents the simple inverse of aversive gradients (stemming from the CS+), or rather the positive signalling of safety gradients (stemming from the CS-). The evidence presented here provides tentative support for the latter account, at least in an instrumental context.</p><p>Excessive avoidance in response to contexts or stimuli which do not pose a threat to an individual’s health or well-being can significantly impair general functioning and is often associated with high levels of psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnaudova et al., 2017</xref>). Such maladaptive avoidance has been identified as a core pathological dimension across several psychological disorders, including anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, chronic pain, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LeDoux et al., 2017</xref>). Over-generalization of aversive feedback to encompass non-threatening but psychologically similar stimuli or contexts has been proposed as a key mechanism underlying the initiation and maintenance of excessive avoidance in these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duits et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dymond et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harvie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pearson et al., 2015</xref>) – however, the link between generalization of negative value and inappropriate avoidance behaviour has been relatively underexplored.</p><p>We found selective relationships between psychological symptom scores and individual parameter estimates governing width of value generalization from aversive, but not safe/neutral outcomes. The largest positive relationship between symptom score and magnitude of aversive generalisation was for the factor-analysis derived score labelled ‘intrusive anxiety’, which mainly comprised items probing self-reported trait anxiety, but also reports of intrusive thoughts from the obsessive-compulsive inventory (% increase in parameter value with a 1SD increase in symptom score was 11.0% for intrusive anxiety, and 10.6% for trait anxiety alone). We also found a significant negative relationship between self-reported apathy and aversive generalization (22.9% decrease in parameter value with a 1SD increase in symptom score) – an effect which appeared to be independent from that relating to self-reported anxiety. This is an interesting finding, as we often think about apathy as involving a greater sensitivity to perceived effort, or decreased sensitivity to potential rewards, rather than a decreased impact of information about punishments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonnelle et al., 2015</xref>). As, to our knowledge, there has been no previously reported link between self-reported apathy and aversive generalization, this finding would benefit from future replication.</p><p>In summary, the findings reported here demonstrate the benefits of parsing complex processes such as generalization into separate components, and examining individual relationships between these components and both neural mechanisms and self-reported psychopathology. This approach may help unify previous apparently contradictory observations, and underlines that both perceptual and value-based processes are likely at work in generalization phenomena. Identification of patients across diagnostic categories who may have a primary deficit in excessive aversive generalization may help target them towards treatments which work more effectively. Further, greater understanding of the mechanisms of over-generalization of avoidance (including transfer to habit-based control systems) may help improve understanding of treatment resistance in these disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Code and data availability</title><p>All relevant code for stimulus generation, data collection, and data analysis, in addition to raw behavioural data, are available at the project’s Open Science Framework page (osf.io/25t3f).

Briefly, on each trial, participants viewed an individual shape (target or comparison stimulus, order randomized on each trial), followed by a mask (scrambled mean shape image), delay period (blank screen), second shape, and second mask.

Shape ‘spikiness’ is parameterized by a single value, <italic>ρ</italic> (where 0 &lt; <italic>ρ</italic> &lt;1), which relates the inner and outer radii of the shape such that stimuli are of constant surface area. Target stimuli were shapes with ρ values of the two CS+ stimuli from the generalization task (0.25 and 0.75). These target stimuli were compared to comparison stimuli of intervals of ±0, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, and 0.15 <italic>ρ</italic>, such that the possible range of different shapes was well tiled.

On each trial, participants were presented with a stimulus in the centre of their screen. This initiated a 3 s decision period, during which they must decide whether or not to make an ‘escape’ (avoidance) response. Following this, a yellow bounding box appeared around the shape, indicating the time when an avoidance response could be made was over and they would receive the outcome for that trial. If an avoidance response was made, no shock was ever delivered on that trial. If no avoidance was made, and the stimulus was a ‘safe’ shape (CS-), no shock was delivered. If the stimulus was a ‘dangerous’ shape (CS+), a painful shock was delivered on 80% of non-avoidance trials at the end of this outcome period (i.e. 6 s from stimulus onset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>On a low frequency of trials, shapes were generalization stimuli (GSs; 2 presentations of each GS per 38 trial block). These stimuli were individually generated to be 75% reliably distinguishable from adjacent CS+ s based on day 1 perceptual task performance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), and were never associated with painful shock. Trial types were presented in the following ratio: 10 CS-: 10 CS+(*2): 2 GS(*two per CS+) in a pseudorandom sequence, in order to minimise learning about GS stimuli. Although previous studies have tended to employ designs with multiple generalization stimuli, use of a single GS around each CS+ in perceptual space is the most efficient design if the perceptual discriminability of probe stimuli is accurately known, and you are agnostic as to the precise identity of the generalization function (e.g. exponential vs Gaussian, assuming this constant across individuals). Frequency of individual GS presentation (10 per GS) was comparable to recent functional imaging studies of Pavlovian generalization (e.g. 7 and 34 presentations per GS during generalization test phases, respectively: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laufer et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Onat and Büchel, 2015</xref>]).</p><p>The stimulus array was asymmetric in perceptual space (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), with two CS+ (and four associated GS) stimuli – one nearer and further from an intermediary CS-.

Questionnaires consisted of the trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spielberger et al., 1970</xref>]); the Physician’s Healthy Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martin et al., 2006</xref>]), a brief measure of mood disorder symptoms; the revised (short-form) Obsessive-Compulsive Index (OCI-R; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foa et al., 2002</xref>]); the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale v11 (BIS-11; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patton et al., 1995</xref>]); and the Apathy Motivation Index (AMI; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ang et al., 2017</xref>]).

This self-report measure asks participants to imagine themselves in various scenarios (e.g. ‘Imagine you go to a party and people are not interested in you’), and then probes the imagined causes of this scenario along dimensions of ‘internal’, ‘global’, and ‘stable’ attributions, plus low self-worth. On this measure, a more ‘global’ cognitive style reflects a tendency to attribute negative events to causes which are general, rather than specific (a cognitive form of over-generalization), and has been found to be a predictor of future depressed mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pearson et al., 2015</xref>).

A non-constant learning rate also ensures that parameters governing width of value-based generalization, which are assumed to be constant over the course of the task, are identifiable during parameter estimation (see below equations).

This was done on the basis that (1) the univariate analysis indicated involvement of these voxels in specific value-related generalisation processes, and (2) previous analysis has shown that reliability of LDC RDMs falls off sharply for larger ROIs (&gt;~250 voxels, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Walther et al., 2016</xref>]; anatomical ROIs for whole insula = 1019 voxels, for whole striatum = 3482 voxels; functional anterior insula ROI = 71 voxels, functional caudate ROI = 20 voxels, masks available at osf.io/25t3f).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Questionnaire data</title><p>Questionnaire total and individual item scores were feature scaled (z-scored across participants) prior to further analysis.</p><p>Factor analysis was carried out as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gillan et al (2016)</xref>: implemented in R v3.4.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), using the factanal function (psych package) with oblique (oblimin) rotation. The number of factors to extract was determined using the Cattell-Nelson-Gorsuch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorsuch and Nelson, 1981</xref>) method (nFactors package), whereby successive scree plot gradients are analysed to determine the ‘elbow’ point after which there is little gain in retaining additional factors. Factor names were chosen on the basis of the highest-loading items for each factor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Individual differences</title><p>Normality of distribution of individual variables (or within-subject differences in variables) was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and, where appropriate, non-parametric statistics were employed for pairwise tests.</p><p>In the fMRI sample, multivariate representational similarity estimates from all ROIs were compared to overall GS avoidance using an ordinary least squares multiple linear regression model. Mean avoidance across different trial types was z-scored within-participants, in order to gain a measure of <italic>relative</italic> GS avoidance (i.e. taking into individual variation in tendency to avoid on CS- and CS +trials).</p><p>Individual model parameters governing value-based generalization (σ<sub>A</sub>/σ<sub>N</sub>) were related to variables of interest (multivariate representational similarity in the fMRI sample, self-reported psychopathology in online sample) using weighted least squares multiple linear regression models. This method produces the maximum likelihood regression estimate when noise is not constant across measurements (i.e. data are heteroscedatic; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carroll and Ruppert, 1988</xref>]). As the VBA toolbox yields the variance of posterior parameter estimates as well as the mean, weights were defined as the precision of individual parameter estimates (i.e. 1/posterior variance). Regression analyses were implemented in R using the function lm (psych package). Age (z-scored) and gender (binary scored as male <italic>vs</italic> female/other) information were also included in all questionnaire data regression models as predictors of no interest. In R syntax: fit.wls = lm(σ<sub>A</sub> ~ predictor(s)+ageZ + gender, weights = σ<sub>A</sub> precision)</p><p>Where candidate predictors were significantly collinear (as was the case for the questionnaire total scores data), they were implemented in separate regression models. Multiple comparisons correction for these models was achieved via the Nyholt-Bonferroni correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li and Ji, 2005</xref>), which yields a modified Bonferroni correction for non-independent (related) variables by estimating the ‘effective number of independent variables’ from the eigenvalues of their correlation matrix. Although we collected trait anxiety data in the MRI group (in order to characterise general anxiety levels in the sample, and screen out any individuals with undiagnosed pathologically significant anxiety), we did not plan to compare individual differences in behaviour to trait anxiety in this sample, as effect sizes from previous studies relating decision-making model parameters to psychological symptoms suggest this would be significantly underpowered (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gillan et al., 2016</xref>]).</p><p>As a more robust test, we complemented our linear regression analyses with cross-validated regularized regression models, where all predictors were included in a single model. Specifically, we used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tibshirani, 1996</xref>) with leave-one-out cross-validation. This approach effectively shrinks non-significant predictors to zero, and provides a more robust estimate of regression coefficients. This was implemented using the glmnet package in R. In R syntax: fit.cv = cv.glmnet(y= σ<sub>A</sub>, x = all predictors, alpha = 1, nfolds = <italic>N</italic>, weights = σ<sub>A</sub> precision)</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by the Wellcome Trust (grant number 097490/Z/11/A to BS).

The authors have used a clever experimental paradigm to test whether the generalization during avoidance learning can be decomposed into the processes related to perceptual and value-related processes, and to examine how such different components of generalization map on to different neural substrates. They found that a model with perceptual, aversive, neutral components of generalization accounted for the observed behavioral data best, and that signals related to the aversive and neutral components of value learning were identified in different brain areas. Finally, the aversive component of the generalization was related to the anxiety-related traits.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have raised two major concerns that must be addressed appropriately before the paper can be accepted. This might require some additional analyses and discussion of the data.</p><p>1) The experimental task confounds shock expectations with motor responses. This makes it difficult to interpret value-related fMRI activity. In particular, because motor responses were only made on a subset of trials (those with high probability of being paired with shock), it is unclear how signals related to shock expectation can be dissociated from those related to motor preparation/execution. Parametric value estimates from a model that predicts behavior well will necessarily also correlate with motor-related fMRI signals. One way to overcome this problem would be to estimate parametric value-bases responses separately for trials with and without avoidance responses. Alternatively, the GLM should include a parametric regressor (as first regressor) which codes for whether or not an avoidance response was made.</p><p>2) It is not entirely clear whether the current task measures classical generalization-like behavior. Peak shifts are considered to be an indicator of generalization. In the current task, one would expect peak shifts for the GS's corresponding to one of the two CS+ (the spiky GS closer to the CS – in Figure 1B). However, peak shifts are not observed in the fMRI sample. This is inconsistent with classical indicators of generalization, raising the question what this task really measures. Typical generalization experiments probe behavior in response to a large number of GS. This makes it virtually impossible for participants to directly acquire stimulus-outcome associations for each and every GS, and subjects have to rely on generalization to respond optimally. In contrast, the current task uses only two GS's, potentially allowing subjects to directly learn GS-outcome associations. Thus, participants (at least in the fMRI sample) might have approached this task as a perceptual challenging but otherwise normal learning task. The implication of this limitation should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34779.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have raised two major concerns that must be addressed appropriately before the paper can be accepted.

Specifically, we wanted to frame the decision to be made on each trial as one to stay and sample a particular stimulus, versus deciding to withdraw (avoid the outcome of that stimulus) – thereby incurring a small cost (analogous to time and/or energy cost in the real world). This decision was made on the basis that framing two choice decisions in this way (versus e.g. an approach-avoidance framework, where selecting either option requires a behavioural response) can affect the choices participants make (e.g. Wright et al., 2013, Frontiers in Neuroscience).</p><p>However, we agree that this creates an issue for certain aspects of MRI analysis – specifically our expected value analysis as modelled internal probability of shock (our expected value regressor) incurs collinearity with the decision to avoid. In order to address this issue, we have re-run all our univariate models with an additional nuisance regressor representing avoidance responses (delta function at time the response was made), parametrically modulated by reaction time (time from stimulus onset to avoidance) – as we observed a difference in mean reaction time between CS+ and GS trials (see Results and newFigure 3). The inclusion of this regressor in our re-analysis should significantly ameliorate concerns over non value-related motor confound effects (i.e. regress out effect of makingvs. not making a button press on a given trial). It is not possible under our design to disambiguate motor preparation responses that may covary with value (e.g. relating to movement force/vigour) – however, as long as this relates to response generation, rather than other potential corollaries such as sensory feedback, it should be considered a part of the generalization response itself, rather than representing a confound (for example, almost all human decision-making studies involve a motor response of some sort).</p><p>The core results of both the expected value and outcome prediction error analyses were unaltered under the new model specification – specifically, we still found evidence of univariate encoding of variance specific to regressors derived from a value-based generalization model in the anterior insula and dorsal striatum (new Figure 3). Indeed, removing the motor preparation confound improved the result on the outcome prediction error analysis, such that significant clusters were now observed in the dorsal striatum (bilateral putamen and right pallidum – see new Figure 3C).</p><p>As well as updating the Results and relevant figures, we have edited the Materials and methods to make it clearer exactly which nuisance regressors were included in all models (please see below). We also updated the simple categorical model that the multivariate data was drawn from to include avoidance response regressors (modulated by reaction time) – please see Results and new Figure 4. Finally, we have added a note to the Materials and methods to explain that, despite inclusion of appropriate motor response regressors, there is still a chance that the expected value analysis may be contaminated by motor preparation responses, due to the relative timing of trial events (please see below).</p><p>“All first level models included the following regressors of no interest: 8 respiration and 6 movement regressors (with translation &gt;1.5mm or rotation &gt;1° on any trial resulting in the inclusion of an additional outlier regressor), plus delta functions at the time of avoidance responses and shock receipt (avoidance response onsets included a parametric modulator representing reaction time, as overall we observed different mean RTs for GS and CS+ stimuli).”</p><p>“Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was carried out using materials from the RSA toolbox (Nili et al., 2014; available at github.com/rsagroup/rsatoolbox), run in Matlab. For this analysis, time series data extracted from all voxels of each ROI were first multivariately noise normalized (data were beta images drawn from a simple categorical general linear model that consisted of stimulus onset by type and the same nuisance regressors as the univariate analyses).”</p><p>“Due to the nature of our task design (i.e., that participants are only required to make motor responses on trials on which they wish to avoid that outcome of the presented stimulus), it is possible that expected value (predicted <italic>P</italic>(shock)) responses are partially contaminated by motor preparation responses (despite inclusion of appropriate nuisance regressors), due to the relative timing of these events. This should not be the case for the outcome prediction error analysis, as this focuses on trials where an avoidance response was not made (see Results).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not entirely clear whether the current task measures classical generalization-like behavior.

Assuming this function is constant across individuals, rank ordering of individual function width estimates should be fairly stable, regardless of the exact function chosen (e.g., both exponential and Gaussian functions have been proposed in the past, and indeed may both fit equally well a small number of noisy datapoints derived from human physiological data). Under these circumstances, use of single probe GSs around CSs is the most statistically efficient design – particularly under circumstances such as fMRI where individual trials are necessarily quite long.</p><p>We did not observe a peak shift effect in overall proportionate choice data in our MRI sample – however this is also the case for other recent human studies of aversive generalization using multiple GS stimuli and similar sample sizes (Onat and Büchel 2015; Laufer, Israeli and Paz, 2016), so we would argue this is not a pre-requisite for inferring any kind of generalization process is at play. Interestingly, peak shift effects have previously primarily been demonstrated using reward-based paradigms – it could be that aversively-conditioned peak shift is a less robust phenomenon, and we are simply underpowered to detect it at standard functional imaging sample sizes (cf our significantly larger online cohort).</p><p>The reviewer raises the important point of considering how participants conceptualise our task, given we do not use multiple GSs, and therefore explicitly (or implicitly) frame the experiment as a generalization problem. Under these circumstances, is it possible that our participants are simply solving the task by considering each stimulus as an independent learning target and not using generalization at all? Using our computational framework, it is possible for us to test this hypothesis explicitly, by comparing models of the task where participants transferred value between states (stimuli) on the basis of their perceptual similarity (i.e., generalized), to a model where all states are learned about independently (with no supra-perceptual threshold transfer of value). Indeed, this is the exact analysis illustrated in Figure 2A. Bayesian model comparison revealed that in neither cohort was it likely the participants were using model where task stimuli were learnt about independently (‘perceptual only model’ in Figure 2) – either at the group level (estimated probability that this model was the true population model was ~0 in both groups), or in a subset of individuals (proportion of participants for whom this was the most likely model was &lt;0.1 in the MRI group, and ~0 in the online group). Further, it is possible that lack of explicit or implicit framing of the task as using a generalization design guarded against the influence of demand characteristics in participants’ responding (particularly e.g. in subjective ratings data).</p><p>We have added a brief discussion of this design issue to the Materials and methods (please see below), and attempted to make the motivation underlying the model comparison analysis clearer in the Results section.</p><p>“On a low frequency of trials, shapes were generalization stimuli (GSs; 2 presentations of each GS per 38 trial block). […] Frequency of individual GS presentation (10 per GS) was comparable to recent functional imaging studies of Pavlovian generalization (e.g. 7 and 34 presentations per GS during generalization test phases, respectively: Laufer et al., 2016; Onat and Büchel, 2015).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
