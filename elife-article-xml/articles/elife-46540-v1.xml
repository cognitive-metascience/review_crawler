overcome CRISPR-Cas immunity. Because Acrs are challenging to identify, their natural diversity and impact on microbial ecosystems are underappreciated. To overcome this discovery bottleneck, we developed a high-throughput functional selection to isolate ten DNA fragments from human oral and fecal metagenomes that inhibit <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 (SpyCas9) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The most potent Acr from this set, AcrIIA11, was recovered from a <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> phage. We found that AcrIIA11 inhibits SpyCas9 in bacteria and in human cells. AcrIIA11 homologs are distributed across diverse bacteria; many distantly-related homologs inhibit both SpyCas9 and a divergent Cas9 from <italic>Treponema denticola</italic>. We find that AcrIIA11 antagonizes SpyCas9 using a different mechanism than other previously characterized Type II-A Acrs. Our study highlights the power of functional selection to uncover widespread Cas9 inhibitors within diverse microbiomes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46540.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses that attack bacteria are known as bacteriophages, or phages for short. Bacteria have developed an antiviral immune system called CRISPR-Cas that works by targeting particular genetic sequences, such as those of an invading phage, for destruction. To counteract this immune system, phages have evolved proteins that can block CRISPR-Cas known as anti-CRISPRs.</p><p>Researchers have studied the CRISPR-Cas bacterial defense systems intensively over the past decade but much less is known about anti-CRISPRs. For example, the natural diversity and prevalence of anti-CRISPRs is still unknown, and identifying these proteins has proven difficult.</p><p>To address this gap, Forsberg et al. developed a technique to identify new anti-CRISPRs based on their ability to inhibit CRISPR-Cas activity. The method relies on three elements. First, a piece of DNA that lets bacteria resist a specific antibiotic. Second, a test piece of DNA that might code for an anti-CRISPR. Third, a CRISPR-Cas system designed to target and destroy the antibiotic resistance DNA. The three elements are put into bacteria, and two things can happen. If the ‘test DNA’ does not code for an anti-CRISPR, then the CRISPR-Cas system destroys the antibiotic resistance DNA and the bacteria die when exposed to the antibiotic. On the other hand, if the test DNA does code for an anti-CRISPR, it will inhibit the CRISPR-Cas system and the antibiotic resistance DNA will remain intact. This means that the bacteria will survive when grown in the antibiotic, and new anti-CRISPRs can be found by examining the test DNA in those bacteria.</p><p>Forsberg et al. employed this strategy to screen a huge library of DNA pieces, uncovering several new anti-CRISPRs. They then focused on an anti-CRISPR that was very common in the human gut called AcrIIA11. Biochemical characterization showed that AcrIIA11 inhibited CRISPR-Cas via a different mechanism from other known anti-CRISPRs. Moreover, it could inhibit CRISPR-Cas systems from many different bacteria.</p><p>The potential to systematically identify anti-CRISPRs able to resist any bacterium’s CRISPR-Cas defense system could lead to the design of phages that can infect bacteria which are otherwise difficult to destroy. In the future, these phages could be used to clear antibiotic-resistant infections. Beyond its role as an antiviral system in bacteria, CRISPR-Cas is a widely used tool for genetic modification in biomedical research. Using anti-CRISPRs to regulate where, how, and when CRISPR-Cas systems act could make their many emerging applications safer and more effective.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR-Cas</kwd><kwd>anti-CRISPR</kwd><kwd>functional metagenomics</kwd><kwd>human microbiome</kwd><kwd>phage</kwd><kwd>bacterial defense systems</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. pyogenes</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Forsberg</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Seattle University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaiser</surname><given-names>Brett K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM105691</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stoddard</surname><given-names>Barry L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005895</institution-id><institution>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stoddard</surname><given-names>Barry L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Harmit S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 GM125201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dillard</surname><given-names>Kaylee E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM124131</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Finkelstein</surname><given-names>Ilya J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F-1808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Finkelstein</surname><given-names>Ilya J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A high-throughput, activity-based selection identifies many phage-derived inhibitors of Cas9 from human fecal and oral metagenomes, with at least one inhibitor acting via a novel mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems are present in many bacterial and archaeal genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burstein et al., 2016</xref>), where they protect their hosts from infection by phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>), plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008</xref>), and other mobile genetic elements (MGEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). CRISPR-Cas systems mediate this defense by incorporating short (~30 bp) spacer sequences from invading genomes into an immunity locus in the host genome. These spacer sequences are then expressed and processed into CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that, together with various Cas nucleases, mediate homology-dependent restriction of invading genomes. CRISPR-Cas systems are classified into six types (I, II, III, etc.) and 30 subtypes (I-A, I-B, II-C, etc.) on the basis of functional differences, phylogenetic relatedness, and locus organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Makarova et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In response to restriction, phages and other MGEs have evolved dedicated CRISPR-Cas antagonists, called anti-CRISPRs (Acrs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013</xref>), which can promote phage infection, enable horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and thus shape microbial ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borges et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pawluk et al., 2017a</xref>). Acrs that inhibit the type II Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pawluk et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rauch et al., 2017</xref>) and type V Cas12 systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watters et al., 2018</xref>) have also garnered significant interest in biotechnology, with demonstrated utility for reducing off-target Cas9 lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shin et al., 2017</xref>), suppressing gene drives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basgall et al., 2018</xref>), and precisely controlling synthetic gene circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakamura et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Work over the past decade has revealed much about the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hille et al., 2018</xref>), distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>), and evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koonin and Makarova, 2017</xref>) of CRISPR-Cas systems. In contrast, comparatively little is known about Acr diversity and function. Known Acrs inhibit only seven of the 30 CRISPR-Cas subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bondy-Denomy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Makarova et al., 2018</xref>), though it is quite likely that unidentified Acrs antagonize the remaining 23 groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pawluk et al., 2017a</xref>). In cases where antagonists of CRISPR-Cas systems have been identified, it is also likely that many additional, undiscovered Acrs exist to antagonize those systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watters et al., 2018</xref>). These undiscovered Acrs likely act via a diversity of mechanisms to influence gene flow and phage dynamics in microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Belkum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Westra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borges et al., 2017</xref>), and may unlock new modes of manipulating phage- and CRISPR-Cas-enabled technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sheth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knott and Doudna, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Previous efforts to discover <italic>acr</italic>s have relied on phage genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pawluk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hynes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2018</xref>), linkage to conserved genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pawluk et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pawluk et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hynes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marino et al., 2018</xref>) or the presence of a self-targeting CRISPR spacer, which would create an unstable autoimmune state if not for the presence of an Acr protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rauch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watters et al., 2018</xref>). These clever strategies have revealed many candidate <italic>acr</italic>s. However, they have also highlighted the difficulty of finding new <italic>acr</italic> genes based on homology, since <italic>acrs</italic> share little sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sontheimer and Davidson, 2017</xref>). As a result, most <italic>acr</italic>s almost certainly lie unrecognized among the many genes of unknown function in phages, plasmids, and other MGEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatfull, 2015</xref>).</p><p>To overcome the challenges associated with anti-CRISPR discovery, we devised a functional metagenomic selection that identifies <italic>acr</italic> genes from any cloned DNA, based on their ability to protect a plasmid from CRISPR-Cas-mediated destruction. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uribe et al. (2019)</xref> independently developed a similar Acr search strategy. Because functional metagenomics selects for a function of interest from large clone libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Handelsman, 2004</xref>), it is well-suited to identify individual genes like <italic>acr</italic>s that have strong fitness impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iqbal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forsberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forsberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Genee et al., 2016</xref>). This approach may be particularly useful for Acr discovery because Acrs are expressed from single genes and function readily in many genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pawluk et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rauch et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Using this functional selection, we find that many unrelated metagenomic clones from human oral and gut microbiomes protect against <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 (SpyCas9), the variant used most commonly for gene editing applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knott and Doudna, 2018</xref>). We identify a broadly distributed but previously undescribed Acr from the most potent SpyCas9-antagonizing clone in our libraries. This Acr, named AcrIIA11, binds both SpyCas9 and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and exhibits a novel mode of SpyCas9 antagonism, protecting both plasmids and phages from immune restriction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A functional metagenomic selection for type II-A anti-CRISPRs</title><p>We designed a functional selection that can isolate rare <italic>acr</italic>s from complex metagenomic libraries. We based this selection on the ability of an <italic>acr</italic> gene product to protect a plasmid, which bears an antibiotic resistance gene, from being cleaved by SpyCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). By screening metagenomes, our selection interrogates core bacterial genomes as well as DNA from the phages, plasmids, and other mobile genetic elements that infect these bacteria, which must contend with CRISPR-Cas immunity. Because most DNA inserts in large metagenomic libraries lack an <italic>acr</italic>, most clones in a library should be susceptible to SpyCas9-mediated destruction. However, those few DNA inserts that encode and express a functional Acr will resist SpyCas9 and can be recovered using the antibiotic resistance conferred by the plasmid they protect.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46540.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A functional metagenomic selection for type II-A anti-CRISPRs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In a metagenomic library, plasmids without <italic>acr</italic>s are targeted by SpyCas9 and eliminated.

Two crRNAs targeting two sites in the plasmid backbone reduce the number of target-site escape mutations, mitigating this source of false-positives. After transformed cells are allowed to recover, SpyCas9 is induced with arabinose and the library is subjected to SpyCas9 selection for twenty hours. Plasmids that survive this first round of selection are purified from Kan<sup>R</sup> clones and the pSpyCas9 plasmid is removed via digestion with I-SceI and RecBCD treatment. The metagenomic library is then subjected to SpyCas9 exposure a second time, which enriches for plasmid-intrinsic SpyCas9 resistance (<italic>i.e.</italic> what may be encoded by the metagenomic DNA inserts). The second iteration allows <italic>acr</italic>-encoding clones to be enriched above background, which is set by the frequency of SpyCas9 loss-of-function mutations.

All transformations use the pZE21-GFP control target plasmid and approximate a metagenomic library expressing only neutral functions. Surviving colonies therefore represent sources of false positives. A single iteration of SpyCas9 exposure reduces Kan<sup>R</sup> transformants by a factor of 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup>. This false-positive rate remained constant across all experiments except for one experiment that used a single target site on pZE21. In this experiment, mutations to the protospacer or PAM region of the SpyCas9 target site in pZE21 dominated, prompting two target loci to be used thereafter. All other colonies genotyped (those in asterisked experiments) escaped selection due to inactivating mutations in pSpyCas9 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S1). This loss-of-function rate, importantly, remained constant across rounds of selection, allowing for plasmid-intrinsic SpyCas9 resistance to be identified via two iterations through SpyCas9 selection. When libraries were subject to two rounds of selection, this plasmid-intrinsic resistance was predominantly due to genes encoded by its metagenomic DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46540-fig1-figsupp2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46540.006</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Coverage of assembled contigs by library.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coverage of each assembled contig before dataset processing.

Anticipating that resistance to SpyCas9 cleavage could arise readily via point mutations in target sites, we targeted SpyCas9 to two distinct loci within the <italic>Kan<sup>R</sup></italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) to reduce the frequency of these ‘escape’ plasmids. We transformed metagenomic libraries into an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain that contained SpyCas9 under an arabinose-inducible promoter. After the cells were allowed to recover, we grew them overnight with arabinose to induce SpyCas9 expression. During this phase, cells were not exposed to kanamycin and thus were not under selection to maintain the metagenomic library bearing the <italic>Kan<sup>R</sup></italic> gene. We then plated cells on solid media with kanamycin, killing cells in which SpyCas9 cleaved the <italic>Kan<sup>R</sup></italic> gene and allowing the recovery of metagenomic DNA from the few remaining Kan<sup>R</sup> colonies.</p><p>Our analysis revealed that SpyCas9 loss-of-function mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) dominated the Kan<sup>R</sup> population in early, single-iteration experiments, occurring in approximately 10<sup>−4</sup> to 10<sup>−5</sup> transformants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S1). We therefore added a second iteration of SpyCas9 selection, reasoning that the loss-of-function rate would remain constant across iterations, whereas <italic>acr</italic>-encoding clones would be enriched by a factor of ~10<sup>4</sup> with each iteration. In theory, this enables us to select for an <italic>acr</italic> gene even if it is present just once in a library of ~10<sup>7</sup> clones. To accomplish these two rounds of SpyCas9 selection, we purified total plasmid DNA from Kan<sup>R</sup> colonies following one iteration and removed the original SpyCas9 expression plasmid via digestion with I-SceI, a homing endonuclease that cleaves an 18 bp target sequence. We then transformed the surviving metagenomic plasmids into a fresh SpyCas9-expressing strain and exposed them to SpyCas9 selection a second time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, adding a second iteration of SpyCas9 selection resulted in a significant enrichment for <italic>bona fide</italic> SpyCas9 antagonists above background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SpyCas9 antagonism in human oral and fecal metagenomes</title><p>We used our functional selection to search for <italic>acr</italic>s in five metagenomic libraries: two oral metagenomes from Yanomami Amerindians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clemente et al., 2015</xref>) and three fecal DNA metagenomes from peri-urban residents of Lima, Peru (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pehrsson et al., 2016</xref>). We subjected each of these libraries, with an estimated 1.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> - 3.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> unique clones per library, to SpyCas9 selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S2). For each library, we observed a 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup>-fold reduction in the proportion of Kan<sup>R</sup>colony forming units (CFU) following one iteration of SpyCas9 selection. This value matches the reduction in Kan<sup>R</sup> CFU seen for a GFP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and the empirically determined frequency of SpyCas9 loss-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S1). Since Kan<sup>R</sup> is a measure of plasmid retention, this result indicates that most clones in each library cannot inhibit SpyCas9. Following a second round of SpyCas9 selection for each library, metagenomic inserts were amplified from pooled Kan<sup>R</sup> colonies by PCR, deep-sequenced, and assembled de novo using PARFuMS (<underline>P</underline>arallel <underline>A</underline>ssembly and <underline>R</underline>e-annotation of <underline>Fu</underline>nctional <underline>M</underline>etagenomic <underline>S</underline>elections) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forsberg et al., 2012</xref>). We used read-coverage over each assembled contig to estimate its abundance following selection. After quality-filtering (<italic>e.g.</italic> removal of low-abundance contigs), we recovered a total of 51 contigs across all five libraries that putatively antagonize SpyCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> tables S3, S4).</p><p>After two rounds of SpyCas9 selection, two libraries (Oral_5, Fecal_01A) seemed more likely to contain new <italic>acr</italic>s than the other three (Oral_3, Fecal_01E, Fecal_03G). The Oral_3 library poorly withstood SpyCas9 targeting, so was not studied further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Although the Fecal_03G library completely resisted SpyCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), subsequent analysis revealed that this was almost entirely due to a single clone that acquired mutations in both Cas9 target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S3). Accordingly, just one contig from this library passed quality filters. In contrast, the Fecal_01E library showed intermediate SpyCas9 resistance and was largely devoid of ‘escape’ mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S3). However, only one of the 18 contigs from this library was found to be phage-associated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S4). Because <italic>acr</italic>s are expected to originate in phages and MGEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borges et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pawluk et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sontheimer and Davidson, 2017</xref>), we predicted that contigs from Fecal_01E were unlikely to contain <italic>bona fide acr</italic>s and did not prioritize them in this study. These contigs may nonetheless encode anti-SpyCas9 activity, perhaps via Cas9 regulatory factors employed by host bacteria rather than MGEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Høyland-Kroghsbo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faure et al., 2019</xref>), and therefore could represent a useful resource for probing host regulation of SpyCas9 activity.</p><p>Contigs from the Oral_5 and Fecal_01A libraries looked most promising for <italic>acr</italic> discovery. These libraries conferred SpyCas9 resistance at levels 10-fold to 1,000-fold above background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, plasmids containing these contigs had few escape mutations in Cas9 target sites, so they likely withstood SpyCas9 due to functions encoded by their DNA inserts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S3). Finally, many contigs from these libraries were found to be phage-associated (30%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S4) and many encoded genes of unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); these are both hallmarks of known <italic>acr</italic>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borges et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pawluk et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sontheimer and Davidson, 2017</xref>).

Firstly, F01A_2 homologs are more closely related than are other homologs in these genomes, which suggests that the F01A_2 homologs (in bright colors) may have a more recent common ancestor than the other gene pairs (in gray).

Secondly, the genes on contig F01A_2 are not linked to one another across genomes and are routinely gained and lost, indicating that they recombine frequently, which is generally true for phage genes.

In our re-testing, we confirmed that F01A_2 completely inhibited SpyCas9 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Finally, F01A_2 shares near-perfect nucleotide identity (&gt;99.9%) with a <italic>Siphoviridae</italic> phage.

Nevertheless, AcrIIA11 potently inhibits SpyCas9, even though SpyCas9 is quite divergent from the type II-A Cas9 proteins found in AcrIIA11-encoding taxa. For instance, the only Cas9 protein in <italic>Clostridium_Q</italic> (CqCas9, NCBI accession CDD37961), AcrIIA11’s genus-of-origin, shares just 32% amino acid identity with SpyCas9. Intrigued by this observation, we tested divergent AcrIIA11 homologs from all three phylogenetic groups against SpyCas9 and found that homologs from each group could inhibit its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Because diverse AcrIIA11 homologs inhibit SpyCas9, we hypothesized that AcrIIA11 may intrinsically possess the capacity to antagonize a broad set of Cas9 orthologs.

Consistent with our predictions, we found that many homologs of AcrIIA11 can inhibit TdeCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). This indicates that AcrIIA11 can inhibit divergent Cas9 proteins, as has been observed for other Acrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrington et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marshall et al., 2018</xref>). Because homologs of AcrIIA11 are found in many genera prevalent within human gut microbiomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), its broad inhibitory range suggests that AcrIIA11 homologs will pose a meaningful barrier to Cas9 activity in this habitat – both in the context of natural phage infections as well as Cas9-based interventions to manipulate microbiome composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sheth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pursey et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems are enriched in the <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> relative to other bacterial families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, p=5×10<sup>−27</sup>, χ² test), which suggests that MGEs in these bacteria regularly encounter type II-A systems. This could explain why all tested AcrIIA11 homologs in the ‘a’ group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) inhibited SpyCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Nonetheless, a common theme has emerged from biochemical studies of AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4, the only type II-A Acrs for which a mechanism of Cas9 inhibition has been elucidated. These studies have shown that both AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4 are dsDNA mimics; they inhibit SpyCas9 by binding to its gRNA-loaded form and preventing association with a dsDNA target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang and Patel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2019</xref>).

These data demonstrate that AcrIIA11 is sufficient for SpyCas9 inhibition and does not require additional host or phage factors, at least in vitro.

Because the shorter substrate has minimal dsDNA overhangs (five bp), AcrIIA11 binding to adjacent dsDNA is not likely to result in the super-shift observed; instead, we conclude that AcrIIA11 binds SpyCas9 to trigger this super-shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Consistent with this model, we observe that AcrIIA11 retards the migration of apo-, sgRNA-loaded, and dsDNA-bound SpyCas9 through a native gel in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). These data suggest that AcrIIA11 binds a motif on SpyCas9 preserved across all three conformations of the enzyme. This also distinguishes AcrIIA11 from AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4, which bind to the dsDNA binding site of SpyCas9 only available in its sgRNA-loaded form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang and Patel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In addition to binding SpyCas9, AcrIIA11 binds dsDNA weakly in the absence of SpyCas9 (lanes 8 and 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), but strongly in the presence of either apo- or sgRNA-loaded SpyCas9 (compare ‘band #2’ in lanes 4 and 12 with 8 and 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We verified this behavior by Western blot, demonstrating that SpyCas9 does not co-migrate with ‘band #2’, thereby confirming that AcrIIA11 binds dsDNA to generate this gel-shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that AcrIIA11 undergoes a conformational change that enhances its dsDNA-binding upon interaction with SpyCas9. Consistent with this hypothesis, a Coomassie-stained native gel shows that AcrIIA11 forms a discrete, bright band in the presence of SpyCas9 but is more diffuse in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that SpyCas9 may stabilize a conformation of AcrIIA11.

These results further support our in vitro findings that the mechanism of AcrIIA4 and AcrIIA11 are substantially different. For example, AcrIIA4 binds SpyCas9 to prevent DNA target recognition, and can therefore inhibit SpyCas9 at all loci tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, AcrIIA11 homologs can robustly inhibit SpyCas9 only at some loci. This indicates that some feature of the target site (for instance, its chromatin state) might impact AcrIIA11’s activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The identification and characterization of CRISPR-Cas systems has outpaced the discovery of anti-CRISPRs, even though Acr diversity almost certainly exceeds CRISPR-Cas diversity in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pawluk et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watters et al., 2018</xref>). These undiscovered Acrs are likely to be important influences on both phage infection outcomes and horizontal gene transfer in natural microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borges et al., 2017</xref>). Determining the impact of Acrs on these processes is a challenge, however, because <italic>acr</italic>s lack shared sequence features and so are difficult to detect. To overcome this obstacle and enable function-based <italic>acr</italic> discovery, we developed a high-throughput selection that identifies <italic>acr</italic>s based solely on their activity. Applying our functional selection to human fecal and oral metagenomes, we recovered 51 DNA fragments that putatively antagonize SpyCas9, with 10 confirmed for activity; many additional host- or phage-encoded inhibitors are expected to be among the remaining 41 sequences.</p><p>In parallel work to ours, Uribe and colleagues recently described a functional metagenomic scheme to identify <italic>acr</italic>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uribe et al., 2019</xref>). They used a single round of Cas9 selection and one targeting crRNA to identify putative SpyCas9-antagonizing clones, though the authors suspected many of these to be false positives. To find <italic>acr</italic>s, they selected 39 ideal candidates from their initial dataset for re-testing, confirming 11 DNA fragments for anti-Cas9 activity, from which they identified four new <italic>acr</italic>s (<italic>acrIIA7-10</italic>). Although the premise of both of our approaches is similar, our strategy uses two iterations of SpyCas9 selection and two targeting crRNAs to identify <italic>acr</italic>s, which suppresses both Cas9 loss-of-function mutations and escape mutations in the target plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). As a result, we confirmed that 10 of the 14 most abundant clones following selection could antagonize SpyCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). More generally, we show that iterative selection can enable high-confidence discoveries from enormously diverse input libraries, which will be critical in the search for even rarer classes of <italic>acr</italic>s and other phage counter-defense strategies.</p><p>One of the major lessons from our work and that of Uribe et al is that the vast majority of <italic>acr</italic>s in nature remain undiscovered. Neither study encountered any previously described <italic>acr</italic>s and no <italic>acr</italic>s were shared across datasets, though more than 10<sup>7</sup> unique clones were screened for antagonists of the same Cas9 allele (SpyCas9) in the same selection host (<italic>E. coli</italic>). This lack of overlap emphasizes that the few <italic>acr</italic>s which have been catalogued are a very minor subset of those that are found in nature. This tremendous diversity exists because selection favors a highly-varied repertoire of <italic>acr</italic>s among even related MGEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borges et al., 2017</xref>) and because Acrs have evolved independently many times from a variety of progenitor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rollins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uribe et al., 2019</xref>). With extreme diversity favored, and the relative ease by which new Acr function is born, it is almost certain that much more mechanistic variety among Acrs remains to be discovered.</p><p>In this study, we have focused on the most potent SpyCas9 antagonist from our set — AcrIIA11 — extensively characterizing its phylogenetic distribution, functional range, and mechanism. SpyCas9 is unlikely to be the natural target of AcrIIA11, as it is quite divergent from the Cas9 homologs found in AcrIIA11-encoding bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chylinski et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, diverse AcrIIA11 homologs, which are distributed across multiple phyla, retain inhibitory activity against SpyCas9. This suggests that AcrIIA11 is intrinsically predisposed to act against a wide variety of Cas9 sequences, a prediction we verified by confirming that many AcrIIA11 homologs can inhibit a highly-diverged Cas9 ortholog from <italic>T. denticola</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Such inhibitory breadth may be particularly useful to MGEs that infect bacteria with diverse CRISPR-Cas systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawley et al., 2018</xref>) and could explain AcrIIA11’s broad phylogenetic distribution. This combination of prevalence and inhibitory breadth may also impact many Cas9-based interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sheth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pursey et al., 2018</xref>), especially in the gut microbiome, where AcrIIA11 homologs are particularly common.</p><p>Broad inhibition implies that AcrIIA11 might interact with conserved residues on Cas9. There is precedent for such biochemical activity in an Acr. For example, AcrIIC1, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of type II-C Cas9 enzymes, binds to conserved Cas9 residues to prevent nuclease activity but not target DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrington et al., 2017</xref>). The same outcome is achieved by AcrIE1 and AcrIF3, two inhibitors of type I CRISPR-Cas systems, as each Acr impairs Cas3 nuclease activity but does not affect target DNA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bondy-Denomy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pawluk et al., 2017b</xref>). No type II-A Cas9 inhibitor has been shown to act similarly, though AcrIIA11’s behavior in-vitro is consistent with such a mechanism; it binds SpyCas9, inhibits DNA cleavage, but does not prevent target recognition.</p><p>Alternatively, AcrIIA11’s inhibition of SpyCas9 could be related to dsDNA-binding ability. Though other Acrs can bind nucleic acids, such as AcrIIA1 and AcrIIA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hynes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ka et al., 2018</xref>), AcrIIA11 is the first Acr reported to bind both dsDNA and its target Cas protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stanley and Maxwell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trasanidou et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, interaction with SpyCas9 dramatically improves AcrIIA11’s dsDNA binding, linking these key behaviors. A role for dsDNA-binding in AcrIIA11’s mode of inhibition could explain why it inhibited SpyCas9 at only some genomic loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Chromatin state (or other locus-specific factors) would alter AcrIIA11’s access different SpyCas9 target sites which, in turn, would influence its ability to inhibit SpyCas9 at these loci. In comparison, AcrIIA4 interacts with SpyCas9 but not target DNA and, consistent with this model, inhibited SpyCas9 at all tested target sites.</p><p>While AcrIIA11’s exact mechanism still awaits elucidation, its mode of antagonism is clearly distinct from the other two mechanistically-characterized type II-A Acrs, AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4, which act as dsDNA mimics to prevent target recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang and Patel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). A combination of Acrs that act via different mechanisms may be more effective at inhibiting CRISPR-Cas activity than a combination of Acrs that act redundantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borges et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, AcrIIA11’s novel mode of antagonism could enable more potent SpyCas9 inhibition than can be achieved using only Acrs that act via dsDNA mimicry. AcrIIA11’s effectiveness against SpyCas9 at some loci in human cells reinforces this possibility and highlights its potential use for modifying new Cas9-based tools in medicine and research.</p><p>Excitingly, AcrIIA11 represents just the tip of the iceberg. We have identified 51 metagenomic clones that putatively antagonize SpyCas9 (with 10 confirmed for activity); many of these sequences are likely to contain new SpyCas9 inhibitors, that is, ones not homologous to any known Acr. Functional metagenomics not only offers a powerful means to identify new <italic>acr</italic> genes, but also enables discovery of fundamentally new ways to inhibit Cas9. More broadly, our functional metagenomic approach allows us to detect <italic>acr</italic>s beyond curated sequence databases and can enable the discovery of Acrs against any CRISPR-Cas system of interest, in any microbial habitat, strain collection, or phage bank. This information will improve our understanding of phage and MGE dynamics in microbial ecosystems and holds significant promise for not only describing the longstanding evolutionary arms race between phages and bacteria, but also for improving phage- and CRISPR-Cas-based technologies used in therapeutic and engineering applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Processing of metagenomic libraries</title><p>Metagenomic libraries were generously shared by Gautam Dantas (Washington Univ. in St. Louis) and have been described previously.

A sample PCR contained the following primer volumes, each from a 10 µM stock: (primer F1, <named-content content-type="sequence">5′-CCGAATTCATTAAAGAGGAGAAAG</named-content>, 0.83 µl); (primer F2, <named-content content-type="sequence">5′- CGAATTCATTAAAGAGGAGAAAGG</named-content>, 0.83 µl); (primer F3, <named-content content-type="sequence">5′- GAATTCATTAAAGAGGAGAAAGGTAC</named-content>, 0.83 µl); (primer R1, <named-content content-type="sequence">5′- GATATCAAGCTTATCGATACCGTC</named-content>, 0.36 µl); (primer R2, <named-content content-type="sequence">5′- CGATATCAAGCTTATCGATACCG</named-content>, 0.71 µl); (primer R3, <named-content content-type="sequence">5′-TCGATATCAAGCTTATCGATACC</named-content>, 1.43 µl). PCRs were then executed using the following conditions: 94°C for 2 min, 30 cycles of: 94°C for 10 s + 55°C for 30 s + 68°C for 5.5 min, and 68°C for 10 min. The amplified metagenomic fragments were cleaned using a Zymo Research DNA Clean and Concentrator column and eluted in 80 µl of Qiagen elution buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Illumina sample preparation and sequencing</title><p>For each sample, 50 µl of PCR amplicons were diluted to a final volume of 130 µl in Qiagen elution buffer and sheared to a fragment size of approximately 500 bp using a Covaris LE220 sonicator. Sheared DNA was purified and concentrated using a Zymo Research DNA Clean and Concentrator column and eluted in 25 µl nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O. DNA was then end-repaired for 30 min at 25°C using 250 ng sample in a 25 µl reaction with 1.5 units T4 Polymerase (NEB cat. # M0203), five units T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB cat. # M0201), 2.5 units Taq DNA polymerase (NEB cat. # M0267), 40 µM dNTPs, and 1x T4 DNA ligase buffer with 10 mM ATP (NEB cat. # B0202).

This reaction was incubated at 16°C for 40 min and heat-killed at 65°C for 10 min. The barcoded adapters contained a 7 bp sequence specific to each sample, which allowed mixed-sample sequencing runs to be de-multiplexed. Forward and reverse sequencing adapters were stored at 1 µM in TES buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.25) and annealed by heating to 95°C and cooling at a rate of 0.1 °C/sec to a final temperature of 4°C. Adapters were stored at −20°C and thawed slowly on ice before use. After adapter-ligation, samples were purified through a Zymo Research DNA Clean and Concentrator column and eluted in 12 µl of the supplied elution buffer.</p><p>Next, 6 µl from each sample was pooled together and the mixture size-selected to ~500–900 bp using a 1.9% agarose gel visualized with SYBR-Safe dye (Thermo Fisher cat. # S33102). DNA was purified from gel slices using a Zymo Research gel DNA recovery kit, eluting in 28 µl nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O. Purified DNA was then enriched by PCR; a sample 25 µl reaction (in 1x Phusion HF buffer) contained 6 µl purified DNA template, 0.5 µl dNTPs (10 mM), 0.25 µl Phusion polymerase (two units/µl, Thermo Fisher cat. # F530), and 1.25 µl each of the following primers (10 µM stock): (primer F, 5’ – AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT); (primer R, 5’ – CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT). PCRs were amplified for 30 s at 98°C, subjected to 18 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 65°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s, and then incubated at 72°C for 5 min. Following enrichment PCR, samples were size-selected a second time to ~500–900 bp as previously described and purified libraries quantified using the Qubit fluorimeter (HS assay). Finally, 300 cycles of paired-end sequence data were generated at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Genomics Core using a 17 pM loading concentration on an Illumina MiSeq machine with the v3 reagent kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Assembly and annotation of functional metagenomic selections</title><p>Illumina paired-end reads were binned by barcode (perfect match required) such that data from each titer plate was assembled and annotated independently. Metagenomic DNA fragments from each sample were assembled using the first 93 bp of each read with PARFuMS, a tool developed specifically for assembling small-insert functional metagenomic selections and which was optimized for shorter read lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forsberg et al., 2012</xref>). The PARFuMS assembler uses three iterations of Velvet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zerbino and Birney, 2008</xref>) with variable job size, two iterations of PHRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de la Bastide and McCombie, 2007</xref>), and custom scripts to clean reads, remove assembly chimeras, and link contigs by coverage and shared annotation, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forsberg et al., 2012</xref>). In sum, 206 contigs were assembled from all ten titer plates (encompassing five selections, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We predicted open reading frames (ORFs) from each contig with MetaGeneMark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>) using default parameters. Proteins were annotated by searching their amino acid sequences against the TIGRFAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haft et al., 2001</xref>) and Pfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bateman et al., 2000</xref>) profile HMM databases using HMMER3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finn et al., 2011</xref>). The highest-scoring profile was used to annotate each ORF (minimum e-value 1e<sup>−5</sup>); these automated annotations were curated by hand into the functional groups shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>The NCBI taxonomies of these contigs were determined using BLASTn against the ‘nt’ database; all contigs could confidently be assigned NCBI taxa at the resolution of order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S4). Seven assembled contigs matched pSpyCas9 (&gt;99% nucleotide identity) and were removed from the dataset. We also discarded contigs covered by less than two reads/base-pair/million reads (RPBM) to ensure contigs assembled from background DNA (<italic>i.e.</italic> plasmid backbone, host genome) were not considered (the coverage maximum among pSpyCas9-derived contigs was 1.67 RPBM, which informed our 2 RPBM cutoff). Then, contigs which could be linked to a mutation in either protospacer or protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) were eliminated (see Materials and methods section below). Note that we use the term ‘target site’ to refer to a particular protospacer/PAM sequence. Subsequently, redundant contigs assembled across both titer plates from a given library were removed with CD-HIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li and Godzik, 2006</xref>), using the following parameters: -c 0.95, -aS 0.95, -g 1 (the shorter contigs among clusters sharing 95% nucleotide identity over 95% the length of the shorter contig were removed). We checked for cross-contamination among the non-redundant contigs with a BLASTn search against the unfiltered contig set, detecting (and discarding) just one cross-contaminating contig (in library Fecal_01E). Manual curation of this near-final dataset prompted removal of one chimeric contig and the fusion of two incomplete assemblies. Note that the final dataset may exclude some metagenomic clones that inhibit SpyCas9, specifically those with mild antagonism or high fitness costs (rare among surviving colonies, with coverage &lt;RPBM = 2) and those which have acquired target site mutations yet also encode SpyCas9 antagonists (partial antagonism may potentiate target site mutation). Indeed, one contig (O5_7) contains a mutation in the PAM of target site B yet still confers SpyCas9 protection when re-cloned into a wild-type vector backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). On the basis of empirical antagonism, we include this contig in our final dataset (to give 51 final contigs across five selections, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> tables S3, S4), but exclude all untested contigs linked to target site mutations. While these exclusions may omit <italic>bona-fide</italic> SpyCas9 antagonism, their exclusion yields a dataset with higher-confidence enrichment for SpyCas9 antagonists.

For each sample, these reads were mapped to assembled contigs with bowtie2 (local alignment, unpaired reads, very-fast mode) and RPBM calculated for each contig.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Determining the proportion of wild-type target sites</title><p>To estimate the proportion of wild-type target sites in each library after two rounds of SpyCas9 selection, sample-specific reads (before vector-cleaning) were concatenated by library and mapped to the pZE21 vector with bowtie2 (end-to-end alignment, unpaired reads, sensitive mode). Base frequencies at each protospacer and PAM position were calculated using bam-readcount (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/genome/bam-readcount">https://github.com/genome/bam-readcount</ext-link>), requiring minimum mapping and base quality scores of 25 and 30, respectively. The proportion of wild-type target sites was conservatively calculated as the product of wild-type base calls at each protospacer/PAM position. In two libraries, (Oral_3 and Fecal_01E), sanger sequencing of individually picked colonies revealed a recombination event between a metagenomic DNA fragment and target site B, which would remove this SpyCas9 target from these clones (but avoid a frameshift within the kanamycin resistance gene). For these two libraries, reads were mapped to a variant of the pZE21 backbone corresponding to each recombination mutant. The proportion of reads mapping across the recombination site was compared to the proportion mapping to the wild-type vector backbone to estimate the frequency of recombination mutants in the population (0.4% and 24.2% for Oral_3 and Fecal_01E, respectively). The overall proportion of wild-type target sites in these libraries was then adjusted to reflect the proportion of these recombinants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S3).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Linking contigs to target site genotype</title><p>For some of the most abundant contigs in the final dataset, the genotype of the target site sequences in the corresponding plasmid backbone could be determined by Sanger sequencing individual Kan<sup>R</sup> clones following two rounds of SpyCas9 selection. To link additional contigs with target site genotype in the clones not sampled by our Sanger data, we examined paired-end reads that mapped to target site sequences and an assembled contig. Because we used PCR to amplify metagenomic fragments before Illumina library creation, only a small minority of reads mapped to the vector backbone. Additionally, target sites A and B are 514 bp and 365 bp from the clone site of pZE21, respectively, so only read pairs from long sequencing inserts could link target site and contig genotype. Accordingly, many assembled contigs remain without links to target site genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), though the overall proportion of wild-type target sites serves as a proxy for the number of SpyCas9 antagonists versus escape mutants in a given library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S3).</p><p>For each titer plate, paired-end reads were mapped to a reference database containing all assembled contigs in both forward and reverse orientations within the pZE21 plasmid. We used bowtie2 in ‘no-mixed’ mode to consider only paired reads with an insert size ≥515 bp when mapping against this reference database (additional mapping options: end-to-end alignment, paired reads, sensitive mode). Only reads with a mapping quality score over ten were considered. We determined the true orientation of a metagenomic DNA fragment by counting whether more reads mapped across the clone-site junctions of the contig in the forward or reverse orientation. If more than one mapped read supported a particular protospacer/PAM variant, the contig linked to that target site was removed from the final dataset. Similarly, if fewer than ten reads mapped to a target site, a single read with any deviation from a wild-type protospacer/PAM was sufficient to eliminate the corresponding contig from further consideration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Predicting phage-associated contigs</title><p>The assembled metagenomic contigs (N50 length 2.2 Kb) were too short to provide sufficient information content for phage prediction based on their nucleotide sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roux et al., 2015</xref>). Instead, protein sequences were used: those with close relatives in predicted phages were used to classify their parent contig as phage-associated. Predicted proteins from each contig were queried against NCBI’s NR database using BLASTp (on September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2017) and the top five unique hits retained from each query. For each BLAST hit, we downloaded sequence 25 Kb upstream and downstream of the corresponding gene sequence and used these ~50 KB sequences as input for phage prediction with VirSorter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roux et al., 2015</xref>). Sequences were compared against VirSorter’s more encompassing ‘virome’ database (using default parameters) and hits to bacteriophage of any confidence category (from ‘possible’ to ‘most confident’) were considered phage-associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roux et al., 2015</xref>). The proteins that seeded these bacteriophage predictions were used then to classify metagenomic DNA contigs.

Five contigs were represented in a sparsely-sampled set of individually-picked and Sanger-sequenced colonies. In these cases, the corresponding plasmids were re-transformed into NEB Turbo, target site sequences confirmed as wild-type by additional Sanger Sequencing, and the plasmids co-transformed with pSpyCas9 into NEB Turbo for functional testing. The remaining contigs were amplified by PCR from the plasmid preparations used for Illumina library construction. PCR primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S7) targeting the junction between pZE21 and the assembled contigs were used to facilitate re-cloning of the amplified fragments into pZE21 by Gibson assembly.

For AcrIIA11, these thresholds were roughly equivalent to an e-value threshold of 1e<sup>−50</sup> following three iterative psi-BLAST searches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We chose to use percent-identity and query-length thresholds to retrieve Acr homologs, rather than psi-BLAST e-values, because the position-specific scoring matrix used in psi-BLAST searches are not comparable across queries. We found that many AcrIIA11 homologs were derived from bacteria with phylogenetically-ambiguous taxonomic labels in NCBI. For instance, the NCBI genus ‘Clostridium’ is extremely polyphyletic, appearing in 121 genera and 29 families in a rigorous re-assessment of bacterial phylogeny performed by the genome taxonomy database, or GTDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parks et al., 2018</xref>).

To make phylogenetically meaningful inference with respect to AcrIIA11, we adopted the GTDB taxonomic scheme which, crucially, is largely congruent with NCBI taxonomy outside a few key problem areas (e.g. Clostridiales, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S4). The taxonomic assignments for AcrIIA1-6 homologs are unchanged between NCBI and GTDB schema.</p><p>To map protein homologs onto a bacterial genus tree, the NCBI genome assemblies corresponding to each homolog were downloaded and classified according to the GTDB scheme using the ‘classify_wf’ workflow within GTDB toolkit (v0.1.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parks et al., 2018</xref>); default parameters were used. To visualize these classifications on a tree of life, the minimal phylogenetic tree encompassing all lineages encoding AcrIIA1-6 or AcrIIA11 homologs was downloaded from AnnoTree (v1.0; node ID 31285).

In some cases, additional homologous gene pairs were identified via shared annotation, consistent operon structure, and conserved genome organization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Phylogenetic tree of AcrIIA11 homologs</title><p>The gene tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> was built using the homologs in NCBI (see above section) and additionally a set of homologs identified via a BLASTP search of IMG/VR (the January 1, 2018 release), a curated database of cultured and uncultured DNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paez-Espino et al., 2017</xref>). An e-value cutoff of 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup> was used in the IMG/VR homolog search. A preliminary phylogeny of all AcrIIA11 homologs was used to select genes that optimally sample AcrIIA11 diversity for gene synthesis and anti-Cas9 activity screening. The final phylogeny contains unique NCBI homologs and the viral homologs which were selected for gene synthesis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S8 for sequences and accession numbers). Alignments were performed using the Geneious (v8) alignment tool and a maximum-likelihood tree was generated with PhyML using the LG substitution model and 100 bootstraps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Codon-optimized AcrIIA4 and AcrIIA11 were cloned into pET15b to contain thrombin-cleavable 6XHis N-terminal tags, with and without C-terminal 2xStrep2 tags. All plasmids were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) RIL cells except the C-terminally-tagged AcrIIA11 variant, which was transformed into a BL21(DE3) pLysS strain. Overnight cultures were grown in LB/Ampicillin (100 µg/mL), diluted 100-fold into 1 L pre-warmed LB/Amp media, grown until an OD600 of 0.6–0.8, then incubated on ice for 30 min. IPTG was added to 0.2 mM, and the cultures where shaken for 18–20 hr at 18°C. The cells were pelleted and stored at −20°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis/wash buffer (500 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mM Imidazole), lysed by sonication, and centrifuged for 25 min in an SS34 rotor at 18,000 rpm for 30 min. The soluble fraction was filtered through a 5 µm filter and incubated in batch with Ni-NTA resin (Invitrogen, Cat# R90115) at 4°C for 1 hr. The resin was transferred to a gravity filtration column and washed with at least 50 volumes of wash buffer, followed by elution in 200 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mM Imidazole. The buffer was exchanged into 200 mM NaCl/25 mM Tris, pH 7.5 by concentrating and diluting using an Amicon filter (EMD Millipore, 10,000 MWCO). Biotinylated thrombin (EMD Millipore) was added (1 U per mg of protein) and incubated for 16 hr at 18°C. Streptavidin-agarose was then used to remove thrombin according to the manufacturer’s instructions (EMD Millipore). The proteins were diluted to 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, loaded onto a 1 mL HiTrapQ column (GE Life Sciences), and eluted by a sodium chloride gradient (150 mM to 1 M over 20 mL). Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated, bound to Ni-NTA to remove any uncleaved proteins, and the flow-through was purified via size exclusion chromatography (using Superdex75 16/60 (GE HealthCare) or SEC650 (BioRad) columns) in 200 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> depicts size exclusion chromatography data for thrombin-cleaved AcrIIA11 lacking a 2xStrep2 tag.

The protein was expressed and purified over Ni-NTA as described above. The eluate from the Ni-NTA resin was dialyzed into 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, with 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol. It was simultaneously cleaved overnight with homemade TEV protease at 4°C. The cleaved protein was loaded onto a 1 mL heparin HiTrap column (GE) in 300 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, 7.5 and eluted in a gradient extending to 1 M NaCl/25 mM Tris, 7.5. Pooled fractions were concentrated and buffer-exchanged with 200 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), and 20 mM imidazole, and bound to Ni-NTA to remove uncleaved fusion proteins. The flow-through was purified over a Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer containing 200 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, and 2 mM DTT. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated to 3–6 mg/mL, flash frozen as single-use aliquots in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. A second SpyCas9 variant was also expressed and purified from a pET28a backbone (addgene #53261) as described above except that tags were not removed. This second SpyCas9 variant includes an N-terminal 6xHis tag, a C-terminal HA-tag, and a C-terminal NLS sequence. DNA cleavage assays and Acr pulldowns were performed using tagged SpyCas9, whereas EMSAs used the untagged version. EMSAs were also performed using the tagged SpyCas9 variant and the results did not differ between SpyCas9 purifications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>sgRNA Generation</title><p>sgRNA was generated by T7 RNA polymerase using Megashortscript Kit (Thermo Fisher #AM1354).

Thereafter all incubations and washes were carried out at 4°C or on ice. The beads were washed a total of four times, including one tube transfer, by centrifuging 1 min at 2000 rpm, carefully aspirating the supernatant with a 25 gauge needle and resuspending the beads in 100 µl binding buffer. After the final bead aspiration, Strep-tagged proteins were eluted by resuspending in 40 µl of 1X BXT buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Biotin, pH 8.0) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers reviewers, including Peter Turnbaugh as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal their identity: Joe Bondy-Denomy (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Forsberg and colleagues present a functional metagenomic selection to enrich for DNA fragments that encode for anti-CRISPR (acr) proteins. The application of this method to oral and gut metagenomic libraries led to the discovery and functional characterization of a novel type of acr that acts in a manner distinct from published acrs and is found in multiple genomes from the dominant taxonomic groups present in the human gut. This platform is incredibly promising for accelerating the unbiased identification of acrs and providing new insights into the interactions between viruses and bacteria within the human body.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This paper is clearly written and describes an approach that should be widely applicable with a new finding. However, the novelty is reduced somewhat by the following factors: (1) Uribe et al. report a similar screen with more proteins discovered, (2) reporting only a single Acr does not seem to fully harness the elegance and throughput of the screen that the authors established and optimized, (3) it is expected that new anti-CRISPRs with novel sequences are out there, (4) while the mechanism of action appears to be novel to type II-A (as described by the authors), two concerns remain: a) the in vitro data generate confusion about how it is actually working, and the mechanism is not novel per se, as the authors clearly state in the discussion, where cleavage inhibition has been shown with AcrIIC1 (and missing AcrF3/AcrE1, conceptually similar).</p><p>The manuscript could be greatly improved by doing one or more of the following:</p><p>1) Identify more genes that inhibit SpCas9 with the existing screen, or by looking at the neighbors of AcrIIA11 shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><p>2) Provide further mechanistic details, which could be obtained by exploring the non-specific DNA interactions, shortening the DNA substrate, etc.</p><p>3) Test the spectrum of activity of this new protein with assays against orthologous Cas9 proteins.</p><p>4) Perform in vivo (bacterial or eukaryotic) experiments that test the predictions of the mechanistic work (i.e. confirming that this Acr would turn SpCas9 into dSpCas9 with phage or reporter experiments)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46540.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This paper is clearly written and describes an approach that should be widely applicable with a new finding.

Despite the thematic overlap, the mechanics or our screen differ significantly from theirs. Moreover, we feel that our work is significantly distinguished from Uribe et al. by the depth of analysis we provide for a single Acr family, AcrIIA11, which is distinct from any previous discovery (including those reported in Uribe et al). In addition to the extensive discussion of Uribe et al. in our original submission, we now highlight their work in our introduction to make the thematic overlap more transparent.</p><p>We have updated our Discussion section to avoid implying that Acrs with novel sequence are a surprise finding. Instead, we emphasize in our introduction and discussion that many new Acrs likely exist in nature and that functional metagenomics is a promising strategy for their discovery.</p><p>We address the remainder of the comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript could be greatly improved by doing one or more of the following:</p><p>1) Identify more genes that inhibit SpCas9 with the existing screen, or by looking at the neighbors of AcrIIA11 shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, as suggested by one of the reviewers (below), we adopted a ‘guilt-by-association’ approach first highlighted in Pawluk et al., (2016). We cloned 17 genes that flank AcrIIA11a.1 and AcrIIA11a.2 in host genomes and tested them for SpyCas9 antagonism using a plasmid protection assay (Figure 4—figure supplement 3B,3C). We chose these loci because they also contained putative homologs of the anti-CRISPRassociated (aca) gene aca4. Unfortunately, although a few of these 17 genes protected a target plasmid marginally better than GFP, none were as potent as bona fide SpyCas9 inhibitors. We report the sequence and activity of these candidate genes in our revised manuscript. We acknowledge that these partial inhibitors may exhibit anti-CRISPR activity in other situations, (e.g., in different hosts or against different CRISPR-Cas systems), consistent with their genomic context, and discuss this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide further mechanistic details, which could be obtained by exploring the non-specific DNA interactions, shortening the DNA substrate, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed several additional experiments to respond to this request:</p><p>First, we explored these non-specific DNA interactions (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B) and have performed EMSAs with a short DNA substrate (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). These data reveal two key properties of AcrIIA11:</p><p>i) AcrIIA11 binds the SpyCas9/sgRNA/dsDNA ternary complex to create the ‘super-shift’ in Figure 6, instead of binding adjacent sDNA.</p><p>ii) AcrIIA11 is stimulated to bind dsDNA in the presence of SpyCas9.</p><p>Second, in response reviewer point #25 (below), we ruled out sgRNA binding as a potential mechanistic explanation for AcrIIA11’s SpyCas9 inhibition (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Third, we demonstrate that AcrIIA11 triggers a similar ‘super-shift’ using apo-SpyCas9, sgRNA-loaded SpyCas9, and a SpyCas9/sgRNA/dsDNA ternary complex (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). These findings suggest that AcrIIA11 binds a SpyCas9 motif preserved across all three conformations.</p><p>While we do not yet have a comprehensive understanding of AcrIIA11’s mode of SpyCas9 inhibition, our new data give us a clearer picture of AcrIIA11’s activity, moving us closer to that goal. These data also support our central conclusion about AcrIIA11’s mechanism – that it is different than any other type II-A Acr. Taken together, we believe that our additional biochemical experiments add enough new mechanistic information to satisfactorily address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Test the spectrum of activity of this new protein with assays against orthologous Cas9 proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. In response to this request, we performed an entirely new series of experiments testing AcrIIA11 homologs against the type II-A CRISPR-Cas9 system from Trepenoma denticola in a plasmid protection assay. We find that many of our A11 homologs protect against TdeCas9, described in Figure 4—figure supplement 4. These data support our hypothesis that AcrIIA11 acts broadly against Cas9.</p><p> <italic>4) Perform</italic> in vivo <italic>(bacterial or eukaryotic) experiments that test the predictions of the mechanistic work (i.e. confirming that this Acr would turn SpCas9 into dSpCas9 with phage or reporter experiments).</italic></p><p>Although we like the hypothesis that AcrIIA11 might turn SpyCas9 into dCas9, our mechanistic findings also leave open other possibilities. Nevertheless, to test the effects of AcrIIA11 inhibition in vivo, we now include an entirely new set of experiments (performed in collaboration with the Finkelstein lab) that show AcrIIA11 does not rely on bacteria-specific factors. These experiments (described in new Figure 7) show that AcrIIA11 can inhibit SpyCas9 in a human cell line, HEK-293T, but only at some loci. This suggests some feature of the target site (for instance, its chromatin state) impacts AcrIIA11’s activity. Additionally, AcrIIA11’s effectiveness in human cells widens its potential uses for modifying new Cas9-based tools in medicine and research.</p></body></sub-article></article>
