behavior. It is widely believed that this spiking mode depends upon an interaction between synaptic activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and intrinsic oscillatory mechanisms. However, the role of specific neural networks in burst generation has not been defined. To begin filling this gap, SNc glutamatergic synapses arising from pedunculopotine nucleus (PPN) neurons were characterized using optical and electrophysiological approaches. These synapses were localized exclusively on the soma and proximal dendrites, placing them in a good location to influence spike generation. Indeed, optogenetic stimulation of PPN axons reliably evoked spiking in SNc dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, burst stimulation of PPN axons was faithfully followed, even in the presence of NMDAR antagonists. Thus, PPN-evoked burst spiking of SNc dopaminergic neurons in vivo may not only be extrinsically triggered, but extrinsically patterned as well.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>basal ganglia</kwd><kwd>pedunculopontine nucleus</kwd><kwd>burst firing</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>glutamate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007457</institution-id><institution>JPB Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galtieri</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name><name><surname>Estep</surname><given-names>Chad M</given-names></name><name><surname>Wokosin</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name><name><surname>Surmeier</surname><given-names>D James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>IDP Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galtieri</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name><name><surname>Estep</surname><given-names>Chad M</given-names></name><name><surname>Wokosin</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name><name><surname>Surmeier</surname><given-names>D James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galtieri</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name><name><surname>Estep</surname><given-names>Chad M</given-names></name><name><surname>Wokosin</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name><name><surname>Surmeier</surname><given-names>D James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pedunculopontine neurons can evoke burst spiking in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons without engaging a subtype of glutamate receptor previously thought to be necessary for this spiking mode.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SNc dopaminergic (DA) neurons play a central role in modulating goal directed actions and habits, which are under the control of the basal ganglia. As such, a great deal of effort has been devoted to understanding what governs the activity of SNc DA neurons. The spiking behavior of these cells can be placed into one of two broad categories – a single spiking, low-frequency (&lt;10 Hz) mode and a multi-spike, higher frequency, ‘burst’ mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grace and Bunney, 1984a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1984b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hyland et al., 2002</xref>). The single spiking mode is critical for maintaining ambient levels of DA in target structures, while the burst mode is thought to be a fundamental signal for action selection and reward-based learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schultz, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The single spiking mode of SNc neurons is generated by an intrinsic pacemaking mechanism involving the cooperation of a number of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shepard and Bunney, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nedergaard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Puopolo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kimm et al., 2015</xref>). This behavior is preserved in the absence of synaptic input, and is observed in both dissociated and ex vivo brain slice preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Puopolo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, burst spiking is lost in preparations lacking functionally intact synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shepard and Bunney, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnson and Wu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blythe et al., 2007</xref>) and is disrupted in vivo by local application of glutamatergic receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grace and Bunney, 1984b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charlety et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Overton and Clark, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Smith and Grace, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chergui et al., 1993</xref>), demonstrating the necessity of synaptic activity for the production of these events.</p><p>Because local infusion of NMDAR antagonists in vivo reduced burst activity in anesthetized rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Overton and Clark, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chergui et al., 1993</xref>), subsequent studies have focused on the potential mechanisms by which NMDARs might generate naturally occurring bursts. Indeed, NMDARs can amplify intrinsic oscillatory activity and promote the transition from slow, single spike pacemaking to a burst pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wilson and Callaway, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kuznetsov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deister et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuznetsova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ha and Kuznetsov, 2013</xref>). In contrast, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs), the other ionotropic glutamate receptor found at SNc glutamatergic synapses, appear unable to produce burst activity like that observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shepard and Bunney, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnson and Wu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deister et al., 2009</xref>). However, local electrical stimulation of glutamatergic axons can induce burst-like spiking in SNc DA neurons that is dependent upon AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Georges and Aston-Jones, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blythe et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>One of the missing pieces in this story is an interrogation of specific glutamatergic inputs to SNc DA neurons. Rabies virus tracing studies have identified a handful of glutamatergic neurons that synapse on SNc DA neurons, including those in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), cerebral cortex, the superior colliculus and the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</xref>). Of these, the PPN is of particular interest because of the strength of its projection to SNc and its connectivity with the rest of the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clarke et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lavoie and Parent, 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charara et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mena-Segovia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, PPN neurons respond to environmental events in a way that resembles SNc DA neurons, including burst spiking in response to salient and rewarding stimuli, but at latencies shorter than those observed in DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Condé et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kobayashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pan and Hyland, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Norton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Thompson and Felsen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hong and Hikosaka, 2014</xref>). Moreover, activation of the PPN in vivo can evoke repetitive spiking in SNc DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Scarnati et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lokwan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Floresco et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hong and Hikosaka, 2014</xref>), and ablation of the PPN disrupts learning operant tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Inglis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bortolanza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Syed et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these observations suggest that PPN glutamatergic neurons might be able to generate patterned activity in SNc DA neurons, particularly bursts. To isolate the influence of PPN glutamatergic neurons on SNc, a combination of optogenetic and pharmacological tools were used. Subcellular optogenetic mapping revealed that PPN glutamatergic synapses were focused on the soma and proximal dendrites, near the axon initial segment. Indeed, stimulation of PPN axons reliably evoked spikes within SNc neurons at a variety of firing rates, including those observed in in vivo bursts. The ability of PPN axons to drive spiking was dependent solely upon AMPARs, not NMDARs. Thus, in addition to NMDAR-dependent forms of burst spiking, where the pattern of activity is dependent upon an interaction between synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms, the pattern of PPN-evoked burst spiking may be extrinsically determined.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PPN-SNc glutamatergic synapses had Ca<sup>2+</sup> impermeable AMPARs and GluN2D containing NMDARs</title><p>Injections of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) ChR2-eYFP driven by the human Synapsin I (hSyn) promoter were made in to the PPN of wild-type or DAT-Cre/Ai14-tdTomato mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The ability of AIS spikes to evoked full SD spikes should be dependent upon the excitability of the SD region, which should be determined by ongoing pacemaking. To test this hypothesis, individual spikes were evoked by optical stimulation of PPN axons at different points in the pacemaking cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When the stimulus occurred towards the end of normal pacemaking cycle, the evoked spikes were indistinguishable from spontaneously occurring spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). In contrast, when spikes were evoked early in the oscillation, just after a spontaneously occurring spike, they exhibit more hyperpolarized spike thresholds and reduced amplitudes, as evident in plots of the first derivative of membrane voltage (dV/dt) as a function of membrane voltage (mV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>).

First, a somatic whole cell recording was established and the cell filled with dye to allow visualization of the dendrites and axon. The axon was identified by the presence of a retraction ball (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atherton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blythe et al., 2009</xref>). Once identified, a second pipette was used to record from the axon in a loose-seal configuration. Recordings were then simultaneously made of both spontaneous and evoked spikes from the soma and axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). Spontaneously recorded somatic spikes invariably propagated into the axon, as expected. More importantly, PPN-evoked spikes were also invariably seen in the axon, regardless of the phase of the pacemaking cycle and the somatic appearance of the spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). Plotting the instantaneous spike frequency within the axon as a function of the instantaneous spike frequency in the soma confirmed this relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). Failure of the somatically recorded spikes to invade the axon would lead to points below the linear trend line, but this was not seen as all somatic spikes showed corresponding axonal spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). This finding is in agreement with previous work showing that AIS spikes alone are capable of triggering axonal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grace and Bunney, 1983b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30352.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>PPN-evoked spikes reliably invade the axon.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reconstruction of an example cell where two recording electrodes are clearly visible.

The most widely held view is that bursts are produced by intrinsic oscillatory mechanisms engaged by activation of dendritic NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Esposito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morikawa and Paladini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Paladini and Roeper, 2014</xref>). Our results expand this landscape to include an additional mechanism by which bursts can be generated. In particular, they show that bursts could be produced by patterned stimulation of PPN synapses formed on proximal dendrites near the AIS. Engagement of NMDARs was not necessary for burst generation in this case. Moreover, in contrast to the conventional model, this mechanism allows bursts to be generated and structured independently of ongoing pacemaking activity or synaptic input to more distal dendrites, like that arising from tonic activity in pallidal and nigral GABAergic neurons. Being able to precisely control the timing and duration of bursts could prove to be important to movement control, particularly that triggered by external events.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>PPN glutamatergic synapses target proximal dendrites</title><p>Our experiments provide the first characterization of the receptor complement at PPN glutamatergic and the sub-cellular distribution of these synapses on SNc DA neurons. Optogenetic approaches allowed the selective activation of axons originating in the PPN. Pharmacological tools allowed the receptor subtypes at these synapses to be determined. As in most adult glutamatergic synapses, the AMPARs at PPN synapses were Ca<sup>2+</sup>-impermeable, as judged by their lack of rectification and insensitivity to philanthotoxin-74. Moreover, as expected from previous work examining NMDARs at unidentified synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jones and Gibb, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brothwell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Suárez et al., 2010</xref>), the NMDARs at PPN synapses were GluN2B/D containing. More specifically, the magnitude of the NMDAR block achieved by ifenprodil was that expected of a triheteromeric, GluN2B/D containing receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hatton and Paoletti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang and Gibb, 2014</xref>). The ability of the GluN2C/D potentiator (CIQ) to increase NMDAR currents further supports the proposition that triheteromic GluNB/D containing receptors are present at this synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jones and Gibb, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang and Gibb, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although the composition of ionotropic glutamate receptors at PPN synapses was expected, their sub-cellular distribution, as revealed by the sCRACM technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fieblinger et al., 2014</xref>), was not. In contrast to the broad distribution of postsynaptic glutamate receptors and STN synapses, PPN glutamatergic synapses were found only on proximal dendrites. This location specificity places these synapses near the AIS, which typically arises from proximal portions of a primary dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blythe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Matsuda et al., 2009</xref>). It remains to be determined whether synapses made by other glutamatergic regions innervating the SNc (e.g., superior colliculus) have a similar distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>An alternative mechanism for burst generation</title><p>The positioning of PPN glutamatergic synapses on proximal dendrites near the AIS should maximize their ability to control spike generation. Indeed, at low optical stimulation intensities, SNc DA neurons faithfully followed the pattern of PPN stimulation, even at high frequencies. This behavior suggests that PPN synapses near the AIS are capable of driving spike generation independently of NMDARs. The AIS origin of the PPN evoked spikes was consistent with several features of the somatic recordings, including the dependence of the nominal spike threshold and amplitude on the phase of the pacemaking cycle and the faithful propagation of evoked spikes down the axon. Although focal optical stimulation of dendrites that did not bear the AIS might have evoked dendritic spikes that would have manifested greater dependence on the pacemaking cycle, it remains to be determined whether individual PPN axons have terminal fields that are restricted to a single dendrite or diverge to contact several dendrites, including the AIS bearing one.</p><p>The degree of PPN convergence on individual SNc DA neurons also is uncertain. Optogenetic stimulation artificially synchronizes spiking in PPN axons, producing a temporal summation of synaptic inputs that may not occur in vivo. This could lead to an over-estimation of the ability of PPN to control the patterning of SNc DA neuron spiking, particularly bursting. However, it is possible that individual SNc DA neurons are innervated by a small number of PPN axons; in this case, synchronization of inputs becomes much less of a concern. The steep relationship between optical stimulus intensity and SNc DA neuron spike probability is consistent with this possibility. This kind of mapping between PPN and SNc would provide an explanation for the variability in SNc burst patterns observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grace and Bunney, 1984b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hyland et al., 2002</xref>). However, to definitively answer this question, anatomical approaches will be needed. One possibility is single cell mapping experiments using tracer fills of individual PPN axons. Alternatively, a rabies-based retrograde tracing could be employed by generating a sparse starter populations within the SNc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wickersham et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Regardless, these experiments demonstrate that PPN glutamatergic synapses are capable of determining the precise timing of SNc DA neuron spikes that are propagated down the axon to target structures, like the striatum. Moreover, PPN synapses were capable of driving precisely structured bursts, like those recorded in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grace and Bunney, 1984b</xref>). This result is consistent with previous studies showing that focal application of glutamate to proximal dendrites, as well as local electrical stimulation of glutamatergic axons, was capable of producing spike bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blythe et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2009</xref>).</p><p>Thus, there appear to be two general mechanisms by which spike bursts can be generated in SNc DA neurons. In contrast to the PPN-driven mechanism, previous studies have shown that local application of glutamate can evoke bursts that depend upon activation of NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnson and Wu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deister et al., 2009</xref>). In vivo, SNc DA neuron burst spiking can be attenuated by NMDAR antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charlety et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Overton and Clark, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Smith and Grace, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chergui et al., 1993</xref>) or genetic deletion of NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zweifel et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, stimulation of the STN in vivo increases burst firing in SNc DA in an NMDA-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Smith and Grace, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chergui et al., 1994</xref>). The bursts generated in this way harness the intrinsic oscillatory mechanisms of dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deister et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuznetsova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ha and Kuznetsov, 2013</xref>). The dependence upon intrinsic oscillatory mechanisms will undoubtedly allow pacemaking and ongoing synaptic input, particularly GABAergic synaptic activity, to influence the timing of bursts, contrasting it with the ‘short-circuiting’ of these processes by PPN synapses. Another interesting feature of the NMDAR-dependent burst is its dependence upon the voltage-dependence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> block. Using the dynamic clamp technique, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deister et al. (2009)</xref> showed that removal of NMDAR voltage sensitivity associated with Mg<sup>2+</sup> block abolished burst firing. Given that tri-heteromeric GluN1-GluN2B-GluN2D NMDARs found at PPN synapses have lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang and Gibb, 2014</xref>), it could be that more distally located NMDARs have a different subunit composition that enhance their ability to promote bursts. Lastly, it is unclear to what extent extra-synaptic NMDARs play a role in burst generation. Given the differences in postsynaptic signaling by synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hardingham and Bading, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>), the differential engagement by the two different modes of burst generation could have important long-term consequences.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional consequences of PPN control of SNc</title><p>There are several lines of evidence suggesting that the PPN exerts a strong control over DA neuron spiking in vivo.

Moreover, lesioning the PPN disrupts dopamine-dependent learning in a variety of behavioral tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Inglis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bortolanza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jimenez-Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Syed et al., 2016</xref>).

Our results show that this activity provides a potent excitation of SNc DA neurons that may be important to modulating striatal circuits controlling movement sequences. This inference is consistent with the observation that phasic activity in SNc DA neurons is temporally correlated not only with the outcomes of actions, but action itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>).

The 2P excitation source was a Chameleon-Ultra series tunable (690–1040 nm) Ti:sapphire laser system (Coherent Laser Group, Santa Clara, CA). Alexa and Fluo-4 dyes were excited using 820 nm (80 MHz pulse repetition frequency and ~140 fs pulse duration) excitation, while Fura-2 was imaged at 780 nm. Laser power attenuation was achieved with two Pockels' cell electro-optic modulators (models M350-80-02-BK and M350-50-02-BK, Con Optics, Danbury, CT) controlled by PrairieView 5.0–5.3 software. The two cells were aligned in series to provide enhanced modulation range for fine control of the excitation dose (0.1% steps over five decades), to limit maximum power, and to serve as a rapid shutter during line scan acquisitions. The fluorescence emission was collected by non–de-scanned photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). Green channel (490–560 nm) signals were detected by a Hamamatsu H7422P-40 select GaAsP PMT, which was protected during blue laser exposures with a Uniblitz DSS10B-1-T-0 shutter (Vincent Associates). Red channel (580–630 nm) signals were detected by a Hamamatsu R3982 side on PMT. Cell visualization during laser scanning was made possible by a Dodt-tube-based transmission detector with a mirror routing the laser to a Hamamatsu R3982 side on PMT (Prairie Technologies; Middleton, WI). Scanning signals were sent and received by the PCI-NI6110 analog-to-digital converter card in the system computer (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Scanned images were built up pixel by pixel (dwell time: 10–12 µs), with PMT anode current to voltage conversion and sampling fixed in 0.4 µs increments. For calcium imaging, line scans were performed along 5–10 µm sections of dendrite (6 ms and 512 pixels per line). Cells were allowed to fill for a minimum of 30 min to allow for dye equilibration. Calcium fluorescence signals were background-subtracted and normalized by a baseline fluorescence (f<sub>0</sub>).

The launch optics were designed to provide ~1 um spot stimulation at the focal plan of the 60x/1.0NA objective lens; additional optics allowed for this spot size to be increased to ~10 um. Generally, a 1.0ND filter was employed to reduce the maximal power at the sample from ~18 mW to ~1.8 mW. Laser power was further controlled by the PrairieView software. A second pair of galvanometer mirrors within the Ultima scan head allowed for multiple stimulation points within the focal plane of interest.

The brain was then removed and allowed to further fix in PFA overnight, and then washed and stored in PBS. Brains were sectioned in to 100 µm parasagittal slices on a Leica VT1200 S vibratome. Sections were mounted on with ProLong Diamond (ThermoFischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) and imaged with an Olympus FV10i confocal laser scanning microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Both electrophysiological and imaging data were analyzed using either GraphPad Prism (version 5.0, GraphPad Software), Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), or custom written python analysis scripts using a number of numerical python packages: pandas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McKinney, 2010</xref>), SciPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jones et al., 2001</xref>), and statsmodels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Seabold and Perktold, 2010</xref>). Figures were created with matplotlib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunter, 2007</xref>) or GraphPad Prism and Adobe Illustrator.

Data were summarized using box plots showing median values, first and third quartiles, and whiskers at 10th and 90th percentiles. Summary statistics are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Sample <italic>n</italic> represents the number of neurons collected from brain slices from a minimum of three animals. Sample size was based on prior studies published from our lab and others using similar techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blythe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sanchez-Padilla et al., 2014</xref>). Statistical analysis was performed with either SciPy, statsmodels, or GraphPad Prism using non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U-test of significance or Wilcoxon signed rank test for between or within-subject design experiments, respectively) except where otherwise noted. To correct for multiple comparisons the Holm-Bonferroni method was used, with the reported p-value representing the adjusted p-value. Probability threshold for statistical significance was p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the JPB Foundation, the IDP Foundation and NIH (NS 047085).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John T Williams (Reviewer #2); Charles Wilson (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers and the BRE find that this study describes an important input/ mechanism that could mediate phasic responses of DA neurons in vivo. However, there is no direct testing that the mechanism presented mediates bursting in vivo. Everyone agreed that in vivo experiments, although important, would take too long for this study. So the consensus was not to ask for new experiments, but instead for a change in language so that the paper does not claim that this is the mechanism for DA neuron bursting in vivo. The authors could still suggest that this may mediate phasic responses of DA neurons in the discussion, and also suggest that this is a novel mechanism which may mediate responses to stimuli or movement. This summary should guide your response to the individual reviewer comments.</p><p>Below are the detailed comments of the reviewers that may help prepare the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors propose that SN DA neuron burst firing is regulated by PPN input, with the SNDA neurons following optogenetic activation of the PPN. The authors further propose that burst firing may be driven in a spike-to-spike manner by patterned burst firing of the PPN. While this is an intriguing finding, the suggestion that this underlies burst firing pattern of SNDA neurons is far from validated. First, with optogenetic stimulation, all of the PPN-SN fibers are activated simultaneously; a situation that does not exist in vivo. Secondly, it cannot account for the ability of NMDA blockade in vivo in preventing burst firing of SNDA neurons. Third, burst firing has never been shown to occur simultaneously across neurons in the SN (which one would expect from a burst PPN input), but occurs with a range of ISIs, burst length, etc. And finally, and importantly, the timing of the burst (length, ISI) of PPN neurons does not follow the characteristics of burst firing in DA neurons, with substantially longer ISIs. Therefore, while this is clearly a powerful and important input that is well-characterized here both anatomically and electrophysiologically, to suggest that it underlies burst firing would require substantially more data, including tonic activation of the PPN (e.g., with DREADDs or pharmacologically), demonstration in vivo that bursting in PPN parallels temporally burst firing in SNC, and the ability to prevent burst firing in vivo (including NMDA-driven burst firing) to be able to support such a specific mechanism. I would suggest the authors focus on the powerful PPN-SNC connection, the extensive characterization of the glutamatergic mechanisms, and its implications for driving normal firing or modulating output, rather than trying to force their data into a tenuous explanation of burst firing that is strongly countered by a rather substantial body of data.</p><p>Subsection “PPN glutamatergic synapses were capable of spike patterning” – There is an explanation for the truncated action potentials that has been published before. In fact the explanation provided in the next paragraph is identical to that demonstrated 30 years ago. Specifically, it has been shown (see early Grace papers) that antidromic activation of DA neurons often triggers only an IS spike and not a full IS-SD spike. This was shown using in vivo intracellular recording that with somatic depolarization, a full spike is triggered. The explanation is that during normal firing, the soma is first depolarized by the pacemaker conductance, allowing the IS spike to spread into the dendrites to trigger dendritic spiking. However, with AD, the soma is hyperpolarized, and the is spike cannot spread to depolarize the dendritic tree.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript describes the glutamate input from the peduculopontine nucleus (PPN) to dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra compacta in the mouse. Whole cell, perforated patch and loose cell attached recordings were made in combination with optogenetic activation of PPN axons, electrical stimulation and glutamate uncaging to pharmacologically define the subunit composition of the AMPA and NMDA receptors. The results show that GluA2 containing subunits make up AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors contained GluN1, GluN2B and GluN2C/D subunits at this synapse. The most interesting observation is that the inputs from PPN more or less selectively innervate the cell body and proximal dendrites. This pattern of innervation resulted in reliable activation of action potentials in the axon and cell body. The conclusion was that the AMPA receptor activation arising from the PPN alone is capable of driving burst activity in dopamine neurons.</p><p>1). This is a concise manuscript that describes comprehensively one key excitatory input onto dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. As such this is an important contribution.</p><p>2) The experiments use appropriate methods and the results support the conclusions.</p><p>3) A series of important controls are included that support the most interesting observation that the inputs from the PPN selectively innervate proximal dendrites and therefore are key regulators of soma/axonal excitability. As far as I know, this is the first demonstration of a selective distribution of excitatory afferents on dopamine neurons and is an important observation.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is an original and unexpected finding on the synaptic origins of burst firing in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Studies in vivo had implicated NMDA receptors as essential, but were not successful at determining the nigral afferent pathway that was directly responsible for bursts. It is important because burst firing in dopaminergic neurons has been hypothesized to be a final common pathway for the internal model of reward prediction. It seems unlikely that the dopaminergic neuron receives direct sensory and memory-related inputs required to synthesize a reward prediction. It is usually assumed that these signals are synthesized elsewhere and combined at the level of the dopaminergic neuron. This paper suggests that the actual combination of sensory and memory information may occur at an even more unexpected location, pedunculopontine nucleus of the pontine reticular formation.</p><p>The experiments use optogenetic activation of afferents from the pedunculopontine nucleus to trigger bursts in dopaminergic cells. The authors do a good job of verifying their stimulus and characterizing the contribution of the various glutamate receptor subtypes.</p><p>A key part of the finding is the demonstration that the synapses responsible are located proximally. For this they use focal optogenetic stimulation. They argue that the proximal location of the synaptic input is key for the generation of burst firing, because fast proximal synchronous activation of the synapses could drive spiking at high frequencies. Spikes could be driven with this stimulus at rates and in patterns that could not be followed by the entire somatodendritic membrane, suggesting that the proximity of the input to the axonal spike generator allowed firing at rates the soma could not sustain. They showed that these partial spikes were propagated down the axon. But it was surprising that fast spiking driven by this stimulus did not depend on NMDA receptors.</p><p>The experiments are well designed and skillfully executed. The figures and the writing are very clear and illustrative. I think the paper is very convincing.</p><p>My only concern is that the authors don't explain how a burst in vivo can actually be generated in their scheme. It seems essential that the neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus fire in synchrony at high frequency, in a style similar to that used in the experiment, to drive a burst in the dopaminergic neurons. The dopaminergic neurons under these circumstances should also fire synchronously. Is this what happens? Or could single PPN neurons fire bursts which are sufficient to trigger identical bursts, spike-for-spike in some small subset of dopaminergic neurons. In that case asynchronous bursts in PPN neurons could produce asynchronous bursting in the SNC. But then single PPN neurons must be effective at triggering spikes. Is there any indication of how powerful a single PPN neuron is?</p><p>One implication of this that the authors do not discuss is the function of the dopaminergic neuron in burst formation. This is, of course, the reason for studying all this in the first place. Their scheme seems to make the dopaminergic cell a mere relay for reward-prediction bursts generated in the PPN. This of course does not explain how the brain can do reward prediction, it merely passes the buck to the PPN. How closer does this get us to understanding reward prediction? Can the PPN synthesize reward prediction error?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30352.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers and the BRE find that this study describes an important input/ mechanism that could mediate phasic responses of DA neurons in vivo.

This summary should guide your response to the individual reviewer comments.</p><p>Below are the detailed comments of the reviewers that may help prepare the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>It was not our intention to give the impression that we were describing THE mechanism responsible for burst spiking in vivo. The current view of burst spiking in SNc DA neurons is that NMDARs are necessary. Our point was simply to provide an example where this wasn’t the case. In the revision, we have attempted to make this point clear and to underscore the limits of our experimental approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors propose that SN DA neuron burst firing is regulated by PPN input, with the SNDA neurons following optogenetic activation of the PPN. The authors further propose that burst firing may be driven in a spike-to-spike manner by patterned burst firing of the PPN. While this is an intriguing finding, the suggestion that this underlies burst firing pattern of SNDA neurons is far from validated.</p><p>First, with optogenetic stimulation, all of the PPN-SN fibers are activated simultaneously; a situation that does not exist in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Optogenetic stimulation induces synchrony in a subset of PPN axons; it does not activate ALL PPN axons. Nevertheless, it is true that it does induce a degree of synchrony that is unlikely to occur in vivo. But, this is also true other methods that have been used to probe the mechanisms controlling spike generation in SNc neurons (e.g., iontophoresis of glutamate or electrical stimulation of afferent fibers). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4 Supplement 1</xref>, we attempted to alleviate this concern by grading the optical stimulation intensity to estimate the extent of the PPN fiber recruitment that was necessary to reliably evoke spikes. As seen in this figure, this relationship was very steep and plateaued at low photon doses, suggesting that only a relatively small number of fibers was necessary for spike generation. The revision has been edited to make this point more clearly. More importantly, the paper makes the point that PPN synapses have the <italic>potential</italic> to control the spiking of SNc neurons by virtue of their preferential, proximal dendritic location, near the axon initial segment; this positioning allows them to produce burst spiking without NMDARs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, it cannot account for the ability of NMDA blockade in vivo in preventing burst firing of SNDA neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>The available evidence suggest that NMDAR blockade or genetic removal reduces, but does not eliminate burst spiking in SNc DA neurons of mice in an open field. There is no compelling evidence that NMDAR blockade affects burst spiking generated by salient or rewarding stimuli. In fact, the work of Zweifel et al,. (2009) argues that many behaviors that recent work has shown to be correlated with burst spiking in SNc DA neurons – like the initiation of movement (Howe and Dombeck, 2016) – are unaffected by genetic deletion of NMDARs. Our view, which has been significantly expanded in the revision, is that there are several ways in which bursts are generated in SNc DA neurons. What our work does it to broaden this ‘burst canvas’ to include NMDAR-independent mechanisms. Again, this does not exclude NMDAR-dependent mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, burst firing has never been shown to occur simultaneously across neurons in the SN (which one would expect from a burst PPN input), but occurs with a range of ISIs, burst length, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>There is no reason to think that all of the glutamatergic PPN neurons spike in synchrony. If only a few PPN neurons control each SNc DA neuron, then there can be a high degree of heterogeneity in the burst spiking of SNc DA neurons. This point is made in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And finally, and importantly, the timing of the burst (length, ISI) of PPN neurons does not follow the characteristics of burst firing in DA neurons, with substantially longer ISIs.</p></disp-quote><p>While the observation made by Pan and Hyland (2005) indicate that PPN neurons fire at much higher frequencies in response to sensory cues than do SNc neurons, work by others has shown a much closer overlap in the spiking patterns of PPN and SNc neurons encoding predicted rewards and reward delivery (Hyland et al., 2002; Kobayashi and Okada, 2007; Okada et al., 2009; Hong and Hikosaka, 2014). That said, given the uncertainty about the extent of PPN axon convergence on SNc DA neurons, there need not be any relationship between burst patterning in PPN and SNc – other than onset. Again, we have attempted to make this point in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, while this is clearly a powerful and important input that is well-characterized here both anatomically and electrophysiologically, to suggest that it underlies burst firing would require substantially more data, including tonic activation of the PPN (e.g., with DREADDs or pharmacologically), demonstration in vivo that bursting in PPN parallels temporally burst firing in SNC, and the ability to prevent burst firing in vivo (including NMDA-driven burst firing) to be able to support such a specific mechanism. I would suggest the authors focus on the powerful PPN-SNC connection, the extensive characterization of the glutamatergic mechanisms, and its implications for driving normal firing or modulating output, rather than trying to force their data into a tenuous explanation of burst firing that is strongly countered by a rather substantial body of data.</p></disp-quote><p>SNc DA neurons receive glutamatergic input from several sources other than PPN: cortical pyramidal neurons, subthalamic nucleus neurons, superior colliculus neurons to name a few. We make no claims about the ability of these inputs to generate NMDAR-dependent bursts. Our only point is that PPN synapses, by virtue of their unusual positioning close to the axon initial segment, are capable of patterning spiking in SNc DA neurons without the engagement of NMDARs. Previous work (Grace and Bunney, 1983; Häusser et al., 1995; Blythe et al., 2009) is consistent with this proposition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “PPN glutamatergic synapses were capable of spike patterning” – There is an explanation for the truncated action potentials that has been published before. In fact the explanation provided in the next paragraph is identical to that demonstrated 30 years ago. Specifically, it has been shown (see early Grace papers) that antidromic activation of DA neurons often triggers only an IS spike and not a full IS-SD spike. This was shown using in vivo intracellular recording that with somatic depolarization, a full spike is triggered. The explanation is that during normal firing, the soma is first depolarized by the pacemaker conductance, allowing the IS spike to spread into the dendrites to trigger dendritic spiking. However, with AD, the soma is hyperpolarized, and the is spike cannot spread to depolarize the dendritic tree.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer pointing out this reference. It has been added to the revision. However, it is important to point out that what was shown in our paper were synaptically generated, orthodromic spikes, not antidromically evoked spikes. Moreover, the IS-SD spike differences with antidromically evoked spikes was shown much earlier in other neurons by Eccles and colleagues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript describes the glutamate input from the peduculopontine nucleus (PPN) to dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra compacta in the mouse. Whole cell, perforated patch and loose cell attached recordings were made in combination with optogenetic activation of PPN axons, electrical stimulation and glutamate uncaging to pharmacologically define the subunit composition of the AMPA and NMDA receptors. The results show that GluA2 containing subunits make up AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors contained GluN1, GluN2B and GluN2C/D subunits at this synapse. The most interesting observation is that the inputs from PPN more or less selectively innervate the cell body and proximal dendrites. This pattern of innervation resulted in reliable activation of action potentials in the axon and cell body. The conclusion was that the AMPA receptor activation arising from the PPN alone is capable of driving burst activity in dopamine neurons.</p><p>1). This is a concise manuscript that describes comprehensively one key excitatory input onto dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. As such this is an important contribution.</p><p>2) The experiments use appropriate methods and the results support the conclusions.</p><p>3) A series of important controls are included that support the most interesting observation that the inputs from the PPN selectively innervate proximal dendrites and therefore are key regulators of soma/axonal excitability. As far as I know, this is the first demonstration of a selective distribution of excitatory afferents on dopamine neurons and is an important observation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their time in evaluating our work and for their supportive comments in response to our presented findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is an original and unexpected finding on the synaptic origins of burst firing in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Studies in vivo had implicated NMDA receptors as essential, but were not successful at determining the nigral afferent pathway that was directly responsible for bursts. It is important because burst firing in dopaminergic neurons has been hypothesized to be a final common pathway for the internal model of reward prediction. It seems unlikely that the dopaminergic neuron receives direct sensory and memory-related inputs required to synthesize a reward prediction. It is usually assumed that these signals are synthesized elsewhere and combined at the level of the dopaminergic neuron. This paper suggests that the actual combination of sensory and memory information may occur at an even more unexpected location, pedunculopontine nucleus of the pontine reticular formation.</p><p>The experiments use optogenetic activation of afferents from the pedunculopontine nucleus to trigger bursts in dopaminergic cells. The authors do a good job of verifying their stimulus and characterizing the contribution of the various glutamate receptor subtypes.</p><p>A key part of the finding is the demonstration that the synapses responsible are located proximally. For this they use focal optogenetic stimulation. They argue that the proximal location of the synaptic input is key for the generation of burst firing, because fast proximal synchronous activation of the synapses could drive spiking at high frequencies. Spikes could be driven with this stimulus at rates and in patterns that could not be followed by the entire somatodendritic membrane, suggesting that the proximity of the input to the axonal spike generator allowed firing at rates the soma could not sustain. They showed that these partial spikes were propagated down the axon. But it was surprising that fast spiking driven by this stimulus did not depend on NMDA receptors.</p><p>The experiments are well designed and skillfully executed. The figures and the writing are very clear and illustrative. I think the paper is very convincing.</p><p>My only concern is that the authors don't explain how a burst in vivo can actually be generated in their scheme. It seems essential that the neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus fire in synchrony at high frequency, in a style similar to that used in the experiment, to drive a burst in the dopaminergic neurons. The dopaminergic neurons under these circumstances should also fire synchronously. Is this what happens? Or could single PPN neurons fire bursts which are sufficient to trigger identical bursts, spike-for-spike in some small subset of dopaminergic neurons. In that case asynchronous bursts in PPN neurons could produce asynchronous bursting in the SNC. But then single PPN neurons must be effective at triggering spikes. Is there any indication of how powerful a single PPN neuron is?</p></disp-quote><p>First of all, we thank the reviewer for their encouragement and positive comments. Second, the reviewer raises an excellent question – one for which we don’t have an answer. We’re grappling with strategies that would allow us to get at an answer but we’re not there yet. What we have done in the revision is raise the broader question in the Discussion section and pose some potential strategies for answering it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One implication of this that the authors do not discuss is the function of the dopaminergic neuron in burst formation. This is, of course, the reason for studying all this in the first place. Their scheme seems to make the dopaminergic cell a mere relay for reward-prediction bursts generated in the PPN. This of course does not explain how the brain can do reward prediction, it merely passes the buck to the PPN. How closer does this get us to understanding reward prediction? Can the PPN synthesize reward prediction error?</p></disp-quote><p>A very insightful and intriguing set of questions – questions that we don’t have answers to. That said, we can speculate. PPN neurons likely provide information about stimulus salience, actual reward presentation and movement initiation to the SNc. These are all events that have been reported to generate SNc bursts. Recent work has shown that SNc DA neurons transiently fire at the onset of movement (Howe and Dombeck, 2016). Cells within the PPN have been shown to also fire prior to movement, with many cells showing directional preference (Thompson and Felsen, 2013). Glutamatergic cells in the PPN have been particularly tied to the role PPN plays in locomotion, with basal ganglia circuits being implicated as regulators of these cells (Roseberry et al., 2016). What is less likely is that PPN provides a reward prediction error signal, as PPN neurons continue to respond to fully conditioned stimuli, regardless of prediction error (Dormont et al., 1998; Kobayashi and Okada, 2007; Okada et al., 2009). This distinction is made in the revision and underscores the heterogeneity in burst generation and SNc signaling.</p></body></sub-article></article>
