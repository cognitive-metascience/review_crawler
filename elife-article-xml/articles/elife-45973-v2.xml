However, current dCas9-based gene activators are still limited by their unsatisfactory activity. In this study, we developed a new strategy, the CRISPR-assisted <italic>trans</italic> enhancer, for activating gene expression at high efficiency by combining dCas9-VP64/sgRNA with the widely used strong CMV enhancer. In this strategy, CMV enhancer DNA was recruited to target genes in <italic>trans</italic> by two systems: dCas9-VP64/csgRNA-sCMV and dCas9-VP64-GAL4/sgRNA-UAS-CMV. The former recruited <italic>trans</italic> enhancer by annealing between two short complementary oligonucleotides at the ends of the sgRNA and <italic>trans</italic> enhancer. The latter recruited <italic>trans</italic> enhancer by binding between GAL4 fused to dCas9 and UAS sequence of <italic>trans</italic> enhancer. The <italic>trans</italic> enhancer activated gene transcription as the natural looped <italic>cis</italic> enhancer. The <italic>trans</italic> enhancer could activate both exogenous reporter genes and variant endogenous genes in various cells, with much higher activation efficiency than that of current dCas9 activators.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR/dCas9</kwd><kwd>CMV enhancer</kwd><kwd>trans enhancer</kwd><kwd>gene activation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>61571119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jinke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Both exogenous and endogenous genes can be highly activated in cells by a new dCas9-based activator, CRISPR-assisted <italic>trans</italic> enhancer, that can be used to activate genes for biomedical applications.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) was originally identified in the immune system of bacteria, with the function of destroying the invading microphage DNA by enzymatic digestion. The system has been developed into a highly efficient gene editing tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mali et al., 2013c</xref>), and also into new gene activators. For example, the dead Cas9 (dCas9) and its associated single guide RNA (sgRNA) have been widely used to regulate gene expression in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominguez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hilton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kiani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mali et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Radzisheuskaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Both dCas9 and sgRNA have been engineered for activating or repressing gene expression. For instance, the dCas9 protein has been fused with various gene activation or repression domains, such as VP48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>), VP160 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perrin et al., 2017</xref>), VP64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maeder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perez-Pinera et al., 2013</xref>), VPR (VP64-p65-Rta) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chavez et al., 2015</xref>), and KRAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the dCas9 protein has been fused with other functional domains with transcriptional regulatory functions, such as p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hilton et al., 2015</xref>), LSD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kearns et al., 2015</xref>), Dnmt3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saunderson et al., 2017</xref>), and Tet1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choudhury et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2016a</xref>). Based on these domains, more elaborate activators have been developed for more potent activation of target genes in mammalian cells, such as SunTag (dcas9-GCN4/sgRNA plus scFV-VP64) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanenbaum et al., 2014</xref>) and SPH (dCas9-GCN4/sgRNA plus scFV-p65-HSF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, some inducible dCas9 systems have been developed to control activity of dCas9 activators in cells, such as light-activated CRISPR/Cas9 effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nihongaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Polstein and Gersbach, 2015</xref>), hybrid drug inducible CRISPR/Cas9 technology (HIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2018</xref>), and CRISPR activator gated by human antibody-based chemically induced dimerizers (AbCIDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is difficult to package most of these dCas9 fusion proteins into adeno-associated virus (AAV) for in vivo application.</p><p>sgRNA has also been engineered to develop new dCas9-based activators. Compared with dCas9 engineering, sgRNA is more simple, flexible, and efficient to redesign. Moreover, the engineered sgRNA is more helpful for the in vivo application of dCas9-based activators because of its limited length for virus packaging. The most widely used sgRNA-based gene activator is the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) system, in which MS2 loops are fused to the 3′ end of sgRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Konermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liao et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, Pumilio/FBF (PUF), modular scaffold RNAs (MS2, PP7, and com), and riboswitches have been fused to sgRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zalatan et al., 2015</xref>). However, these chimeric sgRNA-based strategies were limited by their complicated RNA aptamers and the cognate RNA-binding fusion proteins.</p><p>Although variant dCas9-based activators have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Qi, 2017</xref>), the current dCas9-based transcriptional activators are relatively inefficient in endogenous gene activation and cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). By a systematic comparison of relative potency and effectiveness across various cell types and species (human, mouse, and fly) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chavez et al., 2016</xref>), it was found that the majority of second-generation activators had higher activity than that of dCas9-VP64, with the three most potent activators being VPR, SAM, and Suntag. The three activators were consistently better than VP64 across a range of target genes and cellular environments. Moreover, the three activators showed a similar level of activity, and fusing their elements did not yield more potent activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chavez et al., 2016</xref>). Novel, more potent dCas9-based activators might be built by creating other architectures.</p><p>Almost three decades ago, the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/promoter (referred to as CMV enhancer hereafter) was found. It is a natural mammalian promoter with high transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boshart et al., 1985</xref>). Later studies showed the CMV enhancer to be a strong enhancer in various mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boshart et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foecking and Hofstetter, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 1990</xref>). This enhancer has been widely used to drive ectopic expression of various genes in a wide range of mammalian cells, and to drive ectopic expression of exogenous genes in broad tissues in transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Furth et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmidt et al., 1990</xref>), protein production by gene engineering, and gene therapy. We have recently improved the transcriptional activity of the CMV enhancer by changing the natural NF-κB binding sites into artificially selected NF-κB binding sequences with high binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we conceived that a unique architecture may be constructed to improve dCas9-based activators using the CMV enhancer.</p><p>In this study, mimicking the natural enhancer activating gene expression by a loop structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tolhuis et al., 2002</xref>), we developed a new dCas9-based activator by combining dCas9/sgRNA with CMV enhancer. The 3′ end of sgRNA was redesigned to contain a short capture sequence complementary to a stick-end of a double-stranded CMV enhancer. The CMV enhancer was anchored to the promoter region of a target gene by dCas9/sgRNA. The dCas9/sgRNA-recruited CMV enhancer thus functioned like a natural looped <italic>cis</italic> enhancer in a <italic>trans</italic> form. We found that the new activator could efficiently activate exogenous and endogenous genes in various cells. More importantly, the CMV enhancer could be also recruited to a target gene in <italic>trans</italic> using another system consisting of dCas9-VP64-GAL4/sgRNA and UAS-CMV.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Principle of gene activation by a CRISPR-assisted <italic>trans</italic> enhancer</title><p>The principle of activating gene expression by a CRISPR-assisted <italic>trans</italic> enhancer is schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>.

A linear stick-end CMV (sCMV) enhancer was produced by adding a 3′ end single-strand overhang. The overhang can anneal with the csgRNA capture sequence. When dCas9 protein was guided to the promoter of the target gene by csgRNA, sCMV could be recruited by csgRNA. The recruited sCMV may activate the transcription of the target gene like a natural looped <italic>cis</italic> enhancer.

The results indicated that the target DNA could be digested by all sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), indicating that the capture sequence did not affect the sgRNA function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Activation of exogenous reporter gene by <italic>trans</italic> enhancer</title><p>To determine whether the CRISPR-assisted <italic>trans</italic> enhancer activates gene expression, we constructed a reporter construct of HNF4α promoter (pEZX-HP-ZsGreen). 293 T cells were then transfected with various vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The results revealed that expression of variant exogenous and endogenous genes could be highly activated by CRISPR-assisted <italic>trans</italic> enhancers in various mammalian cells, more efficiently than with current widely used dCas9-VP64 and dCas9-VPR. This strategy has unique advantages over the current dCas9-based gene activation systems.</p><p>First, only one csgRNA was used in activating all target genes in various cells with the CRISPR-assisted <italic>trans</italic> enhancer. However, in current dCas9-based gene activations, multiple sgRNAs are used. In general, three or more sgRNAs are used to activate a gene of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maeder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mali et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perez-Pinera et al., 2013</xref>). In many assays with various numbers of sgRNAs, one sgRNA often produced very low or undetectable expression. Using multiple sgRNAs, each sgRNA has to be independently transcribed by a long U6 promoter. Second, csgRNA is the simplest sgRNA used in dCas9-based gene activators, which only extended a 24 bp short sequence at the 3′ end of normal sgRNA. However, current dCas9/sgRNA activators often use long complex chimeric sgRNAs that harbor multiple tandem aptamers of various RNA-binding proteins, such as SAM sgRNA (MS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Konermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liao et al., 2017</xref>), Casilio sgRNA (Pumilio/FBF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>), and scaffold RNAs (MCP, PCP, and Com) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zalatan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The capture sequences of csgRNA can be easily designed. We originally designed three different capture sequences. All functioned in the CRISPR-assisted <italic>trans</italic> enhancer; however, csgRNA2 showed the best performance. The capture sequences were artificially designed short sequences, they have no complementary sequences in human cells, which is important for their specific annealing with sCMV at high efficiency. This study demonstrated that sCMV could be efficiently captured by csgRNA in the nucleus of human cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a gene being activated by an artificial DNA in <italic>trans</italic>.</p><p>In this study, we realized the CRISPR-assisted <italic>trans</italic> enhancer with two forms: csgRNA-sCMV and GAL4-UAS. Two forms can be easily used to activate genes in in vitro cultivated cells. As to the in vivo applications, the csgRNA-sCMV-based <italic>trans</italic> enhancer can be used via nanoparticle gene carriers, while the GAL4-UAS-based <italic>trans</italic> enhancer can be easily transferred by virus vectors such as AAV, with AAV already being approved for use as a gene vector in clinics. We found that the GAL4-UAS-based <italic>trans</italic> enhancer had better performance than the csgRNA-sCMV-based <italic>trans</italic> enhancer, especially the linear UAS-CMV. In in vivo applications, the linear UAS-CMV can be easily transferred by AAV vector.</p><p>As a typical application, dCas9-based transcriptional activators are used to reprogram cells in vitro and in vivo for biomedical applications by activating endogenous genes. For example, fibroblasts were reprogramed into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by endogenous activation of the Oct4 and Sox2 genes with dCas9-SunTag-VP64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Gene activation by a CRISPR-assistant <italic>trans</italic> enhancer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Irwin Davidson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While the referees found the concept of tethering an enhancer element in trans as a novel and innovative approach to activate expression of chosen endogenous cellular genes, they were unanimously concerned by the lack of information on the reproducibility of the data, the absence of appropriate statistical tests and important missing controls. The presentation of the data made it difficult to assess the efficiency of the system and the many of the experiments will have to be repeated again and the data presented in a much more rigorous fashion. The referees would encourage the authors to take note of the many suggestions and comments that would have to be addressed in any future manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper describes a novel system to tether an CMV enhancer element in trans to selected regions of the genome using CRISPR/CAS9 allowing the selective activation of chosen target genes. They show that activation by this method is more efficient that CAS9-VP64 and that the two systems can be used cooperatively.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>To demonstrate the specificity of the technique, the authors should perform experiments with a version of the CMV enhancer in which key bases have been mutated to impair the binding of transcription factors. This would demonstrate the importance of using a functional enhancer. The authors may also consider experiments using cell-specific enhancers and demonstrating that the system can used in a cell-type specific manner. This is not essential for the message of the paper but may give added value to the study.</p><p>In Figure 2 and Figure 3 as well as Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Figure 2—figure supplement 4 the results of the ZsGreen assays are absolutely not clear. What are we supposed to compare, how by looking at the figures can we assess the activation in the different conditions? Also, in the text, there are no precise figures given concerning the fold activation in each condition. In Figure 4A, there are only 2 transfections so there are no robust statistics concerning activation. The reasons for assaying ZsGreen rather measuring RNA output directly are not well justified. All of these figures have to be modified such that the reader can readily assess the differences in each experimental condition. RNA should be measured by RT-qPCR and fold changes and statistics from replicate experiments should be provided.</p><p>In Figure 5 and Figure 6 the number of biological replicates and the statistical tests used should both be indicated. The text describing these figures is somewhat oversimplified as they claim that activation of HNF4A results in strong induction of liver function genes. In fact, some are strongly induced, but for others the effect is very low and this is not recognised in the text. Statistics should be shown for the cell cycle analyses in Figure 6C number of replicates and statistical test used.</p><p>Figure S9. There is no obvious difference in the number of cells in the different conditions. This must be quantitated and analysed to provide reliable statistics.</p><p>In summary, while this paper describes an interesting and novel technique, the data as they are presented require additional replicates, statistical test and clearer presentation to be acceptable.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>The number of replicates and the statistical tests used are not indicated and more rigorous analyses have to be performed and present in any revised version. The present version is way below acceptable standards.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Here, Xu et al., describe a transcriptional activation strategy using dCas9-VP64 together with a modified gRNA scaffold (csgRNA) that can anneal to a CMV enhancer DNA sequence (sCMV) provided in trans. They show that dCas9/csgRNA/sCMV (in the absence of a transactivation domain) is capable of inducing transcription of a reporter construct and that the transcriptional activity of the complex is enhanced by the addition of a transactivation domain (VP64) to dCas9 (dCas9-VP64). They also show that transfecting dCas9-VP64/csgRNA/sCMV is capable of inducing transcription of the reporter in 7 different cell lines. They also claim that dCas9-VP64/csgRNA/sCMV is a little bit more efficient that dCas9-VPR in inducing transcription. Finally, they show that dCas9-VP64/csgRNA/sCMV can induce transcription of endogenous genes in two different cancer cell lines and that this can trigger differentiation.</p><p>Although the strategy proposed here is original, the sCMV component needs to be provided in trans (co-transfected), therefore application of this system is limited to cells in culture and would be very challenging to use this strategy in vivo.</p><p>A major flaw of this study is that transfection efficiency cannot be determined. It is impossible to know the percentage of cells that are expressing dCas9-VP64 and the proportion of these in which transcriptional activation has occurred. Therefore, the transcriptional effect observed is either under- or over-estimated.</p><p>There are many variables in the experiment, as 4 constructs need to be co-transfected (reporter, dCas9-VP64, csgRNA and sCMV). The experiments should have been done in a cell line stably transfected with the reporter construct and using a single plasmid co-expressing the csgRNA together with mCherry-dCas9-VP64 (or mCherry-dCas9-VPR). This would not only reduce the number of variables but would allow the authors to: (1) Determine the transfection efficiency and the frequency of mCherry+ cells (expressing dCas9-VP64) in which transcriptional activation has occurred (ZsGreen+) and (2) Determine the transactivation level by scoring the MFI of ZsGreen in the mCherry+ ZsGreen+ population.</p><p>The FACS data should be presented as dot plots (FSC vs. ZsGreen). This allows to visualize the ZsGreen+ population, which is not clear at all (given the low percentage of ZsGreen+ cells) from the histograms.</p><p>The manuscript is poorly written and is full of strange words and expressions and should be proof-read by an English-speaking person.</p><p>Figure legends do not describe the figures and should be re-written. Legend for Figure 1B is missing.</p><p>On all FACS data shown, the gating for ZsGreen is not the same throughout (i.e. compare panels in Figure 2).</p><p>It is not clear how the MFI intensity in Figure 4 was determined. Therefore, it is impossible to assess the validity of the comparisons.</p><p>In Figure 1B, the percentage of cleavage should be displayed, as it is clear that the csgRNA is not as efficient as the unmodified scaffold. Also, the input is missing.</p><p>In Figure 5, a negative control without the csgRNA is missing. The relative mRNA induction should be calculated relative to this control, as it would directly show the fold induction triggered by dCas9-VP64/csgRNA/sCMV. Also, the y axis should be labelled relative mRNA (and not RNA) expression.</p><p>In the qPCR data shown in Figure 6A and 6B, it is not indicated what was used to determine the relative expression. Same as in Figure 5, the negative control (without the csgRNA) is missing and should be performed in order to determine the relative expression of each gene. Also, the expression level of the target gene should be shown.</p><p>For clarity, a diagram of the reporter construct should be shown.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, it is not clear how many times the experiments were done. For example, the qPCR data shown in Figure 5, do the error bars correspond to technical or biological replicates? Is a representative experiment shown? Also, in several figures it is not indicated which samples are compared when the * is shown for statistical significance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In their study, Xu et al., developed a novel approach using CRISPR/dCas9 to activate gene expression. They modified the guide RNA scaffold as such that a CMV enhancer DNA fragment was recruited to the target gene by the dCas9-VP64/sgRNA complex. The authors argue that previously published approaches have limitation regarding the strength of transcriptional activation and their approach is superior in this regard.</p><p>The approach by Xu et al., is novel and innovative having potential beyond the use case presented in the current study. Based on the data presented I have the following comments/questions.</p><p>1) The authors initially validate their approach (Figure 2) in 293T cells by co-transfecting an exogenous GFP-based reporter construct. Transient transfection efficiencies of 293T cells are known to be extremely high. Why does e.g. dCas9-VP64/csgRNA2-sCMV achieve only 11% of GFP+ cells, assuming that &gt;90% of 293T are transfected?</p><p>2) Regarding Figure 5 and along the line of my previous comment. How do we have to interpret the fold-changes in expression of endogenous genes having seen that in Figure 2 only a comparably small proportion of cells activated the reporter construct? Based on the methods description, all endogenous gene expression analyses were done using the bulk cell cultures. Are the changes in gene expression seen in the bulk culture caused by extremely high transactivation in a small fraction of cells or by homogenous induction across all cells? At least the first scenario is suggested by the pilot experiments shown in Figure 2. Thus, single cell-based approaches could clarify this for the endogenous target genes, e.g. immunofluorescence/FACS for the proteins encoded by the transactivated target genes.</p><p>3) If transcriptional activation is achieved only in a fraction (approximately 10%) of the cells despite high transfection efficiencies, then the approach by Xu et al., would have some limitations, at least for bulk cell culture analyses, in comparison to SAM and other methods, which can be also efficiently delivered to target cells by viruses. Where do the authors then see the advantage of their approach, as the requirement for transient transfection remains a drawback, in particular in cell models that are difficult to transfect?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Gene activation by a CRISPR-assisted trans enhancer&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In this new version, the authors addressed many of the issues raised on the previous versions. They have provided data on the reproducibility of the results with the appropriate statistics. They have used alternative regulatory elements in place of CMV and they have developed an alternative strategy for recruiting the trans-acting element using the GAL4 DNA binding domain. These new innovations have strengthened the study. However, the paper is now too long with too many figures. The paper would be more appropriate if it was shortened to a Tools and Resources article rather than a full manuscript. This can be done by reorganizing the figures. For example, rather than showing all of the fluorescence images and sorting results, this could all be shown in graphical form as is already the case for Figures 8C, D and E and Figure 9C, D and E. This would save a lot of space and condense all the information into a single figure, showing perhaps a single representative sorting experiment and cell images as supplemental data. Also Figure 5 could be shortened to show only 1 or 2 cell types with the rest shown as supplemental data. I also propose that the data on cell cycle changes and migration be removed to shorten the text. This data is not central to the main message of the paper. On the other hand, supplemental figure 11 should be shown in the main figures possibly as an addition to Figure 1.</p><p>Finally, the writing is poor and the meaning of what is written is in several places very difficult to understand. Mitigating this will require a major effort.</p><p>The authors are invited to submit a shortened revised version based on the above suggestions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45973.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] To demonstrate the specificity of the technique, the authors should perform experiments with a version of the CMV enhancer in which key bases have been mutated to impair the binding of transcription factors.

This was described in detail in the Introduction:</p><p>“Almost three decades ago, the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/promoter (referred to as CMV enhancer hereafter) was found as a natural mammalian promoter with high transcriptional activity (Boshart et al. 1985). The late studies gradually found that the CMV enhancer is the known strongest promoter in various mammalian cells (Boshart et al., 1985; Foecking and Hofstetter, 1986; Ho et al., 2015; Kim et al., 1990). Therefore, this enhancer has been widely used to drive the ectopic expression of various genes in wide range of mammalian cells. For example, the CMV enhancer is also used to drive the ectopic expressions of exogenous genes in broad tissues in transgenic animals (Furth et al., 1991; Schmidt et al., 1990), protein production by gene engineering, and human gene therapy. We have recently further improved the transcriptional activity of the CMV enhancer by changing the natural NF-κB binding sites in this enhancer into artificially selected NF-κB binding sequences with high binding affinity (Wang et al., 2018). Therefore, we conceived that an unique architecture may be constructed to further improve dCas9-based activators by using the CMV enhancer.”</p><p>CMV enhancer/promoter is a known strong natural mammalian enhancer/promoter. Therefore, it was widely employed in researches of biological sciences and biomedicine. Its strongest transcriptional activity was found to be dependent on many binding sites of multiple transcription factors. For example, there are four binding sites of NF-κB. We have recently published a paper about CMV enhancer/promoter in which we discussed in detail the CMV enhancer/promoter and further improved the transcriptional activity of the CMV enhancer by changing the natural NF-κB binding sites in this enhancer into artificially selected NF-κB binding sequences with high binding affinity (Wang et al., 2018). We have already cited the study in the paragraph above. In this study, we found that changing any one of the NF-κB binding sites had no significant effect on the transcriptional activity of CMV enhancer/promoter. Maybe this is the reason why the CMV enhancer/promoter always shows high transcriptional activity in various cell lines. Different transcription factor binding sites and transcription factors show synergistic reaction, which jointly contributed to the strong transcriptional activity of CMV enhancer/promoter. Due to its harbouring of many binding sites of multiple transcription factors, it is very difficult to create a mutation of this enhancer/promoter to get a mutant CMV enhancer/promoter that has significant impaired transcriptional activity relative to the wild-type CMV enhancer/promoter.</p><p>In this study, we focused on verifying the feasibility and reliability of activating expression of both exogenous and endogenous genes by CRISPR-based trans-enhancer, not focused one verifying a function of a known or potential enhancer. Therefore, we did not used a mutated CMV enhancer/promoter.</p><p>When transfecting cells, we included many necessary transfections as controls. All transfections of a cell line were performed simultaneously at the same condition for the sake of comparison.</p><p>We are sorry that we have not used any enhancer fragments other than CMV due to the reasons described above.

It is clear that the csgRNA-sCMV-based trans enhancer technique is helpful for in vitro application, such as in vitro cell reprogramming and gene activation for gain-of function. However, it’s true that the csgRNA-sCMV-based trans enhancer still faces difficulty in in vivo application. The trans enhancer used a linear CMV enhancer DNA fragment that has a single-stranded overhang complementary to the 3′ end of csgRNA. It is difficult to produce this kind of trans enhancer DNA in the in vivo cells unless transfecting the in vitro pre-prepared trans enhancer with nanoparticle gene carriers together with expression vectors of dCas9-VP64 and csgRNA.

This would not only reduce the number of variables but would allow the authors to: (1) Determine the transfection efficiency and the frequency of mCherry+ cells (expressing dCas9-VP64) in which transcriptional activation has occurred (ZsGreen+) and (2) Determine the transactivation level by scoring the MFI of ZsGreen in the mCherry+ ZsGreen+ population.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is a good point and if we performed the experiments as suggested, the results should be better.

Transient transfection efficiencies of 293T cells are known to be extremely high. Why does e.g. dCas9-VP64/csgRNA2-sCMV achieve only 11% of GFP+ cells, assuming that &gt;90% of 293T are transfected?</p></disp-quote><p>In our lab, we often transfected 293T cells by a single plasmid expressing EGFP under the control of strong CMV promoter, in which we found that the EGFP activation in cells is about 20~30. In comparison, transfection of dCas9-VP64/csgRNA2-sCMV achieved 11% of GFP+ cells. It is ideal in our opinion. The decreased transient transfection efficiencies of 293T cells in this study have a close relationship with the co-transfection with four independent vectors: a csgRNA expression vector, a dCas9-VP64/VPR expression vector, a reporter gene ZsGreen expression vector, and sCMV. Co-transfection can’t achieve high transfection efficiencies. By combining dCas9-VP64 and csgRNA into one vector, the gene activation efficiency can be further improved in the future.</p><p>However, we think that transfection efficiency do not affect our conclusion, that is, the trans-enhancer itself can activate the reporter gene expression by complexing with dCas9/csgRNA and dCas9-VP64/csgRNA (please see the Figure 2 and Figure 3, Figure 2—figure supplement, Figure 2—figure supplement3, Figure 2—figure supplement 4, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and Figure 3—figure supplement 2).

How do we have to interpret the fold-changes in expression of endogenous genes having seen that in Figure 2 only a comparably small proportion of cells activated the reporter construct? Based on the methods description, all endogenous gene expression analyses were done using the bulk cell cultures. Are the changes in gene expression seen in the bulk culture caused by extremely high transactivation in a small fraction of cells or by homogenous induction across all cells? At least the first scenario is suggested by the pilot experiments shown in Figure 2. Thus, single cell-based approaches could clarify this for the endogenous target genes, e.g. immunofluorescence/FACS for the proteins encoded by the transactivated target genes.</p></disp-quote><p>As we described above, the decreased transient transfection efficiencies of 293T cells in this study (Figure 2) have a close relationship with the co-transfection with four independent vectors. Co-transfection can’t achieve very high transfection efficiencies. However, in Figure 5, cells were only transfected by three vectors, a csgRNA expression vector, a dCas9-VP64/VPR expression vector, and sCMV. The transfection was enhanced. Moreover, in Figure 2, we detected reporter gene expression at protein level, but in Figure 5 and Figure 6 we detected gene expression at transcription level by qPCR that has high detection sensitivity due to amplification. The reporter gene expression at protein level was quantitatively detected by flow cytometry, which has relative low detection sensitivity in comparison with qPCR because it has relative low fluorescence detection limitation.</p><p>We detected gene expression of target endogenous genes by qPCR. This is a standard approach for detecting gene expression. In many other previous reports of activation gene expression by CRISPR-based methods, the same qPCR detection of gene expression in the bulk culture were widely used. The related references were systematically cited in the Introduction. We found no reported single cell-based approaches were used in this aspect.</p><p>Based on the qPCR detection, all endogenous gene expression analyses were done using the bulk cell cultures. “Are the changes in gene expression seen in the bulk culture caused by extremely high transactivation in a small fraction of cells or by homogenous induction across all cells?”. This is a good question. We reduced that this is the changes in gene expression seen in the bulk culture should be caused by the enhanced transactivation in increased fraction of cells. Please see Figure 4B, in which we found that in comparison with other transfections, the transfection of dCas9-VP64/csgRNA and sCMV (DVSC) significantly increased numbers of cells with certain fluorescence intensity threshold. At the highest fluorescence intensity threshold (6.9), no cells were in other transfection, however, there are still about 2% of cells with this highest fluorescence. In flow cytometry, we measured 10000 cells for each transfection, 2% means that as many 200 cells had the highest fluorescence (i.e. target gene ZsGreen expression at protein level). This is very useful. For example, in cell reprogramming, high target gene activation can increase the efficiency of cell reprogramming.</p><p>Of course, as suggested by reviewer, it is better to characterize the endogenous target gene activation with single cell-based approaches, e.g. immunofluorescence/FACS for the proteins encoded by the transactivated target genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) If transcriptional activation is achieved only in a fraction (approximately 10%) of the cells despite high transfection efficiencies, then the approach by Xu et al., would have some limitations, at least for bulk cell culture analyses, in comparison to SAM and other methods, which can be also efficiently delivered to target cells by viruses. Where do the authors then see the advantage of their approach, as the requirement for transient transfection remains a drawback, in particular in cell models that are difficult to transfect?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this study tested the idea that the exogenous and endogenous genes could be efficiently activated by a CRISPR-assistant trans-enhancer in many cells. To our knowledge, this is the first time it’s been shown that genes in cells could be activated by an exogenous enhancer in trans format. We show that genes in cells could be activated by the interaction between genomic DNA and exogenous DNA via protein mediation. This technique has potential application in vitro such as cell reprogramming and cell-based gene therapy.</p><p>It is clear that the csgRNA-sCMV-based trans enhancer technique is helpful for in vitro application, such as in vitro cell reprogramming and gene activation for gain-of function. However, it is true to say that the csgRNA-sCMV-based trans enhancer still faces difficulty in in vivo application.

We should that UAS-CMV in both linear and circular forms could be recruited by dCas9-VP64-GAL4 and functioned. This system allows easy in vivo application of the CRISPR-assisted trans enhancer technique.

They have used alternative regulatory elements in place of CMV and they have developed an alternative strategy for recruiting the trans-acting element using the GAL4 DNA binding domain. These new innovations have strengthened the study. However, the paper is now too long with too many figures. The paper would be more appropriate if it was shortened to a Tools and Resources article rather than a full manuscript. This can be done by reorganizing the figures. For example, rather than showing all of the fluorescence images and sorting results, this could all be shown in graphical form as is already the case for Figures 8C, D and E and Figure 9C, D and E. This would save a lot of space and condense all the information into a single figure, showing perhaps a single representative sorting experiment and cell images as supplemental data. Also Figure 5 could be shortened to show only 1 or 2 cell types with the rest shown as supplemental data. I also propose that the data on cell cycle changes and migration be removed to shorten the text. This data is not central to the main message of the paper. On the other hand, supplemental figure 11 should be shown in the main figures possibly as an addition to Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>The paper was thoroughly and carefully revised, significantly shortened (from 9952 words to 6753 words including references).
