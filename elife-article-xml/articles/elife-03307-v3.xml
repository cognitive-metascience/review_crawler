Cargo ubiquitylation favors their lysosomal targeting and can be regulated by external signals, but the mechanism is ill-defined. Here, we studied the post-endocytic trafficking of Jen1, a yeast monocarboxylate transporter, using microfluidics-assisted live-cell imaging. We show that the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 and the glucose-regulated arrestin-related trafficking adaptors (ART) protein Rod1, involved in the glucose-induced internalization of Jen1, are also required for the post-endocytic sorting of Jen1 to the yeast lysosome. This new step takes place at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where Rod1 localizes dynamically upon triggering endocytosis. Indeed, transporter trafficking to the TGN after internalization is required for their degradation. Glucose removal promotes Rod1 relocalization to the cytosol and Jen1 deubiquitylation, allowing transporter recycling when the signal is only transient. Therefore, nutrient availability regulates transporter fate through the localization of the ART/Rsp5 ubiquitylation complex at the TGN.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03307.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03307.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03307.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The plasma membrane that surrounds cells contains many different proteins that perform tasks such as detecting signals sent to the cell, and transporting molecules into or out of the cell. To adapt to changing conditions, cells remodel their membrane to change how much of each type of protein is present. A process called endocytosis—where part of the plasma membrane and the proteins it contains buds off into the cell—plays an important role in this remodeling.</p><p>The fate of a membrane protein after endocytosis can depend on whether a protein ‘tag’ called ubiquitin has been added to it. Ubiquitin-marked proteins bud off into the cell and are then sent to cell structures called lysosomes to be degraded, whereas unmarked proteins are recycled back to the plasma membrane.</p><p>Yeast cell membranes contain a protein called Jen1 that transports certain molecules, including one called lactate that can be used as fuel for growth. However, glucose is a preferred nutrient for yeast, so when glucose is available, another protein called Rod1 becomes activated and promotes the addition of ubiquitin to Jen1, and hence its degradation. This means that the cells can no longer use lactate as a source of energy. However, it was not known where in the cell the Rod1 protein does this.</p><p>Becuwe and Léon labeled proteins involved in endocytosis with fluorescent tags and used microscopy to observe their fate in live yeast cells exposed to glucose. This revealed two roles for Rod1. At the plasma membrane, Rod1 helps Jen1 to be taken into the cell in the early stages of endocytosis. But unexpectedly, Rod1 is also found at a cellular structure called the trans-Golgi network, small membrane sacs that are typically responsible for packaging proteins so they can be transported to a new destination, in particular the plasma membrane. This suggests that Rod1 can also act at this location in the cell.</p><p>When the proteins responsible for maintaining transport to the trans-Golgi network are inhibited, Jen1 is no longer degraded, even when glucose is present; instead, Jen1 is recycled back to the plasma membrane. Becuwe and Léon therefore propose that a second level of control of the degradation of plasma membrane proteins occurs in the trans-Golgi network, and so this compartment has an essential role in sorting proteins for degradation or recycling.</p><p>The group of proteins that Rod1 belongs to, named arrestins, has been suggested to play important roles in several diseases, including diabetes and cancer. As many of the features of the endocytic pathway are conserved in a broad range of species, arrestins may also be important for controlling the fate of membrane proteins at multiple places in mammalian cells. However, further work is required to confirm this.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03307.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03307.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>arrestin-related protein</kwd><kwd>glucose signaling</kwd><kwd>transporter</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFI20121205762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Léon</surname><given-names>Sébastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Comite de Paris - RS13/75-45</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Léon</surname><given-names>Sébastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Comite de Paris - RS14/75-120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Léon</surname><given-names>Sébastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DOC20130606445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Becuwe</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel regulatory step in the endocytic pathway, which occurs post-internalization, takes place at the trans-Golgi network and involves the arrestin-related protein Rod1 and the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells remodel the protein composition of the plasma membrane, such as receptors, transporters or channels, in response to external cues. Endocytosis is a major component of this adaptation. The conjugation of ubiquitin to membrane proteins (‘cargoes’) acts as a major determinant of their intracellular sorting in the endocytic pathway. Ubiquitin can notably act as a signal to promote cargo endocytosis from the plasma membrane (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dupré et al., 2004</xref>). This is particularly true in yeast, and studies have shown the critical involvement of Rsp5, a conserved ubiquitin ligase of the Nedd4 family, in cargo ubiquitylation at the plasma membrane upon triggering endocytosis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacGurn et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The regulation of yeast nutrient transporters by nutritional signals in the environment has been used as a paradigm to dissect the mechanisms of signal-induced ubiquitylation and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lauwers et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, the nutritional status of the medium, such as the absence/excess of a given substrate, regulates the dynamics of the cognate transporters at the plasma membrane through their regulated ubiquitylation and endocytosis. Recent work has notably contributed to our understanding of the mechanism responsible for the signal-induced ubiquitylation of transporters. Indeed, at the plasma membrane, the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 ubiquitylates endocytic cargoes and is assisted in its function by adaptor proteins of the ART family (<underline>A</underline>rrestin-<underline>R</underline>elated <underline>T</underline>rafficking adaptors), that confer to Rsp5 the ability to ubiquitylate numerous transporters in response to various external inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nikko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nikko and Pelham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hatakeyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O'Donnell et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karachaliou et al., 2013</xref>). ART proteins are both targets of nutrient signaling pathways and actors of transporter ubiquitylation, and as such act as relay molecules allowing to coordinate transporter endocytosis with the nutrient status of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacGurn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merhi and André, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becuwe et al., 2012b</xref>). Interestingly, the human arrestin-related protein TXNIP was recently reported to regulate glucose influx in cells by promoting the endocytosis of the glucose transporter GLUT1 in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner, illustrating the conservation of arrestin-related proteins function in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, cargo ubiquitylation often occurs at the plasma membrane, and in some cases, this is essential for internalization, as demonstrated for the sodium channel ENaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>) or the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hewitt et al., 2002</xref>). However, this is not a general rule, because affecting the ubiquitylation of the G-protein-coupled receptors β2-AR and CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shenoy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42a">Marchese and Benovic, 2001</xref> #885), or the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR and FGFR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haugsten et al., 2008</xref>) does not abrogate their internalization. Instead, cargo ubiquitylation becomes critical later in the endocytic pathway, to promote cargo sorting towards late endosomes and their subsequent degradation (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miranda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kabra et al., 2008</xref>). At endosomes, ubiquitinated cargoes are captured and sorted by ESCRT proteins (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required For Transport) into the lumen of the endosome through a process known as multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacGurn et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of cargo ubiquitylation reportedly leads to their recycling to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shenoy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haugsten et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eden et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, a major function of ubiquitin conjugation to endocytic cargoes is to regulate their post-endocytic fate.</p><p>Because ubiquitylation is a reversible modification, the competition between ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation at endosomes can decide the fate of many of the endocytosed cargoes, as only proteins that are stably ubiquitylated will be ultimately degraded. In mammalian cells, several deubiquitylating enzymes were indeed shown to control the recycling of endosomal cargoes such as EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCullough et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mizuno et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Row et al., 2006</xref>), the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bomberger et al., 2009</xref>), ENaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butterworth et al., 2007</xref>) or the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berthouze et al., 2009</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clague et al., 2012</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which external signals are integrated and transduced to the ubiquitylation machinery in order to regulate cargo trafficking are unknown.</p><p>We recently reported that glucose, which triggers the endocytosis of various yeast carbon sources transporters (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horak, 2013</xref>), promotes the successive dephosphorylation and ubiquitylation of the ART protein Rod1 (also known as Art4), leading to its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becuwe et al., 2012b</xref>). In turn, activated Rod1 promotes the glucose-induced ubiquitylation and degradation of Jen1, a monocarboxylate transporter. However, the place where Rod1 regulates endocytosis is unknown. Whereas ART proteins are considered to promote transporter internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Becuwe et al., 2012a</xref>), there are conflicting reports regarding the step at which they control intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helliwell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Soetens et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merhi and André, 2012</xref>). Moreover, ART proteins were observed at various subcellular locations, both in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O'Donnell et al., 2010</xref>) and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vina-Vilaseca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2013</xref>) suggesting other roles beyond the regulation of cargo internalization. Furthermore, it was reported that akin to the situation in mammalian cells, the yeast iron transporter complex Fet3/Ftr1 is internalized independently of its ubiquitylation, although the latter is required for its vacuolar targeting. This suggests a control of transporter degradation through a post-endocytic ubiquitylation event, for which the molecular actors are not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Strochlic et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here, through the use of microfluidics-assisted live-cell imaging, we studied the place of action of Rod1 during endocytosis and report a dual function of Rod1 in transporter sorting at two successive locations in the cell, that is, at the plasma membrane to control transporter internalization, and at a post-endocytic compartment to promote vacuolar sorting and degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rod1 contributes to transporter internalization at the plasma membrane</title><p>As a first approach to identify the place of action of Rod1 in endocytosis, we set out to precisely document the endocytosis defect displayed by the <italic>rod1Δ</italic> mutant. For this purpose, we monitored transporter trafficking in wild type (WT) and <italic>rod1</italic>Δ cells using two different cargoes, namely the glycerol/proton symporter Stl1, and the monocarboxylate transporter Jen1. Stl1 is expressed when cells are grown in glycerol/lactate medium, and endocytosed in response to glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferreira et al., 2005</xref>). The glucose-induced endocytosis and degradation of Stl1 required Rod1, establishing Stl1 as a new Rod1-regulated cargo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), in addition to the previously described hexose transporter Hxt6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nikko and Pelham, 2009</xref>) and Jen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becuwe et al., 2012b</xref>). We then performed time-lapse microscopy using a microfluidics device to precisely monitor Stl1-GFP localization immediately after glucose addition in WT and <italic>rod1</italic>Δ cells.

We observed that, in sharp contrast with the result obtained for Stl1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), glucose triggered the transient localization of Jen1 to cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). The appearance of these puncta was strongly affected by latrunculin A treatment, which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and abolishes endocytosis, indicative of their endocytic origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Because <italic>JEN1</italic> expression is repressed by glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bojunga and Entian, 1999</xref>), this plasma membrane-localized pool did not originate from de novo Jen1 synthesis, but rather from the recycling of internalized Jen1 back to the cell surface. This result strongly suggested a role for Rod1 in the post-endocytic targeting of Jen1 to the vacuole, in addition to its function at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-03307-media2.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03307.005</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Jen1-GFP is internalized upon glucose treatment even in the absence of Rod1.</title><p>WT cells (left) and in <italic>rod1Δ</italic> cells (right) expressing Jen1-GFP were grown in lactate medium and observed for 45 min after glucose addition.

Indeed, the remnant internalization of Jen1 observed in the <italic>rod1Δ</italic> mutant still required its ubiquitylation, as demonstrated through the use of a non-ubiquitylatable Jen1 mutant in which all cytosolic lysine residues have been mutated into arginine residues (Jen1-KR-GFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, these mutations abolished Jen1 ubiquitylation in response to glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), but this construct was still functional, as judged by its ability to transport selenite, that can be used as a readout for Jen1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McDermott et al., 2010</xref>). The visualization of the subcellular localization of Jen1-KR-GFP showed that it was indeed targeted to the plasma membrane, although it displayed a small delay in secretion as observed by its transient accumulation at the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). More importantly, the endocytosis of Jen1-KR-GFP in response to glucose was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Since Jen1 was partially endocytosed in the absence of Rod1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F,G</xref>), we conclude that Jen1 can be ubiquitylated at the plasma membrane independently of Rod1, at least when Rod1 is absent. Consequently, it is likely that there are additional ubiquitylation systems besides Rod1 at the plasma membrane, which can promote Jen1 internalization and that remain to be identified. Of note, Jen1 was still internalized in the multiple <italic>9-arrestin</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which lacks Rod1 and eight other arrestin-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nikko and Pelham, 2009</xref>). Altogether, these results show that the function of Rod1 at the plasma membrane is either compensated or is redundant with other adaptors, but that this is not the case regarding its post-endocytic function in Jen1 trafficking.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03307.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Jen1 ubiquitylation is required for its glucose-induced endocytosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the lysine-to-arginine mutations introduced in the cytosolic loops of Jen1 to generate the Jen1-KR construct.

We tested Jen1 co-localization with either the endosomal marker Vps17-mCh, a component of the recycling complex Retromer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seaman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Strochlic et al., 2008</xref>) or the TGN marker Sec7-mCh, two proteins that did not co-localize with each other in wild-type cells as determined in a control experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Early after glucose treatment, the Jen1-GFP puncta co-localized nearly exclusively with Vps17-mCh, but this was followed by a partial co-localization with Sec7-mCh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>), showing that Jen1-GFP associates with the TGN after internalization. Although Jen1-GFP and Sec7-mCh sometimes appeared to be in adjacent structures, rather than completely overlapping, this was likely an artifact due to the fast mobility of TGN structures in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kojima et al., 2012</xref>), which led to a small shift between the image acquisition in each channel. Indeed, the simultaneous observation of Sec7-mCh and Jen1-GFP using a microscope equipped with two cameras showed a complete overlap of these signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The same co-localization analysis was carried out in the <italic>rod1Δ</italic> mutant, and revealed that Jen1-GFP followed essentially the same route as in WT cells, although Jen1-GFP displayed a prolonged co-localization with Sec7-mCh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4 fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplements 4, 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>).

We notably used a mutant <italic>(vps52Δ</italic>) of the Golgi-localized VFT (Vps Fifty-Three)/GARP (Golgi-associated retrograde protein) complex, involved in the fusion of vesicles of endosomal origin with the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conibear and Stevens, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Siniossoglou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Siniossoglou and Pelham, 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In this strain, Jen1 was internalized but accumulated into cytoplasmic puncta and failed to reach the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Similar results were obtained in other mutants affected in retrograde trafficking, such as mutants for the yeast Rab6 homologue, <italic>ypt6Δ</italic>, or for components of its GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor), <italic>rgp1</italic>Δ and <italic>ric1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Siniossoglou et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, Jen1 degradation was strongly affected in these retrograde mutants upon glucose treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). As expected, in the <italic>ypt6</italic>Δ mutant, Jen1 no longer co-localized with the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Therefore, these data reveal that endosome-to-TGN trafficking is critical for the vacuolar sorting of Jen1 after its internalization, suggesting that a step in the post-endocytic of Jen1 occurs at the TGN, prior to its delivery to the vacuole.</p><p>In order to identify the components involved in the vacuolar sorting of TGN-localized Jen1, we studied Jen1 trafficking in mutants of genes encoding the Golgi-localized clathrin adaptor proteins Gga1 and Gga2, involved in protein sorting from the TGN to endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scott et al., 2004</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, the absence of the Gga1/Gga2 proteins did not reduce Jen1 internalization, but partially impaired its vacuolar targeting, leading to Jen1 recycling at the plasma membrane. Of note, Jen1-GFP co-localized more strongly with the TGN marker, Sec7-mCh, after endocytosis in the <italic>gga1Δ gga2Δ</italic> mutant than in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>), thus mimicking the defects observed in the <italic>rod1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Again, this was not due to a defect in organelle identity caused by the deletion of the <italic>GGA1</italic> and <italic>GGA2</italic> genes because Sec7 and Vps17 appeared in distinct compartments in this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). These results showed that TGN-to-endosome sorting is also critical for the post-endocytic targeting of Jen1 to the vacuole. Of note, we also obtained evidence that another transporter, the dicarboxylic amino acid transporter Dip5, also transiently co-localizes with the TGN during its substrate-induced endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>), and that its vacuolar sorting also depends on the Gga1/Gga2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>). Therefore, the post-endocytic control of transporter fate at the TGN is not restricted to Jen1 but is likely to be a more general mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Dynamics of Jen1 ubiquitylation in the endocytic pathway</title><p>We showed that Jen1 ubiquitylation is required for its internalization at the plasma membrane (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Since we identified an additional role for Rod1, which we previously showed to be critical for Jen1 ubiquitylation, in Jen1 sorting at the TGN, we hypothesized that transporter ubiquitylation may be remodeled between these two locations. This was further suggested by the observation that in retrograde mutants, in which Jen1 is internalized but not degraded, Jen1 ubiquitylation disappeared over time after glucose addition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Indeed, in the <italic>vps52Δ</italic> mutant, in which Jen1 departs from the plasma membrane in response to glucose but cannot reach the TGN, we observed a sharp decrease in Jen1 ubiquitylation after 20 min of glucose treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Because Jen1 expression is repressed by glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bojunga and Entian, 1999</xref>), the progressive loss of Jen1 ubiquitylated species was likely due to a deubiquitylation event occurring during the progression of Jen1 from the plasma membrane to the TGN. We then performed the same experiment in a <italic>vrp1</italic>Δ (<italic>end5Δ</italic>) mutant, in which endocytosis is blocked due to the deletion of the gene encoding the yeast WASP-interacting protein (WIP) homologue, verprolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Munn et al., 1995</xref>). In this mutant, however, Jen1 displayed a robust ubiquitylation pattern, indicating that the disappearance of Jen1 ubiquitylated species was not due to an intrinsic lability of ubiquitin-conjugated Jen1, and that this remodeling occurred post-internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03307.024</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The prolonged presence of glucose is required for the full endocytosis of Jen1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Jen1 is deubiquitylated after endocytosis.

In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed that in the <italic>gga1Δgga2Δ</italic> strain, in which Jen1 transiently accumulates at the TGN (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>), Jen1 also accumulated in an ubiquitylated state, suggesting that retaining Jen1 at the TGN leads to its massive ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). To confirm that this was due to the ubiquitylation of Jen1 molecules originating from endosomes, we used a triple <italic>ypt6Δ gga1Δ gga2Δ</italic> mutant in which retrograde trafficking is abolished. In this mutant, Jen1 ubiquitylation was similar to that observed in a single <italic>ypt6</italic>Δ mutant, showing that the accumulation of ubiquitylated species of Jen1 at the TGN observed in the <italic>gga1Δ gga2Δ</italic> mutants indeed required retrograde trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In further support of an ubiquitylation event occurring at the TGN, we also observed a glucose-induced recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 to this compartment in response to glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Using three-color imaging, we also showed a co-localization of Rsp5 with Jen1 and Rod1 at the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Altogether, these data strongly suggest that Jen1 is ubiquitylated at the plasma membrane and is deubiquitylated after its internalization, and lead us to propose that a second, glucose-regulated ubiquitylation step at the TGN involving Rsp5 and Rod1 may control Jen1 progression from the TGN to the vacuole.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The control of Jen1 trafficking at the TGN allows the recycling of internalized transporters back to the cell membrane</title><p>The yeast TGN is a well-established compartment from which cargoes can recycle to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holthuis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conibear et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hettema et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reggiori et al., 2003</xref>). We thus reasoned that a control of the post-endocytic sorting of transporters at the TGN might allow transporter recycling to the cell surface upon the sudden disappearance of the signal triggering endocytosis. To test this prediction, we treated lactate-grown cells expressing Jen1-GFP with a short pulse of glucose (10 min), which was sufficient to drive Jen1-GFP internalization, and then followed Jen1-GFP trafficking upon glucose removal. Using this protocol, Jen1 redistributed back to the plasma membrane within 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), showing that Jen1 endocytosis was reversible upon glucose removal. This change in localization coincided with a loss of Jen1 ubiquitylation, suggesting that a continuous presence of glucose is required for the persistent ubiquitylation of Jen1 and its degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The same experiment performed in the <italic>vrp1Δ</italic> mutant, in which endocytosis is blocked, also led to a loss of Jen1 ubiquitylation, showing it is not due to Jen1 degradation but rather to a rapid deubiquitylation event following glucose removal, regardless of Jen1 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Of note, Jen1 no longer recycled to the plasma membrane in the <italic>vps52Δ</italic> strain in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>), indicating that Jen1 recycling requires a functional endosome-to-TGN retrograde pathway. This also confirmed that the signal recovered at the plasma membrane upon glucose removal in WT cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) did not originate from Jen1 neosynthesis. Therefore, a second, glucose-based sorting event occurs after internalization and takes place at the TGN. Accordingly, Jen1 recycling led to its polarized redistribution to the cell buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>), similarly to the exocytic SNARE Snc1 and the chitin synthase Chs3, which localize to the cell membrane in a polarized fashion after endocytosis and recycling through the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holthuis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lewis et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, Jen1 recycling to the cell membrane upon glucose removal also correlated with the loss of Rod1 localization at the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Rod1 localization was indeed extremely responsive to glucose treatments, and applying repeated glucose/lactate cycles revealed a robust sensor-like response of Rod1 regarding its localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref>) and post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Therefore, Jen1 ubiquitylation and endocytosis can be re-evaluated at the TGN after internalization upon disappearance of the endocytic stimulus, and this correlates with a rapid glucose-induced remodeling of Rod1 post-translational modifications and its redistribution from the TGN to the cytosol.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03307.026</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The control of Jen1 trafficking at the TGN allows the recycling of internalized transporters back to the cell membrane.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Jen1 endocytosis is reversible upon glucose removal.

In the present study, the use of microfluidics-assisted live cell imaging allowed us to follow, for the first time, the dynamics of cargo trafficking in response to variations in the presence of the endocytic stimulus, as well as the localization of the ART protein Rod1 in these conditions. This revealed a dual function of the ART protein Rod1 in the control of transporter endocytosis and degradation by glucose availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, left and middle panel). First, Rod1 exerts a function at the plasma membrane, as it is essential for the endocytosis of the glycerol/proton symporter Stl1, and required for the efficient internalization of Jen1 upon glucose treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Second, Rod1 also controls transporter sorting after endocytosis, a step which takes place at the trans-Golgi network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, middle panel). Indeed, Jen1 localizes to the TGN after endocytosis, and both (i) the endosome-to-Golgi retrograde pathway and (ii) the Gga1/2-dependent, Golgi-to-vacuole pathway are required for the vacuolar delivery of Jen1, indicating a critical role for the TGN in transporter degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, we showed that the endocytosis of the unrelated amino acid transporter, Dip5, in response to its substrate also involves a step at the TGN as well as the GGA proteins. These results shed a new light on previous studies showing the involvement of GGA proteins in the endocytic trafficking of Gap1, the general amino-acid permease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scott et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lauwers et al., 2009</xref>), which could be explained by a similar control of Gap1 fate at the TGN. The yeast TGN therefore appears as a critical organelle for the post-endocytic sorting of transporters. This new level of regulation provides an opportunity to re-evaluate, after internalization, the commitment of transporters to the degradation pathway. Indeed, upon glucose removal, we show that internalized Jen1 recycles to the cell surface after it has reached the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, right panel).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03307.032</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Working model for the dual function of Rod1 in the regulation of transporter endocytosis and recycling.</title><p>Left, in lactate medium, Jen1 is synthesized and targeted to the plasma membrane. Although Rod1 interacts with Rsp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becuwe et al., 2012b</xref>), it is inactive (phosphorylated) and cytosolic. Middle, In the presence of glucose, Rod1 is activated by a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-dependent dephosphorylation and its subsequent Rsp5-mediated ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becuwe et al., 2012b</xref>). Rod1 promotes transporter internalization at the plasma membrane (1), but also localizes to the TGN (2). There, Rod1 controls the fate of internalized transporters that have been retrograde-trafficked by a VFT- and Ypt6-dependent pathway, and also that of transporters coming from the secretory pathway. Transporter sorting from the TGN to the vacuole requires Rod1 and the clathrin adaptors Gga1 or Gga2 (GGAs). Right, Upon glucose removal, shortly after endocytosis is initiated, Rod1 is rephosphorylated (likely by the kinase Snf1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becuwe et al., 2012b</xref>), leading to Rod1 dissociation from the TGN and Jen1 recycling to the cell membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03307.032">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03307.032</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03307-fig8-v3.tif"/></fig></p><p>Whereas the involvement of the TGN in cargo recycling to the cell membrane has already been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holthuis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conibear et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hettema et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reggiori et al., 2003</xref>), little information was available concerning the regulation of cargo recycling in response to external signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Strochlic et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we propose that external signals can remodel transporter ubiquitylation at the TGN through the regulation of ART proteins, and therefore control transporter targeting towards the recycling or degradation pathways. Indeed, Jen1 ubiquitylation is highly dynamic and can be re-evaluated after internalization. Through the use of trafficking mutants, we observed a progressive loss of Jen1 ubiquitylation between the plasma membrane and the TGN, even in the presence of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) suggesting that Jen1 ubiquitylation status is reset between these compartments, likely through the action of deubiquitylating enzymes that are yet to be identified. This may set the stage for a second Jen1 ubiquitylation event at the TGN, that would allow cells to control transporter progression to the vacuole in a glucose- and Rod1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, right panel). This is further suggested by the fact that Jen recycling upon glucose removal coincides with the loss of its ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Therefore, the continuous presence of glucose is not only required to trigger Jen1 internalization, but also to maintain Jen1 in the endocytic pathway and prevent its recycling. Altogether, our data shed light on the integrated nature of the endocytic decision, and the multiple places where signaling can impact on transporter sorting through the ART/Rsp5 network.</p><p>This regulation recalls that of the β2-adrenergic receptor, for which the multifunctional adaptor protein, β-arrestin2, promotes receptor ubiquitylation after its endocytosis through the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shenoy et al., 2008</xref>) but also regulates receptor deubiquitylation by the deubiquitylating enzymes USP33 and USP20, hence its recycling, depending on the duration of the stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berthouze et al., 2009</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kommaddi and Shenoy, 2013</xref>). However, in this specific case, the way by which agonist exposure is perceived and conveyed to edit the ubiquitin signal on the cargo is not fully understood. Here, we propose that a glucose-induced recruitment of the arrestin-related protein Rod1 to the TGN curtails Jen1 recycling and promotes its vacuolar sorting, leading to its degradation. This re-localization relies on rapid glucose-induced changes in Rod1 post-translational modifications through a mechanism that we previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becuwe et al., 2012b</xref>), and both are reversible upon glucose removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). The latter situation coincides with a loss of Jen1 ubiquitylation and its recycling, which may be caused by its inability to be re-ubiquitylated at the TGN because Rod1 is no longer at this compartment. The mechanism of the dynamic recruitment of Rod1 to the TGN will need to be further explored. Rod1 is so far the only arrestin-related protein shown to display a signal-induced localization to the TGN, although other arrestin-related proteins also localize to internal compartments at steady-state, such as the TGN or endosomes, both in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O'Donnell et al., 2010</xref>) and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vina-Vilaseca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2013</xref>). We also showed a dynamic recruitment of Rsp5 to the TGN in response to glucose, which is line with our model of a re-ubiquitylation of Jen1 at the TGN after endocytosis. The previously reported interaction between Rsp5 and Sec7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dehring et al., 2008</xref>) may provide insights into the molecular basis of Rsp5 recruitment to this organelle.</p><p>Noteworthy, the use of the same machinery to regulate transporter trafficking at the plasma membrane and the TGN also allows an integrated control of transporter sorting both during secretion and after endocytosis at the same location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, middle panel). This may be critical to prevent neosynthesized cargoes transiting in the secretory pathway from reaching the cell surface in conditions that induce endocytosis. Intriguingly, the ART-related proteins Bul1 and Bul2 were shown to control the sorting of neosynthesized Gap1 between the Golgi and the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helliwell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Soetens et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Risinger and Kaiser, 2008</xref>), and then later found to be involved in Gap1 down-regulation, suggestive of a role at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Risinger and Kaiser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merhi and André, 2012</xref>). In the light of our data, it appears likely that the Bul1/Bul2 proteins may in fact act at the TGN to control both of these sorting events. The study of the subcellular localization of the Bul1/Bul2 proteins may provide important information in this regard. Interestingly, recent studies in the evolutionary distant yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> also point to a role of the arrestin-related protein Any1 (also named Arn1) in transporter trafficking at multiple places in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakase et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nakashima et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, data on the ART protein Aly2 suggest both a role in endocytosis and endosomal recycling depending on the transporter or the physiological condition considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hatakeyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O'Donnell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crapeau et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In metazoans, recycling endosomes are specific organelles dedicated to the recycling of internalized proteins to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sheff et al., 1999</xref>).

Our work in yeast further indicates that this may be an ancestral mode of regulation, and provides insights into the molecular mechanism by which it is achieved. This study also illustrates an underappreciated role of the TGN in the integrated regulation of recycling and secretion that should be considered for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, transformation and growth conditions</title><p>Strains are listed and detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

This is a novel finding and distinct from roles for arrestins described in endocytosis and in traffic from the endosome to the TGN.</p><p>However, the authors need to address the following points before the manuscript can be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>1) The authors speculate that Jen1 gets actively de-ubiquitylated after internalization and therefore requires another round of ubiquitylation in the TGN in order to be directed to the vacuole. As this two-step model is a central point of this manuscript they should test what happens if the ubiquitination cycle is blocked and whether in that case a localization of Jen1 to the TGN and Rod1 is still required. Or does aberrant ubiquitination bypass the TGN and/or the requirement for Rod1/Rsp5 on the way to the vacuole? The authors should look at the ubiquitination state in the GGA mutant. Would Jen1 be re-ubiquitinated during its hold-over in the TGN? This should provide solid evidence that the TGN is a site of ubiquitination.</p><p>2) At present, the manuscript has not excluded a major alternate explanation that the deletion of ROD1 or GGA genes causes a defect in organelle identity resulting in the presence of Sec7 on early endosomes. This would result in an apparent delay in Jen1 traffic at the TGN. One way the authors could exclude this alternate explanation is to examine co-localization of Sec7 and Vps17 in cell lacking ROD1 or GGA genes. If the organelles have maintained their identity, the two markers should not overlap.</p><p>3) The data display for Jen1 co-localizing with Sec7 in wt cells is difficult to evaluate. Particularly when one looks at the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, it appears that the two proteins tend to be adjacent rather than co-localized and that the number of co-localized events is small. Without solid co-localization data for Sec7 and Jen1 in wild-type cells, the data presented does not provide a strong enough support for the conclusion that Rod1 normally acts to move Jen1 from the TGN to the vacuole.</p><p>Instead of reporting # of structures containing both Jen1 and Sec7, the authors should examine what fraction of Sec7 puncta become Jen1 positive at some point during their lifespan and vice versa. In terms of displaying the images, the current display of 5,10 and 15 minutes does not provide enough time resolution and, while beautiful, the movies are more difficult to analyze than still images. Chymographs or montages of small regions following individual events with greater time resolution would be easier.</p><p>4) The authors mention that Jen1 accumulates at the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This could also be due to slower uptake of Jen1 in the <italic>rod1Δ</italic> mutant as they show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>. However, one would expect an accumulation of Jen1 at the TGN in the <italic>gga1Δ gga2Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Can the authors provide a quantification of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> comparable to 1A,B? For example, they should perform a time-course looking at the co-localization of Jen1 with <italic>vps17</italic> and <italic>sec7</italic> in the <italic>gga1/2</italic> mutant similar to 3A/B. Along these lines, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> Jen1 localizes to the vacuole after 30' Glc in the wt but not in <italic>vps52Δ</italic> or <italic>ypt6Δ</italic>. The authors should provide CMAC staining in all these strains to strengthen this point, since the vacuole could be fragmented in the <italic>vps52Δ</italic>. Since Jen1 is not able to localize to the TGN in <italic>vps52Δ</italic> or <italic>ypt6Δ</italic>, what is the identity of these dots? The authors should address this by colocalization.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Integrated control of transporter endocytosis and recycling by the arrestin-related protein Rod1 and Rsp5” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> should be improved. This data was included to address the major hypothesis that a second round of ubiquitination can occur at the TGN. Since this is an important panel the data should be very strong.</p><p>The final three lanes show that <italic>ypt6</italic> is epistatic to <italic>gga1</italic> and <italic>gga2</italic> in terms of de-ubiquitination of Jen1 at the 30 minute time point. For some reason (possibly changes in cell physiology due to the triple mutant), Jen1 is expressed at very low levels in these cells. The authors conclude that in this mutant, Jen1 is deubiquitinated whereas in the <italic>gga1,2</italic> double mutant Jen1 is not deubiquitinated. However, there appears to be a slight de-ubiqutination in the <italic>gga1,2</italic> double mutant. Given the vast different levels of protein expression, and use of the highly non-linear HRP detection method for western blots; this needs to be reconfirmed. It is suggested that the authors dilute the double mutant samples such that the 4h lactate signal of the two strains are equal and then analyzed the ubiquitination level of Jen1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03307.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors speculate that Jen1 gets actively de-ubiquitylated after internalization and therefore requires another round of ubiquitylation in the TGN in order to be directed to the vacuole.

Would Jen1 be re-ubiquitinated during its hold-over in the TGN? This should provide solid evidence that the TGN is a site of ubiquitination</italic>.</p><p>First, we attempted to alter Jen1’s ubiquitylation cycle as suggested. It should be noted that the Jen1-KR mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1 fig4s2 fig4s3 fig4s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 1-4</xref> of the original manuscript) couldn’t be used to answer this question, because although it is expressed and targeted to the plasma membrane, it is not internalized in response to glucose due to its lack of ubiquitylation (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, we have constructed an in-frame fusion of Jen1 with a non-cleavable (G76V mutant) ubiquitin moiety, under the control of an inducible promoter, in order to have a constitutively ubiquitylated Jen1 construct to monitor whether TGN trafficking and Rod1 are now dispensable. This proved to be tricky because of the toxicity of Jen1- containing constructs in bacteria (yeast shuttle vectors containing WT Jen1 considerably slow down bacteria growth, and the Jen1 - KR presented in the manuscript had to be constructed in yeast because it cannot be amplified in bacteria). We obtained only a few clones that were not rearranged. However, upon their transformation into yeast, we could not detect the expression of the construct, although the sequence was correct. Therefore, and unfortunately, we could not answer this question by this mean in the time allotted.</p><p>However, as proposed above, we have looked at Jen1 ubiquitylation status in the <italic>gga1</italic>Δ<italic>gga2</italic>Δ mutant (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This revealed that Jen1 indeed accumulates in an ubiquitylated state in this strain suggesting that retaining Jen1 at the TGN leads to its massive ubiquitylation. Furthermore, through the use of a new strain bearing a triple <italic>gga1</italic>Δ<italic>gga2</italic>Δ <italic>ypt6</italic>Δ deletion, we also demonstrate that this increased ubiquitylation depends on endosome-to-TGN trafficking (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This shows that Jen1 ubiquitylation occurs after retrograde trafficking and further supports our model that the TGN is a site of ubiquitylation.</p><p><italic>2) At present, the manuscript has not excluded a major alternate explanation that the deletion of ROD1 or GGA genes causes a defect in organelle identity resulting in the presence of Sec7 on early endosomes. This would result in an apparent delay in Jen1 traffic at the TGN. One way the authors could exclude this alternate explanation is to examine co-localization of Sec7 and Vps17 in cell lacking ROD1 or GGA genes. If the organelles have maintained their identity, the two markers should not overlap</italic>.</p><p>Indeed, this explanation had not been addressed in the original manuscript. As suggested, we generated new strains and looked for a potential co-localization of Sec7 and Vps17 in the <italic>rod1</italic> Δ and the <italic>gga1Δgga2Δ</italic> mutant strains. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6 fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplements 6 and 7</xref>, in these mutant strains, Sec7 and Vps17 appear in distinct compartments that are reminiscent of those observed in the WT strain (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, this hypothesis is unlikely to explain the transient accumulation of Jen1 at a TGN - positive compartment in these strains.</p><p><italic>3) The data display for Jen1 co-localizing with Sec7 in wt cells is difficult to evaluate. Particularly when one looks at the</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>supplement, it appears that the two proteins tend to be adjacent rather than co-localized and that the number of co-localized events is small. Without solid co-localization data for Sec7 and Jen1 in wild-type cells, the data presented does not provide a strong enough support for the conclusion that Rod1 normally acts to move Jen1 from the TGN to the vacuole</italic>.</p><p>The TGN is a highly dynamic organelle in yeast. Previous studies have described a LatA-insensitive movement with a velocity of about 100 nm/sec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kojima et al, 2012</xref>. BBA 2012). We hypothesized that the slight shift between Jen1 and Sec7 mentioned by the Reviewer was due to the time needed between the acquisitions in each channel (exposure/acquisition + changing channel). Therefore, we used a spinning-disc confocal microscope equipped with two cameras, one for each channel, allowing the simultaneous imaging of the green and red signals (Revolution xD TuCam system, Andor), coupled to the microfluidics setup. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, the co- localization between Sec7 and Jen1 now appears very clearly, indicating that the slight shift is likely an artifact due to the fast mobility of TGN structures. This has been discussed in the manuscript, in the relevant section.</p><p><italic>Instead of reporting # of structures containing both Jen1 and Sec7, the authors should examine what fraction of Sec7 puncta become Jen1 positive at some point during their lifespan and vice versa</italic>.</p><p>The data presented in the original version of the manuscript indeed represented the number of Jen1 puncta that are Sec7-positive. As requested, we added an additional graph representing the number of Sec7-positive compartments that are also Jen1-positive in both the WT and <italic>rod1</italic>Δ strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>In terms of displaying the images, the current display of 5,10 and 15 minutes does not provide enough time resolution and, while beautiful, the movies are more difficult to analyze than still images. Chymographs or montages of small regions following individual events with greater time resolution would be easier</italic>.</p><p>Regarding kymographs, they are indeed often used to represent the dynamic behavior of proteins at endocytic sites, for instance, but this is only possible because they are rather static and fixed in space. Unfortunately, the fast mobility of TGN structures in the cell, mentioned above, has precluded us from doing kymographs because we cannot follow with certainty a single TGN structure. In our study, we use endogenously tagged proteins, some of which have a low expression level and/or are tagged with mCherry, which is less photostable than GFP. To be able to image cells for 30 min without too much bleaching, we chose a temporal resolution of 1 image/30 sec, and looked only at one focal plane. In these conditions, TGN structures constantly go in or out of focus, or completely change of localization within the cell between each image, making it impossible to track individual events. This is why we chose an alternative approach, in which we instead studied and quantified populations of puncta for co- labeling with Vps17 or Sec7 and Jen1, and that we think better reflects the situation, although in a less graphic manner.</p><p><italic>4) The authors mention that Jen1 accumulates at the TGN (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref><italic>). This could also be due to slower uptake of Jen1 in the</italic> rod1Δ <italic>mutant as they show in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1G</italic></xref><italic>. However, one would expect an accumulation of Jen1 at the TGN in the</italic> gga1Δ gga2Δ <italic>(</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1G</italic></xref><italic>). Can the authors provide a quantification of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1G</italic></xref> <italic>comparable to 1A,B? For example, they should perform a time-course looking at the co-localization of Jen1 with</italic> vps17 <italic>and</italic> sec7 <italic>in the</italic> gga1/2 <italic>mutant similar to 3A/B</italic>.</p><p>As proposed, we have now included a quantification of the co-localization between Jen1 and the most relevant of these two markers, i.e. Sec7, in the <italic>gga1</italic>Δ<italic>gga2</italic>Δ mutant vs. WT cells (now displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). This confirms that Jen1 accumulates at the TGN in the <italic>gga1Δgga2Δ</italic> mutant.</p><p><italic>Along these lines, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref> <italic>Jen1 localizes to the vacuole after 30' Glc in the wt but not in</italic> vps52Δ <italic>or</italic> ypt6Δ<italic>. The authors should provide CMAC staining in all these strains to strengthen this point, since the vacuole could be fragmented in the</italic> vps52Δ.</p><p>We performed the experiment again using CMAC staining (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This shows that the Jen1-positive structures that we observed are not fragmented vacuoles and therefore, that Jen1 trafficking to the vacuole is indeed impaired in the mutants studied.</p><p>In addition, and because the involvement of the retrograde pathway in post-endocytic sorting was rather unexpected, we now provide additional data in the same panel that strengthen this conclusion. Indeed, we generated new strains deleted for <italic>RGP1</italic> or <italic>RIC1</italic>, encoding components of the Ypt6 GEF complex (Siniossoglou et al. EMBO J, 2000). We observed that these mutants display a similar defect in Jen1 trafficking to the vacuole as that observed in the <italic>ypt6</italic>Δ strain. We also provide data on the loss of Jen1 degradation in the <italic>ypt6</italic>Δ mutant<italic>,</italic> in addition to that in the <italic>vps52Δ</italic> mutant already present in the original version of the manuscript (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These data strengthen the point that retrograde trafficking is required for Jen1 degradation in the vacuole after endocytosis.</p><p><italic>Since Jen1 is not able to localize to the TGN in</italic> vps52Δ <italic>or</italic> ypt6Δ<italic>, what is the identity of these dots? The authors should address this by colocalization</italic>.</p><p>Because those are likely early endosome-to-TGN intermediates, we have tried to co-localize these structures with Vps17 and generated the corresponding strain. We obtained only a partial co-localization, which could indicate that they are endosome-derived structures, or instead that we are looking at a fraction of Jen1 that is still transiting at the early endosome. Therefore, it is for the moment hard to conclude on the identity of these structures. Besides, although this is an interesting question, we feel that this is more related to the precise characterization of the <italic>ypt6</italic>Δ or <italic>vps52Δ</italic> mutants, than to our study on the place of action of Rod1 in endocytosis, and may require other guesses and more experiments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref> <italic>should be improved. This data was included to address the major hypothesis that a second round of ubiquitination can occur at the TGN. Since this is an important panel the data should be very strong</italic>.</p><p><italic>The final three lanes show that ypt6 is epistatic to</italic> gga1 <italic>and</italic> gga2 <italic>in terms of de-ubiquitination of Jen1 at the 30 minute time point. For some reason (possibly changes in cell physiology due to the triple mutant), Jen1 is expressed at very low levels in these cells. The authors conclude that in this mutant, Jen1 is deubiquitinated whereas in the</italic> gga1,2 <italic>double mutant Jen1 is not deubiquitinated. However, there appears to be a slight de-ubiqutination in the</italic> gga1,2 <italic>double mutant. Given the vast different levels of protein expression, and use of the highly non-linear HRP detection method for western blots; this needs to be reconfirmed. It is suggested that the authors dilute the double mutant samples such that the 4h lactate signal of the two strains are equal and then analyzed the ubiquitination level of Jen1</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for this comment on our blot, which is indeed an important panel. The experiment had to be performed again, because the ubiquitylation pattern usually appears diffuse after a few weeks of storage at -20°C. As per the reviewer’s request, we have changed the amount loaded to be able to compare Jen1 ubiquitylation in the three strains on the same exposure. The results, now provided in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, confirm our previous data and are in line with our conclusions.
