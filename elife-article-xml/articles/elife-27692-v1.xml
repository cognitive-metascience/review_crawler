We report here that male reproductive organs of both <italic>Ripk</italic>3- and <italic>Mlkl</italic>-knockout mice retain ‘youthful’ morphology and function into advanced age, while those of age-matched wild-type mice deteriorate. The RIPK3 phosphorylation of MLKL, the activation marker of necroptosis, is detected in spermatogonial stem cells in the testes of old but not in young wild-type mice. When the testes of young wild-type mice are given a local necroptotic stimulus, their reproductive organs showed accelerated aging. Feeding of wild-type mice with an RIPK1 inhibitor prior to the normal onset of age-related changes in their reproductive organs blocked the appearance of signs of aging. Thus, necroptosis in testes promotes the aging-associated deterioration of the male reproductive system in mice.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27692.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27692.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>necroptosis</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>testis</kwd><kwd>spermatogonia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Science 973 grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaodong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Necroptosis triggers organ-specific, age-associated deterioration of male reproductive system.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Necroptosis is a form of programmed necrotic cell death caused by the tumor necrosis factor family of cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christofferson and Yuan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vandenabeele et al., 2010</xref>). In response to the activation of TNF receptor family members, receptor-interacting kinase 1 (RIPK1) is recruited to the cytosolic side of the receptor and its kinase activity is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holler et al., 2000</xref>). RIPK1 then interacts with and phosphorylates a related kinase, RIPK3, leading to its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Degterev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). If the cells also happen to have their caspase-8 activity inhibited, either through interaction with its cellular inhibitor cFLIP or through the action of viral or chemical inhibitors, RIPK3 drives the cell fate towards necroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holler et al., 2000</xref>). Necroptosis can be inhibited by RIPK1 kinase inhibitor compounds, and can be promoted by small molecule Smac mimetics, which shifts RIPK1 function from NF-κB activation to activation of RIPK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Degterev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Once active, RIPK3 then phosphorylates a pseudokinase called mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). MLKL normally exists as an inactive monomer in the cytosol. Upon RIPK3 phosphorylation on serine 357 and threonine 358 of human MLKL or the mouse equivalent of serine 345, serine 347, and threonine 349, MLKL forms oligomers and translocates to the plasma membrane, where it disrupts membrane integrity, resulting in necrotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hildebrand et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murphy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rodriguez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Necroptosis is known to have important functions under pathological conditions of microbial infections or tissue damage since <italic>Ripk</italic>3 knockout mice show defects in defending microbial infections or manifest less tissue damage in a variety of chemical or ischemic reperfusion induced tissue damage models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Robinson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Upton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhou and Yuan, 2014</xref>).

The difference in seminal vesicles from wild-type and <italic>Ripk</italic>3-knockout mice become noticeable after one year of life, and become increasingly evident over time. The seminal vesicles from wild-type mice continue to grow, whereas the seminal vesicles from the <italic>Ripk</italic>3-knockout mice did not change in size from 4 months to 24 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Close examination revealed that the epithelium of the seminal vesicles from 18-month-old wild-type mice showed irregularities, with spaces separating the epithelium and the liquid compartment, whereas the seminal-vesicle epithelial cells from the age-matched <italic>Ripk</italic>3-knockout mice were tightly packed, just as they are in young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>)</p><p>The seminal vesicles of mice are anatomically simple, consisting of only an epithelial layer that envelopes a liquid compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gonzales, 2001</xref>). Therefore, the difference in seminal vesicles between wild-type and <italic>Ripk</italic>3-knockout mice did not offer much mechanistic insight what caused such a phenotype. We further studied the testes of wild-type and <italic>Ripk</italic>3-knockout mice. By the time mice reached 18 months of age, the wild-type testes started to appear atrophic, and weighed less than <italic>Ripk</italic>3-knockout testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>).

Moreover, the typical age-related increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vermeulen et al., 1996</xref>) that is known to occur in wild-type mice was not observed in <italic>Ripk</italic>3-knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Interestingly, the levels of two endocrine factors secreted by the pituitary gland, LH and FSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cooke and Saunders, 2002</xref>), did not differ between wild-type and <italic>Ripk</italic>3-knockout mice; both dropped significantly as mice aged from 4 months to 18 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>).

The spermatogonial stem cells and spermatocytes are supported by Sertoli cells, which provide trophic factors and structural support for spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cooke and Saunders, 2002</xref>). Sperm are then transferred and stored in the epididymis, from where mature sperm are ejected.

In contrast, the central lumens of the seminiferous tubules of 4-month-old wild-type and <italic>Ripk</italic>3-knockout mice are fully surrounded with cells, and are filled with sperm.

Consistently, mice with either of their core necroptosis execution components <italic>Ripk</italic>3 and <italic>Mlkl</italic> deleted from their genome showed dramatic delay of male reproductive aging phenotype, both morphologically and functionally.</p><p>Interestingly, one dose of TSZ treatment applied locally to the young testes resulted in the male reproductive system aging phenotype, including the enlargement of seminal vesicles, the depletion of cells in the seminiferous tubules, and decreases in fertility rates in wild-type but not <italic>Ripk</italic>3-knockout or <italic>Mlkl</italic>-knockout mice, strongly suggests that necroptosis happening within testis is the cause of symptomatic male reproductive system aging.</p><p>However, the cellular and molecular events that lead to the eventual aging phenotype warrant extensive future studies. Although only in spermatogonia cells the phospho-MLKL signal was observed in aged testis, Sertoli cells in seminiferous tubules were also depleted. Sertoli cells do express RIPK3 and undergo necroptosis in response to TSZ, however, whether these cells undergone necroptosis during the natural aging process and how their death related to necroptosis of spermatogonia are not known. Moreover, as testis age, the hormonal producing Leydig cells also lost. Leydig cells do not express RIPK3 thus unable to undergo necroptosis. Interestingly, in <italic>Ripk</italic>3- and <italic>Mlkl</italic>-knockout mice, and in mice fed with the RIPK1 inhibitor, Leydig cells are spared. The death of Leydig cells, mostly like through apoptosis since active caspase-8 and caspase-3 were seen on these cells in aging testis, is obviously subsequential to necroptotic death somewhere else. We have no idea how and what signal Leydig cells receive from necroptotic cells to activate apoptosis of their own. In addition to the depletion of spermatogonium stem cells, Sertoli cells, and Leydig cells during testis aging, the most striking feature of aging mouse male sex organ is the enlargement of seminal vesicles. Such an enlargement clearly involves growth of epithelial cells of this auxiliary organ. What growth signal the epithelial cells of seminal vesicle receive in response to the depletion of cells in testis is also enigmatic.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Necroptosis-promoted male reproductive system aging offers an evolutionary advantage at species level</title><p>The fact that knocking out either of the core necroptosis executing component from mouse genome or feeding mice with a chemical necroptosis inhibitor results in prolonged male reproductive longevity indicates that necroptosis actively promotes male reproductive system aging in wild-type mice. However, the progeny produced by aged mice with artificially extended reproductive longevity were not healthy. The cause for these unhealthy pups may be multiple, including age-related accumulation of DNA damages in the old sperm and other organs. Therefore, although mice without the core components of the necroptosis pathway maintain their reproductive activity into advanced ages (well beyond the age when wild-type mice have largely lost such capacity), these age-associated changes still caused deleterious effects on their progeny.</p><p>We therefore propose that necroptosis in testis is a physiological response to yet-to-be-identified, age-related, TNF family of cytokine(s) that transduces necroptosis signal through the canonical RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL pathway. The necroptotic death of cells in testis then triggers the other downstream age-related phenotypes such as enlargement of seminal vesicles, decreased testosterone levels and weight gain. Indeed, we observed an elevated TNF-α level in the old testis of wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, no such elevation was seen in the testis of age-matched <italic>Ripk</italic>3-knockout mice, indicating that such an elevation may be augmented through a feed forward mechanism. Whether TNF-α or other members of the TNF family of cytokines truly contributes to testis aging is not known and should be an interesting research topic for the future studies.</p><p>Necroptosis-instigated reproductive system aging effectively eliminates old animals from the reproductive pool. Given that aged animals carry significantly more DNA damage than younger animals, their elimination from the mating pool results in healthier pups overall, an outcome that would confer an evolutionary advantage over (a population) of animals that do not thusly employ a necroptosis program in their testes.</p><p>Interestingly, when wild-type mice were fed with food containing an RIPK1 inhibitor prior to the onset of reproductive system aging (13 months), the aging of the male reproductive system could be blocked and the effect lasted for 5 months when the experiment was terminated. This finding not only further confirms that necroptosis is the mechanism underlying male reproductive system aging, but also demonstrates an apparently-effective way to delay it.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The <italic>Ripk3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (<italic>Ripk3</italic>-knockout) mice (C57BL/6 strain) were generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Newton et al., 2004</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and four reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Manolis Pasparakis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting study that describes a delayed aging phenotype in the male reproductive tissue of MLKL and RIPK3 knockout mice. These studies are complemented by gain-of-function and loss-of-function pharmacological studies. The reported findings are important as they identify male reproductive aging as a physiological process regulated by necroptosis. Although the implication of these findings for human reproductive aging remains to be assessed, the mouse data presented here and particularly the studies with the RIPK1 inhibitor may provide a possible therapeutic perspective.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the presented data are convincing and support the authors' main conclusions. However, a number of questions concerning the data shown require clarification.</p><p>1) The nature of the aging phenotype is unclear because it involves different cell types that appear to show different behaviors. For example, the decline in testosterone with age (blocked by RIPK3 and MLKL KO) is presumably due to Leydig cells that do not express RIPK3 (subsection “Activation of apoptosis in Leydig cells during aging”) and are proposed to die by apoptosis secondarily to a primary necroptosis response by other cells, possibly including spermatogonia and sertoli cells. However, the seminal vesicle response is different – is this a proliferation response or a cell death response – and what is the proximal cause? All of these phenotypes may result from a single defect; indeed, the authors speculate that death receptors may be responsible for triggering spermatogonial necroptosis and reproductive aging. However, this potential role of germ cell necroptosis represents only one possible explanation of these aging phenotypes that may involve specific defects in more than one cell type. The use of whole body knockout mice (rather than conditional KO mice) and pharmacological approaches in the study limits the ability to deduce mechanism. It is therefore important that alternative explanations of the observed phenotype are discussed.</p><p>2) The decrease in sperm number observed in age wild type mice may not completely explain the reduced reproductive longevity shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>. In the absence of studies of mature sperm, in vitro fertilization experiments, or other more in-depth implantation analyses, the authors should be careful with this conclusion and discuss these data in more detail. The conclusion that all observed differences have a single cause might not be correct.</p><p>3) The authors speculate that death receptors may be responsible for triggering spermatogonial necroptosis and reproductive aging. Testing the functional role of the different death receptors in this process is beyond the scope of this manuscript, assessment of the expression of death ligands and receptors in the testes of young and aged mice could provide evidence strengthening this assumption. Moreover, assessment of markers of inflammation in these tissues (e.g. immune cell infiltration, cytokine/chemokine expression) would also provide helpful data on the possible role of an immune response in male reproductive organ aging.</p><p>4) The phospho-MLKL stainings support a role of necroptosis, but there is no evidence in the paper that cells in the seminiferous tubules actually die. In light of recent work by the Green lab showing that phosphorylated MLKL is not an irreversible marker of cell death, it would be helpful if the authors could assess cell death directly, for example by TUNEL or TEM in the tissues stained with the p-MLKL antibodies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27692.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Overall, the presented data are convincing and support the authors' main conclusions.

It is therefore important that alternative explanations of the observed phenotype are discussed.</italic> </p><p>The enlargement of seminar vesicles when mice age is a well-known phenomenon and lack of such change in RIP3 and MLKL knockout mice was the first visual clue to us that necroptosis might have a role in mouse reproductive organ aging. Our interpretation that the observed enlargement of seminal vesicles is a consequence of necroptosis in the testis is mainly based on the experimental result showing that a single locally injected necroptosis-inducing agent (henceforth ‘TSZ’) into testes resulted in enlarged seminal vesicles in wild type mice while RIP3 and MLKL knockout mice received the same injection did not show such a phenotype. We agree with the reviewers’ comments that since testis consists of several cell types with different cell death responses and our most straight forward interpretation that spermtogonia stem cells’ necroptosis is the trigger for male reproductive system aging may be a bit simplistic. We thus change the text to “necroptosis is part of the process underling the mouse male reproductive organ aging” and added a paragraph in the Discussion to entertain more complicated explanations.</p><p><italic>2) The decrease in sperm number observed in age wild type mice may not completely explain the reduced reproductive longevity shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>. In the absence of studies of mature sperm,</italic> in vitro <italic>fertilization experiments, or other more in-depth implantation analyses, the authors should be careful with this conclusion and discuss these data in more detail. The conclusion that all observed differences have a single cause might not be correct.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comments that the reduced reproductive longevity in wildtype mice shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> may result from a combinational effect of several factors in addition to decrease in sperm counts. These include testosterone level drop, empty of seminiferous tubules, drop of pituitary hormone levels, and enlargement of seminar vesicles. We incorporated these factors in the conclusion in our new manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) The authors speculate that death receptors may be responsible for triggering spermatogonial necroptosis and reproductive aging. Testing the functional role of the different death receptors in this process is beyond the scope of this manuscript, assessment of the expression of death ligands and receptors in the testes of young and aged mice could provide evidence strengthening this assumption. Moreover, assessment of markers of inflammation in these tissues (e.g. immune cell infiltration, cytokine/chemokine expression) would also provide helpful data on the possible role of an immune response in male reproductive organ aging.</italic> </p><p>Our speculation that death receptors participate in testis aging is mainly based the fact that RIP1 kinase inhibitor could blocks such aging phenotype and RIP1 is the only known signaling molecule that transduces necroptosis signal from death receptors to RIP3/MLKL. The suggestion to check the level of death receptors in aging testis is a good one and we added a western blotting analysis showing that TNFα level was increased in the aged wild type testes but not in the aged RIP3-knockout mice (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This data also indicated that the increase of this cytokine may be regulated in a feedforward fashion. We did not go further in this manuscript on the details of inflammatory elements in testis aging for a simple fact that interpretations of these observations are complicated and not helpful to the main conclusion of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The phospho-MLKL stainings support a role of necroptosis, but there is no evidence in the paper that cells in the seminiferous tubules actually die. In light of recent work by the Green lab showing that phosphorylated MLKL is not an irreversible marker of cell death, it would be helpful if the authors could assess cell death directly, for example by TUNEL or TEM in the tissues stained with the p-MLKL antibodies.</italic> </p><p>Although phospho-MLKL may not be an irreversible necroptotic marker, it is still the best characterized, necroptosis specific activation marker. To further strengthen this point, we added one more experimental result (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I-K</xref>) showing that testes of wild type mice on RIP1 inhibitor-containing diet for 5 months (now 18-month old) were devoid of phospho-MLKL signal whereas that from the control group on normal chow showed abundant staining. The non-irreversible nature of phospho-MLKL as described by Green’s group may contribute to the persistence of the signal so we could robustly detect them in the aging testes. On the other hand, TUNEL or TEM assay is not specific for necroptosis. We therefore did not use them.</p></body></sub-article></article>
