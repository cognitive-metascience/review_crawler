How the CMG is assembled and engages DNA substrates remains unclear. Using electron microscopy, we have determined the structure of the CMG in the presence of ATPγS and a DNA duplex bearing a 3′ single-stranded tail. The structure shows that the MCM subunits of the CMG bind preferentially to single-stranded DNA, establishes the polarity by which DNA enters into the Mcm2-7 pore, and explains how Cdc45 helps prevent DNA from dissociating from the helicase. The Mcm2-7 subcomplex forms a cracked-ring, right-handed spiral when DNA and nucleotide are bound, revealing unexpected congruencies between the CMG and both bacterial DnaB helicases and the AAA+ motor of the eukaryotic proteasome. The existence of a subpopulation of dimeric CMGs establishes the subunit register of Mcm2-7 double hexamers and together with the spiral form highlights how Mcm2-7 transitions through different conformational and assembly states as it matures into a functional helicase.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03273.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03273.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03273.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before a cell divides, it must duplicate its DNA so that each new cell inherits its own copy of the genome. To do this, the DNA double helix must be unwound so that the two individual strands of DNA can serve as templates for making new DNA molecules. Unwinding begins when two helicase complexes, termed the Mcm2-7 rings, are loaded together onto the DNA.</p><p>At first, the two Mcm2-7 rings encircle the double-stranded DNA and remain bound together in an inactive form. Activating the Mcm2-7 rings requires the binding of five other proteins to each ring, which forms two larger complexes called CMG helicases. When the CMG helicases form, the two DNA strands separate and an individual Mcm2-7 ring ends up encircling each of the single DNA strands. However, how an activated CMG complex is assembled, and how it binds to and unwinds DNA, is not fully understood.</p><p>Now, Costa et al. have determined the three-dimensional structure of the fruit fly CMG helicase bound to a DNA double helix with a single-stranded overhang at one end. The activated Mcm2-7 ring binds to the overhang, which confirms previous findings indicating that the activated helicase prefers single-stranded over double-stranded DNA. The structure also shows that, as a CMG helicase slides along the single-stranded DNA towards the double-stranded DNA, it is the ring complex's ‘motor domains’ that lead the way, while its DNA-binding domains trail behind.</p><p>Costa et al. also found that disrupting some of the interactions between two of the five proteins that bind to the Mcm2-7 ring either prevented the replicative helicase from forming or made it unstable. Furthermore, it was revealed that one of these two proteins—called Cdc45—was ideally placed to capture the strand of DNA that might be accidentally released from the Mcm2-7 ring. It was also discovered that when the complex is bound to DNA, the motor domains of the Mcm2-7 complex change shape from a flat ring to a spiral structure; the DNA-binding domains, however, remain in a flat ring. Costa et al. note that this structure is similar to that adopted by many viral and bacterial helicases, and that it even shares many features with the molecular machinery that breaks down unneeded or damaged proteins inside cells.</p><p>Finally, Costa et al. were able to image a structure composed of two CMG complexes bound together. This reveals the relative orientation of the two Mcm2-7 rings before they separate and move in opposite directions to unravel the DNA. The findings of Costa et al., combined with previous structural work in this field, demonstrate that the Mcm2-7 helicase complex can adopt many different shapes as it is assembled on DNA and activated to support DNA replication.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03273.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03273.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>Mcm2-7</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>motor protein</kwd><kwd>replication fork</kwd><kwd>AAA+ ATPase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Costa</surname><given-names>Alessandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Botchan</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Research Service Award, GM821972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pesavento</surname><given-names>James J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petojevic</surname><given-names>Tatjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Mcm2-7 motor unwinds DNA using an approach distinct from that of superfamily III helicases, and accesses multiple ring configurations and assembly states during the initiation of DNA replication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The faithful copying of DNA requires the correct spatial and temporal assembly of replication machineries at specific chromosomal loci known as origins. In eukaryotes, origins are licensed for replication by recruitment of the Mcm2-7 complex, a ring-shaped helicase that serves as the principal unwinding activity for separating parental DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blow, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bochman and Schwacha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lyubimov et al., 2012</xref>). Mcm2-7 is initially loaded around duplex DNA as an inactive double hexamer by the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Remus et al., 2009</xref>), forming a stable intermediate known as the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diffley et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donovan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maiorano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagi et al., 2002</xref>). Upon entry into S phase, Mcm2-7 associates with the GINS complex and Cdc45 generating an 11-member assembly termed the CMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanemaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gambus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pacek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>). GINS/Cdc45 assembly is dependent on the CDK kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zegerman and Diffley, 2007</xref>), while post-translational modification of Mcm subunits 2, 4, and 6 by the Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase (DDK) further contributes to CMG activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Labib, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheu and Stillman, 2010</xref>). Following the assembly of replicative polymerases and replisomal scaffolding factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gambus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muramatsu et al., 2010</xref>), the two CMG particles split apart into discrete complexes that have been proposed to each encircle a single DNA strand during translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yardimci et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boos et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>At present, multiple aspects of the Mcm2-7 loading and activation cycle remain poorly understood. Although the six homologous subunits of one Mcm2-7 complex are known to pair with a second Mcm2-7 complex through their N-terminal domains in the context of a double-hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Remus et al., 2009</xref>), the precise register by which these subunits interact with each other across the two rings is not known. How DDK phosphorylation of the Mcm2, Mcm6, and Mcm4 N-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Labib, 2010</xref>), or how a DDK-bypass mutation in the N-terminus of either Mcm4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheu and Stillman, 2010</xref>) or Mcm5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jackson et al., 1993</xref>), might aid in the switch from an inactive Mcm2-7 double hexamer state to a functional CMG is similarly unclear, particularly as Mcm4 is spatially segregated from Mcm2 and Mcm5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>During unwinding and fork progression, the CMG translocates 3′→5′ along DNA. How the various components of the CMG engage nucleic acid strands during this process has remained ill-defined. Cdc45 has recently been shown to contain a RecJ exonuclease domain that can bind DNA but that is catalytically inactive (Petojevic et al., unpublished data, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanchez-Pulido and Ponting, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krastanova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szambowska et al., 2014</xref>). Whether or how the Cdc45 RecJ fold might bind single DNA strands formed in the context of the CMG has not been established. Conflicting models likewise exist for how Mcm2-7 engages substrate DNAs as it moves 3′→5′ during strand separation, with biochemical data from archaeal MCMs and phylogenetic relationships to superfamily III (SFIII) helicases (such as the SV40 Large T antigen and the papillomavirus E1 protein) predicting mutually exclusive binding orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGeoch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rothenberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To begin to understand several extant questions surrounding how the CMG is formed and operates at molecular level, we have determined structure of the full-length complex from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> in the presence of a 3′-tailed DNA duplex and the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS, using negative-stain electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction methods. The structure establishes that: 1) the CMG preferentially associates with single-stranded DNAs over double-stranded substrates, 2) the C-terminal ATPase domains of Mcm2-7 form the leading edge of the motor as it advances on a duplex, and 3) the RecJ domain of Cdc45 is oriented to favor the capture of DNA segments that might accidently escape the Mcm2-7 pore. Comparison of the new structure with a previously-determined apo CMG model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2011</xref>) shows that the Mcm2-7 ATPase domains of the complex transition from a planar, open ring into a closed, right-handed spiral in the presence of both DNA and nucleotide. Analysis of this state alongside other ring-ATPases shows that the MCM spiral is most similar to that adopted by the bacterial DnaB helicase upon engaging single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</xref>), and that the GINS•Cdc45 complex bridges the junction between the ends of the spiral in a manner similar to that by which the Rpn1 accessory subunit spans a spiral Rpt1-6 ATPase assembly in the eukaryotic proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lander et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, examination of a subpopulation of CMG dimers present in our EM data shows how two Mcm2-7 complexes associate within a double hexamer and suggests that this dimerized state persists during CMG formation, prior to separation during fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yardimci et al., 2010</xref>). Collectively, our observations establish that Mcm2-7 unwinds DNA using an approach distinct from that of superfamily III helicases and highlight several new Mcm2-7 ring configurations and assembly states accessed by the motor during the initiation of DNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Determination of a higher-resolution CMG model</title><p>In a previous study, we determined the medium-resolution (28 Å) structures of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> CMG helicase in both an apo state and bound to a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2011</xref>). Though sufficient for mapping individual subunits within the CMG, both models revealed a planar structure for Mcm2-7, with GINS and Cdc45 spanning a gap that appeared between Mcm2 and Mcm5 when nucleotide was omitted. Since insights into where DNA might bind to the CMG or how binding might potentially alter the structure of complex were unclear, we set out to trap and image a prospective translocation intermediate of the CMG using 3D single-particle electron microscopy. A purified solution of the CMG was first mixed with a 20 bp duplex DNA substrate bearing a single-stranded 3′-dT<sub>(40)</sub> tail and passed over a sizing column in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS, to form a ternary complex. The complex did not behave well during cryo-preservation attempts using holey-carbon EM grids, so samples were instead deposited onto continuous carbon grids and exposed to uranyl formate for negative staining. A total of 29,913 particles were selected from EM micrographs acquired with JADAS automated data collection software (JEOL, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) on a JEM2100 electron microscope. Following particle picking and 2D averaging, a 3D model was generated by projection matching using a low-pass filtered (60 Å), free-hand test-validated, nucleotide-bound structure of the CMG as a starting model (‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lyubimov et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>CMG particles imaged with DNA and ATPγS turned out to be quite uniform, permitting structure determination to a higher resolution than that obtained previously (18 Å vs 28 Å resolution, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The resultant model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in turn allowed for a more accurate fitting of the Mcm2-7 and GINS subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), revealing several new features. For instance, the location of Psf1 C-terminus, which was previously not visible, was now clearly evident, and could be readily fit to a recently-published full-length structure of Psf1 from an archaeal ortholog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oyama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Flexing within the Mcm2-7 ring was also apparent with the C-terminal lobes of different MCM subunits displaying markedly distinct degrees of movement with respect to their associated N-terminal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Asymmetric positioning between the two tiers of an MCM ring has not been reported previously, demonstrating that these elements are conformationally independent of each other to some extent in the presence of DNA substrates.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03273.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>18 Å resolution of a CMG–DNA–ATPγS complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top-down view (N-terminal MCM face) of the CMG highlighting subunit positions.

MCMs and viral SF3 helicases, such as SV40 LTag and the papilloma virus E1 protein, are both AAA+ ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neuwald et al., 1999</xref>). This relationship, coupled with shared ability of MCMs and SF3 enzymes to translocate along DNA in a 3′→5′ direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kelman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bochman and Schwacha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moyer et al., 2006</xref>), has suggested that members of two helicase families might operate by a common translocation mechanism. However, studies of E1 and archaeal MCMs bound to DNA substrates have yielded conflicting data concerning the direction by which DNA threads through the helicase pore. In E1, the 3′ end of DNA has been observed by X-ray crystallography to lie proximal to the C-terminal motor domains of the helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</xref>).

This transition in turn pinched off the large single channel that ran through the particle into two smaller channels, sealing the interior of Mcm2-7 away from the inner surface of GINS–Cdc45. In the DNA-bound model, the CMG still exhibits two channels; however, docking of the Cdc45 RecJ domain shows that its exonuclease/DNA-tracking groove is offset by 90° with respect to the central axis of the Mcm2-7 pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Consistent with this idea, cross-linking data in work to be published elsewhere (Petojevic et al.) show both that Cdc45 engages the leading strand of a fork substrate only in the absence of nucleotide and that this interaction is ablated by the mutation of residues suggested by the model to be important for DNA binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DNA and nucleotide remodel the Mcm2-7 AAA+ ATPase subunits into a right-handed spiral</title><p>How ATP-dependent physical movements within hexameric helicases are coupled to DNA binding and unwinding has long been a central question in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lyubimov et al., 2011</xref>).

First, the largest inter-subunit shifts within the Mcm2-7 ring, which occur between Mcm subunits 2 and 5, also correspond to the point where the GINS–Cdc45 complex docks against the helicase. Inspection of the DNA-bound model reveals that GINS–Cdc45 does not simply straddle the Mcm2/5 interface, but that portions of the accessory subunits actually wedge themselves between the N- and C-terminal tiers of the Mcm2-7 ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This action widens the exterior groove between the MCM N- and C-terminal domains at their points-of-contact with GINS–Cdc45, and is offset by a concomitant narrowing of the groove on the exterior MCM face opposite the GINS–Cdc45 binding site (i.e., Mcm4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The structural consequences resulting from GINS–Cdc45 binding suggests that these accessory subunits not only play a role in blocking access through the Mcm2/5 gate, as has been seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2011</xref>), but that they also help stabilize a spiral configuration of ATPase centers when DNA is present. Since the mutation of active site residues at the Mcm2/5 interface ablates helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bochman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>), it is likely that the spiral state observed here, which positionally offsets the ATP-binding site of Mcm5 from the arginine-finger residue of Mcm2, inter-converts with another conformation in which the Mcm2/5 interface is remodeled to form a catalytically functional ATPase center during the translocation cycle. Hence, a need for GINS–Cdc45 in preventing DNA from escaping Mcm2-7 would likely be infrequent and limited to instances when the Mcm2/5 gate accidentally opens for an extended period of time, such as at a roadblock created by other nucleoprotein complexes or DNA damage.</p><p>A second unexpected feature of the DNA-bound CMG complex is that the spiral is more pronounced than that seen in SF3 helicases, and instead more closely approximating the spiral evinced by a RecA-family helicase, DnaB, in the presence of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). The width of the Mcm2-7 central channel (as measured from homology models of the motor domains docked into the EM density) is likewise significantly larger (∼30–35 Å) compared to E1 (∼14 Å), and more closely approaches that of DnaB (∼22 Å). Interestingly, in E1 and DnaB the difference in channel diameter and subunit rise between the two proteins sculpts the DNA substrate bound by each helicase into a single-stranded helix whose relative pitches differ significantly; these geometric differences allow each subunit of DnaB to engage two nucleotides of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</xref>), whereas E1 binds only a single nucleotide per protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</xref>). The similarity of the Mcm2-7 spiral to DnaB raises the interesting possibility that the helicase might translocate with a step-size greater than one nucleotide per ATP consumed; consistent with this notion, a recent study has shown that the MCM N-terminal DNA-binding collar of <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> binds four nucleotides per subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Froelich et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A third notable attribute of the ternary DNA–CMG–ATPγS model is that several structural features of the complex turn out to be most similar not to replicative helicases, but to a completely orthogonal system, namely, the regulatory subcomplex of the eukaryotic proteasome. The proteasome consists of several discrete subcomplexes including a heterohexameric unfoldase region, termed the ‘base’, which (like the CMG) contains six homologous AAA+ ATPase subunits (Rpt1-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forster et al., 2013</xref>). Recent cryo-EM studies have imaged the complete 26S yeast proteasome bound to ATP at ∼9 Å resolution showing that the AAA+ subunits of the base also form a right-handed spiral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lander et al., 2012</xref>). Comparison of proteasome spiral with that seen here for the CMG shows that these regions of the two systems exhibit a surprisingly similar global architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, the proteasome also contains an accessory subunit (Rpn1) that—as observed here for GINS–Cdc45 in the context of the CMG—wedges itself between a subset of ATPase and OB-fold domains present in Rpt1-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lander et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The structural congruencies exhibited between the CMG and proteasome ATPase subcomplexes suggest that, even though the substrates for the two systems differ greatly, both motors may share certain commonalities in how ATP turnover is coupled to movements that promote translocation. Such a similarity could underlie both the pronounced asymmetry of the CMG and proteasome ATPase rings, and the relatively high degree of tolerance shown by both systems toward active-site mutations within certain subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moreau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beckwith et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Identification of a dimeric CMG configuration</title><p>Although the CMG has been observed to operate as a discrete single complex during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yardimci et al., 2010</xref>), the loading of the Mcm2-7 hexamer onto DNA by ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 during initiation results in the transient formation of a catalytically inactive, head-to-head double hexamer intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Remus et al., 2009</xref>).

In particular, a small (∼5%) but consistent population of CMG particles was seen to form a clear dimeric species that adopts a distinctive head-to-head configuration through its MCM N-terminal regions, and which consistently orients the GINS–Cdc45 subcomplex toward opposing sides of the two ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

For example, the 180° offset of GINS and Cdc45 present in the dimer places each Mcm2/5 gate on the opposite sides of the complex, facing away from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). During origin melting, this configuration would allow a single DNA strand to escape each Mcm2-7 hexamer without steric interference from its partner CMG, enabling particle separation and the formation of two independent replication forks. The organization of the CMG dimer also indicates that the N-terminal regions of Mcm2 and Mcm5 of one hexamer associate in <italic>trans</italic> with the N-terminal regions of Mcm6 and Mcm4 of the partner hexamer. Such an interaction would help explain why Mcm4 and GINS have been seen to interact in pulldown studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>), even though the two factors map to distal positions of the CMG in the context of a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, the observed arrangement suggests that the ability of DDK to activate Mcm2-7 by phosphorylation of Mcm4, 2, and 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Labib, 2010</xref>) (as well as the ability of the Bob1 mutation in Mcm5 to bypass the requirement for DDK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jackson et al., 1993</xref>]) could result from a destabilization of the CMG dimer contacts that are symmetrically apposed across the N-terminal collar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Altogether, our data establish that the two Mcm2/5 gates of a double hexamer are spatially segregated from each other and indicate that separation of Mcm2-7 double hexamers occurs subsequent to CMG formation. Such a mechanism is consistent with recent findings showing that the phosphorylation by DDK is insufficient to promote the separation of Mcm2-7 double hexamers on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">On et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The existence of a dimeric CMG state, coupled with prior views of Mcm2-7 and the DNA-bound conformation of the Mcm2-7 ATPase domains seen here, highlights the innate plasticity of the MCM ring and the means by which different factors help remodel the helicase to support appropriate loading and activation during the initiation of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Biochemical studies using <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> proteins first showed that Mcm2-7 on its own possesses a natural discontinuity—the ‘Mcm2/5 gate’—through which DNA can enter and exit the helicase pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bochman and Schwacha, 2007</xref>). Structural studies have corroborated this observation, additionally showing that metazoan Mcm2-7 rings preferentially assume a left-handed lock-washer shape and that ATP alone is incapable of fully inducing ring closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lyubimov et al., 2012</xref>). Following the action of ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1, two Mcm2-7 hexamers become locked into a planarized co-joined ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Remus et al., 2009</xref>); in the presence of GINS, Cdc45, and single-stranded DNA, the Mcm2-7 ATPase domains shift again, but now into a right-handed spiral conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, Mcm2-7 undergoes a chiral-flip in architectural state as it matures into a functional helicase with loading, activation, and DNA binding all appearing to participate in these transitions.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03273.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Overview of Mcm2-7 organization, remodeling, and gate status during initiation and CMG formation.</title><p>Following synthesis and assembly, the isolated metazoan Mcm2-7 motor forms an inactive left-handed spiral, irrespective of nucleotide state, with a discontinuity between Mcm5 and Mcm2. The action of ORC, Cdc6 and Cdt1 results in the loading of a planar, head-to-head Mcm2-7 double hexamer onto a duplex DNA in which the Mcm2/5 gates are closed. Following loading, Dpb11-Sld2-Sld3 (11-2-3) chaperone GINS and Cdc45 onto the Mcm2-7 double hexamer and along with DDK promoted phosphorylation events, help promote both DNA melting, CMG formation and replication fork separation. Structural analysis of dimeric CMG particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) indicates that the Mcm2/5 gates are localized on the opposing sides of the dodecameric Mcm2-7 complex and that CMG formation precedes separation of the double hexamer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03273.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03273.011</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03273-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Why might Mcm2-7 traverse through such disparate intermediates? One possibility is that Mcm2-7 initially assembles into an inactive conformation to prevent inadvertently triggering aberrant replication events. An alternative possibility, not necessarily incompatible with the first, is that Mcm2-7 might transition through different forms as a means to promote the melting of duplex replication origins. Interestingly, an important attribute of some of the states adopted by Mcm2-7 is the existence of a breach or subunit offset in the ATPase ring between the Mcm2 and Mcm5 subunits. Given the topological barrier that extended DNA segments present to encirclement by toroidal proteins, it is notable that two MCM-associated factors—Cdt1 and GINS–Cdc45—both appear to occlude the Mcm2/5 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, controlled access through the Mcm2/5 gate appears useful not only for regulating DNA access into a preformed Mcm2-7 hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bochman and Schwacha, 2007</xref>), but also for preventing accidental DNA egress in the apo state and at stalled forks (Petojevic et al., unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>The structure of the eukaryotic CMG complex bound to nucleotide and a 3′-tailed DNA substrate helps resolve many outstanding questions surrounding the mechanism by which this key replication assembly forms and operates. The structure reveals that the RecJ domain of Cdc45, which recent data have found to bind to escaped leading strand substrates (Petojevic et al., unpublished data), takes up a position on the CMG that would aid in capturing a DNA segment that might escape from the Mcm2-7 pore. Our EM data show that the nucleotide-loaded CMG orients on single-stranded DNA such that the 3′ end enters first through the C-terminal AAA+ domains of Mcm2-7, consistent with prior biochemical data indicating that archaeal MCMs move along DNA with the opposite polarity as superfamily III helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGeoch and Bell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rothenberg et al., 2007</xref>). The binding of DNA to the CMG also induces the formation of a right-handed spiral in the MCM ATPase domains whose overall structure more closely mimics bacterial RecA-family replicative helicases than its viral AAA+ cousins, and whose relative arrangement of AAA+ domains and accessory subunits is mirrored by the regulatory subcomplex of the eukaryotic proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lander et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, we find that the CMG can form head-to-head dimers in which the two Mcm2/5 gates are fully offset from each other, helping to fill in key gaps concerning the higher-order organization of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer and how the CMG matures from this state into two single particles that encircle complementary single strands. Future studies will be needed to definitively establish the full paths of the leading- and lagging-strand DNA bound to the CMG and the extent to which the disparate AAA+ and RecA-family ring-translocases share or diverge in coupling ATP turnover to specific subunit movements that drive substrate translocation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cloning and construction of baculoviruses</title><p>Baculoviruses were constructed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, the MCM3 gene was tagged with FLAG epitope at the amino terminus through 5′ PCR oligonucleotides that inserted the epitope in frame. Mcm2, Mcm3, Mcm4, Mcm5, Psf1, Psf2, and Psf3 cDNAs were inserted between EcoRI and SpeI restriction sites of the pFastBac1 vector. The cDNA of Mcm6 and Mcm7 was inserted between BamHI and SpeI sites, and Cdc45 and Sld5 cDNA between EcoRI and Xba restriction sites. These vector templates were used for generation of CMG mutants through PCR based mutagenesis. Sequencing was used to verify the entire protein coding regions of all generated pFastBac1 constructs. Specific deletion mutants of either the Psf1 C-terminus or Cdc45 N-terminus included Psf1<sup>1−139</sup>, Psf1<sup>1−170</sup>, Psf1<sup>1−176</sup>, Psf1<sup>1−184</sup>, and Cdc45<sup>Δ1−99</sup>. C-terminal deletions were constructed by introducing stop codons after the desired residue and by removing any remaining C-terminal sequences present from the original cDNA clone. N-terminal deletions were constructed by the removal of the pertinent cDNA regions and by introducing a start (ATG) codon in front of the desired residue. The same restriction enzyme sites as described above were used to subclone all truncation constructs into the pFastBac1 vector. To target the Psf1–Cdc45 interface, alanine substitutions in the C-terminus of Psf1 were introduced individually or in parallel into for Glu190, Leu192, Val193, and Arg194 by site-directed mutagenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Nucleoprotein complex preparation</title><p>The CMG complex was purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>), but with the following changes. Briefly, after co-infection with 11 distinct baculoviruses, proteins were expressed for 72 hr in Hi5 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by culturing in 500-ml spinner flasks and co-infecting at 1.2^10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml density. Cells were lysed by hypotonic shock combined with one freeze–thaw cycle and Dounce homogenization. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and the protein complex was immunoaffinity purified over anti-flag (M2) antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to bind a FLAG-tag on Mcm3. To isolate the fully intact CMG from incomplete complexes, the protein preparation was passed over a Mono S HR 5/5 ion exchange column, followed by a Mono Q HR 5/5 ion exchange chromatography using an ÄKTA Purifier (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Peak fractions were collected and then both further purified and concentrated using a Mono Q PC 1.6/5 column coupled to a Pharmacia SMART system. The purified material was dialyzed into a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, and 1 mM DTT. The final protein concentration as measured by the Bradford protein assay was 1.2 mg/ml.</p><p>Oligonucleotides used for nucleoprotein complex reconstitution were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology and shipped as lyophilized pellets.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, the experiments are well executed the data are sound and the main conclusions are justified. However, neither the inference regarding the ssDNA path (on Cdc45) nor the final model (in terms of conformational changes during the loading and translocation) are fully supported by the data. These issues can be addressed provided that the authors can address the following major points; additional experimentation is likely not required:</p><p>1) Relationship of ssDNA binding to Mcm subunits. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows a very specific structure in which DNA is uniquely in contact with the Mcm5 subunit. The basis for this figure is EM reconstructions of the CMG complex with bound DNA that contains a streptavidin tag. As ssDNA is poorly visualized under EM, the streptavidin marks the location of the DNA in the complex. However, 1) the class averages in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> show the streptavidin at a considerable distance from the CMG complex, making assignment of a specific DNA-binding MCM subunit difficult, and 2) as nearly as this reviewer can tell, there is nothing in the text that specifically identifies Mcm5 as the sole DNA binding subunit. Explain: is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> a structural summary or artistic license?</p><p>2) Thresholding/filtering issues. A major point in the paper is the physical interaction between CDC45 and Mcm5, in which the N terminus of CDC45 is proposed to essentially pry apart the N and C-terminal domains of Mcm5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). There are several technical problems with this conclusion. Although varying the thresholding (presumably through Chimera) is a useful way to emphasize various features, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> it is so extensive that the N and C-terminal domains of Mcm5 are completely separated from one another, a feature not demonstrated by other CMG structures presented in this paper. In general, the thresholding level should generate an enclosed volume consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the component proteins: was this done? When 2 structures are being compared, the levels of thresholding and filtering should be the same in each structure.</p><p>3) In addition, the interpretation that CDC45 pries apart the N and C-terminus of Mcm5 largely depends upon how the various masses within the structure were segmented – what part of the density belongs to Mcm5 and what part actually belongs to CDC45? This question has an additional problem insofar as the region of CDC45 that likely interacts with Mcm5 is not highly conserved and the authors were unable to generate a homology model for it. Moreover, the software used for segmentation that sets the subunit boundaries (likely the Segger tool in Chimera) requires a very high-resolution structure to give reliable results without computational validation (&lt; 10 angstroms). Although for transmission EM the structures in this manuscript are excellent, it seems a little optimistic that the authors have enough resolution to accurately validate these boundaries visually. There are computational methods available to provide proper validation of their results (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ncmi.bcm.edu/ncmi/software/segger/docs_fitting_scores">http://ncmi.bcm.edu/ncmi/software/segger/docs_fitting_scores</ext-link>).</p><p>4) The figures are confusing and should be improved. Specifically:</p><p>A) In all the figures, top and side views should be kept in similar orientations whenever possible for clarity.</p><p>B) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are inconsistent in terms of leading strand and lagging strand positions relative to Mcm subunits.</p><p>C) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> suggests a rocking motion (rotation) between the CMG and the duplex DNA. This is not supported by data here. It is quite possible that the leading strand could slip out to the outer channel formed by GINS and Cdc45 without altering the relative orientation between duplex DNA and the CMG. Furthermore, the conformation when the leading strand is captured by Cdc45 is different from that shown here. This figure should be altered to reflect this.</p><p>D) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggests the exact register of the CMG dimer based on 2D class averages. Although it is plausible, there are no experimental data to confirm this and Models 3 or 5 cannot be completely dismissed. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> suggest there might be some flexibility in the dimer arrangement as not all the class averages display the same tight packing. This part of the Results/discussions should be tuned down.</p><p>E) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Translocation step. The interactions of GINS and Cdc45 with Mcm are different in the two complexes. Please check polarity! The earlier steps neither are unclear nor supported by data here so should be omitted. Furthermore, since Mcm2-7 likely act sequentially, different subunits will have different nucleotide bound states at a given time. ATP-gS state presented here therefore might not reflect the functional state during translocation. It is also unclear what triggers gate open/close. How does the Cdt1-Orc complex (which induces the gate being blocked) enable dsDNA loading? What is the defining factor that leads to DNA melting and gate opening/strand separation? These are not addressed here and therefore <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> should be modified to only reflect major conclusions here. The leading strand and lacking strand as well as their directionality should be labelled.</p><p>5) Methods: how many particles contributed to the final reconstruction? How were the streptavidin-labelled data processed? Is a 3D reconstruction obtained (since 436 micrographs were collected)?</p><p>6) Significance: the author argued that the need for GINS/Cdc45 in preventing DNA from escaping Mcm2-7 would likely to be minimal. This raises the question of the significance of the additional roles proposed in this paper (to capture the “escaped” leading strand). Please reconcile.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03273.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Relationship of ssDNA binding to Mcm subunits.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref> <italic>shows a very specific structure in which DNA is uniquely in contact with the Mcm5 subunit.

Insofar as thresholding, all of the renderings mentioned above have indeed been prepared to consistently account for the molecular weight of the full CMG complex, with the exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> (where a slightly higher threshold highlights the Cdc45<sup>CTD</sup>-MCM contact) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (where a lower threshold was used to visualize the region assigned to duplex DNA – negative staining of nucleic acids generally results in “thinner” densities than what one would get with cryo-electron microscopy, which is why the threshold was lowered in this instance). Using the constant threshold shown in the primary figures, the separation of Mcm5 N- and C-terminal domains is apparent in all CMG renderings. For example, the CMG side-view shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> highlights the N-terminal and C-terminal-AAA+ domains separation of Mcm5 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. A similar separation of the N- and C-terminal domains of Mcm5 is likewise present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; this splaying is only unapparent because Cdc45 is rendered opaque, occluding the view of Mcm5.</p><p><italic>3) In addition, the interpretation that CDC45 pries apart the N and C-terminus of Mcm5 largely depends upon how the various masses within the structure were segmented – what part of the density belongs to Mcm5 and what part actually belongs to CDC45?

We agree that we did not include sufficient data to explain the rationale for our assignment of the C-terminal domain of Cdc45. We have now included a comparison between the N-terminal view of the isolated <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Mcm2-7 (as published in Lyubimov, <italic>et al.</italic> PNAS 2012) and the bottom view of the DNA-bound CMG (now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). This comparison shows that no density is appended to either the N-terminal helical domain of Mcm5 or Mcm2 in the isolated Mcm2-7 complex. This result led us to conclude that the density seen to interdigitate between Mcm5 and Mcm2 likely corresponds to the otherwise unaccountable C-terminal domain of Cdc45. However, we acknowledge that it is possible that the extreme N-terminus of Mcm2 (which is thought to be unstructured) might instead become ordered to occupy this region upon Cdc45 binding.

In stating that the need for Cdc45 in preventing DNA escape is minimal, we should have said that we expect the frequency with which Cdc45 would be called upon to capture an escaped leading strand to be low. The rationale for this statement is because once bound to both ATP and DNA for translocation, it seems likely that the Mcm2/5 gate would open relatively infrequently (except, perhaps during fork stalling); however, whenever the gate does open, Cdc45 would be present to prevent DNA escape.
