cancer patients but remains a poorly understood process. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most lethal and most metastatic cancer types. SCLC cells normally express neuroendocrine and neuronal gene programs but accumulating evidence indicates that these cancer cells become relatively more neuronal and less neuroendocrine as they gain the ability to metastasize. Here we show that mouse and human SCLC cells in culture and in vivo can grow cellular protrusions that resemble axons. The formation of these protrusions is controlled by multiple neuronal factors implicated in axonogenesis, axon guidance, and neuroblast migration. Disruption of these axon-like protrusions impairs cell migration in culture and inhibits metastatic ability in vivo. The co-option of developmental neuronal programs is a novel molecular and cellular mechanism that contributes to the high metastatic ability of SCLC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SCLC</kwd><kwd>neuroendocrine</kwd><kwd>neuronal</kwd><kwd>protrusions</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 CA206540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sage</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA124435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winslow</surname><given-names>Monte M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sage</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005188</institution-id><institution>Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24DT-0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Dian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qu</surname><given-names>Fangfei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005188</institution-id><institution>Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Hongchen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002590</institution-id><institution>American Lung Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chuang</surname><given-names>Chen-Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001784</institution-id><institution>Pancreatic Cancer Action Network</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grüner</surname><given-names>Barbara M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013874</institution-id><institution>Hope Funds for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grüner</surname><given-names>Barbara M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 CA207866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oudin</surname><given-names>Madeleine J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In small cell lung cancer, the transition from a neuroendocrine state to a more neuronal state endows these cancer cells with increased migration and metastatic potential.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metastases are a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. By the time cancer cells leave their primary site and spread to distant sites, they have acquired the ability to migrate and invade, as well as characteristics that enable them to survive and proliferate within new microenvironments. These phenotypes are likely driven by changes in gene expression and epigenetic programs that allow cancer cells to overcome the many hurdles that normally constrain the metastatic process. Despite recent advances, our understanding of the principles and mechanisms underlying metastasis remains incomplete, including how changes in molecular programs can translate into selective advantages that enable cancer cells to spread to other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fidler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obenauf and Massagué, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lambert et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a high-grade neuroendocrine cancer that accounts for ~15% of all lung cancers and causes over 200,000 deaths worldwide each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sabari et al., 2017</xref>). The ability of SCLC cells to leave the primary tumor and establish inoperable metastases is a major cause of death and a serious impediment to successful therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Meerbeeck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farago and Keane, 2018</xref>). SCLC is one of the most metastatic human cancers, with over 60% of SCLC patients presenting with disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis, often including liver, bone, brain, and secondary lung metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakazawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riihimäki et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Molecular analyses to understand metastatic progression of human cancer are often limited by difficulties in accessing tumor samples at defined stages. This problem is especially true for SCLC, since patients with metastatic disease rarely undergo surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes et al., 2017</xref>). Genetically engineered mouse models of human SCLC recapitulate the genetics, histology, therapeutic response, and highly metastatic nature of the human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kwon and Berns, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gazdar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rudin et al., 2019</xref>). These genetically engineered mouse models recapitulate cancer progression in a controlled manner and allow for the isolation of primary tumors and metastases directly from their native microenvironment. Recently, we and others have used mouse models to uncover gene expression programs that are altered in SCLC metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denny et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Semenova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). While SCLC cells display features of neuroendocrine cells, the gene expression programs in metastatic SCLC include not only genes normally expressed in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells but also those expressed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carney et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cutz, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broers et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 1988</xref>). Higher levels of the neuronal markers such as NSE (neuron-specific enolase) correlate with shorter survival and more metastatic disease in SCLC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carney et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Zandwijk et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). Broad neuronal gene expression programs are enriched in metastases from mouse models of SCLC, however, whether SCLC cells actually gain neuronal characteristics and whether neuronal features are key regulators of metastatic ability has not been previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denny et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böttger et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here we find that the metastatic state of SCLC can include the growth of protrusions that resemble axons. These axon-like growths increase the ability of SCLC cells to migrate and metastasize, thus representing a cellular mechanism that enhances the metastatic ability of SCLC cells that have transitioned to a more neuronal cell state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SCLC cells can form long cellular protrusions in culture and in vivo</title><p>To investigate SCLC migration, we developed an assay in which SCLC cells, which classically grow in culture as floating spheres or aggregates, are grown as a monolayer under Matrigel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denny et al., 2016</xref> and Materials and methods).

This observation led us to investigate whether the protrusions were similar to neuronal axons or dendrites. We identified a list of 69 genes classically associated in the scientific literature with axonogenesis and axon guidance, and found that many of these genes are expressed in at least subsets of primary human SCLCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">George et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>–table 2). Thus, the gene expression programs controlling axonal growth in neuronal cells are also present in SCLC cells. We previously performed gene expression analyses on purified cancer cells from primary tumors and metastases from two mouse models of SCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denny et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).

These 13 genes are all expressed in at least a subset of human SCLC tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">George et al., 2015</xref>). We excluded gene families for which functional overlap and compensatory mechanism were likely. STRING analysis and literature searches confirmed that these 13 candidates had a significant connection with biological processes related to neurogenesis and the regulation of neuron projection development. These proteins were not often connected with one another and thus likely contribute to distinct aspects of these biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>–table 6).</p><p>A better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the upregulation of gene programs linked to axonogenesis and neuronal migration may help us understand the functional role of these gene programs in SCLC cells. SCLC tumors have been divided in major subtypes driven by key transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rudin et al., 2019</xref>). In human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">George et al., 2015</xref>), the 13-gene signature correlated more closely with the ‘SCLC-N’ subtype, driven by the transcription factor NEUROD1, and both human cell line NCI-H446 and the PDX model LU86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>) belong to this subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The murine cell lines used to study protrusions in this study are of the ‘SCLC-A’ subtype (driven by the transcription factor ASCL1), even though the correlation between the 13-gene signature and ASCL1 expression was weak in mouse tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also found no correlation between <italic>ASCL1</italic> and <italic>NEUROD1</italic> expression and the ability to grow protrusions in other human cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>–table 1). Thus, the ability to grow protrusions may exist across SCLC subtypes. We and others have identified a role for the NFIB transcription factor in SCLC metastasis and the induction of gene programs linked with neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denny et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Semenova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, the 13-gene signature correlated with high NFIB expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). NFIB knock-down in mouse SCLC cells that had high NFIB levels and formed protrusions did not result in the global downregulation of the 13-gene signature, but was sufficient to reduce the formation of protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). Overexpression of NFIB in SCLC mouse cells with low NFIB levels and without protrusions was not sufficient to lead to the upregulation of the entire set of 13 genes or to induce the growth of protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E,G</xref>). Thus, while NFIB upregulation may be important in the induction of neuronal programs in SCLC cells, the upstream factors that control neuronal programs specifically associated with axonogenesis and migration in SCLC remain to be fully characterized. These experiments led us to more specifically test the role of the 13 selected genes in the formation of protrusions and the role of these protrusions in cell migration and metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Loss of Axon-like protrusions inhibits the migration of SCLC cells</title><p>In the 25 human SCLC cell lines analyzed in the Cancer Dependency Map project, knock-down of these 13 genes rarely affected the growth of SCLC cells in culture, consistent with these genes influencing aspects of cell physiology not related to the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>–table 7 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Here we investigated the function of neuronal gene expression programs in metastatic SCLC. We found that SCLC cells can grow axon-like protrusions and that these protrusions contribute to the migratory and metastatic phenotypes of these cells. This study identifies a cellular mechanism by which a neuroendocrine-to-neuronal transition promotes metastasis of SCLC cells.</p><p>The expression of neuronal factors in SCLC has been known for more than three decades and has been used as a marker for disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carney et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cutz, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broers et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 1988</xref>). However, whether neuronal programs in SCLC cells play a direct role in SCLC progression has not been rigorously investigated. We uncovered the formation of axon-like protrusions as one functional aspect of neuronal differentiation in SCLC and provide data to support a role for these protrusions in migration and metastasis. It is likely that other phenotypes usually associated with neurons beyond these axon-like protrusions also contribute to the expansion and the spread of SCLC cells. Furthermore, these axon-like protrusions may have other functions beyond facilitating metastatic seeding to the liver, which may including facilitating SCLC cell migration within the primary tumor, intravasation into the bloodstream, and movement within the parenchyma during metastatic expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shibue et al., 2012</xref>). Future investigation of the roles of axon-like protrusions in SCLC will likely benefit from additional genetic analyses as well as high-resolution in vivo imaging methods. Recent evidence suggests that several other human tumor types also increase the expression of neuronal programs as they become more metastatic, especially to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wingrove et al., 2019</xref>). It will be important for future studies to determine if aspects of the neuronal program also contribute to the striking ability of SCLC cells to seed and expand in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lukas et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our data indicate that SCLC metastasis is facilitated by the development of axon-like protrusions, however other molecular mechanisms certainly also increase the probability that a cancer cell will successfully overcome all the hurdles that limit the development of tissue destructive metastases. For instance, we found that knock-down of <italic>Dcx</italic> (coding for Doublecortin) has little to no effect on the number of protrusions but strongly inhibits migration in our 2D Matrigel assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>), thus Doublecortin may promote SCLC migration independent from an impact on protrusion formation.</p><p>The formation of protrusions in SCLC cells is controlled by pathways previously implicated in the formation of axons and the migration of neuronal cells but it is unclear how the expression of these pro-protrusion genes is coordinated. Existing data support a role for the NFIB transcription factor across SCLC subtypes in the up-regulation of neuronal gene programs in general and gene programs associated more specifically with axonogenesis and neuronal migration (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denny et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Semenova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is likely that a combination of genetic and epigenetic factors contributes to the ability of SCLC to grow protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qadeer et al., 2019</xref>). Adhesion molecules and other factors in the tumor microenvironment are also likely to contribute to the formation of protrusions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Could an understanding of the molecular and cellular processes related to axon-like protrusions in SCLC cells ultimately be translated into clinical benefit for SCLC patients? Because NFIB is an important regulator of neuronal gene programs in SCLC cells, targeting this transcription factor may help inhibit SCLC metastatic potential in the future; one possible strategy could be the use of targeted proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paiva and Crews, 2019</xref>). Another option could be to target individual factors in the axonogenesis and neuronal migration programs. Several of these factors may be required to drive these programs and these programs may not be as critical for brain function in adults as they are during development. Previous studies on SCLC have targeted the CXCR4 chemokine receptor due to its role in cell adhesion and migration and its expression in SCLC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Teicher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taromi et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, CXCR4 also contributes to the formation of axon-like protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In a recent clinical trial in SCLC patients, CXCR4 inhibition was well tolerated but this inhibition did not significantly reduce disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Salgia et al., 2017</xref>). However, agents that reduce the ability of cancer cells to overcome early barriers of metastatic seeding will likely need to be employed in specific settings where inhibition of the metastatic process would logically provide clinical benefit. For example, in patients with resectable SCLC, inhibition of pro-metastatic pathways in the neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant setting could reduce the frequency or multiplicity of metastatic relapse.</p><p>More generally, the transition from a neuroendocrine state to a state where neuroendocrine differentiation is decreased but neuronal differentiation is increased may be related to the exceptional plasticity of SCLC cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to contribute to migration, metastasis, and resistance to treatment in many cancer contexts and may play a role in SCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh and Settleman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cañadas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison Stewart et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Brien-Ball and Biddle, 2017</xref>). Vascular mimicry (or epithelial-to-endothelial transition (EET) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>) may also contribute to tumor growth and response to treatment in SCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williamson et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, Notch-induced dedifferentiation to a non-neuroendocrine state can generate an intra-tumoral niche that protects neuroendocrine SCLC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim et al., 2017</xref>). Based on our results and recent observations in other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wingrove et al., 2019</xref>), we propose that an epithelial-to-neuronal transition contributes to key aspects of cancer metastasis. Further characterization of this neuronal state in both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cancers is likely to uncover novel mechanisms of cancer progression and may ultimately offer new insight into anti-metastasis strategies in the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse model</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. <italic>Trp53<sup>flox</sup>, Rb1<sup>flox</sup>, p130<sup>flox</sup>,</italic> and <italic>R26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic> mice have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schaffer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denny et al., 2016</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MMRRC_043692-UCD">MMRRC_043692-UCD</ext-link>).

Mouse livers were harvested at 4–6 weeks after injection. Tumor number was quantified by directly counting on liver surface and also quantified by counting metastasis number or areas on the H and E sections. For subcutaneous injection, 5 × 104 cells were resuspended in 100 μL PBS and mixed with 100 µL Matrigel (Corning, 356231, Corning, NY) with four injection sites per mouse. For both subcutaneous and intravenous injections, SCLC cells were transplanted into age-matched gender-matched NSG mice. For short-term tumor seeding assays, 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> of N2N1G cells or 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> of 16 T cells were transplanted intravenously into the lateral tail vein of NSG mice.

protrusions on SCLC cells in culture and in vivo contribute to the aggressive, metastatic potential of these cells. Protrusions were detected in mouse SCLC cell lines in migration assays and in vivo, in PDX models. Axonal markers such as GAP43 are expressed in mouse SCLCs, about 50% of human primary SCLC and 6 out of 9 human SCLC metastases, but not in normal neurendocrine or non-endocrine lung epithelial cells or normal mouse lung sections. While the driver that activates axonal protein expression is not clear (e.g., expression of NEUROD1 or ASCL1 does not correlate, and NFIB appears to be neither necessary nor sufficient), the axonal proteins do seem to be important for migration and metastasis: when GAP43 or other proteins involved in axonal biology are knocked down by shRNA, cell protrusions and the migratory activity of the cells decrease. Importantly, this study also shows in an in vivo mouse model of metastasis, knocking down GAP43 or FEZ1, decreases metastasis to the liver, without affecting primary tumor formation. The concept that the neuronal characteristics of SCLC are correlated with poor outcome is in the literature, but this study provides identification of some players and experimental evidence for their requirement for migration and metastasis. Overall, these findings are significant for our understanding of SCLC migration and metastasis and may represent a more general new mechanism for cancer cells to promote their migration and metastasis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Axon-like protrusions promote small cell lung cancer migration and metastasis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John Minna (Reviewer #1); René-Marc Mège (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is highly metastatic but there is little understanding of what features of SCLC cells contribute to their propensity to invade and metastasize. This study proposes that progressive neuronal characteristics contribute to the aggressive, metastatic potential of these cells. Yang et al. characterize axon-like protrusions that they observe on SCLC cells in culture and in vivo. The protrusions that express the axonal markers TAU and TUJ1 but not the dendritic marker MAP2. They observed protrusions in mouse SCLC cell lines in migration assays, in vivo, and in PDX models. When multiple proteins involved in axonal biology are knocked down by shRNA, cell protrusions and the migratory activity of the cells decrease. Importantly, this study also shows in an in vivo mouse model of metastasis, knocking down 2 genes, GAP43 and FEZ1, decrease metastasis to the liver, without affecting primary tumor formation. The concept that the neuronal characteristics of SCLC are correlated with poor outcome is in the literature, but this study provides identification of some players and experimental evidence for their requirement for migration and metastasis. This neuroendocrine/epithelial to neuronal transition may also be shared by other cancer cells and may thus represent a more general new mechanism for cancer cells to promote their migration and metastasis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This paper is reviewed in the context of the urgent need to identify and potentially therapeutically target mechanisms of metastases in SCLC, one of the most highly metastatic human cancers for which we need rational therapies. Thus, the authors have identified and tackled an important problem with clinical translational relevance. There are a series of issues, which, if addressed, would improve this manuscript and strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>1) While it is clear that these SCLC-expressed neuronal genes are functionally important, the authors conclude that they have identified a cellular mechanism through which neuroendocrine to neuronal transition promotes metastasis of SCLC cells (Discussion, first paragraph). An alternative possibility is that these programs are active in normal lung neuroendocrine cells and in primary SCLC, contributing to a high propensity of SCLC cells to metastasize. What is unclear is the extent to which a neuroendocrine to neuronal transition is at work in promoting the expression of the genes under study and conferring the phenotypes observed.</p><p>For example, do normal pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) form long protrusions/axon-like structures and express the axonal marker TAU? Do normal PNECs express GAP43 and FEZ1, i.e. the neuronal genes most thoroughly examined in this study shown by the authors to be important for metastasis?</p><p>Also, is there evidence that the expression of genes such as GAP43 and FEZ1 is increased in metastatic SCLC compared to primary SCLC? These genes were expressed in the George et al., RNAseq dataset composed of primary SCLC samples, so it is important to know if they increase in metastatic cells.</p><p>If the neuronal features of SCLC cells identified in this study are active in normal lung neuroendocrine cells and in primary SCLC, then it becomes less clear that a neuroendocrine to neuronal transition is important for SCLC metastasis and for the phenotypes described and the authors would need to reconsider their conclusions.</p><p>2) There are many human and mouse SCLC cell culture models available for study. How many were analyzed for the presence of protrusions and what% had axon like protrusions? The text is vague on this point and only few cell lines are shown. Likewise, in deposited datasets like those the authors have studied (e.g. George et al., 2015) how frequent are SCLC expressing the neuronal markers? Are there molecular, clinical, and histological differences between the SCLC preclinical models that do or don't have these protrusions?</p><p>3) The authors are very vague on the preclinical model cell line and patient derived xenograft (PDX) descriptions. Basically, readers should not have to go look up the information on them to understand the experiments. It would be really helpful if any given model used could be described better to give some context. For example, what are the characteristics of the different human PDXs used-are the expressing key factors or characteristics that have been described for different subtypes of SCLC such as ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, none of these, etc.? The authors were active in publications studying such factors and could easily provide quantitative information and context of neuronal differentiation to such factors as these lineage oncogenes (beyond the comparison of ASCL1 positive mouse models and one human SCLC line).</p><p>4) The authors were the first to report on the role of NFIB in generating metastatic behavior and indicated its role in neuronal phenotypes. In fact, in that report they raised the question of whether NFIB does this through generating neuronal characteristics. Thus, an obvious question is whether NFIB controls the expression of any of the neuronal genes they studied with functional genomics? While they cite unpublished studies of exogenous expression of NFIB, a more obvious question is whether knockout of NFIB in tumor models with protrusions influences these? I am sure, this had to be one of the first things they addressed, but we are given no information on this, making me wonder why not? Whatever the answer is we need to know.</p><p>5) Murine SCLC lines 16T and KP22 have different abilities to form protrusions (16T does and KP22 doesn't). Is there RNAseq data on these and any differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that would be of interest in this respect?</p><p>6) Assuming they are correct in the major claim (SCLCs differentiating along neuronal pathways lead to mechanisms that promote metastases), what is the path to a &quot;therapeutic window&quot;? Clearly, targeting some of these features directly, could lead to injury to the nervous system. So, is the approach to be to decide what controls this expression program and then target that or something else? This brings one back to the consideration of the role of key lineage oncogenes (in this case NEUROD1 seems like the prime culprit) or transcription factors like NFIB in controlling the neuronal program, and how best to target these transcription factors. This key issue is only dealt with by the authors in a tangential way in the Results or Discussion section.</p><p>7) The authors show that metastasis is affected very early (two days). This suggests that GAP43 or FEZ1 inhibition impacts the emigration out of tumor. This may be difficult to detect rapidly by in vivo imaging in mice but an easy way to start could be to seed tumor cells aggregates in 3D Matrigel or collagen gel and image live cell emigration. The authors have all the tools to test this hypothesis in a very short time period.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50616.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This paper is reviewed in the context of the urgent need to identify and potentially therapeutically target mechanisms of metastases in SCLC, one of the most highly metastatic human cancers for which we need rational therapies.

We presented data in the first version of the manuscript that TAU expression is lowly expressed or not detectable in &gt; 90% of early SCLC primary tumors in the mouse models (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B). Importantly, the percentage of tumors that express TAU increased as the tumors progress. We also presented data that TAU is undetectable in ~45% of human SCLC primary tumors (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). These data suggested that the neuronal programs involved in axonogenesis and neuronal migration are not activated or activated at low levels in early lesions. To provide some additional insight into this pattern of expression of neuronal markers in SCLC, we analyzed the expression of the axonogenesis marker GAP43 in human tissue microarrays. We found that ~half of the human primary tumors do not express GAP43, indicating that the neuronal programs are not always present in SCLC tumors. These new data are now mentioned in the text, with representative images and quantification shown in new Figure 3—figure supplement 3B. These correlative data are consistent with a model in which the axonogenesis and neuronal migration programs are turned on during tumorigenesis.</p><p>At the time of our initial submission, we had not examined the expression of neuronal markers associated with axon-like protrusions in non-transformed neuroendocrine cells. In part, this was because SCLC tumors are likely to arise from multiple different cell types in the lung, not only from neuroendocrine cells. Previous work in mouse models from the lab of Dr. Anton Berns (1) and our lab (2) suggested that neuroendocrine cells may be a cell of origin without excluding other cell types. Recently, the group of Dr. Mark Krasnow published data that SCLC tumors can arise from a small subpopulation of neuroendocrine cells (3). However, new work from the group of Dr. Anton Berns (4) and our recent work (5) support the idea that non-neuroendocrine lung epithelial cells may also serve as cell types of origin for SCLC. In particular, a recent study from the group of Dr. Mirentxu Santos shows that basal cells can also be a cell type of origin for SCLC at least in specific genetic contexts (6). Thus, to address the point raised by the reviewer in an unbiased manner, with the help of Dr. Christin Kuo (now a co-author on the manuscript), we analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data in which neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine lung epithelial cells were studied (3). This analysis shows that the neuronal programs associated with axonogenesis and neuronal migration are not expressed (as a whole) in any of the cell populations analyzed. These new data are now mentioned in the text and in new Figure 2—figure supplement 2C. Furthermore, we stained lung sections from adult mice for GAP43 and found no detectable expression in CGRP+ neuroendocrine cells (or in any other lung epithelial cell types) (new Figure 2—figure supplement 2D). Based on these observations, and on the difficulty of growing primary neuroendocrine cells in culture, we did not pursue studies to investigate whether primary neuroendocrine cells form protrusions.</p><p>Together, these data further support a model in which the neuronal migration and axonogenesis programs are specifically turned on during SCLC progression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, is there evidence that the expression of genes such as GAP43 and FEZ1 is increased in metastatic SCLC compared to primary SCLC? These genes were expressed in the George et al., RNAseq dataset composed of primary SCLC samples, so it is important to know if they increase in metastatic cells.</p></disp-quote><p>From the analysis of human primary tumors (e.g. tissue microarrays), it is difficult to know if the tumors studied have already gained metastatic potential, however the observation that only a fraction of primary tumors express GAP43 is suggestive of a switch, as discussed above. Through our clinical collaborators, we obtained 9 human SCLC metastases and stained them for GAP43 expression. Six of these metastases expressed GAP43. Although these numbers are low, these new data show that GAP43 is expressed in a fraction of metastatic SCLC (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>To complement the analysis of human tumors (which is limited by the paucity of metastatic samples, especially of paired primary tumor and metastasis samples from the same patients), we present RNA-seq data from primary tumors and metastases in our SCLC mouse models (Supplementary file 2—table 3). We realize that it was difficult to extract key information from the large table that we initially included in our manuscript. Thus, to address this point, we generated a new figure plotting the fold change for the 13 key neuronal genes in metastases versus primary tumors (only 12 of these genes are actually present in our mouse RNA-seq datasets). We found that the increase in the top candidate genes is significant in the mouse model in which tumors are initiated by Adeno-CMV-Cre instillation. It is also important to remember that this likely represents an underestimation of the induction of these genes because some primary tumors in this study are already in the metastatic state. These data now are shown in new Figure 4—figure supplement 1D. These data provide support to the idea that these neuronal genes are increase during metastatic progression in certain contexts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the neuronal features of SCLC cells identified in this study are active in normal lung neuroendocrine cells and in primary SCLC, then it becomes less clear that a neuroendocrine to neuronal transition is important for SCLC metastasis and for the phenotypes described and the authors would need to reconsider their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, our data strongly support a model in which the gene programs associated with neuronal migration and axonogenesis are upregulated during SCLC development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are many human and mouse SCLC cell culture models available for study. How many were analyzed for the presence of protrusions and what% had axon like protrusions? The text is vague on this point and only few cell lines are shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that providing a more a clear description of each model is important. To address this point (and point #3 below), we generated a new table in which we compiled information related to the mouse and human models analyzed (new Supplementary file 2—table 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likewise, in deposited datasets like those the authors have studied (e.g. George et al., 2015) how frequent are SCLC expressing the neuronal markers? Are there molecular, clinical, and histological differences between the SCLC preclinical models that do or don't have these protrusions?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, we show the expression of the 13 top candidate genes in the George et al. human SCLC dataset. This analysis shows variable expression of this gene signature but it has not been possible to access the clinical data for each patient and correlate gene expression and clinical data. To address this point at least partly, in the revised version of the manuscript, we performed a correlation analysis between the expression of these genes and some key drivers of SCLC, such as the ASCL1 and NEUROD1 transcription factors. We found a better correlation for this gene signature and higher NEUROD1 levels, but a number of our cellular models with protrusions belong to the ASCL1-high subtype. This analysis failed to identify a clear driver of the switch to increased expression of axonogenesis and migration programs. It is possible that larger datasets would prove more informative. These data are shown in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors are very vague on the preclinical model cell line and patient derived xenograft (PDX) descriptions. Basically, readers should not have to go look up the information on them to understand the experiments. It would be really helpful if any given model used could be described better to give some context. For example, what are the characteristics of the different human PDXs used-are the expressing key factors or characteristics that have been described for different subtypes of SCLC such as ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, none of these, etc.? The authors were active in publications studying such factors and could easily provide quantitative information and context of neuronal differentiation to such factors as these lineage oncogenes (beyond the comparison of ASCL1 positive mouse models and one human SCLC line).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good point and we apologize for not making these completely clear in the first submission. This point is closely related to point #2 above. We had previously addressed some aspects of this question in the Discussion section of the initial manuscript, but we agree that it is better to provide clear information to the reader. We have now added this information in new Supplementary file 2—table 1. Unfortunately, we do not have gene expression data or copy number data for all the cellular models that we used, thus this correlative analysis remains informative but incomplete. As an additional piece of data, we examined the expression of key drivers of SCLC phenotypes in human SCLC cell lines and their possible relationship with the growth of protrusions in culture. We found no correlation between ASCL1 and NEUROD1 levels and the ability to grow protrusions (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-D). Thus, the progression to this cellular state appears to not be constrained within one SCLC subtypes and is detected in a subset of both mouse and human cell culture system and in vivo tumors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors were the first to report on the role of NFIB in generating metastatic behavior and indicated its role in neuronal phenotypes. In fact, in that report they raised the question of whether NFIB does this through generating neuronal characteristics. Thus, an obvious question is whether NFIB controls the expression of any of the neuronal genes they studied with functional genomics? While they cite unpublished studies of exogenous expression of NFIB, a more obvious question is whether knockout of NFIB in tumor models with protrusions influences these? I am sure, this had to be one of the first things they addressed, but we are given no information on this, making me wonder why not? Whatever the answer is we need to know.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that we have now clarified in the revised version of our manuscript. To provide some context, our previous work, along with work from the groups of Dr. Anton Berns and Dr. David MacPherson identified NFIB upregulation as a determinant of SCLC metastasis in mouse models. In humans, NFIB is expressed in 50-75% of advanced tumors/metastases (8-10). In our previous work, NFIB upregulation was associated with increased expression of neuronal gene expression programs.</p><p>Some of our data support a role for NFIB in controlling the gene expression programs involved in the growth of protrusions in SCLC cells. For instance, as mentioned above, we found that the top candidate genes are significant upregulated in SCLC tumors that are initiated by Adeno-CMV-Cre (the model in which NFIB is nearly always upregulated in metastases) (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). In human and mouse SCLC tumors, the expression of our top candidate genes correlates with NFIB expression (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-D). Furthermore, we found a modest correlation between NFIB levels and the ability of human SCLC cell lines to grow protrusions (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). Finally, knock-down of NFIB in 16T cells, which form protrusions, leads to decreased formation of protrusions (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1F).</p><p>However, our data also indicate that upregulation of NFIB is not necessary or sufficient for the induction of genes programs related to axonogenesis and migration, and for the growth of protrusions in SCLC cells. For instance, expression of individual top candidate genes does not correlate with NFIB knock-down in 16T cells (which form protrusions) or with NFIB overexpression in KP22 cells (which do not form protrusions), including the genes coding for GAP43 and FEZ1 (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1E). Importantly, ectopic expression of NFIB in KP22 cells is also not sufficient to induce the formation of protrusions (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1G).</p><p>We have now added these new data to the manuscript and updated the Discussion to indicate that NFIB may be a regulator of the gene programs studied in this manuscript, but that other factors are also likely to be involved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Murine SCLC lines 16T and KP22 have different abilities to form protrusions (16T does and KP22 doesn't). Is there RNAseq data on these and any differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that would be of interest in this respect?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed RNA-seq on several cell lines, including 16T, N2N1G, and KP22, however the 16T data is from an experiment performed at a different time with a different sequencing platform. Thus, we focused on the N2N1G/KP22 comparison since N2N1G also grows protrusions similar to 16T. We found that the genes associated with the growth of protrusions (as determined by the impact of gene knock-down on protrusion formation) were more highly expressed in N2N1G cells compared to KP22 cells. These data are now shown in a heat map in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Assuming they are correct in the major claim (SCLCs differentiating along neuronal pathways lead to mechanisms that promote metastases), what is the path to a &quot;therapeutic window&quot;? Clearly, targeting some of these features directly, could lead to injury to the nervous system. So, is the approach to be to decide what controls this expression program and then target that or something else? This brings one back to the consideration of the role of key lineage oncogenes (in this case NEUROD1 seems like the prime culprit) or transcription factors like NFIB in controlling the neuronal program, and how best to target these transcription factors. This key issue is only dealt with by the authors in a tangential way in the Results or Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We had begun to discuss this in the initial version of the manuscript, but we agree that these points required additional clarification. In the correlation analyses that we performed, we identified NFIB as an important regulator of the neuronal gene programs involved in the growth of protrusions (even though NFIB up-regulation is not sufficient to recapitulate these gene programs). Thus, we envision two possible therapeutic approaches. One would be to decrease NFIB levels, as our best candidate for a regulator of the protrusions. The second one would be to target individual proteins required for the formation of protrusions. The diversity of proteins required for the formation of these protrusions may thus represent the most fruitful avenue for this type of investigation. In regards to a “therapeutic window”, it is important to note that while many of these pathways are important for neuronal pathfinding and development, they may have a much less significant role in the adult. We have updated the Discussion to include these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors show that metastasis is affected very early (two days). This suggests that GAP43 or FEZ1 inhibition impacts the emigration out of tumor. This may be difficult to detect rapidly by in vivo imaging in mice but an easy way to start could be to seed tumor cells aggregates in 3D Matrigel or collagen gel and image live cell emigration. The authors have all the tools to test this hypothesis in a very short time period.</p></disp-quote><p>The two-day assays that we describe in the manuscript are based on intravenous transplantation followed by SCLC seeding in the liver. Thus, these data actually relate to the early events of metastatic seeding, rather than cancer cells extravasation out of the tumor.</p><p>However, we do agree that experiments aimed at addressing the effect of neuronal programs on emigration out of primary tumors (like those described by the reviewer) are warranted and of potential importance. Thus, to address this point, we developed a new assay in which control and knock-down aggregates (spheroids) are plated directly into Matrigel followed by quantification of the migration of SCLC cells away from the aggregates. These new data confirm the loss of migration ability when <italic>Gap43</italic> and <italic>Fez1</italic> are knocked-down (new Figure 3—figure supplement 3F-G). These data support a model in which these genes (and likely the development of protrusion which they control) may be important at multiple steps in the metastatic cascade.</p><p>Selected References:</p><p>1) Sutherland KD, Proost N, Brouns I, Adriaensen D, Song JY, Berns A.
