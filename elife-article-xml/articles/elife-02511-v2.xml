In this study, we investigate whether the premotor circuitry of jaw and tongue motoneurons contain elements for coordination. Using a modified monosynaptic rabies virus-based transsynaptic tracing strategy, we systematically mapped premotor neurons for the jaw-closing masseter muscle and the tongue-protruding genioglossus muscle. The maps revealed that the two groups of premotor neurons are distributed in regions implicated in rhythmogenesis, descending motor control, and sensory feedback. Importantly, we discovered several premotor connection configurations that are ideally suited for coordinating bilaterally symmetric jaw movements, and for enabling co-activation of specific jaw, tongue, and facial muscles. Our findings suggest that shared premotor neurons that form specific multi-target connections with selected motoneurons are a simple and general solution to the problem of orofacial coordination.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02511.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02511.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02511.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Chewing requires highly coordinated movements of the tongue and jaw. The tongue pushes food around the mouth, keeping it within reach of the teeth, while rhythmic movements of the jaw enable the teeth to grind up food without injuring the tongue itself. However, despite the importance of tongue–jaw coordination, the neuroanatomical circuits that underlie it have not been studied in detail. Stanek et al. have now mapped these neural circuits using a cutting edge tracing technique in mice.</p><p>Muscles are activated by signals from neurons called motoneurons, which are themselves activated by signals from so-called premotor neurons. To identify the neural circuits responsible for tongue–jaw coordination, Stanek et al. injected a modified version of the rabies virus into the muscles that move the jaw and/or the tongue. This modified virus, which was also labeled with a fluorescent protein, was able to jump ‘backwards’ across the junctions between the muscles and the motoneurons, and then back to the premotor neurons. The fluorescent label allowed the neural circuits to be visualized under a fluorescence microscope.</p><p>It had been assumed that distinct populations of premotor neurons would control the activity of different muscles. However, when viruses labeled with red fluorescent protein were injected into the muscles on the left side of the jaw, while viruses with green labels were injected into the muscles on the right side, a number of premotor neurons were found to display both red and green fluorescence. This indicates that some premotor neurons control muscles on both sides of the jaw, providing an effective means of coordinating bilateral muscle activity. A similar sharing of premotor neurons was observed between motoneurons that regulate jaw opening and those that trigger tongue protrusion, and between those that regulate jaw closing and tongue retraction.</p><p>As well as providing new insights into the neuronal circuits that control the movements of the jaw and tongue, the work of Stanek et al. may have identified a general principle—namely the sharing of premotor neurons—that could be common to other circuits that produce coordinated muscle activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02511.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02511.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>premotor circuit</kwd><kwd>monosynaptic rabies virus</kwd><kwd>jaw motoneuron</kwd><kwd>tongue motoneuron</kwd><kwd>orofacial coordination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS077986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Fan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE019440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Fan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDE024003A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stanek</surname><given-names>Edward</given-names><suffix>IV</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Retrograde tracing of the neural circuits that control movement of the jaw and tongue reveals how shared premotor neurons help to ensure coordinated muscle activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Behaviors are executed through coordinated activity of multiple groups of motor neurons and their muscle targets. Coordination of jaw and tongue muscles during feeding behaviors represents one of the most intricate mechanisms of the motor system and has been observed in a wide range of animals including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerstner and Goldberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thexton and McGarrick, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takada et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Palmer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishiwata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller, 2002</xref>). Here, coordination concerns primarily the adjustment of both timing and sequence of muscle activation to enable smooth, effective jaw and tongue movements. Three basic forms of coordination are consistently observed in feeding behaviors. First, the left and right jaw muscle activities are temporally symmetric, which is necessary because the mandible is joined by ligaments at the midline. Second, during chewing the activity of the tongue and jaw muscles is held to a similar low frequency rhythm, with the tongue positioning food between the surfaces of the teeth while the jaw moves the teeth to break down food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thexton and McGarrick, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takada et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiyama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Naganuma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamamura et al., 2002</xref>). Third, during chewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerstner and Goldberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Naganuma et al., 2001</xref>), licking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Travers et al., 1997</xref>), and suckling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thexton et al., 1998</xref>), the tongue-protruding and jaw-opening muscles are co-active during jaw opening, while tongue-retracting and jaw-closing muscles are co-active during jaw closing. This co-activation also occurs in cortically-induced fictive mastication and occurs regardless of the frequency of cortical stimulation or the intensity of sensory stimuli applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerstner and Goldberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>The neural architecture enabling these different yet specific forms of jaw-tongue-facial muscle coordination remain unclear. In the more extensively studied vertebrate spinal cord, the network that generates the coordinated and rhythmic muscle activity during locomotion is referred to as the central pattern generator (CPG). Separate CPGs are known to control separate limb muscles, with forelimb CPGs located in the cervical enlargement and hindlimb CPGs residing in the lumbar enlargements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiehn, 2011</xref>). Limb coordination occurs through interactions between these separate CPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiehn, 2011</xref>). By analogy, it is conceivable that different orofacial muscles are also controlled by different CPGs with their interaction resulting in orofacial coordination, although the evidence for well-defined jaw, face, and tongue CPGs is lacking. On the other hand, previous studies injecting two different retrograde tracers into two different cranial motor nuclei have suggested the existence of neurons projecting to both nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amri et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamogawa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Popratiloff et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kondo et al., 2006</xref>). However, due to limitations of the neural tracer technique, such as non-specific labeling of passing fibers and labeling of the entire nucleus rather than the motoneurons innervating specific muscles, whether there are common premotor neurons simultaneously innervating specific motoneuron groups enabling the above mentioned orofacial coordination remained unclear. In this study, we employed a recently established monosynaptic circuit tracing methodology to identify premotor neurons of the jaw-closing masseter and tongue-protruding genioglossus motoneurons (See ‘Materials and methods’). Analysis of the resultant labeling reveals several premotor circuit elements that are well suited for the orofacial coordination observed in feeding behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transsynaptic mapping of premotor circuitry controlling the jaw-closing masseter motoneurons</title><p>As described in the ‘Materials and methods’ and schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we have developed a mouse line, Chat::Cre; RΦGT, that enables us to inject deficient rabies virus (ΔG-RV) into desired muscles resulting in transsynaptic tracing of the corresponding premotor circuitry in neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takatoh et al., 2013</xref>).

A much lower efficiency of motoneuron infection from peripheral injection was observed at this later stage (19 ± 4 motoneurons labeled in P8 injected animals; 35 ± 6 motoneurons labeled in P1 injected animals; mean ± SEM, n = 3 samples per group), and the overall number of labeled premotor neurons was drastically reduced. Despite this, the labeled neurons were distributed in similar locations as those observed in the P1→P8 tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to other regions, the number of labeled premotor neurons in the lateral paragigantocellular (LPGi) nucleus increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). When normalized against the number of infected motoneurons, twice as many LGPi neurons were labeled in the P8→P15 tracing, suggesting more LPGi neurons form synapses with motoneurons, or individual LPGi neurons form synapses with more motoneurons.

To determine whether at least some of the contralateral projections directly innervate motoneurons, we used anti-ChAT immunostaining to visualize motoneurons in ΔG-RV-EGFP-labeled brains. Indeed, numerous GFP+ boutons from labeled left masseter premotor neurons directly contacting ChAT+ motoneurons in the right MoV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm the existence of neurons presynaptic to motoneurons on both sides, as well as to identify the locations of these neurons in the jaw premotor circuitry, we injected the left masseter of P1 Chat::Cre; RΦGT pups with ΔG-RV-EGFP (green), and the right masseter of the same pups with ΔG-RV-mCherry (red). Thus, if any premotor neuron provided monosynaptic input to both the equivalent left and right masseter motoneurons, it would be labeled by both red and green ΔG-RV, thereby appearing yellow. We observed many double-labeled yellow neurons in most of the premotor nuclei, including many in the caudal and rostral reticular formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>), a few primary proprioceptive neurons in the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (MesV) (as distinguished from interneurons by their large spherical unipolar cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lazarov and Chouchkov, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Verdier et al., 2004</xref>)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and inset), neurons in dorsal principle trigeminal nucleus (dPrV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E,F</xref>), and neurons in the region above dPrV (dRt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,F</xref>). The number of double-labeled neurons was relatively few (∼8%). However, this is likely a significant under-representation. The masseter is a large muscle, and the chances of virus infecting functionally equivalent muscle fibers on both sides are very low to begin with. Additionally, when taking into account the stochastic nature of viral spreading at the synapses, the actual number of bilateral-projecting premotor neurons could be much higher than what we observed. The presence of premotor neurons innervating motoneurons on both sides throughout the jaw premotor circuitry provides a simple mechanism for directly synchronizing bilateral motoneuron activities.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transsynaptic mapping of the premotor circuitry controlling the tongue-protruding hypoglossal motoneurons</title><p>Suckling in neonates and chewing later in life involve not only coordination of bilateral jaw muscles, but also coordination between muscles of the jaw, the lips, and the tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Naganuma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thexton et al., 2004</xref>). We next wanted to map the premotor circuitry controlling the tongue, which is innervated by motoneurons located in the hypoglossal motor nucleus (MoXII). The genioglossus is the main tongue-protruding muscle. Partly due to its ease of access, the genioglossus has been a primary target for many previous studies investigating orofacial behaviors, including chewing, suckling, and licking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerstner and Goldberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sawczuk and Mosier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kakizaki et al., 2002</xref>). During rhythmic chewing, the genioglossus and masseter are activated with the same rhythm but in opposite phases, because activation of both at once could result in biting of the tongue. We investigated the premotor circuitry of the genioglossus motoneurons using a similar method as described for the masseter motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). ΔG-RV-EGFP was injected into the left genioglossus muscle of the tongue. However, due to the small size of the tongue in P1 mice and the amount of virus necessary to infect motor axons, in most animals some of the virus injected to the left side unavoidably spread to the right genioglossus. Thus, it was not feasible to map the premotor inputs solely to the genioglossus on one side.</p><p><xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> is a representative example of one serially sectioned brain after ΔG-RV-EGFP-mediated transsynaptic tracing from primarily the left genioglossus muscle. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows representative labeling patterns from selected brainstem regions. As a summary of the key findings, the genioglossus premotor circuitry contains: (1) a large population of premotor neurons located bilaterally in the intermediate reticular formation (IRt), with fewer neurons in the lateral side of the reticular formation (in PCRt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>); (2) premotor neurons located in trigeminal sensory nuclei mainly in caudal brainstem (SpC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and a few in dPrV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and MesV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), as well as taste-related neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>); (3) neurons in the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and midbrain reticular formation (dMRf, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), which likely provide descending inputs; and (4) scattered cells in the midline and other brainstem structures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

To do this, we conducted a series of in situ hybridization experiments to examine the neurotransmitter phenotypes while simultaneously immunostaining for EGFP expressed in ΔG-RV-EGFP-labeled premotor neurons. We focused our analysis on known markers for glutamatergic neurons (vesicular glutamate transporter 2: vGluT2), GABAergic neurons (glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 and 2: GAD1 and GAD2 mixed probe [GAD1/2]), and glycinergic neurons (glycine transporter 2: GlyT2).

By analogy to the studies investigating spinal locomotion circuits, one model of bilateral coordination involves the interaction between the jaw CPGs in the left and right brainstem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A1</xref>). Studies investigating the rhythm-generating properties of the brainstem after midline transection have supported this theory through the finding that sufficient circuitry exists on both sides of the brainstem to independently generate a rhythmic output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chandler and Tal, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ihara et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have implicated commissural interneurons located inside MoV and bilaterally projecting neurons extending axons to both left and right MoV in some brainstem regions as a potential source of bilaterally coordinated inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Appenteng and Girdlestone, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ter Horst et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Juch et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamogawa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yoshida et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McDavid et al., 2006</xref>). We also labeled a sparse number of interneurons in the contralateral MoV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Furthermore, we observed axon terminals of premotor neurons transsynaptically labeled from left masseter motoneurons extensively innervating the contralateral (right) MoV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and forming boutons opposing motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>), supporting the existence of large numbers of bilaterally projecting premotor neurons. Using two-color rabies-mediated tracing, we confirmed that premotor neurons that synapse onto left and right masseter motoneurons were present in many brainstem regions. It thus appears that the jaw premotor circuit includes the simplest configuration for bilateral coordination: a single premotor neuron that synapses on equivalent ipsilateral and contralateral motoneurons.</p><p>Interestingly, these neurons are especially prevalent in the reticular formation region previously identified as containing the jaw CPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chandler and Tal, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandler et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lund, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakamura and Katakura, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morquette et al., 2012</xref>). This organization could facilitate bilateral synchrony and symmetry, either independently of or in concert with interactions between CPGs, by enabling the output of the jaw CPG on one side to activate jaw muscles on both sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A2</xref>). In this model, the premotor neurons that transmit the CPG signals can be either part of the CPG (dashed circle in model) or immediately downstream of the CPG, and can include neurons projecting either unilaterally or bilaterally to the MoV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications for coordination of co-activated muscles</title><p>Tongue activity is tightly coordinated with jaw and facial muscle activity during feeding behaviors in a variety of mammals, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Westneat and Hall, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takada et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishiwata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamamura et al., 2002</xref>). More specifically, the tongue-protruding genioglossus is active in phase with the jaw-opening digastric muscle and with the orbicularis oris of the lips under a wide range of conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takada et al., 1996</xref>), and the tongue-retracting styloglossus is often active in phase with the jaw-closing masseter muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kakizaki et al., 2002</xref>). Previous work studying body muscle coordination in vertebrates and invertebrates showed that distinct CPGs which control motoneurons of different body segments may interact with each other to effect cross-muscle coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cang and Friesen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briggman and Kristan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smarandache-Wellmann et al., 2014</xref>). Because orofacial muscles are innervated by different groups of motoneurons located in MoXII, MoV, or MoVII, respectively, an analogous model would be that orofacial muscle co-activation is achieved by interaction between different CPGs that drive distinct motoneuron pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B1</xref>). Our study discovered that axon collaterals from labeled genioglossus premotor neurons also innervate MoV motoneurons supplying the jaw-opening anterior digastric muscles, as well as the motoneurons located in the central part of the MoVII. The central MoVII supplies the posterior digastric muscle (jaw-opening and swallowing), the platysma muscle (which depresses the jaw and draws down the lower lip), and the lower lip muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Munro, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ashwell, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hinrichsen and Watson, 1984</xref>), which are all activated when the tongue is protruding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Here, we found that many premotor neurons for these two antagonist motor groups are located in a spatially intermixed pattern (especially those situated between the caudal end of MoVII and the rostral end of MoV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Furthermore, previous studies examining intracellular potentials have found that masseter motoneurons receive rhythmic inhibitory and excitatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldberg et al., 1982</xref>), while genioglossus motoneurons receive only rhythmic excitatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sahara et al., 1988</xref>). In the reticular region previously implicated in rhythm generation, we found that premotor neurons consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Thus, we propose a hypothetical model consistent with these results whereby premotor neurons in an extended rhythmogenic network could have the same rhythm but could have opposite phases of activity through local circuit interactions, resulting in rhythmic excitation of masseter motoneurons and anti-phase excitation of genioglossus motoneurons and inhibition of masseter motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Other nuclei of interest</title><p>There were three particularly interesting findings regarding premotor nuclei labeled through our masseter and genioglossus rabies tracing experiments that deserve more detailed discussion.</p><p>The NTS (nucleus of the solitary tract) is thought to play a major role in taste processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradley and Grabauskas, 1998</xref>).

Our results support these findings, revealing that some NTS neurons provide monosynaptic input onto tongue-protruding genioglossus motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). While sparse, this input could play a central role in the well-established taste reactivity test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grill and Norgren, 1978b</xref>), which has been used extensively in assessing the interaction of taste processing and ingestive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flynn, 1995</xref>). These stereotypic responses to controlled tastes have been found to be independent of cortical areas, and highly consistent across animals, suggesting that there may be a brainstem substrate for these behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grill and Norgren, 1978a</xref>). Our finding of a direct innervation of tongue motoneurons by NTS neurons may be one such neural substrate.</p><p>The labeling of neurons in the DCN (deep cerebellar nuclei) was somewhat surprising. The DCN had not previously been implicated in directly contacting masseter or genioglossus motoneurons of the brainstem in the neonate. Furthermore, where DCN axons project into the brainstem in non-murine species, the projection path is known to be primarily ipsilateral, with only sparse contralateral projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruigrok and Voogd, 1990</xref>). Previous retrograde or transsynaptic tracing studies in rodents did not comment on any deep cerebellar nuclei labeling, even in polysynaptic tracing experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Travers and Norgren, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fay and Norgren, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kolta et al., 2000</xref>). By contrast, in our transsynaptic studies we found that the fastigial nucleus of the DCN provides inputs onto contralateral masseter motoneurons in the early postnatal mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, we observed that a small number of neurons in both the fastigial and dentate nuclei of the DCN provide inputs onto genioglossus motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Recently, the Allen Brain Institute published their adult mouse brain connectivity study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oh et al., 2014</xref>). We consulted their connectivity atlas for tracing from the fastigial and dentate nuclei of the DCN. Interestingly, fastigial neurons give rise to a major contralateral projection pathway (as well as ipsilateral projections) and sparse fastigial axon terminals can be seen inside the contralateral MoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oh, et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, tracing results from either the fastigial or the dentate nucleus revealed sparse axon terminals inside MoXII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oh, et al., 2014</xref>). Although these DCN innervations of contralateral MoV and MoXII are sparse in adult mice, it is possible that in newborn mice there are transiently more connections. Notably, in our P8→P15 masseter tracing experiment, we did not observe any labeling in the DCN, supporting such transient projections from DCN to masseter and genioglossus motoneurons during early development.</p><p>Finally, labeling of bilaterally projecting MesV primary afferent neurons, although very few, was another unexpected finding. In our P8→P15 tracing study, we only observed ipsilateral MesV neurons labeled. Thus, such bilaterally projecting MesV neurons could be another case that only transiently exists in neonatal animals.</p><p>In summary, our study revealed a set of premotor connection configurations well-suited to enable multi-muscle coordination and bilateral symmetry observed in feeding behaviors. Shared premotor neurons simultaneously providing inputs onto multiple groups of motoneurons innervating specific muscles may be a common circuit mechanism for motor coordination. It would be interesting to examine how these specific connections are established during development, and whether sensory inputs and CPG inputs converge on these coordinating premotor neurons to control both reflexes and centrally-induced movements. Additionally, we provide high-resolution maps of premotor nuclei for these jaw and tongue motoneurons including sensory-related inputs and descending inputs. An important goal of future studies is to develop molecular tools that allow specific functional manipulation of individual groups of premotor neurons to establish their roles in controlling and coordinating a variety of orofacial behaviors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experimental protocols were approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and tracing paradigm</title><p>We employed a previously described monosynaptic rabies-virus-based technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wickersham et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callaway, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arenkiel and Ehlers, 2009</xref>) adapted to selectively trace neurons that directly synapse onto primary motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stepien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takatoh et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, we used a knock-in mouse line containing CAG-loxP-STOP-loxP-rabies-G-IRES-TVA at the Rosa26 locus (RΦGT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takatoh et al., 2013</xref>) crossed with a mouse line that expresses Cre recombinase under the control of the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) gene (Chat::Cre mouse, JAX Stock #006410). The resultant male and female pups were heterozygous for both alleles (Chat::Cre;RΦGT), and thus expressed the rabies glycoprotein (rabies-G) in all cholinergic neurons, including motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Injection of a rabies virus expressing a fluorophore in place of the glycoprotein (green: ΔG-RV-EGFP; or red: ΔG-RV-mCherry) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wickersham et al., 2007b</xref>) into the primary muscle (jaw-closing masseter or tongue-protruding genioglossus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) infected motoneurons targeting that muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left). In the case of the masseter injections, animals which showed infection of the overlying skin as evident by fluorescence were excluded from analysis. Subsequent complementation of this virus by rabies-G in motoneurons enabled transsynaptic, retrograde travel of the virus into presynaptic partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right).</p><p>The monosynaptic rabies virus is deficient for the rabies-G in its genome, resulting in an inability for the virus to spread into presynaptic neurons of the source-infected cells unless it is complemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etessami et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, rabies virus infects neurons potentially through binding to the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) or other neuronal receptors irrespective of neurotransmitter phenotype, size, or morphology, enabling an unbiased assessment of presynaptic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thoulouze et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ugolini, 2010</xref>).</p><p>As a caveat to our premotor tracing strategy, if any premotor neurons expressed ChAT, rabies virus could be complemented again, resulting in spurious two-step labeling. A previous study has reported small numbers of cholinergic neurons in the intermediate reticular region of the brainstem that project to MoV and MoXII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Travers et al., 2005</xref>). To investigate whether there were any ChAT+ masseter or genioglossus premoter neurons labeled in our experiments, we conducted anti-ChAT immunostaining on samples infected with rabies. We found that only approximately 1–3 cells in the reticular regions in the samples we examined were labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, such rare labeling was inconsistent in terms of rostral–caudal position across samples, suggesting that secondary jumping from such neurons would be very sparse with inconsistent labeling patterns. We therefore focused our quantification and analysis on the premotor regions consistently labeled across all samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Viral injections</title><p>ΔG-RV was prepared and injected as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takatoh et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, male and female mouse pups at postnatal day 1 (P1) were anesthetized by hypothermia, and were injected with 200–400 nL of ΔG-RV into either the masseter muscle or the genioglossus muscle of the tongue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). 1 week post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, inset), mice were deeply anesthetized, transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution in PBS. Brain samples were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (OCT, Tissue-Tek) and frozen for at least 24 hours at −80°C. Optimal survival times for maximal labeling were assessed prior to collection of results. Periods longer than 1 week resulted in an increase in glial infiltration and cell debris in the motor nuclei suggesting massive cell death, while periods shorter than 5–6 days post-infection resulted in a significant decrease in transsynaptically labeled neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Histology</title><p>Tissue preparation and immunostaining were conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takatoh et al., 2013</xref>). 80-µm thick sections were analyzed for tracing results, while ChAT immunostained samples were sectioned at 60 µm.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Peggy Mason, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an important and interesting study that uses an elegant approach to investigate the brainstem premotor circuitry responsible for oro-motor coordination. Transgenic mice expressing rabies glycoprotein (G) in cholinergic neurons received injections of rabies virus expressing a fluorophore (in place of G) in their masseter muscles and/or genioglossus muscles. This resulted in retrograde labeling of premotor neurons projecting directly to the motoneurons of these muscles. Many of the findings reported here reproduce or confirm previously reported results, but innovate in 2 ways. Firstly, as pointed out by the authors, the methods used eliminate the possibility that some of the retrograde labelling results from having the tracer taken up by fibers passing by the injection site. Secondly, they allow direct comparison of the distributions of masseteric and genioglossus premotor circuitries. Several novel findings emerge from this study: premotor neurons have bilateral projections to masseteric motoneurons; premotor neurons innervate both the jaw and tongue muscles and are intermingled in the same regions of the reticular formation; a strong premotor innervation of genioglossus motoneurons from NTS. In summary, the findings provide evidence that the connectivity of premotor neurons might underlie coordination of orofacial muscles.</p><p>While the reviewers were unanimous that this manuscript tells an exciting, interesting and original story, the manuscript could be further strengthened by discussion and re-framing of several issues as follows: 1) At the age that the experiments were done, P1→P8, there is only suckling and swallowing, no chewing. The circuitry for ingestion is likely to change between the time studied (P1→P8) and the emergence of chewing. Indeed, the authors' previous paper in Neuron shows that vibrissal premotor circuitry changes extensively with emergence of exploratory whisking. The results should be interpreted in this light. And the authors should refer to the suckling CPG rather than the masticatory CPG. The labeling observed appears to be perfectly suited to suckling – opening mouth and lips to latch on, tasting milk, sucking, and swallowing.</p><p>2) The authors use “synchronization” and “coordination” loosely (Synchronization is maintenance of relative phase. Coordination involves modulation of muscle amplitude or timing (where modulation can be maintenance of amplitude or relative phase or changes in amplitude or relative phase) in order to achieve some goal. For example, during stage 1 food transport, jaw and tongue muscles are very differently coordinated than during mastication, but still well coordinated, and show variation in relative phase. In contrast, during mastication, jaw and tongue muscles are pretty well synchronized, but, again, their amplitude and relative phase of activity are constantly modulated to achieve the goal of chewing efficiently without biting the tongue. Thus, coordination and synchronization are not the same. These terms should be defined and used consistently and correctly.</p><p>3) Additional information about the methodology should be provided. Remember that there are no length constraints in <italic>eLife</italic>. Our hope is that all the information needed by a reader to understand what was done is contained in the Methods section. Therefore, please address the following methodological issues: a) How can the authors ensure that only monosynaptic projections are labeled? This is particularly worrisome in light of the cerebellar labeling. The adult cerebellum does not contain projections from DCN to motoneurons, even motoneurons in the brainstem. The cerebellar DCN labeling raises doubt that neurons are traveling retrogradely across a single synapse from the motoneuron.</p><p>b) Does the virus infect all cells equally independently of their size, metabolism or activity level?</p><p>c) How was the survival time determined? What are the consequences of having a too short or too long survival time?</p><p>d) Please motivate the use of VGluT2 (rather than VGluT1 or VGluT3) to mark glutamatergic neurons.</p><p>e) Is the virus injected through the skin when injected in the masseters? If yes, this should be stated clearly in the methods and the authors should consider the fact that some facial motoneurons (and their premotor connections) will be infected with the virus as well in this case.</p><p>4) The input from NTS to genioglossus but not masseter premotor neurons is striking. It is also very important as it is a potential substrate for the “taste reactivity” responses described by Grill and Norgren. These responses are innate, hardwired for particular tastes (modifiable but hard-wired to start with), independent of forebrain, and are used extensively to study liking vs wanting in rodents. The circuitry outlined here is very exciting in light of the importance of taste reactivity to diverse behavioral studies. The NTS premotoneuronal input to genioglossus is such an important finding and really should be included in the in the Discussion.</p><p>5) The cerebellar labeling is puzzling on a few accounts. In addition to #3a above, the masseter labeling is contralateral. We just don't understand this. While the data are what the data are, this is a puzzle that is worth noting. If the authors have any speculation on what is going on here, they should share it. In addition, genioglossus injections caused a very lateral labeling pattern (surely dentate) in the cerebellum. This is strange as one would expect labeling in the vermis and not in the lateral lobes. Again, the data are what the data are but these unexpected observations should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02511.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>1<italic>) At the age that the experiments were done, P1→P8, there is only suckling and swallowing, no chewing.

We have accordingly pointed this out in the Results section We also cited previous studies that found that over the time period when chewing behavior develops, glycine switches from being excitatory onto motoneurons to being inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inoue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting the possibility that the same circuitry used to produce rhythmic suckling early in life may be reconfigured to produce rhythmic chewing later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langenbach et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Westneat and Hall, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morquette et al., 2012</xref>), although this issue is still up for debate.</p><p>Furthermore, we conducted rabies-mediated transsynaptic tracing at a later developmental stage (P8→P15 tracing). Since chewing movements first emerge around post-natal day 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Westneat and Hall, 1992</xref>), sampling at P15 should reveal chewing related premotor circuitry. These results are shown in the newly added supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–Figure Supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>For the P8→P15 tracing, we observed a much lower efficiency of viral infection of motoneurons (19±4 motoneurons labeled in P8 injected animals, as compared to 35±6 motoneurons labeled in P1 injected animals; mean ± SEM, n=3 samples per group), and thus the overall number of labeled premotor neurons was drastically reduced. Despite this, the labeled neurons were distributed in similar locations as those observed in the P1→P8 tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–Figure Supplement 1B-D</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to other regions, labeling of premotor neurons in the LPGi was increased (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–Figure Supplement 1B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This is similar to that observed in our lab’s previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takatoh et al., 2013</xref>, except that in the whisker premotor circuitry, LPGi labeling transitioned from none to many across development, whereas for masseter premotor circuitry, LPGi labeling transitioned from few to many across development (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–Figure Supplement 1</xref>). It will be interesting in the future to functionally test the role of LPGi neurons presynaptic to different cranial motor neurons. Due to the low infection and low spreading efficiency, we did not further pursue P8→P15 tracing for other experiments. This explanation has been added to the Results section.</p><p><italic>2) The authors use “synchronization” and “coordination” loosely (Synchronization is maintenance of relative phase.

We have included detailed description (methodological description, references, as well as some results) to address all the questions (a-e) raised by the reviewers.</p><p>Could there be secondary jumping of the rabies virus in our approach? This is a very good concern. In our experiments, complementation of the virus is limited to occurring solely in cholinergic neurons, which express the rabies-G induced by the ChAT-Cre transgene. While this primarily limits complementation to within motoneurons, there are also central cholinergic neurons located in the reticular regions of the brainstem, and a previous retrograde tracing study found that some of these neurons project to the MoV and MoXII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Travers et al., 2005</xref>). When we performed anti-ChAT staining on the viral-labeled brain samples, we observed occasional and rare labeling of cholinergic premotor neurons located in the reticular formation (about 1∼3 per brain). This is now described in detail in the Methods section as a caveat, and the representative results of the anti-ChAT staining are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–Figure Supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>These rare labeled central cholinergic premotor neurons in theory could enable the rabies virus to be complemented again and travel one more step to pre-premotor neurons. However, the location of these rarely-labeled neurons were highly variable across the brainstem between samples, suggesting that even if jumping occurred, the labeled pre-premotor neurons may not exhibit a consistent labeling pattern (in terms of both number and location of presynaptic contacts). In addition, the brains were sampled 7 days after initial viral infection. Because it takes time for the virus to replicate and be complimented by the rabies glycoprotein, the chance of secondary “jumping” is further diminished. Nevertheless, we indeed observed some sparse inconsistent labeling in various regions of brainstem (as mentioned in the results). Our quantitative analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1 tbl2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>) were performed only on consistently labeled brainstem regions.</p><p>Problems with cerebellar DCN labeling: the reviewers are absolutely right with the concerns of cerebellar DCN labeling. First of all, we should have been more precise about where we observed the labeling in the DCN. The masseter premotor study consistently labeled neurons in the contralateral <italic>fastigial</italic> nucleus of the DCN, whereas the genioglossus premotor study sparsely labeled neurons in the ipsilateral <italic>fastigial</italic> and <italic>dentate</italic> nuclei of the DCN. We looked into this issue further. We are fortunate that the Allen Brain Institute just published their “Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas” which included anterograde tracing studies from the fastigial and dentate nuclei of the DCN. Importantly, fastigial neurons send a major projection <italic>contralaterally</italic> in addition to an ipsilateral projection, and a few axons can be seen projecting into the contralateral MoV even in the adult mouse (see images below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>, obtained from the Allen Institute at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org">connectivity.brain-map.org</ext-link>). Furthermore, a few axons from both the fastigial and dentate nuclei can be observed inside the MoXII (see images below from the Allen Institute at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org">connectivity.brain-map.org</ext-link>). These sparse innervations in the adult raise the possibility that in neonatal mice there is a transient more elaborate projection from DCN to cranial motor nuclei that is later largely pruned away, but was detected by our P1→P8 transsyanptic tracing. Additionally, we noted that our late-stage P8→P15 tracing did not label any neurons in DCN, consistent with a transient synaptic contact between DCN neurons and masseter or genioglossus motoneurons at early neonatal stage. This explanation has been added to the Discussion.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-02511-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>b) Does the virus infect all cells</italic> <italic>equally independently of their size, metabolism or activity level?</italic></p><p>We added references about primary infection and spreading of the rabies virus in the Methods. Briefly, both the infection and spreading of rabies virus are exclusively dependent on the rabies-G protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etessami et al., 2000</xref>). Rabies-G binds to synapse-localized molecules, such as the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thoulouze et al., 1998</xref>), after which the virus is internalized through endocytosis. Studies of rabies viral infection have shown a lack of preference in transmission for neurotransmitter phenotype or cell body distance from initially infected neurons, and rabies has been shown to infect neurons of various cell soma sizes and activity levels, as reviewed by Gabriella Ugolini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ugolini, 2010</xref>). Description of the rabies virus has now been included in the Methods.</p><p><italic>c) How was the survival time determined? What are the consequences of having a too short or too long survival</italic> <italic>time?</italic></p><p>The survival/sampling time was primarily determined by the toxicity of the rabies virus and the extent of transsynaptic labeling. When sampling at shorter time points post-infection (4∼5 days), we observed significantly fewer labeled premotor neurons. When sampling at time points longer than one week post-infection (8∼9 days), we see an increase in glial cell infiltration in the motor nucleus, loss of labeled motor neurons and presence of cell debris suggesting that rabies has caused death of infected neurons. This explanation has now been included in the Methods.</p><p><italic>d) Please motivate the use of VGluT2 (rather than VGluT1 or VGluT3) to mark glutamatergic neurons</italic>.</p><p>The primary reason for using vGluT2 instead of vGluT1 or vGluT3 to examine transmitter phenotypes of labeled premotor neurons was based on the expression patterns of these three genes as shown in the Allen Brain Atlas. While vGluT1 is an important marker for MesV neurons, we were primarily interested in assessing neurotransmitter phenotypes in the reticular formation, where vGluT2 is extensively expressed. By contrast, vGluT1 is only expressed in small number of neurons and largely absent in reticular formation prevalent, and vGluT3 is expressed in very few neurons in the brainstem. We have now included this rationale for the probes used in the Methods.</p><p><italic>e) Is the virus injected through the skin when injected in the masseters? If yes, this should be stated clearly in the methods and the authors should consider the fact that some facial motoneurons (and their premotor connections) will be infected with the virus as well in this case</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for not providing enough detail with regards to peripheral injection. Yes, the virus is injected through the skin into the masseter muscle. Hence there was the possibility of the virus leaking out and infecting facial motor axons passing through underneath the skin. When harvesting the mouse after tracing, we examined the tissue at the injection site under a fluorescence microscope, and excluded samples that showed infection of the dermal and epidermal tissues. Additionally, we did not observe any ectopic motoneurons labeled by rabies in the facial motor nucleus or any other cranial motor nuclei when we examined our serial sections. We have now included this explanation in the Methods.</p><p><italic>4) The input from NTS to genioglossus but not masseter premotor neurons is striking. It is also very important as it is a potential substrate for the “taste reactivity” responses described by Grill and Norgren. These responses are innate, hardwired for particular tastes (modifiable but hard-wired to start with), independent of forebrain, and are used extensively to study liking vs wanting in rodents. The circuitry outlined here is very exciting in light of the importance of taste reactivity to diverse behavioral studies. The NTS premotoneuronal input to genioglossus is such an important finding and really should be included in the in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ insight on the importance of this finding. We have added summary sentences according to reviewers’ suggestion. We also included a magnified image of the NTS labeling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, and have further discussed it in the Discussion citing these references mentioned by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>5) The cerebellar labeling is puzzling on a few accounts. In addition to #3a above, the masseter labeling is contralateral. We just don't understand this. While the data are what the data are, this is a puzzle that is worth noting. If the authors have any speculation on what is going on here, they should share it. In addition, genioglossus injections caused a very lateral labeling pattern (surely dentate) in the cerebellum. This is strange as one would expect labeling in the vermis and not in the lateral lobes. Again, the data are what the data are but these unexpected observations should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are absolutely right about the surprising and somewhat puzzling labeling of premotor neurons in cerebellar nuclei. Previous tracing experiments have found some contralateral projections from the deep cerebellar nuclei in the cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 1958</xref>) and rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruigrok and Voogd, 1990</xref>). And as mentioned above (see response to #3a), recent anterograde tracing experiments conducted by the Allen Institute in the adult mouse from the fastigial nucleus show a major contralateral projection pathway with a few axons innervating the contralateral MoV (see attached images from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org">connectivity.brain-map.org</ext-link>). Thus, it appears that the mouse has a more prominent contralateral projection from fastigial nucleus. Additionally, sparse processes are also visible extending into the MoXII from both the fastigial and dentate tracing by the Allen Institute. It is possible that the deep cerebellar nuclei are connected to motoneurons only temporarily during development (see response to 3a). We have included extended discussion on this labeling pattern in the Discussion, as per the reviewers’ suggestion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
