There is considerable evidence that evolutionary changes in transcriptional networks have played an important role in morphological evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGregor et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, it is widely accepted that mutations in non-coding, cis-regulatory elements (CREs) have played a major role in the evolution of transcriptional networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rubinstein and de Souza, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wittkopp and Kalay, 2011</xref>). The role of protein-level changes in transcription factors, however, has been more controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheatle Jarvela and Hinman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lynch and Wagner, 2008</xref>). Localized changes in CREs are thought to be more easily tolerated than mutations in coding regions of transcription factors, as the latter could alter the ability of transcription factors to bind to hundreds of CREs throughout the genome and consequently reduce organismal fitness. Mutations in coding regions might be buffered, however, in the event of gene duplication, which frees one copy of the gene from selective pressure, thereby allowing it to evolve novel functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conant and Wolfe, 2008</xref>). Whether functional specialization of paralogous transcription factors has played a significant role in the evolution of novel structures remains an open question.</p><p>Echinoderms are a valuable experimental model for addressing the evolution of morphological novelty because of their diverse larval and adult body plans. There are five classes of echinoderms: echinoids (sea urchins), holothuroids (sea cucumbers), asteroids (sea stars), ophiuroids (brittle stars) and crinoids (sea lilies). The echinoids consist of two taxa, the euechinoids (thin-spined sea urchins) and the cidaroids (pencil urchins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Telford et al., 2014</xref>). Most echinoderms are maximal indirect developers; that is, they reproduce via a feeding larva which undergoes metamorphosis to produce the adult. The feeding larvae of echinoids and ophiuroids have extensive, calcite-based endoskeletons, while those of holothuroids have only a rudimentary skeleton, and those of asteroids lack skeletal elements entirely. The feeding larvae of hemichordates, the sister group to echinoderms, also lack a skeleton, suggesting that this structure is derived within the echinoderms. All adult echinoderms, however, regardless of the morphology of their larval forms, possess an extensive, calcitic endoskeleton. Comparative studies have revealed many similarities in the gene regulatory programs of skeletogenic cells in the larva and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Czarkwiani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao and Davidson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Killian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richardson et al., 1989</xref>). Hence, it is widely thought that the larval skeleton arose within echinoderms by co-option of the adult skeletogenic program.</p><p>In sea urchins, the embryonic skeleton is formed by a specialized population of cells known as primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs). These cells are the sole descendants of the large micromeres, four cells that form near the vegetal pole of the cleavage-stage embryo. The specification of the large micromere-PMC lineage occurs during early embryogenesis through a cascade of regulatory (i.e. transcription factor-encoding) genes that are organized into a functional unit termed a gene regulatory network (GRN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ettensohn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oliveri et al., 2008</xref>). The skeletogenic GRN is activated in the large micromere territory by a combination localized, maternal factors and unequal cell divisions. These maternal inputs activate early regulatory genes, which engage downstream layers of regulatory genes and eventually a suite of several hundred effector genes that control PMC behavior and skeletal morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ettensohn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rafiq et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Alx1 is a pivotal transcription factor in the sea urchin skeletogenic GRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ettensohn et al., 2003</xref>). This protein contains a highly conserved homeodomain, an N-terminal charged region, and a C-terminal OAR domain, which is shared by many Paired-class homeodomain proteins. The precise functions of these various domains (except for the homeodomain) are poorly understood. Throughout embryogenesis, the expression of <italic>alx1</italic> is restricted to the large micromere-PMC lineage. Transcription of the <italic>alx1</italic> gene can be detected as early as the 56 cell stage, during the first cell cycle after the large micromeres are born. The level of <italic>alx1</italic> transcripts peaks at two developmental stages, at the pre-hatching blastula stage and later at the mesenchyme blastula stage, with expression persisting throughout later embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Damle and Davidson, 2011</xref>). Perturbation of <italic>alx1</italic> function using antisense morpholinos (MOs) blocks PMC specification while misexpression of <italic>alx1</italic> results in the ectopic activation of the skeletogenic program in non-PMC lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ettensohn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ettensohn et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, <italic>alx1</italic> was shown to provide positive inputs into more than 50% of all genes differentially expressed by PMCs, confirming its central role as a regulator of PMC identity and skeletogenesis in sea urchins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rafiq et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recent comparative studies point to a conserved, essential role for <italic>alx1</italic> in skeletogenesis in all echinoderms. In all echinoderm clades that form larval skeletal elements, <italic>alx1</italic> is activated at an early developmental stage specifically in the skeletogenic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dylus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erkenbrack and Davidson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ettensohn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McCauley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rubinstein and de Souza, 2013</xref>). In addition, perturbation experiments have demonstrated that <italic>alx1</italic> is essential for larval skeletogenesis in both pencil urchins and sea cucumbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erkenbrack and Davidson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McCauley et al., 2012</xref>). It is noteworthy that in sea star embryos, which lack a skeleton, <italic>alx1</italic> is expressed at levels that are barely detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McCauley et al., 2012</xref>), although the gene is robustly expressed in skeletogenic centers of adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao and Davidson, 2008</xref>), as it is in adult skeletogenic centers in sea urchins and brittle stars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Czarkwiani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao and Davidson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). Forced expression of sea urchin or sea star Alx1 in sea stars is sufficient to activate several skeletogenic genes that are also regulated by Alx1 in sea urchins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koga et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to <italic>alx1</italic>, echinoderms possess a paralogous <italic>alx4</italic> gene. The two <italic>alx</italic> genes are located adjacent to one another in the echinoderm genome, suggesting that a gene duplication occurred. A recent molecular phylogenetic analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koga et al., 2016</xref> showed that both paralogues were present in the last common ancestor of all modern echinoderms and that the gene duplication probably took place after the divergence of echinoderms from hemichordates, which possess a single <italic>alx4</italic>-like gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koga et al., 2016</xref>). In euechinoids, <italic>alx4</italic> is expressed by PMCs but also by non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells (probably presumptive coelomic pouch cells) at the tip of the archenteron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rafiq et al., 2012</xref>). The function of Alx4 has not been explored experimentally; however, it has been proposed that because the <italic>alx4</italic>-like gene in hemichordates is expressed in the coelomic mesoderm, the primary function of the ancestral gene was to support coelom development, a function which may be retained by <italic>alx4</italic> in echinoderms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koga et al., 2016</xref>). These findings therefore suggest that the skeletogenic function of <italic>alx1</italic> arose secondarily.</p><p>In the present study, we performed a detailed structure-function analysis of sea urchin (<italic>Lytechnius variegatus</italic>) Alx1 (LvAlx1). We developed a rescue assay using morpholino-resistant <italic>alx1</italic> mRNA that allowed us to test the function of motifs in the LvAlx1 protein via mutagenesis. We found that large parts of the protein, including the N-terminal region and most of the C-terminal region, were dispensable for LvAlx1 function in PMC specification, PMC patterning, and skeletogenesis. Further dissection of the C-terminal region, however, revealed that a small, novel domain, which we termed Domain 2, harbored motifs essential for LvAlx1 function. We found that LvAlx4 lacked skeletogenic function by our rescue assay; thus, LvAlx1 and LvAlx4 are not functionally redundant. Remarkably, insertion of LvAlx1 Domain 2 into LvAlx4 conferred robust skeletogenic functions on the LvAlx4 chimeric protein. We found that Domain 2 of Alx1 is contained within a short exon regulated by alternative splicing in sea urchins, pencil urchins and sea stars. Lastly, we used cross-species protein expression experiments to show that while Alx1 proteins from closely related sea urchin species are functionally interchangeable, Alx1 proteins from more distantly related echinoderms are not, due to protein-level differences within the C-terminal region but outside the highly conserved Domain 2. Taken together, our findings support the view that exonization of Domain 2 was an early and critically important event in the functional divergence of Alx1 and Alx4 and a major step in the evolution of echinoderm biomineralization. Other protein-level changes in Alx1 have accumulated more recently and limit the functional interchangeability of Alx1 proteins among echinoderms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A morpholino-resistant form of LvAlx1 rescues LvAlx1 morphants</title><p>Orthologues of Alx1 are found in all echinoderms and share a number of highly conserved motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To perform a structure-function analysis of sea urchin (<italic>L. variegatus</italic>) Alx1, we generated a MO-resistant, GFP-tagged, wild-type <italic>Lv-alx1</italic> mRNA (LvAlx1.WT.GFP) by introducing six silent mutations into the MO target site, which was located at the 5’ end of the coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When LvAlx1 MO was co-injected with 2 µg/µL of the MO-resistant LvAlx1.WT.GFP mRNA, PMC specification and patterning were substantially rescued (mean percentage of 6a9-positive cells relative to uninjected controls was 99%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,C’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because previous work has shown that the effects of Alx1 are dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ettensohn et al., 2007</xref>), we tested a range of concentrations of LvAlx1.WT.GFP mRNA (1–4 µg/µL) and found that higher concentrations (3–4 µg/µL) inhibited PMC specification, consistent with previous findings. Embryos injected with 3.0 mM LvAlx1 MO showed an almost complete block in PMC specification, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ettensohn et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, for all subsequent rescue experiments, we used LvAlx1.WT.GFP mRNA and LvAlx1 MO at concentrations of 2.0 µg/µL and 3.0 mM respectively. For mutant mRNAs of different lengths, mRNA concentrations were adjusted to match the molar concentration of 2.0 µg/µL LvAlx1.WT.GFP.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32728.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of Alx1 across the echinoderms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Clustal Omega alignment of the Alx1 sequences from <italic>Lytechinus variegatus</italic> (LvAlx1), <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic> (SpAlx1), <italic>Eucidaris tribuloides</italic> (EtAlx1), <italic>Parastichopus parvimensis</italic> (PpAlx1), <italic>Patiria miniata</italic> (PmAlx1), <italic>Ophiothrix spiculata</italic> (OsAlx1) and <italic>Metacrinus rotundus</italic> (MrAlx1).

In initial experiments, we generated point mutations in a putative MAPK phosphorylation site which was previously identified in the N-terminal region of Alx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Röttinger et al., 2004</xref>). The MAPK signaling pathway has been shown to play an important role in PMC specification and is required for the phosphorylation and activation of Ets1, another important transcription factor expressed by PMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandez-Serra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Röttinger et al., 2004</xref>). We altered the putative MAPK phosphorylation site (PSTP) in Alx1 by generating phosphorylation-null (LvAlx1.T28A.GFP) and phosphomimetic (LvAlx1.T28D.GFP) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

These findings suggest that the requirement for MAPK signaling in PMC specification is not mediated through phosphorylation of Alx1.</p><p>To more comprehensively examine the role of the N-terminal region, three additional mutants were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Deletion of the N-terminal region or charged domain individually revealed that each was dispensable for LvAlx1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E’</xref>).

In LvAlx1 splice variant 1, an alternative splice donor site at the 3’ end of Domain 3 was utilized, introducing a frameshift and resulting in a premature stop codon within Domain 4. In LvAlx1 splice variant 2, the exon containing Domains 2 and 3 was skipped. These results closely matched those obtained by RNA-seq, which also showed one major splicing isoform that contained the Domain (2 + 3) exon and low levels of an isoform lacking this exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rafiq et al., 2014</xref>).

We noted that asterozoan <italic>alx1</italic> genes contain a potential splice site at the 5’ end of Domain 2 that corresponds perfectly to the 5’ splice junction of the echinozoan <italic>alx1</italic> genes. RT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from <italic>P. miniata</italic> embryos at several developmental stages revealed five major splice variants in this region. Sequencing results revealed that, in addition to the ‘wild-type’ mRNA (which we defined as the isoform that was most similar to the abundant isoform in sea urchins), PmAlx1 splice variant 1 contained an in-frame, alternative exon between Domains 3 and 4. In PmAlx1 splice variant 2, an alternative splice site at the 3’ end of Domain 3 was used to join the alternative exon, resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon. In PmAlx1 splice variant 3, the alternative exon took the place of Domains 2 and 3, which were spliced out using an internal splice site at the 5’ end of Domain 2. In PmAlx1 splice variant 4, the Domain (2 + 3) exon and alternative exon were skipped. We also noted a change in the splicing pattern across development, such that by the late bipinnaria stage, when adult skeletal elements are being produced, levels of the wild-type PmAlx1 which contained the Domain (2 + 3) exon were elevated. These findings revealed a complex pattern of alternative splicing of the <italic>alx1</italic> transcript in <italic>P. miniata</italic> and showed that the splicing pattern is developmentally regulated, with a shift to a greater abundance of the wild-type mRNA isoform (which encodes Domain 2) at stages when skeletogenesis is underway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Structure-function analysis of Alx1</title><p>Our studies show that a short form of Alx1 containing only the homeodomain and Domains 1 and 2 is able to substantially rescue PMC specification and skeletal morphogenesis in sea urchin (<italic>L. variegatus</italic>) embryos. Thus, the N-terminal region (which contains a consensus MAPK phosphorylation site), the conserved OAR domain, and much of the C-terminal region are largely dispensable for these functions. Studies on vertebrate Alx1 have reported that the OAR domain and N-terminal region have modest, attenuating and enhancing influences, respectively, on transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amendt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horiguchi and Takeshita, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Norris and Kern, 2001</xref>). Our findings do not rule out subtle effects of these or other Alx1 domains on transcriptional activity, which might be detectable only through biochemical assays. Our analysis suggests, however, that any such effects play a relatively minor role in regulating Alx1 function in vivo. It should be noted that our rescue assay specifically examined the embryonic function of Alx1, and the OAR domain, N-terminal region, or other domains of Alx1 may play important roles in adult skeletogenesis.</p><p>We have shown that the C-terminal region between the homeodomain and the OAR domain harbors a previously uncharacterized domain, Domain 2, that is critically important for Alx1 function in the embryo. We did not identify motifs within this short (41-amino acid) domain, nor did we find signatures of this domain in other proteins, either within or outside echinoderms. Domain 2 is highly conserved among echinoderms, however, which is consistent with its functional importance. The specific biochemical function of Domain 2 remains to be elucidated. Owning to its proximity to the homeodomain, this domain may alter DNA binding directly or may act indirectly by recruiting protein partners that influence the transcriptional activity of Alx1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Taxon-specific changes in Alx1</title><p>PmAlx1 and LvAlx1 share a highly conserved homeodomain and OAR domain, in addition to Domain 2.

This result was previously interpreted as evidence of the functional conservation of the PmAlx1 and LvAlx1 proteins, but a radialized skeleton can also result from a disruption of ectodermal patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergeron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coffman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coluccio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flowers et al., 2004</xref>). We showed that a chimeric form of PmAlx1 that contained the LvAlx1 C-terminal region (PmAlx1.LvAlx1C.GFP) was able to rescue LvAlx1 morphants, indicating that differences in the C-terminal region of PmAlx1 compromised its activity in the sea urchin embryo.

This conclusion was based on two observations: (1) all echinoderms have clear orthologues of <italic>alx1</italic> and <italic>alx4</italic> (also known as <italic>calx</italic>), and (2) the hemichordate <italic>Saccoglossus kowalevskii</italic> has a single <italic>alx4-</italic>like gene.

Our findings clearly show, however, that Alx1 and Alx4 are not functionally interchangeable. The lack of rescue by LvAlx4 is not attributable to direct binding of the LvAlx1 MO to LvAlx4.WT.GFP mRNA, as the N-terminal MO target sequence is not conserved in <italic>Lv-alx4</italic>. Most strikingly, insertion of the LvAlx1 Domain 2 into LvAlx4 is sufficient to confer function and fully rescue PMC specification, patterning, and skeleton formation in LvAlx1 morphants. This observation strongly supports the view that the gain of Domain 2 was an important evolutionary innovation that marked the functional divergence of Alx1 from Alx4 by conferring skeletogenic capabilities on Alx1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Evolution of domain 2</title><p>Protein domains are acquired through several mechanisms, such as gene fusion, intron recombination, exon recombination, retrotransposition and exon extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buljan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marsh and Teichmann, 2010</xref>). By comparing the intron-exon organization of <italic>alx1</italic> and <italic>alx4</italic> in echinoderms and hemichordates, we have shown that the evolution of the <italic>alx1</italic> paralogue was accompanied by an increase in the structural complexity of the gene. This is consistent with a general tendency for duplicated genes to diverge structurally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Several lines of evidence support the view that this structural diversification included the exonization of Domain 2 from previously non-coding sequences: (1) The lack of an identifiable Domain 2 in proteins other than Alx1 argues against the possibility that this domain originated from a donor gene, although sequence divergence could confound this analysis. (2) Domain 3 within the Domain (2 + 3) exon is intrinsically disordered, a characteristic of exons that originated from non-coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buljan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marsh and Teichmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>). (3) The complex patterns of alternative splicing of the Domain (2 + 3) exon within the echinoderms are consistent with the observation that new exons are alternatively spliced at much higher frequency than old exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sorek, 2007</xref>). (4) In asterozoan <italic>alx1</italic> genes, Domains 2 and 3 of Alx1 are encoded by a continuous open reading frame that also encodes a portion of the homeodomain. Based on these considerations, we propose a model whereby Domain 2 was originally acquired via recruitment of intronic sequences in an ancestral form of <italic>alx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). We propose that asterozoan <italic>alx1</italic> genes have retained the intron-exon structure of the ancestral <italic>alx1</italic> gene while echinozoan <italic>alx1</italic> genes underwent multiple rounds of intron gain following the exon extension event, including the gain of an intron that separated the Domain 2-containing exon from its parental exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>). We have examined the 5’ region of the intron downstream of Domain 1 in modern echinoderm <italic>alx4</italic> and hemichordate <italic>alx4</italic>-like genes and have detected no signature of Domain 2 at either nucleotide or protein level, but it seems highly unlikely that such signatures would have persisted over the &gt;400 million years since the putative exon extension occurred. We also propose that the intrinsically disordered state of Domain 3 is a vestige of its origin from non-coding sequence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>), while the highly conserved Domain 2 has become more ordered over time in concert with its acquisition of an important developmental function.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32728.017</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Model representing the evolution of <italic>L. variegatus alx</italic> genes.</title><p>Following gene duplication, the ancestral <italic>Lv-alx1</italic> underwent rapid evolution through multiple intron gains and more importantly, acquired Domain 2 through exonization of previously non-coding sequences.

Indeed, our analysis of <italic>alx1</italic> splicing in <italic>P. miniata</italic> revealed a developmentally regulated pattern, with increased levels of Domain 2-containing mRNA at stages of overt skeletogenesis. Moreover, our cross-species studies demonstrated that the sea star Domain 2 is functional in sea urchin embryos. It was shown previously that in sea stars, levels of <italic>alx1</italic> mRNA are extremely low in the embryo but increase at larval stages, when <italic>alx1</italic> is expressed in the skeletogenic centers of the adult rudiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koga et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings indicate that, in addition to this control mechanism, regulation of the alternative splicing of <italic>alx1</italic> also influences the levels of functional (Domain 2-containing) Alx1 protein during development. Finally, we note that while a role for Domain 2 in adult skeletogenesis seems at odds with our finding that this domain is absent from the single Alx1 protein sequence from crinoids, very limited cDNA sequence data (and no genomic data) are available from this group, and additional splice isoforms may well exist.</p><p>In hemichordates, the closest outgroup to echinoderms, the single <italic>alx4</italic>-like gene lacks Domain 2. Adult hemichordates form small, calcareous skeletal elements termed ossicles, and orthologues of several echinoid biomineralization genes are transcribed during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cameron and Bishop, 2012</xref>). This raises the possibility that the ancestral <italic>alx4</italic>-like gene provided positive inputs into a ‘primitive’ skeletogenic GRN similar to that present in modern hemichordates. According to this view, gene duplication and the subsequent gain of Domain 2 by Alx1 altered its transcriptional activity, thereby modifying a rudimentary, ancestral skeletogenic GRN in ways that promoted the formation of much more elaborate endoskeletal system, first in the adult and later in the embryo. To explore this model further, analysis of the adult expression and transcriptional targets of the single <italic>alx4</italic>-like gene in hemichordates (and of the <italic>alx4</italic> gene in sea urchins) would be extremely informative. In addition, analysis of the biochemical function of Domain 2 will provide important insights concerning the mechanisms by which protein domain gain has driven the acquisition of novel structures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult <italic>Lytechinus variegatus</italic> were acquired from the Duke University Marine Laboratory (Beaufort, NC, USA) and from Pelagic Corp.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Functional divergence of paralogous transcription factors supported the evolution of biomineralization in echinoderms&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Diethard Tautz as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hiroshi Wada (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper reports analysis of the transcription factor Alx1 in which the authors have experimentally analyzed a protein domain that is critical to initiating skeletogenesis in urchin embryos. By producing chimeric versions of Alx, in which the critical domain of orthologues and paralogues are substituted the authors establish the necessity and sufficiency of the domain. An analysis of Alx gene organization and splice patterns in several related species suggests that a gene duplication event was followed by a recruitment of a new exon from intronic sequences. They conclude that the gain in protein domains provides an evolutionary mechanism for novel morphology to arise.</p><p>Both reviewers find the experiments, the writing and the conclusions compelling. There are only a few points that need clarification.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a confusing aspect of the naming of the critical domain of the Alx1 protein. The authors refer to it as a C2 domain and note that their searches indicate it is not a previously characterized protein domain. There is a C2 protein domain that is well characterized and involved in calcium dependent membrane binding of proteins such as PTEN and PKC to specific membranes. As the authors do not refer to this literature, I assume the name they have chosen for the Alx1 protein domain is redundant and may confuse readers. It is therefore necessary to use another nomenclature for the domains to avoid such a confusion.</p><p>2) It is not clear how the authors established the domain boundaries. It is unclear whether they are based upon protein structure predictions or the position of the splice boundaries. Given that the minimal construct is the homeodomain+C1+C2, is it not possible that there are regions within C1 that are critical to Alx1 function? The Alx4 with the Alx1 C2 domain construct rescues, but the C1 domains of Alx1 and Alx4 are very similar (20/30 amino acids are identical). As well, the authors conclude (in subsection “Alx1 orthologues from closely related sea urchin species, but not from more distantly related echinoderms, are functionally interchangeable”) that sequence differences in the PmAlx1 outside the C2 domain are critical to its ability to rescue. It seems the C2 domain is necessary, but C1+C2 is sufficient for rescue. The concern here is that the model proposed focuses on the acquisition of the C2 domain, which appears to be defined by splice boundaries. The argument that the domain is acquired by a change in the splice location becomes somewhat circular when the domain is defined only by splice locations.</p><p>3) In the second paragraph of subsection “The C2 domain is subject to alternative splicing and likely arose by exonization”, the authors describe an analysis that suggests that C3 is intrinsically disordered, but it is not clear how they relate this to the evolution of the C2 domain. It would be necessary to show this in a specific figure and put it into the context of de novo evolution of genes (e.g. one of the latest papers on the topic is: Wilson et al., (2017).</p><p>4) Experiments are reported that indicate that loss of MAPK target sites has no effect on Alx1 function. Previous studies have established that loss of MAPK pathway components inhibits skeletogenesis. It will be necessary to have a discussion of their interpretation of these data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32728.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a confusing aspect of the naming of the critical domain of the Alx1 protein.

It seems the C2 domain is necessary, but C1+C2 is sufficient for rescue. The concern here is that the model proposed focuses on the acquisition of the C2 domain, which appears to be defined by splice boundaries. The argument that the domain is acquired by a change in the splice location becomes somewhat circular when the domain is defined only by splice locations.</p></disp-quote><p>The relevant experiment here is the one in which we deleted the C1 (now Domain 1) region and showed this has no effect on Alx1 function (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Based on this experiment, we conclude that the C1 region does not contain essential sequences. Given this finding, we do not believe there is circularity in our other arguments, as there is experimental evidence that the C2+C3 exon was gained through changes in splicing, and separate experimental data showing that C2 domain is crucial for Alx1 function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the second paragraph of subsection “The C2 domain is subject to alternative splicing and likely arose by exonization”, the authors describe an analysis that suggests that C3 is intrinsically disordered, but it is not clear how they relate this to the evolution of the C2 domain. It would be necessary to show this in a specific figure and put it into the context of de novo evolution of genes (e.g. one of the latest papers on the topic is: Wilson et al., (2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for calling our attention to the recent Wilson et al., (2017) paper, which we now cite. Essentially our argument is that the high degree of intrinsic disorder of the C3 domain supports the hypothesis that the C2+C3 exon arose relatively recently from non-coding sequences. This is consistent with several studies (including the Wilson paper) which show that young proteins (or protein domains) show elevated levels of intrinsic disorder, perhaps because a disordered structure makes new protein sequences less likely to be harmful to cells. We hypothesize that the highly conserved C2 domain has become less disordered over time as it has acquired an important function, while the disorder of C3 has persisted. Our feeling is that this argument is probably not complex enough to warrant a separate figure (as it is just a hypothesis), but we have expanded upon it in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Experiments are reported that indicate that loss of MAPK target sites has no effect on Alx1 function. Previous studies have established that loss of MAPK pathway components inhibits skeletogenesis. It will be necessary to have a discussion of their interpretation of these data.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies have shown that MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of a different PMC transcription factor, Ets1, is required for PMC specification. We wondered whether MAPK might also phosphorylate Alx1 and that this might be part of the role of MAPK, but this does not seem to be the case as we can delete the phosphorylation site without affecting Alx1 function. Thus, Ets1 might completely account for the MAPK requirement. We have added statements to this effect in the text (subsection “The N-terminal region of LvAlx1 is dispensable for skeletogenic function”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
