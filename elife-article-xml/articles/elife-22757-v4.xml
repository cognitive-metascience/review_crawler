circuits. Cell type-specific properties are encoded by selective gene expression programs that shape molecular repertoires and synaptic protein complexes. However, the nature of such programs, particularly for post-transcriptional regulation at the level of alternative splicing is only beginning to emerge. We here demonstrate that transcripts encoding the synaptic adhesion molecules neurexin-1,2,3 are commonly expressed in principal cells and interneurons of the mouse hippocampus but undergo highly differential, cell type-specific alternative splicing. Principal cell-specific neurexin splice isoforms depend on the RNA-binding protein Slm2. By contrast, most parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneurons lack Slm2, express a different neurexin splice isoform and co-express the corresponding splice isoform-specific neurexin ligand Cbln4. Conditional ablation of <italic>Nrxn</italic> alternative splice insertions selectively in PV<sup>+</sup> cells results in elevated hippocampal network activity and impairment in a learning task. Thus, PV-cell-specific alternative splicing of neurexins is critical for neuronal circuit function</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22757.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22757.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>synaptic specificity</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd><kwd>synaptogenesis</kwd><kwd>activity</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030B-160319</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheiffele</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPLICECODE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheiffele</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The National Centre of Competence in Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCCR SYNAPSY</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheiffele</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovative Medicines Initiatives</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EU-AIMS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheiffele</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Traunmüller</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie-Curie Mobility Fellowship European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schreiner</surname><given-names>Dietmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Werner Siemens/Opportunities in Excellence Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Thi-Minh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interneuron-specific alternative splice variants of the synaptic receptor neurexin are critical for hippocampal network activity and short-term memory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Specific synaptic connectivity and function are essential for the appropriate operation of neuronal circuits. A large degree of this structural and functional specificity is thought to be genetically encoded. For example, synaptic partners express matching pairs of adhesive factors or afferents are repelled from inappropriate targets through chemorepulsive signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sanes and Yamagata, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shen and Scheiffele, 2010</xref>). Gene families encoding large numbers of isoforms generated through multiple genes, alternative promoters and extensive alternative splicing, hold the potential to generate recognition tags for specific trans-synaptic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baudouin and Scheiffele, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reissner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takahashi and Craig, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schreiner et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2015</xref>). However, given the difficulty of mapping endogenous splice isoform repertoires it is poorly understood how splice isoforms are differentially distributed across neuronal cell types.</p><p>Neurexins (<italic>Nrxn1,2,3</italic>) represent one gene family of highly diversified synaptic adhesion molecules. Through the use of alternative promoters (alpha and beta) and alternative splicing at up to six alternatively spliced segments (AS1-6) more than 1300 transcripts are generated that are expressed in the mature mouse nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schreiner et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Treutlein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schreiner et al., 2015</xref>). Isoform diversity scales with the cellular complexity of brain regions and one purified cell population was shown to be strongly enriched for a subset of isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schreiner et al., 2014a</xref>). This indicated that at least some neurexin isoforms are enriched in a cell type-specific manner. Pairwise comparisons of relative transcript levels recovered from single cells suggested that individual cells within one cell type might exhibit more similar alternative exon usage than cells from divergent origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuccillo et al., 2015</xref>). However, the actual alternative exon incorporation rates in interneuron and principal neuron populations have not been examined.</p><p>Importantly, individual splice insertions in the neurexin proteins control biochemical interactions with an array of synaptic ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baudouin and Scheiffele, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reissner et al., 2013</xref>). Based on ectopic expression and knock-out experiments in mice it has been postulated that neurexin isoforms might contribute to an alternative splice code for selective synaptic interactions and differ in their tethering at neuronal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boucard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chih et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graf et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu and Huang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Futai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Traunmüller et al., 2016</xref>). However, interpretation of such findings is complicated by the fact that the manipulations of isoforms were conducted in cells where endogenous isoform repertoires were unknown. In the human population mutations in <italic>Nrxn1</italic>,<italic>2</italic>, and 3 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rujescu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gauthier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vaags et al., 2012</xref>). Global deletion of the majority of <italic>Nrxn1</italic> or <italic>Nrxn3</italic> transcripts in mice or global perturbation of the <italic>Nrxn</italic> alternative splicing at AS4 disrupts function and plasticity of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Missler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Etherton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Traunmüller et al., 2016</xref>). However, the function of neurexin isoforms in interneurons has not been examined with targeted approaches.</p><p>In this study we uncover a major alternative splice isoform switch that distinguishes glutamatergic and GABAergic cell populations in the hippocampus. We demonstrate that <italic>Nrxn1,2,3α</italic> transcripts are commonly expressed in pyramidal cells and fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons expressing the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV<sup>+</sup> cells). However, pyramidal and PV<sup>+</sup> cells exhibit highly differential incorporation rates of alternative exons at AS4. This alternative splicing switch depends on the differential expression of RNA-binding proteins and coincides with the cell type specific expression of a neurexin splice isoform-specific ligand. Selective disruption of PV<sup>+</sup> cell splice variants in mice results in functional and behavioral abnormalities. Thus, interneuron-specific alternative splicing of neurexins is important for normal circuit function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neurexin alpha mRNAs are highly expressed in pyramidal cells and PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons of the mouse hippocampus</title><p>To begin to assess the differential expression and functional relevance of neurexin isoforms in mouse neuron populations, we first examined the six primary <italic>Nrxn1,2,3α</italic>/<italic>β</italic> transcripts by in situ <italic>hybridization</italic>.

Thus, we tested whether cell type-specific alternative splicing at AS4 may be a consequence of differential expression of Slm2 in pyramidal versus PV<sup>+</sup> cells that are targeted in the <italic>CamK2<sup>cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Pvalb<sup>cre</sup></italic> transgenic lines, respectively. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stoss et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iijima et al., 2014</xref>), we observed high expression of Slm2 protein in pyramidal cells, and more than 90% of CamK2<sup>Ribo</sup>-positive cells were Slm2-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). By contrast, 75% of cells marked in <italic>Pvalb<sup>cre</sup>::</italic>Ai9<sup>Tom</sup> mice in hippocampus area CA1 do not express Slm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In particular, cells within or close to the pyramidal cell layer were Slm2-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref> - note that the percentage of Slm2-expressing ‘PV<sup>+</sup> cells’ depends on the anatomical position within the hippocampus and the use of genetic versus antibody-labeling to define ‘PV<sup>+</sup> cells’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). We further explored differential expression of STAR-family RNA binding proteins by real-time qPCR on polysome-associated transcripts from CamK2<sup>Ribo</sup> and PV<sup>Ribo</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Consistent with the immunohistochemistry results, we observed an enrichment of <italic>Slm2</italic> transcripts in the CamK2<sup>Ribo</sup> population and a de-enrichment in the PV<sup>Ribo</sup> preparations (similarly the <italic>Slm2</italic> paralogues <italic>Slm1</italic> and <italic>Sam68</italic> were de-enriched). Given that global ablation of Slm2 results in a significant loss of the skipped (AS4-) neurexin isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ehrmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Traunmüller et al., 2014</xref>), this strongly suggests that differential expression of Slm2 in pyramidal versus PV<sup>+</sup> cells drives the cell type-specific skipping of alternative exons at AS4 in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. Finally, we observed that ectopic expression of Slm2 in cells that normally do not express high levels of STAR proteins (cerebellar granule cells in culture) was sufficient to shift alternative splicing in favor of <italic>Nrxn AS4-</italic> isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>AS4 + splice insertions selectively enhance the function of neurexins towards GABAergic postsynaptic components</title><p>Neurexin AS4+ and AS4- isoforms differ in biochemical interactions with several synaptic ligands. In particular, AS4+ isoforms bind to a class of extracellular ligands called cerebellins (Cbln1-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Uemura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ito-Ishida et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesized that neurexin alternative splicing and Cbln expression might coincide. We detected an enrichment of <italic>Cbln4</italic>-encoding transcripts in the PV<sup>+</sup> cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). By contrast, the CamK2<sup>Ribo</sup> population was de-enriched for both, <italic>Cbln2</italic> and <italic>Cbln4</italic> transcripts (note that <italic>Cbln1</italic> and <italic>Cbln3</italic> show very low expression in the mouse hippocampus as compared to the cerebellum, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus express high levels of Slm2 which drives production of AS4- splice isoforms, and there are low levels of Cbln2 and 4. Conversely, the PV<sup>+</sup> cell population largely lacks STAR-family RNA-binding proteins (Sam68, Slm1, Slm2), exhibit high levels of alternative exon inclusion at AS4, and the cells co-express Cbln4. Despite the similarities between Cbln1,2, and 4 it has remained unclear to what extent Cbln4 interacts with Nrx AS4+ proteins. In fact, binding to Nrx3 AS4+ isoforms has been reported to be low or not detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matsuda and Yuzaki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). Using in vitro binding assays with Cbln4 from conditioned media we confirmed binding to cells expressing Nrx1α AS4+ but significantly lower binding to Nrx3 AS4+ isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). We then tested another assay configuration where Cbln proteins and Nrx isoforms are co-expressed in the same cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In this assay, Cbln1 or 4 were strongly retained at the cell surface of cells co-expressing Cbln1 or Cbln4 together with Nrx3 AS4+ isoforms but not Nrx3 AS4- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Thus, Cbln4 indeed associates not only with Nrx1α but also Nrx3α proteins in a AS4 splice-isoform-specific manner (further studies will be required to confirm whether these interactions are direct or whether they may involve additional linker proteins).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22757.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Regulation of Nrx3 interaction by AS4- splice insertions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Cbln1, 2, 3</italic> and <italic>4</italic> mRNA expression level was assessed by real-time qPCR in CamK2<sup>Ribo</sup> and PV<sup>Ribo</sup> preparations from mouse hippocampus.

First, we demonstrate that alpha neurexin transcripts are commonly expressed in pyramidal cells as well as PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons. We then show that alternative splicing at the alternatively spliced segment four (AS4) is a major driver for the generation of divergent neurexin isoforms in PV<sup>+</sup> cells and pyramidal cells. Differential alternative splicing emerges from differential expression of the RNA-binding protein Slm2 that drives selective production of AS4- splice isoforms in pyramidal cells. By contrast, Slm2 is absent from the majority of PV<sup>+</sup> cells which produce AS4+ isoforms and co-express the splice isoform-specific ligand Cbln4. Finally, we provide evidence that selective disruption of the PV<sup>+</sup> cell-associated AS4+ isoforms results in increased hippocampal network activity and impairs short-term memory, demonstrating that the cell type-specific alternative splice variants are indeed relevant for circuit function.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell-type specific alternative splicing machinery instructs the neurexin isoform code</title><p>Previous work provided evidence for cell type-specific repertoires of full-length neurexin transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schreiner et al., 2014a</xref>). Pairwise comparison of alternative exon amplification indicated similar exon amplification from single cells within one class of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuccillo et al., 2015</xref>). However, these approaches did not provide actual exon incorporation rates across cell types which are a prerequisite for understanding the logic of cell type-specific function of endogenous isoforms.</p><p>Our observation that AS4 insertion-containing <italic>Nrxn</italic> mRNAs are dominant in PV<sup>+</sup> cells and abundant in the entire hippocampus was surprising as it had been previously suggested that these <italic>Nrxn3</italic> AS4+ isoforms make up less than 10% of <italic>Nrxn3</italic> in the mouse hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoto et al., 2013</xref>). We note that the estimates of exon incorporation rates based on extrapolation from several independent qPCR assays can make it difficult to reliably assess isoform contents due to differential primer efficiencies. The high abundance of AS4+ isoforms in the hippocampus reported in the present study is supported by radioactive and semi-quantitative PCR assays, as well as previous mass-spectrometric assays that probe Nrx3 AS4+ variants on the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ehrmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Traunmüller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schreiner et al., 2015</xref>]). Thus, we conclude that these variants are indeed significantly expressed. More importantly, we demonstrate that they are specifically enriched in interneurons but largely absent from pyramidal cells in the hippocampus.</p><p>The highly selective alternative splicing choices in the neurexin pre-mRNAs suggest that they result from neuronal cell-type specific expression of alternative splicing factors. The high expression of <italic>Nrxn1,2,3 AS4-</italic> variants in pyramidal cells discovered here correlates with the high expression of Slm2 protein in pyramidal cells and the near complete loss of these variants in Slm2 knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ehrmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Traunmüller et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, we demonstrate that Slm2 is absent from the majority of hippocampal CA1 interneurons marked in the <italic>Pvalb<sup>cre</sup>::</italic>Ai9<sup>Tom</sup> mouse line. Correspondingly, these cells generate high levels of AS4+ neurexin isoforms. It remains to be tested whether the absence of STAR-family RNA binding proteins is sufficient to direct alternative splicing to the inclusion of AS4+ or whether other, yet unidentified alternative splicing factors contribute to this alternative splicing choice. Finally, we demonstrate that this selective expression of AS4+ variants coincides with PV<sup>+</sup> cell enrichment of Cbln4, an AS4+ specific neurexin ligand. Interestingly, the differential expression of AS4 isoforms in PV <italic>versus</italic> principal cells is also in part observed for cortical cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In additional RiboTrap purifications from somatostatin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus we also observed an enrichment of <italic>Nrxn AS4+</italic> isoforms as compared to principal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>) along with Slm2-negative somatostatin-expressing cells in the hippocampus (in particular in the hilus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, our study uncovers a hippocampal interneuron-specific gene expression program that consists of neurexin isoforms and ligands in the hippocampus.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional consequences of cell type-specific splicing regulation</title><p>The difficulty of assigning cell type-specific <italic>Nrxn</italic> transcripts and splice isoform expression has been a major impediment for the interpretation of functional studies. Global knock-out studies demonstrated that neurexin alpha triple knock-out mice show a 40% reduction in the density of presumptive inhibitory synapses and defects in synaptic transmission in the brain stem of perinatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Missler et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, simultaneous global ablation of all <italic>Nrxn3</italic> transcripts results in brain area-specifc alterations in synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoto et al., 2015</xref>). In these studies it was unknown which endogenous primary transcripts and which splice isoforms are expressed and the knock-out manipulations were not cell type-specific. The data presented here demonstrate that pyramidal and PV<sup>+</sup> cells share primary <italic>Nrxn1,2,3</italic> transcripts but that the endogenous neurexin isoforms differ dramatically in their alternative splicing regulation at AS4.</p><p>In cellular assays, we demonstrate that the AS4+ splice insertion in Nrx3α selectively increases Nrx3 activity towards assembly of GABAergic postsynaptic structures and that AS4+ variants bind to the extracellular ligand Cbln4 that is co-expressed in PV<sup>+</sup> cells. In the mouse cerebellum, Neurexin-Cbln1 interactions have been demonstrated to be essential for the formation and stability of granule cell-Purkinje cell synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Uemura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ito-Ishida et al., 2012</xref>). Similar to granule cells, PV<sup>+</sup> cells in the hippocampus express a Cbln family protein (Cbln4) and neurexin AS4+ isoforms which interact with Cblns. However, genetic disruption of <italic>Nrxn1 and 3</italic> AS4 insertions did not result in morphological alterations of PV<sup>+</sup> cell output synapses detectable at the level of light or electron microscopy. Structural functions of a Nrx1/3-Cbln4 pair, analogous to the cerebellar system, may be compensated by the remaining Nrx2 AS4+ isoforms or conditional ablation of the AS4 insertions with the <italic>Pvalb<sup>cre</sup></italic> line may not be complete when PV<sup>+</sup> cell synapses form during postnatal development. Alternatively, the essential roles for Nrx1/3-Cbln4 complexes in PV<sup>+</sup> cells may differ from what is observed for Nrx-Cbln1 complexes in the cerebellum. Regardless, the increased c-fos<sup>+</sup> expression in the hippocampus of <italic>Nrxn1/3<sup>ex21ΔPV</sup></italic> mice indicates that the AS4+ isoforms have important functions and presumably reflects an impairment in PV<sup>+</sup> cell mediated inhibition in hippocampal circuits. Moreover, the impairment of short-term memory further supports the notion that neurexin AS4+ isoforms have important functions in the cells targeted by the <italic>Pvalb<sup>cre</sup></italic> line in the hippocampus. Dysfunction of PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron networks has been postulated to be a major contributor to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Del Pino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gogolla et al., 2014</xref>).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;An alternative splicing switch shapes neurexin repertoires in principal neurons versus interneurons of the hippocampus&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Sacha B Nelson (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Joris De Wit (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that we will not be able to publish your manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form.</p><p>The editorial policy at <italic>eLife</italic> requires that manuscripts requiring additional experimental work that would take more than approximately two months be rejected. There is also no separate &quot;soft reject&quot; or &quot;reject-resubmit&quot; category recognized. In this case, however, all three reviewers recognized the merits of the study and support publication, but also felt clarification, and importantly, additional experiments were likely needed to support the claims made in the paper. Assuming the results of these experiments are not already in hand, they would likely take several months to complete.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has identified the following key points for revision with input from the other reviewers and Senior Editor:</p><p>1) All three reviewers felt that the absence of a synaptic deficit significantly reduced the impact of the paper and made it difficult to relate the behavioral phenotype to molecular differences between hippocampal cell types identified. Further attempts to address this are warranted. The problem is that there is no evidence tying the behavioral phenotype to the cells on which the rest of the paper focuses. The tie could be made by seeking a synaptic phenotype, but if the authors have some other way of making the link, that would be fine too.</p><p>2) Two of the reviewers felt that the relationship between cerebellin expression and neurexin function was not pursued adequately. Some additional experiments were proposed but it is also possible that this concern could be addressed with results on hand and textual clarification or by removing this section.</p><p>3) An additional concern of one reviewer was the lack of direct evidence linking Slm2 levels and AS4 splicing in these cells. While it would improve the manuscript to address this with additional manipulations this is not required for acceptance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Since the discovery that neurexins undergo extensive alternative splicing, scientists have speculated that cell type specific splicing is important for cell type specific patterns of connectivity. Several studies have provided evidence that multiple splice variants are expressed and some studies have argued that this expression is cell type specific, but this is the first study I am aware of to directly test the consequence of a cell type specific knockout of a specific isoform.</p><p>The authors first show that <italic>Pvalb</italic> interneurons selectively express the AS4+ isoform and that this is likely due to the fact that they lack expression of the Slm2 RNA binding protein. They also show that heterologous expression of this splice variant in culture enhances formation of inhibitory synapses. They then use a conditional allele to selectively delete this isoform in <italic>Pvalb</italic>+ cells in mice and show a behavioral deficit in a working memory task.</p><p>The results presented are convincing and are important because they directly test key aspects of the neurexin splice code hypothesis. Unfortunately, the paper is missing a phenotype at the synaptic level. Somatic inhibitory synapses onto pyramidal neurons appear normal and mIPSCs are not affected (nor are numbers of <italic>Pvalb</italic> neurons). But the findings – that the potentially relevant ligand (Cbln4) is expressed in the same <italic>Pvalb</italic> cells as the NrxAs4+ transcripts, and that these Nrx transcripts enhance inhibitory synapses – argue that the relevant synaptic deficit to look for are inhibitory synapses between <italic>Pvalb</italic> cells. At least in the neocortex, these are the dominant source of inhibition of these interneurons and disruption of this synapse might destabilize the persistent activity hypothesized to underlie working memory. Therefore, it is disappointing that the authors did not look for anatomical and physiological evidence of reduced inhibition between <italic>Pvalb</italic> interneurons. If the authors did look for this and did not find it, this negative result is an important one that should be included. (As an aside, SST neurons also provide some inhibitory input to <italic>Pvalb</italic> neurons in some forebrain structures).</p><p>I think the paper is probably important enough to publish even without this synaptic punchline, but it would have greatly increased impact with this additional data if this is feasible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Nguyen et al. investigate neurexin (<italic>Nrxn</italic>) isoform diversity in specific neuronal cell types and uncover a major, cell type-specific difference in <italic>Nrxn</italic> alternative splice site 4 (AS4) usage. They find that parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons exhibit a high level of AS4 inclusion (AS4+), whereas pyramidal cells are preferentially AS4-. The AS4 inclusion in α <italic>Nrxn</italic>s increases their ability to induce inhibitory postsynaptic specializations in cell culture. In addition, expression of AS4+ <italic>Nrxn</italic>s in PVs coincides with the secreted <italic>Nrxn</italic> ligand Cbln4, which specifically binds to AS4+ <italic>Nrxn</italic>s. Thus, pyramidal and PV neurons have differential molecular repertoires of <italic>Nrxn</italic> isoforms and <italic>Nrxn</italic> ligands. The authors then test the effects of deleting <italic>Nrxn1</italic> and <italic>Nrxn3</italic> AS4 in PV neurons and find no changes in PV synapse structure or function, but do find changes in short-term memory.</p><p>Overall this is a well-performed study that will be of broad interest to the field. Deciphering how cell type-specific repertoires of molecularly diverse cell surface proteins are generated and contribute to the formation of precisely wired neural circuits is an important and timely topic. I have only a few comments/suggestions that need to be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) The authors show a correlation between low PV neuron expression of the STAR-family RNA-binding protein Slm2, which regulates AS4 skipping, and high levels of AS4+ <italic>Nrxn</italic> isoforms in these cells. The manuscript would be strengthened by putting the causal relation between absence of Slm2 and cell type-specific exon skipping to the test. One experiment to test this would be to use AAV to misexpress Slm2 specifically in PV cells in a Cre-dependent manner and analyze whether this causes a shift towards more AS4-<italic>Nrxn</italic> isoforms. Another experiment would be to analyze <italic>Nrxn</italic> isoform repertoires in pyramidal cells of CamK2 Ribotrap mice crossed with Slm2 KO mice.</p><p>2) The interaction of Cbln4 with <italic>Nrxn</italic> AS4+ shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and the functional relevance thereof, should be further clarified. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, Cbln4 shows little binding to <italic>Nrxn3α</italic> AS4+ and Cbln1 shows some binding to <italic>Nrxn3α</italic> AS4+, whereas in 3F Cbln4 shows binding to <italic>Nrxn3α</italic> AS4+ to a similar degree as Cbln1. How can the apparent difference in Cbln binding to <italic>Nrxn</italic> between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref> (COS cell binding vs surface retention) be explained, as both experiments measure Cbln at the surface? Does binding of Cbln4 to <italic>Nrxn</italic> AS4+ affect the induction of postsynaptic inhibitory specializations by AS4+ α <italic>Nrxn</italic>? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, are Cbln1, which binds most strongly to <italic>Nrxn</italic>a AS4+, and Cbln3 also expressed in PV neurons? Finally, is expression of Cbln4 in PV neurons perhaps dependent on an <italic>Nrxn</italic> AS4+ repertoire?</p><p>3) The differential expression of <italic>Nrxn</italic> splice variants in principal vs. PV interneurons is well characterized, and the correlation of the AS4+ variant in PV cells with low Slm2 expression and high Clbn4 expression is striking. However, there is a large gap between these findings and the finding that short-term memory is impaired in the mice with PV-specific deletion of <italic>Nrxn1/3</italic> AS4, which limits the impact of the manuscript. The link between PV neuron-specific <italic>Nrxn</italic> splicing, absence of obvious synaptic abnormalities in PV synaptic boutons and the observed behavioral impairments is not clear and raises questions. Are PV neurons known to play a role in the behavioral task assayed? Does this task also rely on PV micro-circuits outside the hippocampus and do PV neurons in those circuits also display enriched expression of AS4+? In other words, is the preferential use of AS4+ in PV cells a global phenomenon or might it be brain region-specific? A further exploration of synaptic defects in PV neurons might help to bridge the current gap between PV-specific <italic>Nrxn</italic> isoform repertoires and behavioral defects. In addition to analyzing spontaneous synaptic transmission, the authors could analyze evoked inhibitory responses and look at plasticity of PV-pyramidal neuron synapses. This would strengthen the impact of their findings. I understand the current focus is on PV synaptic terminals, but the authors could also explore whether excitatory inputs onto PV neurons might be affected in <italic>Nrxn1</italic>/3<italic><sup>ex21</sup></italic>Pv mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In a series of papers, Scheiffele and colleagues have analyzed alternative splicing in neurons, with particular emphasis on the neurexin and neuroligin adhesion molecules and the STAR family of splicing factors (Chih, 2006; Ijima 2011, 2014; Schreiner, 014a, 2015; Traunmuller, 2014, 2016). Here, Nguyen et al. continue this analysis, focusing on differences in α-neurexin splicing between inhibitory (PV<sup>+</sup>) and pyramidal (CamK2<sup>+</sup>) neurons in hippocampus. Using state-of-the-art methods, including RiboTrap purification of RNA from genetically identified cell types and quantitative analysis of exon usage, they show high inclusion rate of AS4 in neurexins in inhibitory relative to pyramidal neurons. Their previous work had shown that the STAR family member Slm2 leads to AS4 exclusion, and sure enough, PV<sup>+</sup> cells have lower levels of Slm2 than pyramids. They then go on to assess the consequences of AS4 inclusion/exclusion in two ways. First they confirm and extend previous work showing that AS4 affects the relative activity of neurexins on inhibitory and excitatory synaptogenesis, as well as its binding to cerebellins. Second, they show that selective deletion of the AS4 exon from neurexins 1 and 3 in PV-expressing cells degrades performance of mice in an object recognition task, which is generally interpreted as indicating impairment in short-term memory.</p><p>Most previous studies on patterns and roles of alternative splicing have been performed at the level of brain regions, whereas direct evidence of cell type-specific isoform expression and function has been limited. In this regard, the work of Nguyen et al. is an important contribution to our understanding of molecular mechanisms that distinguish cell types and their functions. There are, however, some gaps in the analysis that deserve attention.</p><p>1) The authors emphasize splicing and bioactivities of <italic>Nrxn3</italic> in much of the text, then perform the genetic analysis only on <italic>Nrxn1/3</italic> double mutants. This leads to the obvious question of why <italic>Nrxn3</italic> single mutants weren't analyzed, or at least compared to the doubles. In fact, I think this seeming inconsistency is more a matter of style than substance. If the authors gave similar weight to the two genes in the splicing analysis, everything would be more logical. Some additional data on <italic>Nrxn1</italic> will be needed in the binding and bioactivity sections, unless it can be cited from previous papers.</p><p>2) It would be helpful to include data on pyramidal cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, for comparison with the data on interneurons.</p><p>3) The data on cerebellins is somewhat peripheral to the main point, but since the authors have chosen to include it, they need to expand it a bit. Are cerebellins believed to act in the same cells as neurexins or to be transsynaptic ligands? What does the &quot;association&quot; shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and 3F</xref> mean? The authors seem to suggest it is not direct binding. A minor related point is that the reader may be led to believe that selective cerebellin expression is going to figure in the phenotype, whereas in fact it is just an interesting observation. This should be clarified to avoid confusion and disappointment.</p><p>4) Perhaps the most important problem is with the behavioral analysis in vivo. The authors are making the case that inclusion of <italic>Nrxn1/3</italic> exon 21 in hippocampal interneurons is essential for optimal hippocampal operation. Yet their cre line excises these exons from large numbers of interneurons throughout the brain and spinal cord, as well as large populations of sensory neurons and even some non-neuronal cells. Moreover, they fail to identify any physiological or morphological defects in the interneuronal synapses that could be responsible for driving the behavioral change. Thus, I'm not sure it is justifiable to relate the behavioral results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to the neurons analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>-4.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22757.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] The results presented are convincing and are important because they directly test key aspects of the neurexin splice code hypothesis.

This new data is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] 1) The authors show a correlation between low PV neuron expression of the STAR-family RNA-binding protein Slm2, which regulates AS4 skipping, and high levels of AS4+ Nrxn isoforms in these cells. The manuscript would be strengthened by putting the causal relation between absence of Slm2 and cell type-specific exon skipping to the test. One experiment to test this would be to use AAV to misexpress Slm2 specifically in PV cells in a Cre-dependent manner and analyze whether this causes a shift towards more AS4- Nrxn isoforms.</italic> </p><p>We have now performed a similar experiment to test whether Slm2 is sufficient to drive the expression of <italic>Nrxn</italic> AS4- isoforms when ectopically expressed. We drove expression of Slm2 in cerebellar granule cells which are Slm2-negative and primarily express <italic>Nrxn</italic> AS4+ variants. Ectopic expression of Slm2 was sufficient to shift splicing towards expression of AS4- variants. This data is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>Another experiment would be to analyze Nrxn isoform repertoires in pyramidal cells of CamK2 Ribotrap mice crossed with Slm2 KO mice.</italic> </p><p>This is a good suggestion. Unfortunately, we currently did not have this genotype combined in our mouse colony. Given that this experiment requires combination of four alleles (<italic>CaMK2<sup>cre</sup></italic>, Rpl22-HA, and two Slm2 KO alleles) we were not able to perform this experiment in the allotted timeframe.</p><p><italic>2) The interaction of Cbln4 with Nrxn AS4+ shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and the functional relevance thereof, should be further clarified. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, Cbln4 shows little binding to Nrxn3α AS4+ and Cbln1 shows some binding to Nrxn3α AS4+, whereas in 3F Cbln4 shows binding to Nrxn3α AS4+ to a similar degree as Cbln1. How can the apparent difference in Cbln binding to Nrxn between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and 3F</xref> (COS cell binding vs surface retention) be explained, as both experiments measure Cbln at the surface?</italic> </p><p>We apologize for not having explained the difference between these two experiments appropriately in the original manuscript. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-D</xref> showed experiments were Neurexin was expressed in cells and Cbln proteins expressed in a separate batch of cells and secreted into the medium were added to the Neurexin-expressing cells to assess surface binding. In a second set of assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-G</xref>) we co-expressed Cbln proteins and neurexins in the same cells (as in parvalbumin-positive interneurons both proteins are co-expressed). In this second assay configuration Cbln4 shows significantly higher interaction with Nrx3αAS4+ isoforms. This may resolve some of the conflicting data that was found in the previous literature. To clarify the two assay configurations used in our study we now included cartoons for illustration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and 3E</xref>).</p><p><italic>Does binding of Cbln4 to Nrxn AS4+ affect the induction of postsynaptic inhibitory specializations by AS4+ α Nrxn? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, are Cbln1, which binds most strongly to Nrxna AS4+, and Cbln3 also expressed in PV neurons? Finally, is expression of Cbln4 in PV neurons perhaps dependent on an Nrxn AS4+ repertoire?</italic> </p><p>We have tested directly whether co-expression of Cbln4 together with <italic>Nrxn</italic>AS4+ modifies the induction of postsynaptic inhibitory specializations. We do not find a significant difference in this assay. We note that presence of endogenous Cbln4 in the neuronal culture may conceal a function for Cbln4. Loss of function studies for Cbln4 will be required to resolve this. The new results are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and 1E</xref>.</p><p>Regarding the expression of Cbln1 and 3 in PV<sup>+</sup> cells we note that both transcripts show only very low expression in hippocampus when probed with qPCR assays. The same assays show robust detection in the cerebellum (new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, we interpret our observation that Cbln1 and 3 transcripts are poorly or not at all detected in hippocampal PV<sup>+</sup> cells as an indication that they are not significantly expressed and are unlikely to play a major role in these cells. This conclusion is consistent with previous in situ hybridization data in the literature (Miura et al., European Journal of Neuroscience, 2006).</p><p><italic>3) The differential expression of Nrxn splice variants in principal vs. PV interneurons is well characterized, and the correlation of the AS4+ variant in PV cells with low Slm2 expression and high Clbn4 expression is striking. However, there is a large gap between these findings and the finding that short-term memory is impaired in the mice with PV-specific deletion of Nrxn1/3 AS4, which limits the impact of the manuscript. The link between PV neuron-specific Nrxn splicing, absence of obvious synaptic abnormalities in PV synaptic boutons and the observed behavioral impairments is not clear and raises questions. Are PV neurons known to play a role in the behavioral task assayed? Does this task also rely on PV micro-circuits outside the hippocampus?</italic></p><p>The object recognition task is known to rely on the hippocampus but also the entorhinal cortex (Cohen &amp; Stackman, Behav. Brain Res., 2015). Donato et al. (Nature, 2013) demonstrated for area CA3 of the hippocampus that PV<sup>+</sup> neurons activation decreases whereas PV-neuron inhibition increases performance of mice in the novel object recognition task.</p><p><italic>And do PV neurons in those circuits also display enriched expression of AS4+? In other words, is the preferential use of AS4+ in PV cells a global phenomenon or might it be brain region-specific?</italic> </p><p>To further explore splicing regulation at AS4 we performed RiboTrap purifications from neocortical neurons. In our splicing analysis we find that – similar to the hippocampus – CamK2-positive neurons preferentially express AS4- whereas parvalbumin-positive interneurons preferentially express AS4+ (particularly for <italic>Nrxn3</italic>). Thus, the preferential exon use reported for the hippocampus is shared in neocortical cells. This new data is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>.</p><p><italic>A further exploration of synaptic defects in PV neurons might help to bridge the current gap between PV-specific Nrxn isoform repertoires and behavioral defects. In addition to analyzing spontaneous synaptic transmission, the authors could analyze evoked inhibitory responses and look at plasticity of PV-pyramidal neuron synapses. This would strengthen the impact of their findings. I understand the current focus is on PV synaptic terminals, but the authors could also explore whether excitatory inputs onto PV neurons might be affected in Nrxn1/3<sup>ex21</sup>Pv mice.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate that identifying a synaptic alteration that might be responsible or at least correlate with the behavioral phenotype would greatly strengthen this work. We have initiated some paired recordings in the knock-out mice, however, these experiments are very time-consuming and have not yet yielded novel insights.</p><p>To explore further whether the behavioral alterations coincide with alterations in neuronal network activity in the hippocampus, we compared c-fos-immunoreactivity in control and <italic>Nrxn1/3<sup>ex21</sup></italic> conditional knock-out mice. We observed a significant increase in the density of c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells in area CA3 of the mutant mice as well as a trend towards increased density of c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells in the dentate gyrus and area CA1. This indicates that parvalbumin-neuron–specific ablation of the AS4+ insertions results in an overall increase in network activity in the hippocampus. These new results are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] 1) The authors emphasize splicing and bioactivities of Nrxn3 in much of the text, then perform the genetic analysis only on Nrxn1/3 double mutants. This leads to the obvious question of why Nrxn3 single mutants weren't analyzed, or at least compared to the doubles. In fact, I think this seeming inconsistency is more a matter of style than substance. If the authors gave similar weight to the two genes in the splicing analysis, everything would be more logical.</italic> </p><p>The reason that we did emphasize <italic>Nrxn3</italic> is that <italic>Nrxn3</italic> transcripts were most strongly enriched in the parvalbumin-RiboTrap preparations. However, clearly <italic>Nrxn1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> are also expressed in these cell preparations. We now included data on the <italic>Nrxn3</italic> single mutants, including weight and Mendelian frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), anatomical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-F</xref>) and data from mIPSC recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>). We do not detect any significant changes in these single mutants.</p><p><italic>Some additional data on Nrxn1 will be needed in the binding and bioactivity sections, unless it can be cited from previous papers.</italic> </p><p>The manuscript did contain data on the Cbln4-Nrx1 interactions. We apologize if this was not sufficiently visible in the previous submission. This previous data is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and 3I</xref>. In addition, we now included data on induction of gephyrin-positive structures by Nrx1α isoforms in presence and absence of Cbln4 (Figure 3—figure supplement 3D and 3E). For both, Nrx1α and Nrx3α we do not observe a significant alteration in the synaptogenic activity with co-expression of Cbln4.</p><p><italic>2) It would be helpful to include data on pyramidal cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, for comparison with the data on interneurons.</italic> </p><p>We have now quantified the percentage of cells marked in the CamK2<sup>Ribo</sup> mice that express Slm2. We find that Slm2 is expressed in &gt;90% of CamK2<sup>Ribo</sup>-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The data on cerebellins is somewhat peripheral to the main point, but since the authors have chosen to include it, they need to expand it a bit. Are cerebellins believed to act in the same cells as neurexins or to be transsynaptic ligands?</italic> </p><p>Our expression data demonstrates that Cbln4 is significantly enriched in PV<sup>+</sup>cells as compared to Camk2-positive cells. This means, <italic>Nrxn</italic> AS4+ isoforms and Cbln4 are co-expressed and indicates that they are transported to the PV-cell surface and then might engage postsynaptic ligands. This model is analogous to the action of <italic>Nrxn</italic>-Cbln1 complexes in the mouse cerebellum.</p><p><italic>What does the &quot;association&quot; shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and 3F</xref> mean? The authors seem to suggest it is not direct binding. A minor related point is that the reader may be led to believe that selective cerebellin expression is going to figure in the phenotype, whereas in fact it is just an interesting observation. This should be clarified to avoid confusion and disappointment.</italic> </p><p>The two assays presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are cell binding assays. While the interactions that we see are consistent with direct <italic>Nrxn</italic>-Cbln interactions we cannot completely exclude that additional co-factors contribute to the interaction. We have now clarified this in the text (subsection “AS4 + splice insertions selectively enhance the function of neurexins towards GABAergic postsynaptic components”, first paragraph). We have also clarified that it remains to be shown whether Cbln4 mediates any of the functions of <italic>Nrxn</italic> AS4+ isoforms in PV<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><p><italic>4) Perhaps the most important problem is with the behavioral analysis</italic> in vivo<italic>. The authors are making the case that inclusion of Nrxn1/3 exon 21 in hippocampal interneurons is essential for optimal hippocampal operation. Yet their cre line excises these exons from large numbers of interneurons throughout the brain and spinal cord, as well as large populations of sensory neurons and even some non-neuronal cells. Moreover, they fail to identify any physiological or morphological defects in the interneuronal synapses that could be responsible for driving the behavioral change. Thus, I'm not sure it is justifiable to relate the behavioral results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to the neurons analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>-4.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is unclear whether the conditional ablation of <italic>Nrxn1/3</italic> AS4 insertions in PV<sup>cre</sup>-positive cells modifies the behavior due to an alteration in hippocampal interneurons or other cells that are targeted by the <italic>PV<sup>cre</sup></italic> line. The object recognition test relies in part on normal hippocampal function and performance of mice in this test has been linked to the activity of PV<sup>+</sup>-cells in the hippocampus (Donato et al., Nature, 2013). To assess whether hippocampal network activity might be altered in <italic>Nrxn1/3</italic> conditional knock-out mice we measured the density of c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells in the hippocampus. We find that the density of c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells is elevated in the mutant mice as compared to littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). Thus, PV-cell-specific deletion of exon21 in <italic>Nrxn1</italic> and <italic>3</italic> indeed results in a modified hippocampal network. Whether this modification is causal for the altered behavior of the mice remains to be explored. We have now extended the Discussion regarding this limitation of our study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
