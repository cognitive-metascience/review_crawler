Here, we report our study of MAP7, a unique microtubule-associated protein that interacts with both microtubules and the motor protein kinesin-1. Structure-function analysis in rat embryonic sensory neurons shows that the kinesin-1 interacting domain in MAP7 is required for axon and branch growth but not for branch formation. Also, two unique microtubule binding sites are found in MAP7 that have distinct dissociation kinetics and are both required for branch formation. Furthermore, MAP7 recruits kinesin-1 dynamically to microtubules, leading to alterations in organelle transport behaviors, particularly pause/speed switching. As MAP7 is localized to branch sites, our results suggest a novel mechanism mediated by the dual interactions of MAP7 with microtubules and kinesin-1 in the precise control of microtubule-based transport during axon morphogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon growth and branching</kwd><kwd>kinesin-1</kwd><kwd>MAP7</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial transport</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM070862</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verhey</surname><given-names>Kristen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS062047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Le</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004897</institution-id><institution>Pennsylvania Department of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAP # 4100068728</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Le</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008513</institution-id><institution>Thomas Jefferson University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Jefferson Synaptic Biology Center</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Le</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An under-studied microtubule-associated protein is found to regulate axon growth and branching by modulating microtubule-based organelle transport through its dual interactions with microtubules and the conventional kinesin motor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal cell functions, including axon morphogenesis, require proper regulation of intracellular transport on microtubules via a variety of motor and non-motor microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armijo-Weingart and Gallo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalil and Dent, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kevenaar and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>). Motor proteins consume ATP to move membrane or protein cargos along microtubules, whereas non-motor MAPs often modulate microtubule assembly dynamics and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>). Neurons are enriched with lattice-binding non-motor MAPs that are often associated with stable microtubules in axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>). Some of these proteins can influence motor protein functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Encalada and Goldstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nirschl et al., 2017</xref>). For example, the protein tau can inhibit motor function of the conventional kinesin (kinesin-1) by dissociating it from microtubules <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dixit et al., 2008</xref>). However, the mechanism and the functional role of the interaction between motor and non-motor MAPs in neurons remain poorly understood.</p><p>We address this question by studying MAP7 (also known as ensconsin or EMAP-115), a non-motor MAP, for its unique interaction with both microtubules and theÂ kinesin-1 motor. MAP7 was identified from HeLa cell lysates based on its ability to bind microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulinski and Bossler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masson and Kreis, 1993</xref>). It is expressed in many cell types and involved in many cellular processes. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, MAP7 has been shown to regulate cell polarity of oocytes, nuclear positioning in muscle cells, organelle transport in S2 cells, and spindle morphogenesis in neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sung et al., 2008</xref>). In mice, mutations in MAP7 are linked to spermatogenesis and histocompatibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Komada et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Magnan et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, we described the first neuronal function of MAP7 in regulating axon collateral branch development of rodent sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tymanskyj et al., 2017</xref>). However, the mechanisms mediating MAP7 function in neurons are not known.</p><p>MAP7 consists of three domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): an amino (N)Â domain containingÂ the first coiled-coil (CC1) thatÂ binds microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masson and Kreis, 1993</xref>), a middle P domain that contains many potential phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masson and Kreis, 1995</xref>), and a carboxyl domain (C)Â domain containing the second coiled-coil (CC2) that interacts with kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>). Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cellsÂ have shown that deletion of the CÂ domain affects kinesin-based cell polarity, nuclear migration, organelle transport, and spindle segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sung et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting a functional role of the MAP7-kinesin interaction. <italic>In vitro</italic> data have suggested that MAP7 recruits kinesin-1 to microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monroy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sung et al., 2008</xref>), but the exact impact of this recruitment on kinesin-1-mediated transport is not completely understood. Nevertheless, the ability of MAP7 to recruit kinesin-1 to microtubules suggests an intriguing function in regulating kinesin-mediated transportÂ in neurons, especially during axon morphogenesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36374.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distinct roles of MAP7 domains in DRG axon growth and branching.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Primary structure of MAP7, indicating the phosphorylation (P) domain and the two coiled-coil (CC) regions that interact with microtubules (MT(CC1)) and kinesin-1 (Kinesin(CC2)).

Axon branching can be further divided into branch formation and branch growth. These processes involve the regulation of microtubule assembly/stability by non-motor MAPs and organelle transport by motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armijo-Weingart and Gallo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dent et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallo, 2011</xref>). For example, kinesin-1 stabilizes axonal arbors and promotes branch growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seno et al., 2016</xref>); and non-motor MAPs, including doublecortin and MAP1B, appear to suppress branch formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilimoria et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouquet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tymanskyj et al., 2012</xref>). However, how motor and non-motor MAPs coordinate to regulate these processes is largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armijo-Weingart and Gallo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallo and Letourneau, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>). The newly identified role of MAP7 in branch development of DRG axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tymanskyj et al., 2017</xref>), along with its ability to interact with both microtubules and kinesin-1, suggests a potential mechanism.</p><p>To understand the cooperation of MAP7 and kinesin-1 during axon morphogenesis, we first determined the MAP7 domains that are required for axon growth and branching using a gain-of-function approach in a well-defined ratÂ DRG neuronal cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tymanskyj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 1999</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>). We then analyzed these domains in COS cells and characterized their microtubule binding properties as well as their roles in recruiting kinesin-1 to microtubules. Finally, using an optogenetic tool that directly loads active kinesin-1 motors to a specific organelle surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</xref>), we show that MAP7 modulates kinesin-1-mediated organelle transport by increasing pause/speed switching in COS cells and in DRG axons. Our findings have thus revealed a coordinated interaction between MAP7 and kinesin-1 in regulating axon growth and branching as well as a role of the kinesin-1 recruitment in regulating organelle transport during neuronal cell morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MAP7 domains have distinct roles in axon morphogenesis</title><p>To understand the contribution of MAP7 domains in axon morphogenesis, we used E14 rat DRG neurons that lack endogenous MAP7 expression at this time point and which exhibit a simple morphology when grown in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tymanskyj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 1999</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>)Â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Expression of an EGFP fusion protein of full length (FL) MAP7 (MAP7-FL-EGFP) resulted in a threefold increase in the number of branches produced per cell and a fivefold increase in the number of interstitial branches, defined as those arising from 90% of the axon length proximal to the soma, whenÂ compared with the EGFP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, however, comparison of the axon length also revealed that MAP7-FL-EGFP-expressing axons were only half the length of EGFP control axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest that MAP7 has opposite effects on axon growth and branch formation.</p><p>Using this gain-of-function approach, we tested the requirement of the C-terminal kinesin interacting domain in axon growth and branching. Expression of a ÎC fragment lacking the CÂ domain induced a similar number of branches to the MAP7-FL protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the kinesin interaction is not required for branch formation per se. However, the ÎC fragment did not significantly alter the length of the main axon when compared withÂ the EGFP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Further analysis revealed that ÎC-expressing neurons also generated shorter branches than those expressing the MAP7-FL protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), supporting the requirement of the kinesin interacting domain for branch growth.</p><p>We next tested the requirement forÂ the NÂ domain that has been shown to bind microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masson and Kreis, 1993</xref>). Unlike the MAP7-FL protein, expression of an EGFP fusion of the N-deletion fragment (ÎN) did not increase the number of branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the N domain is required for branch formation. Interestingly, however, ÎN-expressing neurons have significantly longer axons compared with neurons expressing the EGFP control orÂ other MAP7 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>), indicating that both P and C domains combined are sufficient to promote axon growth. To test the requirement of the P domain, we generated an EGFP fusion of MAP7 with the PÂ domain deleted. Expression of this construct (âP-EGFP) did not increase the number of branches per cell, nor did it increase the length of main axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâD</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This result suggests that the PÂ domain is required for both branch formation and axon growth. Finally, we tested each domain individually and found that none of the domains alone (N, P, or C) were sufficient to promote branch formation or main axon growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that MAP7 domains play distinct roles in three intimatelyÂ related processes during axon morphogenesis: axonal growth requires both P and C domains, branch formation requires both N and P domains, and branch growth requires all three domains.</p><p>We also examined the requirement of different domains for MAP7 localization, as antibody staining showed that the endogenous MAP7 was localized to branch sites in E17 rat DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) when the expression reached its peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tymanskyj et al., 2017</xref>). We quantified the number of branches containing MAP7 and found that 65% of branches have endogenousÂ MAP7 concentrated at the base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with this, MAP7-FL-EGFP expressed in E14 DRG neurons was also localized to 57% ofÂ branch sites butÂ excluded from the nerve terminals, in contrast to the uniform localization of the EGFP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). This can be seen by fluorescenceÂ line scan along the length of the axon, which reveals decreasing tubulin signals from the cell body to the axon terminal but a peak ofÂ MAP7 signals coinciding with a branch in the middle of anÂ axon (asterisk; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Like MAP7-FL, the ÎC fragment also accumulated at branch points along the axon and avoided nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that the kinesin interaction is not required for this localization. In contrast, deletion of either N or PÂ domain (ÎN and âP) led to the even distribution of EGFP fusion proteins throughout the axon and expanded localization to the axon terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Line scans showed anÂ even distribution of the ÎN-EGFP signal, in contrast to the gradedÂ tubulin signal thatÂ tapered off at the distal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, eachÂ single MAP7 domain alone (N, P, and C) behaved like the EGFP control with uniform localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> for N, and data not shown for P and C).

COS cells were co-transfected with EGFP fusion proteins of MAP7-FL or MAP7 fragments along with tubulin-mCherry to identify single intact microtubules (data not shown) for FRAP analysis. A previous study in epithelial-like TC-7 cells has shown that MAP7 binds microtubules dynamically with aÂ ~Â 4 s recovery half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulinski et al., 2001</xref>). Similarly, the fluorescent recovery of the N-EGFP fragment occurred with a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 2.6 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), which is equivalent to a dissociation rate constant (<italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>) of 0.27Â Â±Â 0.06 s<sup>â1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), suggesting that N-EGFP dissociates rapidly afterÂ binding to microtubules. Interestingly, however, MAP7-FL-EGFP appears to have &gt;43Ã tighter microtubule binding, with a longer half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 112.6 s) of fluorescence recovery and a slower <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> (0.0062Â Â±Â 0.0020 s<sup>â1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4AâC</xref>). Also, MAP7-FL remained bound to microtubules with a total recovery of 38 Â± 7%, whereas the N fragment showed a large mobile fraction with a total recovery of 74 Â± 3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The difference in binding affinity appears to be contributed by the P domain, as the ÎC-EGFP fusion also has a longer half-life of recovery (t<sub>1/2</sub>= 59.0 s) and lower <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> (0.012Â Â±Â 0.003 s<sup>â1</sup>) than the N fragment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with this, the P-EGFP fusion protein has a half-life of recovery (t<sub>1/2</sub> of 39.6 s) and a mobile fraction (92 Â± 9% total recovery), whichÂ are similar to those of the ÎC fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C,D</xref>). The kinetic difference between N and P fragments is further confirmed by the two deletion mutants: âP-EGFP and âN-EGFP, which exhibited a sixfold difference in recovery half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) and <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B,C</xref>), despite having similar amounts of mobile fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, MAP7 has two unique microtubule binding domains with distinct dissociation kinetics.

As MAP7 enhances kinesin-1 recruitment to microtubules, we next asked how this interaction affects organelle transport in cells. To address this question, we employed a recently developed optogenetic approach to transiently recruit kinesin-1 motors to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</xref>). COS cells were transfected to express two fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>): a 560-PDZ fusion protein that has the active motor KIF5C(1-560)-mNeGr fused to a PDZ peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strickland et al., 2012</xref>), and a TOM-LOV fusion that has a mitochondrial targeting sequence (TOM) fused to mCherry and a LOV domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</xref>). Blue light (488 nm) stimulation causes a conformational change in the LOV domain, which results in heterodimerization of the LOV domain and the PDZ peptide, thereby loading the active kinesin motor (560-PDZ) to the mitochondrial surface via TOM-LOV. The resulting movement of KIF5C(1-560)-loaded mitochondria provides a convenient readout for theÂ active kinesin-1 motor-mediated transport. As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</xref>), TOM-LOV mitochondria were largely immobile and localized to the perinuclear region of COS cells, but were transported from the cell center to the cell periphery upon blue light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). This movement depends on the expression of the engineered kinesin-1 motor fusion protein, as mitochondria showed little or no movement when 560-PDZ was replaced with theÂ maxGFP controlÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>To assess how MAP7 affects kinesin-mediated transport, 560-PDZ and TOM-LOV were expressed in COS cells along with MAP7-FL-iRFP or iRFP as a control. Upon light activation, the TOM-LOV-labeled mitochondria moved from the central region to the periphery over a 30-min time period, irrespective of MAP7-FL-iRFP or iRFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that MAP7 does not affect overall mitochondrial movement. We therefore analyzed the behavior of individual mitochondria using fast acquisition rates (1â2 frames per second) immediately after blue light stimulation. During the 2-min imaging window, the majority of TOM-LOV-labeled mitochondria remained in the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), but some displayed clear directional movements to the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We analyzed their movement by projecting the time-lapse movie with each frame color-coded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and using the trajectories to generate kymographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

We found that MAP7 decreased the speedÂ by 29% (0.50Â Â±Â 0.06 Âµm/s versus 0.70Â Â±Â 0.07 Âµm/s in controls cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Next, we analyzed the pause behavior and found that MAP7-FL-iRFP did not significantly alter the pause time (10.4Â Â±Â 0.8 s versus 11.9Â Â±Â 1.0 s in control cells). Interestingly, however, there was a large increase (36%) in the pause frequency (4.8Â Â±Â 0.6 events/min versus 3.1Â Â±Â 0.3 events/min in control cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The change in pausing behaviors prompted us to examine the moving mitochondria trajectories more carefully. In the color-coded projection containing the space-time information, we found that motile mitochondria in control cells usually resumed relativelyÂ straightÂ movement after a pause (hashes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2C</xref>), resulting in linear or slightly curved trajectories. However, motile mitochondria in MAP7-expressing cells often resumed movement after pauses with sharp turns (with angles larger than 90<sup>o</sup> along the trajectory) (asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). We quantified this behavior and found that MAP7-expressing cells had 1.6-fold more sharp turns (2.44Â Â±Â 0.28 events/min) than control expressing cellsÂ (1.39Â Â±Â 0.13 events/min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Such sharp directional changes are unlikely to occur along single microtubules, but rather areÂ likely toÂ result from TOM-LOV mitochondria switching tracks onto neighboring or crossing microtubules.</p><p>To understand whether these changes depend on the interaction between MAP7 and kinesin-1, we examined MAP7-ÎC-iRFP that does not bind KIF5C(1-560) and found that it had little effect on the speed (0.64Â Â±Â 0.06 Âµm/s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). It also showed no statistical difference in the pause frequency (2.5Â Â±Â 0.5 events/min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) or the sharp turn frequency (0.98Â Â±Â 0.19 events/min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) when compared with those of the control. These results indicate that the effects of MAP7 on active kinesin-1-mediated mitochondrial movement are dependent on the interaction between the CÂ domain and kinesin-1.</p><p>To test whether these observations depend only on kinesin-1 or also on the organelle being transported, we used the same approach to target peroxisomes with a fusion protein (PEX-LOV) containing a peroxisome targeting sequence (PEX) attached to mCherry and the LOV domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</xref>). Like mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</xref>), peroxisomes are relatively immobile in COS cells, as expression of the PEX-LOV alone without 560-PDZ showed no movement (data not shown). However, light activation of COS cells co-expressing 560-PDZ and PEX-LOV led to movement of PEX-LOV-labeled peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We thus analyzed the same parameters described above and found that the effect of MAP7 on pausing is similar to thatÂ found with mitochondria. MAP7-FL-iRFP had no significant change in the run speeds (0.26Â Â±Â 0.02 Âµm/s versus 0.31Â Â±Â 0.01 Âµm/s in controls, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), but increased the pause frequency by 60% (5.7Â Â±Â 0.7 events/min versus 3.5Â Â±Â 0.5 events/min in controls, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>) as well as the sharp turn frequency by 61% (2.54Â Â±Â 0.36 times/min versus 1.56Â Â±Â 0.19 times/min in controls, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Also, there was no significant change in the pause duration (13.5Â Â±Â 2.04 times/min versus 12.9Â Â±Â 1.29 times/min in control cells). As aÂ comparison, MAP7-ÎC-iRFP showed no significant change in velocity (0.30Â Â±Â 0.01 Âµm/s), pause frequency (2.53Â Â±Â 0.5 events/min), or sharp turn frequency (0.91Â Â±Â 0.19 times/min)Â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>).

Unlike COS cells, TOM-LOV-labeled mitochondria in axons rarely pause, but instead, they undergo changes of speeds during each run segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>, arrows in green/yellow lines). We thus calculated the frequency of speed switching and compared itÂ with the pausing behavior seen in COS cells. Upon light activation, MAP7 expression increased theÂ speedÂ change frequency for 560-PDZ-driven mitochondria by 2.1-fold, from 1.28Â Â±Â 0.19 events/min in controls to 2.3Â Â±Â 0.33 events/min in MAP7-FL-iRFP axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This effect depends on the MAP7-kinesin-1 interaction, as there was no impact with MAP7-ÎC-iRFP on the speed change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>; 0.77Â Â±Â 0.21 events/min). The same effect was also found for 560-PDZ-driven peroxisomes, as co-expression of PEX-LOV and MAP7-FL-iRFP significantly increased the number of speed change events when compared withÂ both theÂ iRFPÂ control and MAP7-ÎC-iRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; control: 0.8Â Â±Â 0.17 events/min; MAP7-FL: 2.12Â Â±Â 0.24 events/min; MAP7-ÎC: 1.56Â Â±Â 0.38 events/min). These results suggest that the effect of MAP7 on speed switching is not limited by the type of organelle once they are loaded with the active kinesin-1 motor.</p><p>To determine whether the effect applies to endogenous kinesin-1, we analyzed MitoTracker-labeled mitochondria movement. Again, we found an increase in speed change events elicited by MAP7-FL-EGFP but not by MAP7-ÎC-EGFP in E17 DRG axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1B</xref>; control: 0.98Â Â±Â 0.13 events/min; MAP7-FL: 2.04Â Â±Â 0.22 events/min; MAP7-ÎC: 0.77Â Â±Â 0.20 events/min), suggesting that endogenous kinesin-1 behaved similarly to the active KIF560 motor. This effect is consistent with results from the control experiments done with TOM-LOV-labeled mitochondria without the active motor KIF-PDZ. Here, MAP7 increased movement switching by twofold, from 1.26Â Â±Â 0.33 events/min in control axons to 3.12Â Â±Â 0.36 events/min, whereas MAP7-ÎC showed no change (0.64Â Â±Â 0.23 events/min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, we also examined MitoTracker-labeled mitochondria in E14 DRG axons, which do not have endogenous MAP7 expression. Again, overexpressionÂ ofÂ MAP7-FL-EGFP but not MAP7-ÎC-EGFP increased the speed switching frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1C</xref>, control: 1.13Â Â±Â 0.13 events/min; MAP7-FL: 1.54Â Â±Â 0.16 events/min; MAP7-ÎC: 1.11Â Â±Â 0.23 events/min), confirming the role of MAP7-FL. Taken together, analysis in DRG axons suggests that MAP7 influences speed switching in kinesin-1-mediated organelle movement. This function depends on the kinesin-1 interaction and likely reflects track switching seen in COS cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ability of MAP7 to interact with both microtubules and kinesin suggests unique regulatory mechanisms for MAP7 function in diverse neuronal processes. Our detailed domain analysis of MAP7 in DRG neurons has revealed distinct roles of MAP7 domains in regulating axon growth and branching. Analysis of MAP7 interactions with microtubules and kinesin-1 has also mapped out the role of each domain in these interactions and suggested a potential function of MAP7 in regulating kinesin-1-mediated organelle transport.

Both N and P domains are responsible for branch formation, whereas the C-terminal kinesin-interacting domain is important for promoting axon and branch growth. As both N and P domains bind microtubules and are both required for localizing MAP7 proteins to branch sites, MAP7 could potentially regulate microtubule organization seen at the branch sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ketschek et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the newly identified microtubule binding site in the PÂ domain (see discussion below) is sufficient to promote axon growth in cooperation with the kinesin-interacting CÂ domain, as demonstrated by the difference in axon growth between ÎP-EGFP and ÎN-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

AsÂ both ÎN and ÎP can recruit kinesin-1 to microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), this result suggests that a tight microtubuleÂ bindingÂ site, along with the potential phosphorylation regulation in the P domain, is required for the kinesin-1 function in axon growth.</p><p>Although the kinesin interaction mediated by the C domain is dispensable for branch formation, it is required for branch growth, as demonstrated by shorter branches in neurons expressing the ÎC fragment that lacks the CÂ domain when compared withÂ MAP7-FL-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The fact that MAP7-FL-expressing neurons have shorter main axons than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), suggests that branch growth mediated by the CÂ domain can compete for main axon growth. In the absence of branch formation, the CÂ domain is required for the main axon growth, as shown by the ability of the ÎN fragment but not the PÂ domain aloneÂ to promote axon elongation. These results not only support the role of the kinesin-interacting domain in axon and branch growth but also reveal how MAP7 localization affects its function. Therefore, our domain analysis has revealed distinct roles of MAP7 interactions with microtubules and kinesin-1 in different steps of axon morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The PÂ domain of MAP7 harbors a second microtubule binding site critical to tight MAP7-microtubule interaction</title><p>Detailed domain analysis of MAP7 binding to microtubules in COS cells has revealed several features of this interaction. First, previous studies based on deletion analysis have suggested that microtubule binding is mediated by CC1 in the N domain, which contains 13 positively charged residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faire et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masson and Kreis, 1993</xref>). Using FRAP analysis, we were able to demonstrate that this domain binds to microtubules transiently with fast dissociation kinetics. Our analysis also suggests that MAP7 is composed of two microtubule binding domains, with the second microtubule binding site residing in the P domain, as deletion of the N domain does not prevent microtubule binding butÂ the P domain itself is sufficient to bind microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The P domain contains 26 positively charged residues, suggesting that it might bind microtubules directly. Indeed, the <italic>in vitro</italic> co-sedimentation analysis with purified proteins supports this propertyÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the FRAP analysis has shown that MAP7 binds microtubules in COS cells with slow dissociation kinetics, which is manifested by aÂ low total recovery andÂ a long recovery half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, MAP7 has a more stable microtubule binding property than tau (t<sub>1/2</sub> =~4 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sayas et al., 2015</xref>). The slow MAP7 dissociation kinetics areÂ similar to those obtained recently using a single molecule assay <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monroy et al., 2018</xref>) but differ from an earlier study in TC-7 cells, which shows a shorter half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulinski et al., 2001</xref>). The difference may beÂ aÂ result of the different cell lines or MAP7 fusions used. It is interesting to note that our analysis of the N domain did show faster microtubule dissociation kinetics, similar to the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulinski et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the P domain binds microtubules more tightly than the N domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) andÂ is likely toÂ contribute to the kinetic property of the MAP7-FL protein. In addition, deletion of either the N or the P domain alters the binding kinetics, suggesting that both domains cooperate to regulate microtubule structures that are critical to branch formation. As MAP7 is phosphorylated during mitosis, likely at many potential sites within the P domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masson and Kreis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramkumar et al., 2018</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mchedlishvili et al., 2018</xref>), this newly found microtubule binding site could be a target for regulation in different cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>MAP7 enhances kinesin-1 recruitment to microtubules</title><p>We have demonstrated for the first time that co-expression of MAP7 and kinesin-1 leads to recruitment of kinesin-1 to microtubules in COS cells. This is consistent with the previous demonstration of their functional and physical interactions in several systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sung et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, we not onlyÂ confirmed that this interaction is mediated by the C domain but also demonstrated that it requires at least one microtubule binding site in either the N or P domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Domain analysis of kinesin-1 suggests that the stalk1 domain of KIF5C is both necessary and sufficient for this interaction, consistent with the previous co-immunoprecipitation data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, FRAP analysis reveals that the interaction between the stalk1 domain and MAP7 is transient, with a half-life of 5 s, which could support a controlling mechanism of kinesin-mediated motility discussed below. Interestingly, the kinesin-1 motor head that binds microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner can influence the kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting thatÂ other regions of the kinesin-1 molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) may affect its interaction with MAP7 on microtubules. In fact, the FL kinesin-1 molecule is normally folded with the motor domain inhibited by a C-terminal inhibitory peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hackney and Stock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Verhey and Hammond, 2009</xref>), and the tail region of kinesin-1 contains a sequence that can bind microtubules directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hackney and Stock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seeger and Rice, 2010</xref>). SinceÂ the FL kinesin-1 molecule can be alsoÂ recruited to microtubules by MAP7 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sung et al., 2008</xref>), microtubule-bound MAP7 mayÂ therefore unfoldÂ kinesin-1 and stimulate motility, as suggested by the recent study of <italic>Drosophila</italic> MAP7 in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlan et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>MAP7 regulates kinesin-1-mediated organelle transport by modulating pause/speed switching</title><p>What is the functional role of the kinesin-1 recruitment to microtubules by MAP7? Our analysis provides clues for a direct impact of MAP7 on kinesin-1-mediated transport. One effect of MAP7 expression seemed to decrease the run speed of 560-PDZ-bound mitochondria in both COS and neurons. However, when comparing the MAP7 effect on mitochondria driven by endogenous kinesin-1 or 560-PDZ-bound peroxisomes, we did not see a similar change in speed. The different effects may reflect the number of motors present on the organelleÂ surface under each condition and/or additional roles of the kinesin-1 stalk2 and tail domains in the endogenous FL kinesin-1 function. In neurons, this speed differenceÂ is independent of the CÂ domain of MAP7, suggesting that binding of MAP7 to microtubules, possibly becauseÂ of a crowding effect, may be responsible for reducing the speed of kinesin-1-mediated transport along microtubules.</p><p>More interestingly, one consistent effect of MAP7 in COS cells and DRG axons is the increase in pause/speed switching during organelle movement. This was found for optogeneticallyÂ activated mitochondrial or peroxisome movement in both COS cells and axons as well as for the endogenous mitochondrial movement in axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). In COS cells, we noticed that this switching correlated with mitochondria changing microtubule tracks, as demonstrated by prominent sharp turns in MAP7 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This behavior is similar to early <italic>in vitro</italic> observations for other kinesin molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ross et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schroeder et al., 2012</xref>) and suggests that MAP7 bound to neighboring microtubules may enhance kinesin-bound cargos switching to those microtubules. In fact, <italic>in vitro</italic> kinesin-1 motors often disengage from microtubules completely when encountering multiple microtubules, but on occasions can engage to a different microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ross et al., 2008</xref>). It is likely that MAP7-bound microtubules, with anÂ increased capability to recruit kinesin-1, can increase the likelihood of kinesin-1 binding to neighboring microtubules and thus redirect the kinesin-bound cargos. As microtubules are highly bundled in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mikhaylova et al., 2015</xref>), the speed switching elicited by MAP7 in axons observed here may be reminiscent to theÂ track change in COS cells and suggests a potential MAP7-mediated mechanism for ensuring efficient kinesin-1 engagement and transport within the axon.</p><p>Our data show that unlike other MAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Encalada and Goldstein, 2014</xref>), MAP7 influences kinesin-1 motility by enhancing motor recruitment to microtubules and increasing the frequency of pausing or speed switching. Although our analysis centers mainly on mitochondria, which normally uses kinesin-1 for movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glater et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hurd and Saxton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin and Sheng, 2015</xref>), the same effects may apply to other kinesin-1-mediated transport as suggested by our study of peroxisomes. Thus, we proposeÂ a mechanism by which microtubule-bound MAP7 promotes axon or branch growth by recruiting kinesin-1 to microtubules and modulating organelle transport. When MAP7 isÂ concentrated at branch junctions via interactions of its N and P domains with microtubules, it will slow down or pause moving organellesÂ at that junction and facilitate track switching, thereby diverting organellesÂ into branches. This effect leads to a reduction of organelle transport into the main axon and shifts the balance from main axon growth to branch growth. Consistent with this possibility, mitochondria are often associated with branch sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armijo-Weingart and Gallo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Courchet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>). In the absence of branch formation, however, microtubule-bound MAP7 recruits kinesin-1 and drives organelle movement in the main axon such as seen with ÎN, thereby increasing axonal length. Thus, the presence of MAP7 at branch sites and its ability to recruit kinesin-1 to microtubules and subsequentlyÂ to switch organelles to different microtubules are essential to MAP7 function in regulating branch formation. Such functions of MAP7 mediated by its dualÂ interactions with microtubules and kinesin-1 may provide a mechanism for other morphogenetic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sung et al., 2008</xref>)

Tubulin-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>) was a gift from Roger Tsien (UCSD).</p><p>The KIF5C(1-560)-mNeGr construct hasÂ beenÂ described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Norris et al., 2015</xref>). mNeGr fusion proteins of other kinesin-1 domain constructs ((1-335) and (335-560)) were created first by PCR from KIF5C-mCit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Norris et al., 2015</xref>). After sequence confirmation, the PCR products were subcloned into the EcoRIÂ andÂ KpnI sites by swapping with KIF5C(1-560) in the KIF5C(1-560)-mNeGr backbone. These mNeGr fusion constructs were later subcloned into a pCAGGS-ES vector using the EcoRIÂ andÂ NotI sites.</p><p>The TOM-mCherry-LOVpep (TOM-LOV) and PEX-mCherry-LOVpep (PEX-LOV) constructs (gift from Lukas Kapitein) used in the optogenetic experiments haveÂ beenÂ described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</xref>). The KIF5C(1-560)-PDZ-mNeGr (560-PDZ) construct was created by subcloning the PDZ peptide behind mNeGr at the BsrGI and Not1 sites in the pCAGGS-KIF5C(1-560)-mNeGr construct. The PDZ peptide was cut from the KIF-PDZ plasmid (gift from Lukas Kapitein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>COS-7 cells (originally from the lab stock of the Tessier-Lavinge lab) were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). They were authenticated based on morphology, and DNA staining revealed no mycoplasma contamination.</p><p>Timed pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River and used in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and the approved IACUC protocol (#01560) of the Thomas Jefferson University.

Briefly, DRGs were dissected out from E14 or E17 rat embryos, washed once in HBSS, and incubated at 37Â°C with 0.25% trypsin for 10â15 min. Trypsin-treated DRGs were resuspended in L15 medium plus 10% horse serum and then mechanically triturated with a fire-polished glass pipette. Dissociated rat DRG neurons (â¼7.5Â ÃÂ 10<sup>5</sup> cells) were transfected with various MAP7 constructs by nucleofection (Lonza) using reagent P3 and the CU-133 program. Neurons were then plated at â¼30,000 cells on 18 mm glass coverslips coated with 10 Î¼g/mL poly-<sc>d</sc>-lysine and 10 Î¼g/mL laminin and cultured in F12 medium (with the N3 supplement, 40 mMÂ glucose, and 25 ng/mL NGF). Cells were fixed in 4% PFA/PBS after 24 hr for immunocytochemical analysis.</p><p>EGFP fusion proteins of MAP7 fragments expressed in DRG neurons were visualized directly by the fluorescence of the EGFP tag. Neuronal morphology was visualized by antibody staining of neurofilament. For antibody labeling, PFA-fixed neurons were blocked in PBS plus 5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton (PGT) for 1 hr and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PGT for at least 1 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4Â°C. After washing, they were incubated with Cy3, Alexa 488, or Alexa560-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch or Invitrogen) diluted in PGT for 1 hr at room temperature. Digital images were taken on Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with a 20Ã or 40Ã objective by a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal system using 488, 561, or 642 nm laser excitation and an sCMOS camera (Zyla, Andor). Images are shown as 2D projections and inverted in gray-scale.</p><p>Based on the digital confocal images, the following parameters were analyzed in ImageJ: main axon length, number of branches per cell, and branch length. The main axon was defined as the longest axonÂ from the cell body to the growth cone.Â Branches longer than 10 Î¼m were traced and counted. They were divided into two groupsÂ based on the length of the axon. Branches emerging from the distal 10% of the axon were defined as terminal branches and those emerging from the other 90% of the axon were termed interstitial branches and considered asÂ collateral branches in the analysis. For branch length comparison, branches longer than 10 um were measured and included in the analysis. Each condition was repeatedmore than three timeswith &gt;20 neurons analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Live cell imaging and FRAP analysis of MAP7 and kinesin in COS cells</title><p>COS cells were transfected using a TransMax system (gift from Yun Yao) with various constructs after plating on glass bottom dishes (MatTek). After overnight culture, dishes were mounted on a heated humidified chamber (OkoLab) equilibrated to 37Â°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> on an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200). Fluorescent images were acquired from live cells using a 100Ã apochromatic objective (NAÂ =Â 1.4) and an EMCCD camera (Cascade 512, Photometrics) or an sCMOS camera on a spinning disk system (described above).</p><p>For FRAP analysis of MAP7, we selected COS cells expressing low levels of C-terminal tagged EGFP fusion proteins and regions containing single microtubules. For FRAP analysis of kinesin, we selected regions of COS cells that contain microtubule bundles bound with MAP7-FL-iRFP and KIF5C(1-560)-mNeGr. Photobleaching was achieved by 5â10Ã pulses of 435 nm pulse laser using an Andor MicroPoint system. EGFP, mNeGr, and iRFP images were acquired by a 100Ã objective and an EMCCD camera described above for 1â5 mins at 1â5 s intervals. Cells were cotransfected with a tubulin-mCherry vector to monitor any damage to microtubules from bleaching.</p><p>To analyze fluorescent changes in the bleached region, the fluorescent signal was measured from a box placed in three regions: bleached, unbleached, and background. The signal in the background region was first subtracted from that in the bleached and unbleached regions of the same frame. The background subtracted signal in the bleached region was then normalized to the signal in the unbleached region at each time point. The percentage of fluorescence recovery was then determined by calculating the ratio of fluorescence change after bleaching to the fluorescence difference before and after photobleaching using the recovery equation (<italic>F<sub>t</sub> â F<sub>0</sub></italic>)/(<italic>F</italic><sub>pre</sub>-<italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic>), where <italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic> is the fluorescence measured at each time point, <italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic> is the fluorescence signal immediately after photobleaching at <italic>t</italic>Â =Â 0 s and <italic>F</italic><sub>pre</sub> is the fluorescence intensity before photobleaching. The recovery (excluding the number from the out-of-focus frames becauseÂ of microtubule movement) was plotted and then fit by least square nonlinear regression in Prism (GraphPad) based on the inverse of an exponential decay model with the initialÂ recovery set to 0 at <italic>t</italic>Â =Â 0 and theÂ maximumÂ recovery set at 100. The kinetic parameters (t<sub>1/2</sub> and <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>) and the total recovery were obtained from the fit, assuming a diffusion-uncoupled binding reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Recombinant protein purification and co-sedimentation assay</title><p>To obtain recombinant P-mCherry or C-mCherry proteins, 120 mL cultures of HEK 293F cells transfected with mCherry-His fusion DNA (in the pCAGGS-mCherry-His vector) were spun down at 5000 rpm, 4Â°C, for 10 min. Pellets were re-suspended in 2 mL modified RIPA buffer (mRIPA, 10 mM Tris-HCL, pH 8, 140 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), plus EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1 mM PMSF on ice. Cell suspensions were lysed in a dounce homogenizer and spun for 30 min, 14 k rpm, at 4Â°C. The supernatant fraction was filtered through a 0.25 Âµm syringe filter and then incubated with 0.4 mL of 50% nickel bead slurry (BioRad) and allowed to mix end-over-end at 4Â°C for 2.5 hr. Lysate-bead mixture was added to a 10 mL chromatography column, and the flow through was allowed to rebind 3Ã. Beads were then washed with 100 mL of wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM Ã-mercaptoethanol (ÃME), 5 mM imidazole) to remove contaminants and prevent non-specific binding. Bound MAP7 fusion proteins were eluted off beads by incubating the beads with 0.2 mL elution buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 175 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1Ã Protease inhibitor, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM ÃME, 500 mM imidazole) for 5 min before collection. Eluted proteins were dialyzed overnight in 800 mL BRB80 (80 mM PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 mM ÃME) at 4Â°C and 10% glycerol was added. Finally, purified proteins were aliquoted and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using BSA as a standard.</p><p>To obtain recombinant GST-tagged MAP7-N proteins, 1 L cultures of BL-21 <italic>E. coli</italic> transformed with the GST-MAP7-N expression plasmid (in pGEX-6P1-FLAG) were incubated in a 37Â°C degree shaker and induced with 0.1 mM IPTG when ODÂ atÂ 595Â nm reached 0.6. Cultures were then allowed to shake overnight at 18Â°C before being pelleted at 4000 RPM, 15 min, at 4Â°C. Bacterial pellets were re-suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pHÂ =Â 8, 250 mM NaCl, 1% Tween-20, 5 mM ÃME, 20% NDSB-201, 5 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) and then sonicated four times for 20â30 s. Sonicated lysates were pelleted down at 15,000 rpm, 30 min, at 4Â°C. The supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.2-Âµm syringe filter. Glutathione beads were washed and equilibrated in lysis buffer. They were mixed with the filtered supernatants and allowed to incubate for 3 hr at 4Â°C on a plate shaker. Bead-protein mixes were then added to 10 mL chromatography columns. The flow through was collected and then re-bound to the beads for four times. Protein-bound beads were then washed with 1 L of wash buffer (25 mM Tris pHÂ =Â 8, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.2 mM PMSF) and 150 mL of wash buffer without Tween-20. Finally, proteins were incubated for 30 min with elution buffer (wash buffer plus 20 mM reduced glutathione, minus Tween) and allowed to shake for 30 min before eluent collection. Purified proteins were dialyzed into BRB80 before beingÂ snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>For the co-sedimentation assay, freshly thawed bovine tubulin was added to BRB80 supplemented with fresh DTT (1 mM) and GTP (1 mM) (BRB80D/G) in a centrifuge tube to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. The tubulin mixture was spun at 60,000 RPM at 4Â°C for 15 min in a TLA-100.1 rotor to remove tubulin aggregates. The supernatant was collected and incubated for 5 min in a 37Â°C water bath before the addition of 0.2, 2, and 20 ÂµM of taxol (Sigma) in DMSO sequentially with 5-min incubations between each addition of taxol. Polymerized MT seeds were then spun through an equal volume of cushion consisting of 60% glycerol in BRB80D/G/T (BRB80D/GÂ +Â 20 ÂµM Taxol) at 60,000 RPM, 15 min, and 34Â°C to remove un-polymerized tubulin. Freshly thawed recombinant MAP7-fragment proteins were supplemented with 1 mM DTT, 1 mM GTP, 1Ã protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and 20 ÂµM taxol and then spun at 60,000 RPM, 4Â°C, 15 min in a TLA100.1 to remove aggregates. Supernatants were collected and then adjusted in BRB80D/G/T to 2â20 ÂµM. For microtubule binding, the MAP7 proteins were used to re-suspend microtubule pellets prepared above for microtubule binding. All samples were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 min, and then pelleted down at 35,000 RPM, 15 min, at 22Â°C. To analyze bound proteins, the first half volume of supernatant was collected and diluted in 2Ã sample buffer while the remaining supernatant was removed carefully without touching the pellet. Pellets were then incubated with equal volumes of sample buffer diluted with BRB80 plus 1 mM DTT on ice for 30 min. The pellet was then mechanically disrupted by scraping with tweezers before being re-suspended through repeated pipetting. For no-microtubule controls, MAP7 proteins were incubated alone and then spun the same way as above. For pre-binding control, MAP7 proteins were directly diluted in sample buffer. For protein analysis, small aliquots of each condition (pre, supernatant, and pellet) with equal dilution (1:10 in 1Ã sample buffer for western, and undiluted for Coomassie staining) were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Western blots were probed using rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma, 1:2500), rabbit anti-RFP antibody (Rockland, 1:2500), or chick anti-GFP antibody (Aves Lab, 1:2000) in 4% milk in PBS-T (PBS and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 hr. After washing three times (5 min each) in PBS-T, blots were incubated in HRP conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2500) or anti-chick IgY (1:2000) for 1 hr, washed for 5 Ã 5 min in PBS-T, and then incubated with Clarity ECL reagent (BioRad) for 5 min before being exposed for 1 min to HyBlot ES X-ray film (Denville Scientific) or ChemiDoc Imaging System (BioRad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of kinesin-mediated motility in live COS cells and DRG axons</title><p>COS cells or DRG neurons cultured on glass bottom dishes (MatTek) were triple transfected with 560-PDZ, TOM-LOV or PEX-LOV, and iRFP-N3, MAP7-FL-iRFP, or MAP7-ÎC-iRFP. In control experiments, maxGFP (Lonza) was used instead of 560-PDZ. After overnight culture in the dark, dishes were mounted on a heated humidified chamber on an inverted microscope and imaged at 100Ã as described above. To activate heterodimerization, cells were exposed to blue light via 488 nm laser for 5 s and then immediately imaged. For long-term imaging, images were acquired for all three channels (488, 561, 647 nm) every minute for 30 min. For short-term imaging, images were acquired every 1â2 s for 2 min for mitochondria/peroxisome only (mCherry) or every 0.5â1 s for 2 min for both mitochondria and MAP7(mCherry and iRFP). For single channel mitochondrion imaging, MAP7-FL-iRFP and 560-LOV images were also acquired at the first and last time points. To avoid the microtubule bundles sometimes formed with high MAP7 expression, we chose cells expressing low level MAP7-FL-iRFP for the subsequent analysis on single microtubules.</p><p>For experiments examining endogenous mitochondria behavior, MitoTracker Red (5 nM) was added to the neuronal culture (transfected withÂ EGFP,Â MAP7-FL-EGFP, or MAP7-ÎC-EGFP) for 10 min, subsequently washed twice with warm media and left to recover for 30 min before imaging. Images were acquired every 2 s for 2 min.</p><p>To analyze mitochondrial/peroxisome movement behavior, time-lapse images of live cells were first projected and pseudo-colored using the Temporal Color-Code plugin to reveal motile trajectories. Segmented lines were then drawn over the trajectories to generate kymographs in Fiji. Tracks on the kymograph are then analyzed by drawing with the segmented line tool. Each track can be divided into multiple segments. A segment is defined as a portion of a track with a constant speed. It is bound by changes in speed or pauses. Run time (t) and run length (l) were obtained from each segment, and used to calculate the run speed (s) using the formula sÂ =Â l/t. Pauses were defined as any movement slower than 0.1 Âµm/s. Pause or speed switches were defined as any change in speed along a single track. Mitochondria/peroxisomes which showed no movement in the time window were excluded from run analysis. In COS cells, the directional change was mainly identified in the trajectories within the cell and defined as abrupt changes in directionalityÂ withÂ angles more than 90Â°..</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All measurements are presented as meanÂ Â±SEM.

Both reviewers found that many aspects of this manuscript are well done. The observations of MAP7 localization, MAP7's recruitment of kinesin-1 are striking. They also raised some technical issues, particularly relating to the mitochondria experiments in Figure 7. We agree that these experiments are important and needs to be strengthened.

The only place that was a bit confusing was the description of the cells &quot;we took advantage of the E14 rat DRG neurons that lack endogenous MAP7 expression.&quot; These are wild-type DRGs that because of their age happen not to express MAP7? I am guessing this is the correct interpretation, but I initially thought that these were from homozygous mutant mice, so it might be better to make this explanation clearer.</p><p>3) Figure 2: Is there any way to quantitate the localization data? As it is, all the reader has are the few example images. How representative are they? How many cells had these patterns? Can the pattern itself be quantitated?</p><p>4) In the part of the paper that uses optogenetics to control mitochondrial motility, it would be helpful to add some controls using MAP7 that is unable to bind kinesin-1, but that can still interact with microtubules.</p><p>5) For the mitochondrial motility experiments in DRG neurons, the authors use E17 DRG neurons, when MAP7 expression level is at its peak based on their previous paper. More MAP7 is added by overexpression, but wouldn't the results be cleaner if E14 DRGs that do not express MAP7 were used as in as in Figure 1 and Figure 2? The E17 neurons would be a perfect place to look for effects of MAP7 loss.</p><p>6) In Figure 7A, where is the motility quantified? MAP7 is only at branch point but mitochondria are everywhere so one might expect different mitochondrial behaviors in different places.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;MAP7 Regulates Axon Morphogenesis by Recruiting Kinesin-1 to Microtubules and Modulating Organelle Transport&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The text should be read through carefully for small errors. For example, in the first sentence of the Introduction the subject and verb do not agree.</p><p>2) The writing can still be improved to convey a linear series of events. The images in Figure 1B-I have numerous &quot;dots and blobs&quot;, and readers would surely not know where to look. Maybe the authors should trace the neurons and only show the tracings (not the images). Figures should be organized based on themes, and every single panel or graph should not be given a different letter.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36374.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Both reviewers agree that the model proposed in this manuscript is interesting.

We thus performed the same set of optogenetic experiments using peroxisomes in both COS cells (Figure 6) and neurons (Figure 7). These studies with PEX-LOV labeled peroxisomes nicely compliment the findings seen with TOM-LOV labeled mitochondria under different experimental conditions. In fact, the results are consistent with regards to the pause or speed switching for both organelles. However, the studies also showed a difference in terms of run parameters, such as run speed (see below). Thus, these new experiments with peroxisomes provide another way to identify and validate common functions of MAP7.</p><p>In addition, we have carried out studies using neurons isolated from a gene-trap mouse line that lacks MAP7 expression. The data obtained supports the findings shown in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1: The explanation of the domain analysis data in Figure 1 is very clear.

We thus analyzed MAP7-ÎC, which displays similar microtubule binding properties as MAP7-FL but lacks the ability to interact with kinesin. Comparison between MAP7-FL and MAP7-ÎC would test whether the phenotypes we obtained were due to the unique microtubule binding properties of MAP7 or the ability of MAP7 to interact with kinesin-1. We have analyzed this construct in both COS cells and neurons. We have also included the construct in the new peroxisome analysis in COS cells and neurons. Finally, we added this analysis in the study of two different embryonic ages using MitoTracker. The results from these analyses (presented in Figure 6 (Final Figure 7) and Figure 7 (Final Figure 8)) support the role of the C domain of MAP7 in mediating MAP7 regulation of organelle transport, especially pause/speed switching. Thus, these control experiments with MAP7-ÎC provide better insights into the function of MAP7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For the mitochondrial motility experiments in DRG neurons, the authors use E17 DRG neurons, when MAP7 expression level is at its peak based on their previous paper. More MAP7 is added by overexpression, but wouldn't the results be cleaner if E14 DRGs that do not express MAP7 were used as in as in Figure 1 and Figure 2? The E17 neurons would be a perfect place to look for effects of MAP7 loss.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion to examine MAP7 function in E14 neurons that do not express endogenous MAP7. We thus analyzed the effect of MAP7 on MitoTracker-labeled mitochondria between E14 and E17 neurons (Figure 7Q-T (Fignal Figure 8F,G)) and found consistent effects between the two ages. In addition, the analyses in DRG neurons were done in axonal areas with MAP7 expression. Thus, the effects found with E17 neurons do reflect MAP7 function in transport regulation.</p><p> <italic>6) In Figure 7A, where is the motility quantified? MAP7 is only at branch point but mitochondria are everywhere so one might expect different mitochondrial behaviors in different places.</italic></p><p>When overexpressed, MAP7-FL is often present in the mid-region of an axon, in addition to its normal branch site localization. Our analysis was done in these axonal regions with detectable MAP7 signals. We have included a clearer description in the text (subsection âMAP7 affects kinesin mediated mitochondrial transport in DRG axonsâ). We have also included sample images of the transfected axon regions used to generate the kymographs (Figure 7A,B,G,H (Final Figure 7A)).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The text should be read through carefully for small errors.
