This process produces toroids of between four and twelve repeats, which are almost always arranged sequentially in a single polypeptide chain. We found that new propellers evolve continuously by amplification from single blades. We therefore investigated whether such nascent propellers can fold as homo-oligomers before they have been fully amplified within a single chain. One- to six-bladed building blocks derived from two seven-bladed WD40 propellers yielded stable homo-oligomers with six to nine blades, depending on the size of the building block. High-resolution structures for tetramers of two blades, trimers of three blades, and dimers of four and five blades, respectively, show structurally diverse propellers and include a novel fold, highlighting the inherent flexibility of the WD40 blade. Our data support the hypothesis that subdomain-sized fragments can provide structural versatility in the evolution of new proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>beta-propellers</kwd><kwd>oligomeric proteins</kwd><kwd>protein design</kwd><kwd>protein evolution</kwd><kwd>sequence repeat amplificati</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lupas</surname><given-names>Andrei N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Life Grant 94 810</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lupas</surname><given-names>Andrei N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A protein fragment forms different folded structures when amplified to different copy numbers within a single polypeptide chain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Current evolutionary scenarios generally treat domains as the unit of protein evolution. Domains, however, already display a level of complexity that seems to preclude their origin by chemical processes in an abiotic environment. We have proposed that the first domains evolved from a pool of peptides with the propensity to form supersecondary structures, which originated in the context of RNA-based replication and catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lupas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Söding and Lupas, 2003</xref>). Initially, these peptides were entirely dependent on an RNA scaffold for their structure and activity, but increasing complexity allowed them to form structures by excluding water through hydrophobic contacts and thus gain independence from RNA; in this model, protein folding was an emergent property of peptide-RNA coevolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lupas and Alva, 2017</xref>). Using a computational approach, we have retraced 40 of these peptides, whose presence in different folds suggests that they predated the first folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alva et al., 2015</xref>). The most prolific, such as the nucleotide-binding helix-turn-helix motif, found in 14 different folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sauer et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Steitz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rosinski and Atchley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aravind et al., 2005</xref>), or the (di)nucleotide-binding β-α-β Rossmann motif, found in 10 different folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rossmann et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dym and Eisenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laurino et al., 2016</xref>), illustrate a fundamental property of these ancestral peptides: while deterministic with respect to their own structure, they are sufficiently flexible to have given rise to topologically different folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Copley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grishin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krishna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pereira and Lupas, 2018b</xref>). In this paper, we attempt to track some of this structural versatility in one of the fragments we retraced, a four-stranded β-meander found in β-propellers, β-prisms, and in the luminal domain of IRE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kopec and Lupas, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The simplest way for peptides to achieve an increase in complexity is self-association, either by homo-oligomerization, or by amplification into a repetitive array on a single polypeptide chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eck and Dayhoff, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McLachlan, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McLachlan, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Remmert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franklin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pereira and Lupas, 2018a</xref>). Many folds, spanning all levels of complexity (fibrous, solenoid, toroid, and globular), clearly originated in this way. β-Propellers offer an attractive model system to study this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nikkhah et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yadid and Tawfik, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaudhuri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yadid et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yadid and Tawfik, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Voet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noguchi et al., 2019</xref>). They are toroids formed by sequential supersecondary structure units of typically 40–50 residues, each consisting of four anti-parallel β-strands. The units are arranged radially, with their strands perpendicular to the plane of the toroid, and have a right-handed twist, hence the name ‘propeller’ for the fold and ‘blades’ for the repetitive units. Often up to three strands of the last blade are circularly permuted to the N‐terminus of the propeller, resulting in a ‘velcro’ closure <italic>via</italic> hydrogen bonding of the N- and C-terminal strands within the same blade (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), an arrangement that is thought to provide increased stability and folding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neer and Smith, 1996</xref>). Although all blades are structurally very similar, propellers can differ considerably in their number of blades, with structures of between four and twelve blades currently deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Also, uniquely among toroids, propellers span the full range of internal symmetry, from near sequence identity of their blades to full differentiation, where the similarity of the blades is essentially only recognizable from their structure. Diversity in sequence and structure extends to diversity in function; propellers can have enzymatic activity, bind ligands, or mediate protein–protein interactions. Often, they perform their function as a domain in the context of a larger protein.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49853.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The 7-bladed propeller in the protein PkwA of <italic>Thermomonospora curvata</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multiple sequence alignment of the seven blades and sequences of the constructs used to test the formation of higher-order oligomers in vitro.

This finding raises questions about the mechanisms which led to the diversity of propellers observed today. If new propellers are constantly amplified from single blades, must a given blade be amplified to the correct repeat number before it yields a folded structure, or is flexibility in copy number acceptable? Also, can incompletely amplified sequences, that is polypeptides which may be unstable on their own, fold as oligomers, allowing them to act as intermediates in the amplification process? Obviously, a certain robustness in folding would facilitate the emergence of new propellers. Several studies have addressed these questions using constructs derived from natural propellers. The first was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nikkhah et al. (2006)</xref>, who used a consensus WD40 blade to generate proteins with between 4 and 10 repeats, but none of the constructs appeared folded or oligomeric. Subsequently, groups in Israel and Japan built folded, oligomeric propellers from the 5-bladed tachylectin-2 propeller and from a 6-bladed NHL propeller, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yadid et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Voet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smock et al., 2016</xref>), but all their constructs reproduced the parental fold, suggesting that the number of blades in the final structure is not flexible, although it can be reached through oligomeric intermediates.</p><p>In parallel with the aforementioned studies, we took the same path to study the amplification of WD40 propellers. We built constructs of one- to six-bladed building blocks, derived from two seven-bladed parents with high internal sequence symmetry. In contrast to the other studies, none of our constructs reproduced the parental structure, instead yielding a diversity of forms, in an extreme case even giving rise to an arguably novel fold. Their high-resolution structures reveal the geometrical adjustments that the repeat units have to undergo to enable this structural flexibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A first approach using PkwA</title><p>For our study, we decided to start from a recently amplified β-propeller, which we reasoned would not have undergone extensive differentiation towards a specific structural form. At the start of the project, the WD40 propeller with the highest internal sequence symmetry was the C-terminal domain of the putative serine/threonine protein kinase PkwA from the thermophilic actinobacterium <italic>Thermomonospora curvata</italic> (GenBank: AAB05822.1), whose blades mostly share &gt;60% pairwise identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), unreported in any propeller before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janda et al., 1996</xref>).

The 2-bladed construct formed tetramers, suggesting an 8-bladed propeller and the 3-bladed, 4-bladed, and 5-bladed constructs formed dimers, suggesting the formation of 6-bladed, 8-bladed, and 10-bladed propellers, respectively. We were, however, unable to obtain high-resolution structures for any of these oligomers, evidence which we considered essential in order to judge whether such structural diversity had indeed been obtained.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49853.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of biophysical data for the different propeller constructs of PkwA (upper panel) and WRAP (lower panel).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Propeller <break/>Blades in protomer</th><th valign="top">Molecular mass <break/>protomer calculated</th><th valign="top">Molecular mass <break/>SLS measured</th><th valign="top">Assembly state <break/>based on SLS</th><th valign="top">CD melting <break/>temperature <break/>T<sub>m</sub></th><th valign="top">Tryptophan <break/>fluorescence <break/>λ<sub>max</sub></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">8.8 kDa</td><td valign="top">33.9 kDa</td><td valign="top">Tetramer</td><td valign="top">52°C</td><td valign="top">331 nm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">13.6 kDa</td><td valign="top">27.8 kDa</td><td valign="top">Dimer</td><td valign="top">67°C</td><td valign="top">335 nm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4</td><td valign="top">17.5 kDa</td><td valign="top">32.7 kDa</td><td valign="top">Dimer</td><td valign="top">63°C</td><td valign="top">332 nm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5</td><td valign="top">21.8 kDa</td><td valign="top">42.6 kDa</td><td valign="top">Dimer</td><td valign="top">65°C</td><td valign="top">333 nm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">8.9 kDa</td><td valign="top">28.4 kDa</td><td valign="top">Tetramer</td><td valign="top">43°C</td><td valign="top">345 nm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">13.2 kDa</td><td valign="top">39.5 kDa</td><td valign="top">Trimer</td><td valign="top">54°C</td><td valign="top">341 nm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4</td><td valign="top">17.6 kDa</td><td valign="top">26.7 kDa</td><td valign="top">Dimer</td><td valign="top">65°C</td><td valign="top">341 nm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5</td><td valign="top">22 kDa</td><td valign="top">46.9 kDa</td><td valign="top">Dimer</td><td valign="top">62°C</td><td valign="top">341 nm</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">26.3 kDa</td><td valign="top">107 kDa</td><td valign="top">Tetramer</td><td valign="top">63°C</td><td valign="top">340 nm</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>For comparison, in the case of the 5-bladed tachylectin propeller, fragments with two blades reproduced the structure of the parent by forming pentamers, which assembled into two 5-bladed propellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yadid et al., 2010</xref>).

In contrast, none of our assemblies appear to have taken this path to reproduce the parental structure. We therefore mixed constructs with different numbers of blades in an attempt to generate hetero-oligomers with seven blades, but were unable to obtain any, either by co-expression or in vitro mixtures of purified components in defined stoichiometries.

This domain therefore was as close to a natural domain immediately after amplification as we were likely to find, and thus precluded the need for consensus sequences and ancestral sequence reconstruction. We therefore used the aforementioned single WRAP blade to probe the foldability of fragments with tandem repeats of two to six blades (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for sequences). All constructs were successfully expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and could be purified for further analysis. In CD experiments, the complexes unfolded thermally in a cooperative fashion, indicative of well-folded proteins, and their tryptophan fluorescence spectra also resembled those of folded proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The 2-bladed construct behaved as a single species in solution, but size determination by SLS and analytical gel size exclusion chromatography did not allow us to unequivocally distinguish between a trimeric and tetrameric form (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, as all WRAP fragments tended to dissociate during native polyacrylamide electrophoresis, we could not use this as an additional criterion for assessing the state of the assembly, as we had done for the PkwA constructs. Instead, we used glutaraldehyde crosslinking to assay the oligomerization state of the assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and confirmed tetramerization for the 2-bladed construct. For the 3-bladed construct, SLS data indicated a trimer, as also suggested by our crosslinking data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This result is in contrast to the aforementioned 3-bladed PkwA construct which formed dimers, pointing to a certain versatility in the way different fragments with the same repeat number can assemble. The 4- and 5-bladed constructs assembled into homo-dimers and the 6-bladed construct into homo-tetramers. Notably, none of these fragments showed monomer-oligomer equilibria or existed in more than one form in solution (see for example the size-exclusion elution profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the observed assemblies were the most favorable energetically. Although there are numerous examples of monomeric 4-, 5-, and 6-bladed propellers in nature, our WRAP constructs with these blade numbers all formed homo-oligomers. Like for the PkwA constructs, we were unable to obtain hetero-oligomers by co-expression of the constructs, co-refolding of denatured proteins in vitro or co-incubation of purified components.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The structure of oligomeric WRAP propellers</title><p>Unlike the PkwA constructs, many WRAP constructs crystallized and we obtained structures for homo-oligomeric assemblies of 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-bladed fragments. As we anticipated from their oligomeric states, the 2-bladed and 4-bladed fragments formed 8-bladed propellers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) and the 3-bladed fragment a 9-bladed propeller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The 5-bladed fragment, however, did not form a 10-bladed propeller, even though it was dimeric, as observed in solution. Rather, the dimer adopted an unusual, asymmetric structure, hitherto unseen in natural proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), in which one monomer formed the expected 5 blades of an incomplete propeller, while the other monomer formed only four blades and converted part of the N-terminal fifth blade to a helix, leaving the rest of this blade unstructured. The blades in one monomer were antiparallel to the blades in the other, as opposed to natural propellers, where the blades are always parallel. Thus, while the fold is clearly built of blades, it is not a propeller. As the stretch of sequence preceding the helix was not resolved in the structure, we analyzed the intactness of the crystallized protein and found that it had undergone partial trimming during crystallization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49853.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structures of homo-oligomeric WRAP propellers.</title><p>Subunits in each propeller are colored in rainbow colors with blue at the N-terminus and red at the C-terminus.

However, this is not what we observe in our assemblies. Instead, the packing of the blades within each fragment preserves the geometry of the 7-bladed parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and the tension due to the mismatch between the number of blades in the assembly versus that in the parent accumulates at the interface between the fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In the 9-bladed propeller, the symmetry mismatch is absorbed to equal extent at three interfaces, leading to a slightly triangular shape. In the two 8-bladed propellers, the one formed by four 2-bladed fragments absorbs the symmetry mismatch to different extent at the four interfaces, leading to a slightly oval shape and an approximate two-fold symmetry. The one formed by two 4-bladed fragments absorbs the tension at only two interfaces, leading to an even more pronounced oval shape and a clear two-fold symmetry. This latter construct, unlike all others, also shows considerable interface variability between the propellers in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, resulting from the two halves being shifted to different extent in the plane of the interface, further highlighting the inherent structural tension. This is presumably also the reason why the 5-bladed fragment does not form a 10-bladed propeller: The structural tension resulting from the mismatch between the 7-bladed parent and a 10-bladed assembly is apparently too large to be absorbed at two fragment interfaces. Instead, one monomer changes orientation, improving the geometry at one of the two interfaces, and compensates for the accumulated tension at the other interface by conversion of its N-terminal blade to a helix, thus also reducing to nine the number of blades that have to be accommodated in the structure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have explored the structural versatility of propeller blades, which represent one of the ancestral peptides predating folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alva et al., 2015</xref>). For this we used two symmetrical β-propellers of the WD40 family, one of which has clearly been amplified extremely recently in evolution and naturally shows an almost perfect internal symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaudhuri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunin-Horkawicz et al., 2014</xref>), obviating the need to bring it about computationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Voet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noguchi et al., 2019</xref>). Constructs derived from this very highly symmetrical protein, WRAP, yielded two oligomeric propellers with eight blades and one with nine blades, as well as a new fold, which departs from the propeller architecture. None of the constructs recapitulated the 7-bladed structure of the parent, in contrast to previous efforts based on the 5-bladed tachylectin-2 propeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yadid and Tawfik, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yadid et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smock et al., 2016</xref>) and on a 6-bladed NHL propeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Voet et al., 2014</xref>), in both of which all constructs assumed the parental fold. Our results thus show that the same blade can form propellers of different symmetry when amplified to different copy numbers within one polypeptide chain. This supports the notion that subdomain-sized protein fragments are more flexible structurally than fully formed folds – and thus available for reuse in the formation of new proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nepomnyachiy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alva and Lupas, 2018</xref>) – particularly if the fragments have not yet had the time to evolve specificity for a particular structure.</p><p>Given the small sample size of propeller constructs attempted so far, it is of course impossible to judge whether the WD40 family is intrinsically more versatile than other families, but we note that the first set of WD40 constructs we made, based on the PkwA consensus blade, also showed structural versatility. While it is not clear in the absence of high-resolution data whether the tetramer of 2-bladed constructs and dimers of 4- and of 5-bladed constructs indeed formed the expected structures, or rather assumed the parental 7-bladed architecture with one or more blades left unstructured, the dimer of 3-bladed constructs could not have reached the parental architecture and would thus most likely have formed a 6-bladed propeller. Provided that the PkwA-derived constructs did form the expected structures, this blade would thus potentially have been even more versatile, since the WRAP constructs did not produce any 6-bladed form. A counterpoint to the view that WD40 blades may be particularly versatile is however provided by recent results with a computationally symmetrized 8-bladed WD40 propeller, Tako8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noguchi et al., 2019</xref>). A version with seven blades, Tako7, could not be expressed and one with nine blades, Tako9, formed an 8-bladed structure with a single unfolded blade.</p><p>An intriguing, open question concerns the 5-bladed PkwA construct, which assembles into a dimer. Is this dimer a 10-bladed propeller, a 7-bladed propeller with substantial unstructured extensions, or a ‘hopeful monster’ with the same fold as the one formed by the 5-bladed WRAP dimer? The concept of hopeful monsters was introduced by the geneticist Richard Goldschmidt in order to describe the sudden emergence of new species through discontinuous variation at the genetic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldschmidt, 1940</xref>). While the subject of ongoing controversy in developmental biology, this concept is quite attractive in order to describe the relationship between the new fold and canonical propeller structures. The change in its genetic information is not large, going from 2, 3, 4, or seven repeat units to 5, but it is certainly discontinuous and leads to the sudden emergence of a new form, which – as a stable, efficiently folded protein – is available for further evolution. A corollary of these considerations is therefore the question whether this new fold can be functionalized sufficiently to allow it to enter biological evolution in vivo. Our efforts in this direction have just started. We note however that, unless the WRAP blade has unique properties not clear to us, nature must have seen proteins with this fold on many occasions along the eons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>As a starting point for the consensus constructs we used the propeller (residues 450–740) of PkwA from <italic>Thermonospora curvata</italic> (AAB05822.1), annotated as a putative serine/threonine-protein kinase.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editor’s note: the editors did not request any revisions prior to acceptance, so there is not an accompanying Author response.]</p><p>Congratulations, we are pleased to inform you that your article, &quot;Structural diversity of oligomeric β-propellers with different numbers of identical blades&quot;, has been accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>It is most likely that proteins evolved complex structures by multiple duplication of small building blocks. Varying in the number of blades and sequence similarity between the blades, β-propellers offer a great example to learn about such evolution. In this work, the authors study the ability of β-propeller &quot;blades&quot; to reassemble into higher-order structures when allowed to do so separately from their parent structures. This had been attempted before, but without success in that the assembled structures simply resembled the parent protein, or did not fold.</p><p>Here, the authors chose as the parent protein a recently formed propeller fold in a protein (WRAP). The recent origin of this protein is deduced from the high internal similarity (near identity) between its 7 blades within each of two propeller domains, pointing to evolutionarily recent fusion and divergence from the parental blade.</p><p>The authors took a sequence of a blade from a 7-bladed propeller and investigated how proteins composed of its repeats (from 2 to 6) fold. It was interesting to learn that it was unexpectedly difficult to make stable proteins from identical repeats, and quite a few resisted 3D structure determination. Those that were successful mostly produced symmetric structures through oligomerization. Due to this apparent preference for symmetry probably stemming from energetically favorable interactions between the blades within each monomer, none of the structures reproduced their 7-bladed progenitor, but only grew in the number of blades.</p><p>It was interesting to see that the 6-bladed structure never formed, that is, why didn't 3-bladed chains assemble into 6-bladed dimers? However, 8 or 9-bladed propellers were obtained. The most unexpected result was the 5-bladed chain. It didn't assemble into a 10-bladed dimer. Why? Is it because the sequence in the original 7-bladed unit was such that going beyond 9 creates steric clashes? It also didn't assemble into a symmetric 9 or 8-bladed unit by kicking out one or two blades from one or both chains. Instead, it formed a bizarre asymmetric assembly in which the two chains in a dimer packed in antiparallel fashion. Only 9 blades were accommodated, and one blade of one chain was indeed kicked out of this broken propeller that couldn't close due to antiparallel arrangement of the chains.</p><p>These experiments revealed that such new and unusual folds can originate rather easily and may form the basis of structure inventions, like those that seen in viruses. The reviewers found work quite fascinating. Going forward, it would be interesting to learn how these structures could evolve, either for stability or for function, if strict identity of repeats is relaxed (in future work, of course, not in this paper). E.g., what path would that 9-bladed asymmetric monster take upon some random mutations being introduced in its sequence. Will it continue to be asymmetric, or it will relax back to maybe 10-bladed &quot;normal&quot; dimer? Novel folds are probably easy to get by wrecking up the structure somewhat, being saved by oligomerization. But would they stay novel in evolution?</p><p>The work is very well done technically, and the results are solid. We recommend publication.</p></body></sub-article></article>
