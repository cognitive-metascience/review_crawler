Whereas it is well established that centromeric satellite DNA serves as a platform to form the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Willard, 1990</xref>), the role of pericentromeric heterochromatin has been obscure despite its abundance that surpasses far beyond centromeric heterochromatin. Due to the lack of protein-coding ability and lack of conservation among species, satellite DNA has been repeatedly consigned to the status of genomic junk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ohno, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Orgel and Crick, 1980</xref>), even though they can constitute ~50% of eukaryotic genomes. Although satellite DNAs have been proposed to function in diverse cellular processes such as meiotic disjunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dernburg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hawley et al., 1992</xref>), dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Menon et al., 2014</xref>) and chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rošić et al., 2014</xref>), these functions have often been restricted to specific satellite DNA repeats, cell types or organisms. Accordingly, a central principle underlying the ubiquity and abundance of satellite DNA in eukaryotes has remained poorly understood.</p><p>In a recent study using <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse cells as models, we have proposed a conserved function of satellite DNAs in maintaining the entire chromosomal complement in a single nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jagannathan et al., 2018</xref>). Our study indicated that pericentromeric satellite DNAs play a critical role in bundling multiple chromosomes, leading to the formation of ‘chromocenters’, cytological structures that have been recognized for ~100 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jones, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jost et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pardue and Gall, 1970</xref>). We have shown that <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> D1 and the mouse HMGA1 bundle chromosomes by binding to their cognate satellite DNAs ({AATAT}<sub>n</sub> and major satellite, respectively) and clustering them into chromocenters. Loss of chromocenters (i.e. defective bundling of chromosomes) due to mutation/depletion of these satellite DNA-binding proteins resulted in the formation of micronuclei, because unbundled chromosomes budded out of interphase nuclei. This was associated with extensive DNA damage, as has been observed with micronuclei in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crasta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Denais et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hatch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raab et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these observations, we proposed that chromocenter formation, supported by interchromosomal bundling, secures the full complement of chromosomes within a single nucleus.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43938.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Prod bundles the {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA on the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> major autosomes into chromocenters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of chromosomes containing distinct pericentromeric satellite DNAs being organized into chromocenters.

First, although some species such as mouse have the same pericentromeric satellite DNA repeat (i.e. major satellite) on all chromosomes, other species such as humans, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, cows and kangaroo rats are known to have divergent pericentromeric satellite DNA sequences on each chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">John and Miklos, 1979</xref>), raising the question as to how all chromosomes are bundled into chromocenters. For example, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the {AATAT}<sub>n</sub> satellite is abundant on X, Y and 4<sup>th</sup> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and we have shown that the D1 protein, which recognizes this satellite DNA, plays a critical role in chromocenter formation. However, chromosome 2 possesses little if any of the {AATAT}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, arrowheads), and chromosome 3 possesses much less of this satellite DNA compared to X, Y and 4<sup>th</sup> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, arrows). Therefore, how chromosomes 2 and 3 (hereafter referred to as the major autosomes) may participate in chromocenter formation remained unclear. Second, it is widely observed that most eukaryotic cells contain multiple chromocenters, recognized as DAPI-dense foci or the association of pericentromeric satellite DNA. However, our model for chromocenter function necessitates the bundling of all chromosomes together, but how multiple chromocenter foci can mediate the bundling of all chromosomes remained unclear.</p><p>Here we show that the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> major autosomes are incorporated into chromocenters by the Proliferation disrupter (Prod) satellite DNA-binding protein and its cognate {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA. Loss of Prod resulted in phenotypes similar to those of <italic>D1</italic> mutant with a different spectrum of affected tissues: defective chromocenters, micronuclei formation and loss of cellular viability in the imaginal discs and lymph glands. We show that D1 and Prod are mutually dependent in forming chromocenters, and our analysis implies that D1 and Prod might dynamically interact. These results suggest a network-like configuration for chromocenters, ensuring effective bundling of all <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromosomes. Moreover, a double mutant of <italic>D1</italic> and <italic>prod</italic> resulted in embryonic lethality with defective embryos exhibiting a striking increase in micronuclei, revealing the essential function of chromocenters and satellite DNAs for cell viability. Taken together, we propose that modules of satellite DNA and satellite DNA-binding proteins form chromocenters, which bundle the full complement of an organism’s chromosomes in a single nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA-binding protein, Prod, is important for chromocenter formation</title><p>Our previous study demonstrated that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> D1 protein, which binds to the {AATAT}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA, plays a critical role in bundling chromosomes into chromocenters, such that they are encapsulated within a single nucleus. Puzzlingly, little if any {AATAT}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA is present on 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), raising a question as to how these autosomes may be incorporated into chromocenters.</p><p>The {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA drew our attention, because it is abundantly present on chromosomes 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and is known to be bound by the Proliferation disrupter (Prod) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Török et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Török et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Platero et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, we observed that the {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA and Prod protein perfectly co-localized within interphase nuclei in multiple cell types such as spermatogonia, imaginal disc cells and lymph gland cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Whereas the {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA exists at four loci in diploid cells (2 from 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2 from 3<sup>rd</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we predominantly observed two {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA foci per nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>), suggesting that this satellite DNA is bundled into chromocenters. The number of {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA foci per nucleus significantly increased in cells depleted of Prod (both loss-of-function mutants and RNAi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), suggesting that Prod functions to bundle {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA into chromocenters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>prod</italic> mutant cells exhibit cellular phenotypes associated with chromocenter disruption, leading to larval lethality</title><p>Loss-of-function of <italic>prod</italic> was reported to cause late larval lethality with these mutants containing atrophied imaginal discs and melanized lymph glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Török et al., 1997</xref>). However, the cellular phenotypes in these degenerate tissues have not been investigated in detail. Because we observed defective chromocenter formation in <italic>prod</italic> mutant imaginal discs cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>), we wondered if larval lethality may be explained by cellular defects due to chromocenter disruption.</p><p>Our prior study showed that disruption of chromocenter formation in <italic>D1</italic> mutants led to micronuclei formation due to lack of chromosome bundling in interphase nuclei, leading to a loss of cellular viability in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jagannathan et al., 2018</xref>).

However, these D1/Prod-positive chromatin threads are only apparent during a narrow time window during mitotic prophase when individual chromosomes start to resolve from each other during chromosome condensation but prior to metaphase. By metaphase, the chromatin threads that connect heterologous chromosomes were completely resolved, likely to allow mitotic chromosome segregation. Also it is not possible to visualize the clustering of heterologous chromosomes within chromocenters during interphase, as decondensed chromatin does not allow distinction of individual chromosomes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43938.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Prod bundles heterologous chromosomes through the {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Deconvolution microscopy of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuroblasts in early prophase expressing GFP-Prod (green) under the control of <italic>wor-gal4</italic> and stained with pH3 (Ser10) (red).

While we have observed an average of ~4–5 D1-positive foci/nucleus and ~2 Prod positive foci/nucleus in fixed and stained samples, the live observation demonstrated that these foci are not static but rather moving dynamically within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Using single particle tracking, we estimated the diffusion coefficient (D), which indicated that D1 and Prod exhibited similar dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We also quantified the slope of momentum scaling spectrum (S<sub>MSS</sub>) of D1 and Prod foci, an established parameter for the type of particle movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ewers et al., 2005</xref>). In the case of free, unhindered diffusion, the S<sub>MSS</sub> value equals 0.5 whereas values below and above 0.5 indicate confined and directed motion respectively. The majority of D1 and Prod foci exhibited S<sub>MSS</sub> &lt;0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting confined motion, likely within the heterochromatin domain. D1-positive foci and Prod-positive foci frequently became juxtaposed in a ‘kiss and run’ manner: coming into contact temporarily and separating from each other soon after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>). These results indicate that chromocenter is a structure comprised of dynamic modules of satellite DNAs and satellite DNA binding proteins, rather than rigidly linked satellite DNAs. The dynamism exhibited by these satellite DNA binding proteins may reflect the recently demonstrated liquid droplet-like properties of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Strom et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The frequent associations of D1 and Prod led us to examine whether these modules may exhibit inter-dependency in chromocenter formation. Indeed, we found that mutation of <italic>prod</italic> resulted in defective clustering of D1 protein within the nuclei of imaginal discs, neuroblasts and spermatogonial germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D–I</xref>).

Taken together, these results support the idea that modules of Prod, D1 and their cognate satellite DNA function in a mutually dependent manner to form chromocenters. We propose that this inter-dependency shapes a network-like configuration for chromocenters and forms the basis for bundling the ‘entire set’ of chromosomes, instead of bundling individual satellite DNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title><italic>D1 prod</italic> double mutant exhibits embryonic lethality</title><p>While our data suggest that both D1 and Prod play a role in chromocenter formation, loss of either protein only resulted in tissue-specific cellular defects.

Nevertheless, these tandem repeats have often been dismissed as ‘junk’ DNA for the following reasons, (a) they are simple sequences with no apparent protein coding potential, (b) there is a striking lack of conservation in the abundance and identity of satellite DNA repeats even amongst closely related species. Nonetheless, satellite DNA abundance is remarkably stable over multiple generations, despite being prone to copy number loss through mechanisms such as replicative slippage and intrachromatid exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Charlesworth et al., 1994</xref>), implying that satellite DNA must serve unappreciated function(s).</p><p>We have recently proposed a conserved function for pericentromeric satellite DNAs in encapsulating the entire chromosomal complement within a single nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jagannathan et al., 2018</xref>). The framework of this model is that satellite binding proteins, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> D1 and mouse HMGA1, bind their cognate satellite DNAs and bundle them into chromocenters. This bundling prevents individual chromosomes from budding off out of the nucleus, thereby maintaining chromosomes within the nucleus. Based on this idea, all the chromosomes must be bundled into chromocenters so as not to be lost as micronuclei. This raised a few questions. 1) How can all of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> chromosomes be bundled into chromocenters, given that the D1-bound {AATAT}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA is present abundantly only on X, Y and 4<sup>th</sup> chromosomes? and 2) If bundling of all chromosomes into chromocenters is required to package the genome into a single nucleus and given the multiple chromocenter foci typically observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse cells, are these chromocenters linked to one another? In this study, through the investigation of Prod protein in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we provide insights into these questions.</p><p>First, we found that Prod, which is known to bind the {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA on the major autosomes, is a chromocenter-forming protein, functioning together with D1 protein. Our study suggests that the chromocenter consists of multiple modules of satellite DNAs and satellite DNA-binding proteins, where D1 bundles X, Y and 4<sup>th</sup> chromosomes and Prod bundles 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosomes, thereby covering the full complement of the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Given that the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome contains at least 17 satellite DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jagannathan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lohe et al., 1993</xref>), it is plausible that additional satellite DNA binding proteins may participate in chromocenter formation, even though D1 and Prod can cover the full complement of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> chromosomes. Alternatively, these 17 satellite DNAs might reflect the history of the species, wherein individual satellites were essential at some point, while only a subset are critically important for the present day <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome.</p><p>We observed that D1-positive foci and Prod-positive foci dynamically associated within the interphase nuclei. D1 and Prod function interdependently such that D1/{AATAT}<sub>n</sub> clustering is dependent on Prod while Prod/{AATAACTAG}<sub>n</sub> clustering is dependent on D1. Therefore, although our data do not provide direct evidence that D1 and Prod physically interact to form chromocenters, we speculate the functional interaction of D1 and Prod plays a critical role in chromocenter formation. We further suggest that the association of satellite DNA binding proteins can form a chromocenter network, thereby packaging the entire genome within a single nucleus. Importantly, while mutation of either <italic>D1</italic> or <italic>prod</italic> exhibited varying effects on micronuclei formation in a tissue-specific manner, a <italic>D1 prod</italic> double mutant resulted in a striking enhancement of the phenotype, leading to embryonic lethality. This suggests that while cells can compensate for the loss of an individual chromocenter module, loss of multiple chromocenter modules will result in more widespread and penetrant cellular defects, illuminating an essential function for chromocenter formation.</p><p>Our data suggest that the essence of satellite DNA function is to be bound by sequence-specific binding proteins that have the ability to bundle these repeats into chromocenters. As such, the satellite DNA sequence itself does not need to be conserved. This may explain why satellite DNA repeats diverge rapidly, even among closely related species, an observation that has led to the idea that satellite DNA is junk. For instance, the {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA, which is a central player in bundling the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> major autosomes, is completely absent in its nearest relative, <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic>. These observations lead to an interesting speculation: if satellite DNA repeats diverge rapidly, their binding proteins will also likely adapt to attain optimal binding specificity for the diverged sequences. Whereas <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Prod binds the {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA, <italic>D. simulans</italic> Prod must have adapted to bind a distinct satellite DNA sequence to form chromocenters. This leads to a question as to whether <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Prod can bundle <italic>D. simulans</italic> chromosomes and vice versa. It is tempting to speculate that such divergence in satellite DNA sequences and their binding proteins may lead to incompatibility in chromocenter formation when chromosomes from these two species are brought together in hybrids.</p><p>In summary, we propose that satellite DNA and their binding proteins conform to a modular system, whereby all the chromosomes are brought into a chromocenter network by the association of satellite DNA binding proteins. In this manner, chromocenter plays a fundamental role in securing all the chromosomes within a single nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly husbandry and strains</title><p>All fly stocks were raised on standard Bloomington medium at 25°C.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The modular mechanism of chromocenter formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Susan A. Gerbi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The comments are favorable, and some changes asked are speedily addressable. All best wishes for the season and the New Year,</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a fine paper worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In a paper published earlier this year, the authors presented the novel idea that protein D1, which binds to the {AATAT}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, serves to bundle chromosomes into chromocenters in nuclei and blebbing off of micronuclei occurs in the absence of D1. They demonstrated that the same effect is seen in mouse cells for the HMGA1 homologue of D1. Having established this conceptually new advance for the field, one could ask what more is new in the present manuscript. The answer to this question is positive, as significantly more information is presented in this manuscript.</p><p>While the concept remains unchanged, it is broadened by their new studies on the Prod protein that binds to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite DNA. They clearly show chromosome specificity in the binding: D1 binds to the {AATAT}<sub>n</sub> that is located on chromosomes X, Y and 4, whereas Prod binds to {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> that is on chromosomes 2 and 3. In both cases, chromatin threads of protein binding to satellite DNA are seen that may link heterologous chromosomes together. Since <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has at least 17 different satellite DNAs, the question remains for future studies if there are other satellite-binding proteins and what their impact may be for chromocenter maintenance. Another unanswered question for future studies revolves around the rapid evolution of satellite DNA sequences that differ even between <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and its closely related species <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic>. Can the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Prod bind to satellite DNA in <italic>D. simulans</italic> (and vice versa), suggesting recognition of a feature beyond the simple sequence? Or, might species specificity of Prod binding to satellite DNA be at the heart of mechanisms that separate one species from another?</p><p>The authors use elegant <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics approaches coupled with microscopy (including time lapse live cell imaging). The authors demonstrate tissue specificity of micronuclei formation with D1 mutation more severely affecting the germline whereas prod mutation more severely affects somatic cells. Moreover, genetic inhibition of apoptosis reveals DNA damage in prod mutant tissue. Their data suggest that D1 and Prod transiently interact for a reciprocal influence of DNA bundling. This leads to their model of a &quot;modular network&quot; for chromocenter formation. This explains the synthetic lethality of the <italic>D1 prod</italic> double mutant.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The data are mostly convincing, and the manuscript is well written and addresses an important topic: the function of pericentromeric satellite DNA. There are two concerns with the experiments showing interactions between D1 and Prod, which are crucial for the overall message.</p><p>First, the only direct evidence for interactions between D1 and Prod is their localization near each other (Figure 4A) and the fluctuating distance between them (Figure 4G). These results need to be carefully quantified and compared to distances between loci that are not expected to interact with each other. Otherwise the results are difficult to interpret.</p><p>Second, Figure 4H-M shows that the number of D1 foci increases when Prod is mutated and vice versa, suggesting that one of the satellite binding proteins support the clustering of the other. For this experiment to be convincing, FISH against the specific satellite DNAs should be included to rule out the possibility that the observed loss of clustering is due to satellite-binding proteins spreading to non-cognate sequences. Please see if this can be speedily done (which we think is feasible; but if not please make case why we can proceed without this experiment).</p><p>Coming from our editorial discussions, the following points also need to be addressed.</p><p>With regard to &quot;transient interaction&quot; between D1 and Prod, even with careful analysis (as suggested by the reviewer), the cytological evidence would only be suggestive at best. There was no co-IP seen, which the authors interpret as a transient interaction. The synthetic lethality of the D1/prod double mutant demonstrates a genetic interaction. Overall, the authors should soften the wording to conclude that there is suggestive evidence for interaction between D1 and Prod.</p><p>With regard to Figure 1B, the authors should explain in the legend both the arrows (denoting chromosome II(I) and the arrowheads (denoting chromosome II). Since the FISH probe was against the {AATAACATAG}<sub>n</sub> satellite that resides on both chromosomes II and III, it is unclear how these two chromosomes could be distinguished in this particular experiment. It is only in Figure 3D where FISH probes are used against the chromosome 3 specific dodeca satellite or against the chromosome 2 specific {AACAC}<sub>n</sub> satellite that chromosome 2 can be distinguished from chromosome 3. Finally, for consistency, the authors should use Arabic numbers to denote the chromosome identity (not Roman numerals as in Figure 1B).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43938.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The data are mostly convincing, and the manuscript is well written and addresses an important topic: the function of pericentromeric satellite DNA.

However, we feel that there is no appropriate ‘negative control’ (two loci that are expected to not interact) as suggested by reviewers. Any other satellite DNAs may be a part of ‘modular network’ that we propose in this study, and thus they likely cannot be used as a negative control. Other possibilities include the use of LacO repeats integrated into multiple loci and analyze their interaction. However, this will not serve as a fair control, because LacO repeats insertions (256 copies roughly spanning 10kb) are cytologically much smaller than the Mb-long tracts of AATAT or AATAACATG satellites. Therefore, it is expected that LacO repeats will exhibit less interaction than D1 and Prod, yet it does not prove the lack of interaction. Another possibility is the use of chromosome painting (such as oligo paint technique) of multiple loci. But this technique does not allow live observation, and thus we cannot assess dynamic interaction, and it is unlikely that we can utilize such data to infer their interaction (or lack thereof) to compare to that of D1 and Prod. Therefore, we decided to soften our statement throughout the manuscript so as not to mislead the readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, Figure 4H-M shows that the number of D1 foci increases when Prod is mutated and vice versa, suggesting that one of the satellite binding proteins support the clustering of the other.

This is indeed a very important point and we conducted this experiment in two parts, which is now added as Figure 4—figure supplement 3. The results presented in this figure demonstrate that D1 and Prod co-localize with AATAT/AATAACATAG satellite DNA, respectively, even when D1/Prod exhibit de-clustering in the absence of the other protein. Consistently, our quantification of AATAT satellite DNA foci in the absence of Prod and AATAACATAG satellite DNA foci in the absence of D1 in larval imaginal discs and lymph glands show that these satellite DNA foci exhibit similar levels of declustering to protein foci declustering as shown in Figure 4H-M.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Coming from our editorial discussions, the following points also need to be addressed.</p><p>With regard to &quot;transient interaction&quot; between D1 and Prod, even with careful analysis (as suggested by the reviewer), the cytological evidence would only be suggestive at best.

For Figure 1B: Chromosome II and III were distinguished because chromosome III contains a minor amount of AATAT satellites. This was mentioned in the text but was not explained in the context of Figure 1B. Thus, we have added this explanation to the legend. We have changed all to Arabic numbers (figures and text).</p></body></sub-article></article>
