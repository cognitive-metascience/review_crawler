Here we identify a RNA binding pocket on WDR5, and discover a WDR5 mutant (F266A) that selectively abrogates RNA binding without affecting MLL complex assembly or catalytic activity. Complementation in ESCs shows that WDR5 F266A mutant is unable to accumulate on chromatin, and is defective in gene activation, maintenance of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, and ESC self renewal. We identify a family of ESC messenger and lncRNAs that interact with wild type WDR5 but not F266A mutant, including several lncRNAs known to be important for ESC gene expression. These results suggest that specific RNAs are integral inputs into the WDR5-MLL complex for maintenance of the active chromatin state and embryonic stem cell fates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02046.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02046.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02046.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>If all the DNA contained within a single human cell were stretched out it would be about three meters long. To fit this length of DNA into the nucleus of the cell, it is packaged into a compact structure called chromatin. If a cell wants to express one of the genes in the DNA in order to produce a protein, it must unpack part of the chromatin to give an enzyme called RNA polymerase access to the DNA to produce messenger RNA. However, other enzymes—often working with other enzymes, proteins and molecules called cofactors—can modify the structure of the chromatin in a way that leads to changes in the expression of nearby genes.</p><p>The protein WDR5 binds to enzymes and helps to modify chromatin so that nearby genes can be ‘switched on’. However, WDR5 also binds to RNA molecules that are not involved in the expression of genes as proteins. These long non-coding RNA molecules (lncRNAs) are thought to act as scaffolds that guide the WDR5-enzyme complex to specific stretches of DNA. However, it is not clear if lncRNAs might be performing roles that affect the function of these enzyme complexes directly—as has been observed for other cofactors.</p><p>Yang, Flynn et al. have now investigated the role of lncRNA molecules further, and identified a pocket on the structure of WDR5 where these molecules bind. A mutation in this pocket that blocks binding to lncRNA did not stop purified WDR5 protein from forming active enzyme complexes when tested in the lab. However, it seems that WDR5 needs to bind to the lncRNAs to function properly inside living cells. WDR5 binds to hundreds of lncRNAs within a cell, and the mutation that blocks this binding reduced both the amount of time that WDR5 protein survives in a cell and the amount of time it spends bound to chromatin. As such, this mutation seems to reduce the ability of the WDR5-enzyme complex to activate chromatin and ‘switch on’ genes.</p><p>WDR5 is also known to be important in mammalian embryonic stem cells—cells that have the potential to become all the different types of cells found in the body. Yang, Flynn et al. uncovered that the mutations in WDR5 that abolish lncRNA binding also affect the expression of genes that help mouse stem cells to maintain this potential. Since different cell types have distinct patterns of active chromatin, the next challenge will be to understand whether different lncRNAs bind to WDR5 to switch on unique set of genes in each cell type.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02046.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02046.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>long noncoding RNA</kwd><kwd>active chromatin</kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cell</kwd><kwd>trithorax/MLL</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yul W</given-names></name><name><surname>Flynn</surname><given-names>Ryan A</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name><name><surname>Qu</surname><given-names>Kun</given-names></name><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Bingbing</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Kevin C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lei</surname><given-names>Ming</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Howard Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yul W</given-names></name><name><surname>Flynn</surname><given-names>Ryan A</given-names></name><name><surname>Qu</surname><given-names>Kun</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Kevin C</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Howard Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Howard Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RNA binding is a key input of an active chromatin complex and maintenance of stem cell fate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An orchestra of chromatin readers, writers, and erasers act on diverse covalent histone modifications to establish particular cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rando and Chang, 2009</xref>). By maintaining such histone modifications through cell divisions, the cell state can then be epigenetically transferred from generation to generation, eventually establishing tissues and complex organisms. Histones are modified by large protein complexes with multiple coenzymes that modulate and regulate catalytic activity, thus allowing fine regulation of histone marks.</p><p>Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is a mark of transcriptionally active chromatin, generated through the catalytic activity of the MLL family of proteins. The MLL family of H3K4 methylases are evolutionarily conserved (known as COMPASS in yeast and trithorax in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2011</xref>), and <italic>MLL</italic> translocations are an important cause of human leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meyer et al., 2009</xref>). Members of the MLL family encode single SET domain-containing H3K4 methylases, and are associated with WDR5, Ash2L, RbBP5, and additional proteins to regulate activity. Of the various cofactors that regulate MLL activity, WDR5 is a particularly important multifunctional adaptor protein that can discriminate posttranslational modifications on histone tails, as well as bind to the MLL complex to regulate gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wysocka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Migliori et al., 2012</xref>). WDR5 is particularly important for mammalian embryonic stem cell (ESC) self renewal and maintenance of active chromatin for pluripotency genes, and WDR5 is required for efficient generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from differentiated somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27a">Li et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>WDR5 has recently been shown to bind individual long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gomez et al., 2013</xref>). LncRNAs are capped, spliced, polyadenylated RNA transcripts ranging from several hundred to kilobases in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Derrien et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rinn and Chang, 2012</xref>). Specific lncRNAs bind repressive or activating chromatin modification complexes, and localize these activities to specific gene loci (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Chang (2011)</xref>). For example, the lncRNA XIST binds the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to cause histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation and silence the X chromosome for dosage compensation in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morey and Avner, 2011</xref>). As another example, the lncRNA HOTAIR acts as a molecular scaffold, binding both PRC2 and the H3K4 demethylase LSD1 complex to silence hundreds of loci throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rinn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tsai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2011</xref>). Additional lncRNAs can bind to messenger RNAs to control their decay via interaction with the Staufen 1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gong and Maquat, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kretz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, several lncRNAs bind to WDR5 to facilitate H3K4me3 and epigenetic activation. HOTTIP is an enhancer-like lncRNA of the human <italic>HOXA</italic> locus that coordinates expression of <italic>HOXA9</italic> to <italic>HOXA13</italic>, which are important for distal identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). HOTTIP RNA directly binds to the WDR5 protein to recruit the MLL H3K4 methylase complex to maintain H3K4me3. In addition, recent research has shown that the NeST lncRNA also binds WDR5 to upregulate IFN-γ expression through H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gomez et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting the existence of multiple different enhancing lncRNAs that function via WDR5 interactions. Many enhancers and promoters often produce lncRNAs, and some of these lncRNAs have enhancer-like functions in the activation of nearby genes by binding the Mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orom et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 2013</xref>). Currently, it is believed that lncRNAs function by guiding localization of chromatin modification machinery as simple scaffolds. However, like coenzymes that modulate protein activity, it is possible that lncRNAs may affect protein function more directly.</p><p>To examine the roles of RNA binding on WDR5 functionality, here we identify a RNA binding site on WDR5, and characterized its function in vitro and in vivo. Inability to bind RNAs does not affect MLL complex formation or catalytic activity in vitro. However, ability to bind RNAs is crucial for WDR5 function in cells. We find that WDR5 binds over a thousand endogenous RNAs and that RNA binding is essential for WDR5 maintenance of ESC pluripotency. Inability to bind RNAs greatly reduced duration of WDR5 protein and its occupancy on chromatin, impaired global H3K4me3 levels, and reduced expression of genes required for embryonic stem cell state. Overall, these results suggest an unexpected role for RNA binding in regulating the lifespan of epigenetic fates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Discovering the lncRNA binding interface on WDR5</title><p>To determine the lncRNA binding site, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis of WDR5, guided by its crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trievel and Shilatifard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Odho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avdic et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). WDR5 is a barrel-shaped protein with several charged clefts on its surface, several of which are known to mediate protein–protein interactions with MLL, histone H3 tail, or RbBP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We generated 19 WDR5 point mutants, expressed them in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as GST-fusion proteins, and purified them to homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Four out of 19 mutants significantly reduced the ability to retrieve HOTTIP lncRNA in vitro: Y228A, L240A, K250A, and F266A. These WDR5 mutations defined a cleft between blades 5 and 6, partially encompassing the same surface previously described to bind RbBP5 amino acids 371–381 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Odho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avdic et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, a focal binding site defines the interaction between WDR5 and HOTTIP. To confirm that HOTTIP and RbBP5 bind to the same or overlapping sites on WDR5, we pre-incubated wild type GST-WDR5 with an excess of RbBP5 peptide (amino acids 371–381) or control H3K4me3 peptide (amino acids 1–20), and then assayed for HOTTIP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Whereas addition of H3K4me3 peptide had no effect, pre-incubation with RbBP5 peptide prevented HOTTIP binding to WDR5, thus confirming the shared binding cleft.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02046.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HOTTIP lncRNA binding surface overlaps with the RbBP5 binding surface on WDR5.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crystal structure of WDR5 (PDB:3P4F, visualized with PyMol) reveal that mutations abrogating HOTTIP RNA binding align along a cleft between blades 5 and 6, opposite the H3K4/MLL binding site.

Whereas the D107A and R181A mutations caused little effect on RbBP5 binding compared with wild type (∼95%), the K250 mutation reduced RbBP5 binding (∼62.5%) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Odho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avdic et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the F266A mutation actually increased RbBP5 binding (∼120%), suggesting that loss of binding to HOTTIP increases the ability to bind RbBP5. Consistent with the direct in vitro binding assay, both K250A and F266A mutations fully abrogated WDR5 binding to HOTTIP in vivo. In contrast, mutations at D107A and R181A showed minimal effects on WDR5-HOTTIP interactions. K250A and F266A did not affect the accumulation of HOTTIP lncRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and both negative controls U1 and HOTAIR did not enrich binding to WDR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo analyses demonstrate that HOTTIP RNA binds WDR5 through a specific binding pocket.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A selective mutant reveals the importance of lncRNA binding on WDR5-mediated gene activation</title><p>To pinpoint the functional consequences of a selective lncRNA-binding mutation of WDR5, we further analyzed WDR5 F266A. In contrast to the other HOTTIP binding mutations, WDR5 F266A is defective in lncRNA binding in vitro and in vivo, but without any defects in binding MLL complex subunits RbBP5 or MLL1 in immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We reasoned that the F266A mutation offered an experimental strategy to isolate the requirement of lncRNA binding for WDR5 function.</p><p>To confirm the lncRNA selectivity of the F266A mutation, we examined its effects on MLL complex structure and catalytic activity in vitro. As seen by isothermal calorimetry, the F266A mutation minimally affects the affinity of WDR5 for RbBP5, MLL1, or H3 peptides, in contrast to the Y228A mutation (RbBP5 binding defective) or D107A mutation (MLL1 and H3 binding defective) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This was further confirmed using GST protein pull down assays, in which GST-WDR5 F266A displays no deficits in binding RbBP5, Ash2L, and MLL1 purified proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Interestingly, ESCs harboring WDR5 F266A displayed a similar global 50% reduction of H3K4me3 (Lane 3), although WDR5 F266A protein was expressed at lower levels. In addition, promoter shutoff of WDR5 F266A caused a drastic &gt;80% reduction of H3K4me3 levels (Lanes 3 and 4). Thus, WDR5 F266A exhibits a striking inability to maintain global H3K4me3 levels.</p><p>We more closely examined the subcellular localization of WDR5 WT and WDR5 F266A, and found that WDR5 F266A was depleted in both nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and chromatin fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The alteration in cellular distribution of WDR5 F266A can be explained by differential stability in nuclear vs cytoplasmic pools, or alternatively, by a role of F266 in directly controlling nuclear localization.

WDR5 is a multifunctional adaptor protein that can interact with multiple subunits of the MLL complex, such as MLL itself and RbBP5, as well as with regulators and substrates of the complex, such as HOTTIP and histone H3 arginine 2 symmetric demethylation (H3R2me2s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Migliori et al., 2012</xref>). The MLL and H3R2me2s share the same binding pocket, and we found that HOTTIP and RbBP5 share a distinct binding pocket. While Pou5f1 has been reported to bind WDR5, we found no difference in the WDR5 F266A lncRNA binding mutant for its interaction with Pou5f1 (data not shown). Nonetheless, these multitudes of interactions suggest that molecular arrangements in this complex may be dynamic and intricate.</p><p>By strategic structure-guided mutagenesis, we identified WDR5 F266A as a mutant that has a specific defect in binding the lncRNA HOTTIP, but does not impact interactions with MLL1, RbBP5, or Ash2L. More importantly, the F266A mutation does not diminish MLL1 complex catalytic activity in vitro. Thus, although HOTTIP and RbBP5 share an overlapping binding pocket, the specific residues required for binding appear fundamentally different. This result is not surprising, given the electrostatic and three dimensional structure differences between peptides vs RNAs. The WDR5 F266A mutant is largely deficient in gene activation in cells, suggesting that direct lncRNA-protein interactions are important for WDR5 function in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Requirement of a RNA-binding interface in WDR5 for gene activation in ESC self renewal</title><p>We replaced endogenous WDR5 in mouse ESCs with a RNA binding mutant, WDR5 F266A, and found that the RNA binding interface is critical for the accumulation of nuclear and chromatin WDR5. These results suggest that in addition to their roles in recruiting protein complexes to specific genomic loci, lncRNA binding may also regulate the longevity of their interacting protein complexes <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). When able to bind RNAs, wild type WDR5 displays a long nuclear and chromatin half-life, thus allowing formation of the MLL1 complex for H3K4me3 and gene activation of ESC pluripotency genes. However, when unable to bind RNAs, WDR5 mutant is rapidly turned over, causing loss of H3K4me3 and reduced expression of pluripotency genes. Thus, RNA binding may directly or indirectly regulate protein turnover for epigenetic regulation. It is possible that WDR5 protein that is not properly complexed or localized on chromatin are degraded by default, or WDR5 degradation may be a regulated mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakagawa and Xiong, 2011</xref>). In our study, ability to bind RNAs extends WDR5 protein half-life by an additional 12 hr to approximately 24 hr, which starts to approach the time scale of an entire cell division cycle (especially in ESCs). With the extended protein longevity, lncRNAs may then regulate protein occupancy on chromatin during cellular maintenance, as well as aid in transmission of epigenetic regulators across cell generations. In this manner, lncRNAs may play crucial roles in regulating the multigenerational transmission of epigenetic proteins required for maintenance of cell state.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02046.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for RNA-mediated switch of protein turnover to activate target genes.</title><p>Expressed lncRNAs bind the WDR5 protein to increase protein stabilization on chromatin, which facilitates MLL complex assembly and methyltransferase activity for target gene activation.

Interestingly, the impact of F266A mutation on H3K4me3 level is modest in steady state conditions, but becomes quite striking with transcriptional shutoff of WDR5. We interpret these results to indicate that WDR5 stability is important for the robustness of the active chromatin state, exemplified by H3K4me3. In the absence of stabilized WDR5, H3K4me3 becomes much more sensitive to fluctuations in the transcriptional levels of WDR5 and likely other subunits of the MLL complex.

Cyp33, an allosteric regulator of MLL, also contains a RNA recognition motif, and its regulation of MLL can be controlled in an RNA-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hom et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).

ESCs were fixed for 15 min with 1% formaldehyde in 1xPBS at 25°C. The reaction was stopped by added 1/10<sup>th</sup> the volume of 1.25M Glycine. For a typical RIPiT-seq experiment chromatin was prepared from ∼1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells by thawing previously crosslinked ESC pellets and resuspending in 880 μl of Nuclear Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) supplemented with fresh Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 10 mM PMSF, and RNaseOUT (1:100). Chromatin was sheared in a Covaris E220 ultrasonicator to a size of 200–500 bp. The first IP was performed with 50 μl of FLAG-M2 agarose slurry (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 4 hr at 4°C on rotation. Samples were washed one time 1 ml in series at 4°C for 5 min each with the following buffers: High Stringency Buffer (15 mM Tris–HCl pH 7, 5 mM EDTA pH 8, 2.5 mM EGTA pH 8, 1% Triton-X100, 1% Sodium Deoxycholate, 120 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl), High Salt Buffer (15 mM Tris–HCl pH 7, 5 mM EDTA pH 8, 2.5 mM EGTA pH 8, 1% Triton-X100, 1% Sodium Deoxycholate, 1M NaCl) and NT2 Buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.0005% NP-40).

Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and two peer reviewers, and this decision letter is based on discussions between the reviewers. We consider your work to be of potential importance but feel that you would have to make substantial changes to the manuscript before it could be acceptable for publication. We aim to publish articles with a single round of revision that would typically be accomplished within two months. We are not convinced that you will be able to deal with the criticisms during that time-frame but we are offering you the opportunity to inform us whether it is possible. If you are unable to revise the manuscript appropriately the manuscript will have to be rejected.</p><p>We would offer you the option of resubmitting if you can provide a reasonable response to the three major concerns below with a set of simple additional experiments that can be completed in a reasonable time frame.</p><p>You and your co-workers investigate WDR5, a protein previously demonstrated to bind the lncRNAs HOTTIP and NEST in differentiated cells. Using complementation to replace Wdr5 with wildtype or mutant human WDR5 in mESCs, you show that WDR5 F266A mutation in the lncRNA-binding pocket renders WDR5 unable to maintain stem cell pluripotency and global H3K4Me3 patterns. LncRNAs have been a highlight of post-genomic biology. This work is a timely contribution to understanding lncRNAs, considering that many lncRNA papers are descriptive expression surveys, with few interrogating lncRNA-protein interactions, let alone such interactions’ cellular functions.</p><p>1) However, you did not pursue WDR5 wildtype versus mutant interactions with known WDR5 lncRNA targets, such as HOTTIP, in cells where WDR5 co-occurs with its known targets, for example fibroblasts. Instead, you chose stem cells, which do not express WDR5-interacting lncRNAs. Although functional lncRNAs in pluripotency and differentiation are known (Sheik Mohamed et al., RNA 16: 324-337, 2010), you did not perform WDR5 RIPseq. You should attempt WDR5 RIP-qRTPCR to test for known ES lncRNAs as interactors, then confirm whether any interactions are mediated by the residues implicated in the HOTTIP binding.</p><p>2) The paper does not demonstrate a WDR5-lncRNA interaction essential to stemness. By the your own admission, “As HOTTIP and NeST RNAs are not expressed in ESCs, our results ... imply the existence of other ESC lncRNAs that stabilize WDR5.” Any resubmission should show rather than imply these lncRNAs’ existence, and test whether they interact with WDR5 in a manner abolished by F266A.</p><p>3) The effect of F266A is presented in terms of global H3K4Me3 signatures and expression level differences of multiple cellular state defining factors. This is potentially at odds with the target-specific lncRNA action model, where PRC2-interacting lncRNAs regulate well-defined sets of targets for each RNA, rather than cause global chromatin remodeling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02046.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the reviewers for the positive assessment and insightful critiques; your suggestions have improved the paper. Based on the reviewer comments, we undertook RNA immunoprecipitation experiments to define the set of RNAs bound by WDR5 in embryonic stem cells. The editors were right to guess that this effort took longer than the two months that we initially estimated. But we felt it was important to do the experiment right and be confident with the results (please see detailed information on approach, controls, and interpretation below). We are pleased to submit a revised version of the manuscript. If it is felt that this long revision process mandates consideration of the paper as a new submission, we can understand that decision as well.</p><p><italic>1) However, you did not pursue WDR5 wildtype versus mutant interactions with known WDR5 lncRNA targets, such as HOTTIP, in cells where WDR5 co-occurs with its known targets, for example fibroblasts.

We tested UV-crosslinking with PAR- CLIP, but found that WDR5-RNA interactions have poor inherent UV crosslinking ability. We also found that standard RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) with FLAG epitope gave substantial background that hampered data interpretation. We then turned to RNA:protein immunoprecipitation in tandem (RIPiT), a method designed to identify RNA targets of RBP complexes with poor UV linking capacity (Singh et al., Methods, 2013). Specifically, we fused tandem FLAG and hemagglutinin (HA) tags to wild type WDR5 or the F266A mutant, and generated stable ESC lines expressing either fusion protein at near endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref>). FPLC analysis confirmed that both tandem-tagged WDR5 proteins quantitatively formed equivalent MLL-WDR5 protein complexes with endogenous subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We next performed RIPiT-seq of WDR5 in ESC with formaldehyde crosslinking and tandem IP. We identified over 1400 RNAs that bound WDR5, but importantly not to F266A mutant or vector control (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Thus, a family of ESC RNAs bind WDR5 through the same surface as HOTTIP and NeST, enhancer-like RNAs that act in other cell types. WDR5 binds many types of RNAs including messenger RNAs, lncRNAs, and precursors of small regulatory RNAs, dramatically expanding the known RNA targets of this protein. Importantly, six lncRNA partners of WDR5 are known to be important for ESC pluripotency or differentiation based on published knockdown experiments (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Intriguingly, prior protein interaction surveys with repressive chromatin modification complexes had failed to identify protein partners for these lncRNAs (Guttman et al., Nature, 2011), and their interaction with WDR5-MLL, a complex that enforces active chromatin, provides an explanation for their functions in ESC biology. The four lncRNAs identified by Sheik Mohamed et al. were not enriched in WDR5 RIPiT-seq.</p><p>We found a subset of WDR5-bound lncRNAs are encoded by loci that are also bound on chromatin by WDR5 in cis, while many other WDR5-bound lncRNAs reside in WDR5-free chromosomal loci, suggesting potential roles in trans (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The chromatin binding profiles of WDR5 at cis-RNA bound loci vs RNA-independent loci are indistinguishable as a class, highlighting the value of the RIPiT data set to reveal RNA involvement (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Collectively, the discovery of a family of ESC RNAs that bind WDR5 specifically through a RNA binding pocket will serve as a valuable resource for the field. The defect of the F266A mutant in binding specific lncRNAs required for ESC pluripotency provides a direct mechanistic links to its phenotypes in defective ESC self renewal and ectopic differentiation.</p><p><italic>2) The paper does not demonstrate a WDR5-lncRNA interaction essential to stemness. By the your own admission, “As HOTTIP and NeST RNAs are not expressed in ESCs, our results ... imply the existence of other ESC lncRNAs that stabilize WDR5.” Any resubmission should show rather than imply these lncRNAs’ existence, and test whether they interact with WDR5 in a manner abolished by F266A</italic>.</p><p>As indicated in response to point 1 above, WDR5 RIPiT-seq revealed six lncRNA partners of WDR5 are known to be important for ESC pluripotency or differentiation based on published knockdown experiments (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These lncRNAs bind WT WDR5 but not F266A mutant. Prior protein interaction surveys with repressive chromatin modification complexes had failed to identify partners for these lncRNAs (Guttman et al., Nature, 2011), and their interaction with WDR5-MLL, a complex that enforces active chromatin, provides an explanation for their functions in ESC biology. As an example, linc-1552 is a WDR5-interacting lncRNA that acts in a positive feedback circuit for pluripotency. Oct4 and Nanog bind linc-1552 promoter, and depletion of linc-1552 leads to loss of Nanog and Oct4 expression. This mechanism parallels the one described by Lipovich and colleagues (Sheik Mohamaed et al., RNA, 2010) for four lncRNAs they identified to be important for ESC stemness.</p><p><italic>3) The effect of F266A is presented in terms of global H3K4Me3 signatures and expression level differences of multiple cellular state defining factors. This is potentially at odds with the target-specific lncRNA action model, where PRC2-interacting lncRNAs regulate well-defined sets of targets for each RNA, rather than cause global chromatin remodeling</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for recognizing this crucial point in our paper. The lncRNA field has focused on understanding the function of one lncRNA at a time, and we believe that a strength of our work is the elucidation of the cumulative effects of entire classes of lncRNAs. Using the above example where each PRC2-interacting lncRNA regulates a well-defined set of targets, the entire class of PRC2-interacting lncRNAs likely controls thousands of genes, either positively or negatively (Davidovich et al. and Kaneko et al., NSMB, 2013, cited in text). In this paper, we have elucidated the cumulative effects of the entire class of WDR5-binding RNAs in ES cells by replacing WDR5 WT with a RNA binding-null mutant, and we found that this single perturbation to WDR5-MLL complex results in global changes in H3K4me3 and cell fate, highlighting the importance of RNA input into WDR5.</p></body></sub-article></article>
