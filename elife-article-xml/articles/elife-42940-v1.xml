Various insults activate kinases that phosphorylate the GTPase eIF2 leading to inhibition of its exchange factor eIF2B. Vanishing White Matter (VWM) is a neurological disease caused by eIF2B mutations that, like phosphorylated eIF2, reduce its activity. We show that introduction of a human VWM mutation into mice leads to persistent ISR induction in the central nervous system. ISR activation precedes myelin loss and development of motor deficits. Remarkably, long-term treatment with a small molecule eIF2B activator, 2BAct, prevents all measures of pathology and normalizes the transcriptome and proteome of VWM mice. 2BAct stimulates the remaining activity of mutant eIF2B complex in vivo, abrogating the maladaptive stress response. Thus, 2BAct-like molecules may provide a promising therapeutic approach for VWM and provide relief from chronic ISR induction in a variety of disease contexts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42940.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells must be able to respond to their changing environment in order to survive. When cells encounter particularly unfavorable conditions, they often react by activating a so-called ‘stress’ response. A group of proteins collectively known as eIF2B helps to regulate this response.</p><p>In a severe neurological condition called Vanishing White Matter (VWM), the genes that produce the eIF2B proteins contain mutations that make eIF2B less active.

In 2018, they found that it also works on various mutant forms of eIF2B found in VWM. The molecule had so far only been tested in biochemical laboratory experiments.

It could similarly be used to treat other conditions that activate this abnormal cell stress response.

GTP-bound eIF2 associates with the initiator methionyl tRNA and this ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi) delivers the first amino acid to the ribosome. GTP is hydrolyzed and eIF2-GDP is released, requiring reactivation by eIF2B to enable a new round of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinnebusch and Lorsch, 2012</xref>). Four stress-responsive kinases (PERK, HRI, GCN2 and PKR) that detect diverse insults converge on phosphorylation of eIF2 at serine 51 of the α subunit (eIF2α). Phosphorylation converts eIF2 from a substrate of eIF2B into its competitive inhibitor, triggering the integrated stress response (ISR), which reduces translation initiation events and decreases global protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang and Hinnebusch, 1996</xref>). Concomitantly, the ISR induces the translation of a small set of mRNAs with special sequences in their 5’ untranslated regions, including the transcription factor ATF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watatani et al., 2008</xref>). ATF4 triggers a stress-induced transcriptional program that is thought to promote cell survival during mild or acute conditions but can contribute to pathological changes under severe or chronic insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Vanishing White Matter (VWM; OMIM 603896) is a rare, autosomal recessive leukodystrophy that is driven by mutations in eIF2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leegwater et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van der Knaap et al., 2002</xref>). The disease is characterized by myelin loss, progressive neurological symptoms such as ataxia, spasticity, cognitive deterioration and ultimately, death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schiffmann et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van der Knaap et al., 1997</xref>). Age of VWM onset is variable and predictive of disease progression, ranging from severe prenatal/infantile onset leading to death in months (as in the case of ‘Cree leukoencephalopathy’) to slower-progressing adult onset presentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fogli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamilton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Knaap et al., 2006</xref>). Because eIF2B is essential, VWM mutations are restricted to partial loss-of-function in any of the five subunits of the decameric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fogli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horzinski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Nearly 200 different mutations have been catalogued to date in the Human Gene Mutation Database, which occur as homozygotes or compound heterozygotes with a different mutation in each allele of the same subunit. Reduction of eIF2B activity is analogous to its inhibition by phosphorylated eIF2α, thus it is congruent and compelling that ISR activation has been observed in VWM patient post-mortem samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van der Voorn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Kollenburg et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that a range of VWM mutations destabilize the eIF2B decamer, leading to compromised GEF activity in both recombinant complexes and endogenous protein from cell lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). We demonstrated that the small molecule eIF2B activator ISRIB (for <underline>ISR</underline> inh<underline>ib</underline>itor) stabilized the decameric form of both wild-type (WT) and VWM mutant complexes, boosting their intrinsic activity. Notably, ISRIB bridges the symmetric dimer interface of the eIF2B central core, acting as a molecular stapler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zyryanova et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, we showed that ISRIB attenuated ISR activation and restored protein synthesis in cells carrying VWM mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wong et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although we found that ISRIB rescued the stability and activity of VWM mutant eIF2B in vitro, the ability of this class of molecules to prevent pathology in vivo remained an unanswered question. Knock-in mouse models of human VWM mutations have been characterized, and the severe mutations recapitulate key disease phenotypes such as progressive loss of white matter with concomitant manifestation of motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geva et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we generate an improved tool molecule and demonstrate that sustained eIF2B activation blocks maladaptive induction of the ISR and prevents all evaluated disease phenotypes in a VWM mouse model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2BAct is a novel eIF2B activator with improved in vivo properties in rodents</title><p>To interrogate efficacy in vivo, we sought a small molecule eIF2B activator with improved solubility and pharmacokinetics relative to ISRIB. To that end, we synthesized 2BAct, which has a differentiated bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl core and, unlike ISRIB, is no longer symmetric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). 2BAct is a highly selective eIF2B activator and exhibited similar potency to ISRIB in a cell-based reporter assay that measures ISR attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). 2BAct is able to penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) (unbound brain/plasma ratio ~0.3) and also demonstrated dose-dependent oral bioavailability using an aqueous-based vehicle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Additionally, 2BAct is well-suited for formulation in diet, enabling long-term dosing without effects on body weight in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The molecule was well-tolerated in the animal studies described here, and did not elicit any relevant effects in a rat cardiovascular (CV) safety study; however, significant anomalies were observed in a dog CV model. This CV safety liability makes this particular molecule unsuitable for human dosing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42940.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>2BAct normalized body weight gain and prevented motor deficits in male R191H mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structure of 2BAct and ATF4-luciferase reporter assay EC50.

The impaired GEF activity of mutant eIF2B underlies the observed translational upregulation of the transcription factor ATF4 and in turn, induction of a maladaptive ISR program that precedes behavioral pathology. Our data demonstrate that a subset of astrocytes possess a basal ISR in normal mice, which is further activated when eIF2B is mutated. Notably, we also detected ISR upregulation in other non-neuronal cell populations, including myelinating oligodendrocytes. Histological analysis has shown that white matter astrocytes, but not grey matter astrocytes, are dysmorphic and a subset of oligodendrocytes are characterized as foamy in VWM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hata et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wong et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, Bergman glia, astrocytes found in the cerebellum, and Muller glia, astrocytes found in the retina, were shown to be severely affected in patients and in VWM mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dooves et al., 2018</xref>). In agreement with histology, scRNA-seq of two brain regions identified astrocyte subtypes with exacerbated ISR induction in R191H. As cells in the brain are highly interconnected, cellular and metabolic dysfunction in astrocytes could lead to malfunction in other cell types such as the myelinating oligodendrocytes. Whether ISR activation in the non-astrocytic cells is cell-autonomous or triggered by signals from astrocytes remains to be explored.</p><p>Among the ATF4 targets revealed by both transcriptomics and proteomics are solute transporters (SLC1A4, SLC1A5, SLC3A2, SLC7A1, SLC7A3, SLC7A5, SLC7A11) and metabolic enzymes (ASNS, CTH, CBS, PLPP4, PHGDH, PSAT1, PSPH, SHMT2 and MTHFD2), and their upregulation is likely to disrupt cellular functions in the CNS. Interestingly, ATF4 is chronically induced in various mouse models of mitochondrial dysfunction, and mutations in human mitochondrial proteins can lead to loss of myelin or leukoencephalopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dogan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mendes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moisoi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pereira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quirós et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>). An important question for future investigation is whether these diseases are also characterized by a chronic ISR that may be protective or maladaptive, and which cell types are susceptible to its induction.</p><p>The induction of <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic> and <italic>Sesn2</italic>, two negative regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway, suggests that impairment of translation in VWM may extend beyond the direct effect of crippled eIF2B activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budanov and Karin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolfson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yanagiya et al., 2012</xref>). We speculate that inhibition of the eIF2 and mTOR pathways could lead to a dual brake on protein synthesis. If protein synthesis is globally reduced by chronic ISR activation in oligodendrocytes, this could directly disrupt maintenance of the myelin sheath.</p><p>The ISR signature of VWM mice is unique as it originates downstream of the canonical sensor, that is eIF2α phosphorylation by stress-responsive kinases. Thus, it provides insight into the transcriptional and proteomic changes driven by the response in vivo in the absence of exogenously applied pleiotropic stressors. In contrast to ISR induction via stress-responsive kinases, the negative feedback loop elicited by both the constitutive CREP-containing and the ISR-inducible GADD34-containing eIF2α phosphatases is not effective in attenuating the response in VWM. Therefore, it constitutes a ‘locked-on’ ISR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, the system can still respond to further stress, as seen in VWM patients wherein provoking factors (e.g. febrile infections or head trauma) exacerbate the disease and lead to poorer outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamilton et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>2BAct had a normalizing effect on the transcriptome, proteome, myelin content, microglial activation, body weight and motor function of R191H VWM animals. Long-term administration of 2BAct starting at ~8 weeks of age is a preventative treatment paradigm. Beginning treatment at later time points would likely result in ISR attenuation, as we predict that eIF2B activation by 2BAct is age-independent. However, the degree of pathological amelioration in a therapeutic mode would likely depend on the extent of neuronal damage and myelin perturbation in the nervous system at the start of treatment. The accrued damage in turn would depend on the severity of the eIF2B mutant allele and the time elapsed since disease onset.</p><p>The remyelination capacity of humans and mice is likely to differ significantly, thus the therapeutic value of eIF2B activators in VWM is best interrogated in the clinic. The small molecule 2BAct has cardiovascular liabilities at a minimal efficacious dose and is not suitable for human dosing. Therefore, therapeutic testing of this class of molecules awaits the generation of a suitable candidate. Nevertheless, ISRIB has shown beneficial effects in mouse models when administered either acutely or for short periods of time by intraperitoneal delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Halliday et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The improved in vivo properties of 2BAct make it an ideal molecule to interrogate the efficacy of this mechanism of action in rodent disease models that require long-term dosing, including those characterized by chronic activation of any of the four eIF2α kinases.</p><p>We and others previously demonstrated that stabilizing the decameric complex can boost the intrinsic GEF activity of both WT and various VWM mutant eIF2B complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). To date, all tested VWM mutations have responded to eIF2B activators in vitro. Here, we show that increased GEF activity can compensate in vivo under conditions where a severe mutation leads to both decreased levels of eIF2B complex and reduced intrinsic activity. Furthermore, 2BAct also shut off the ISR in vivo in mice bearing an <italic>Eif2b5</italic><sup>R132H/R132H</sup> VWM mutation. Although it is possible to introduce artificial mutations into eIF2B that interfere with the compound binding site, no VWM mutations are known to exist in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sekine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). Based on this, we anticipate that 2BAct-like compounds may be broadly efficacious across the range of mutations identified in the VWM patient population. Finally, our results demonstrate that eIF2B activation is a sound strategy for shutting off the ISR in vivo. This raises the possibility that various diseases exhibiting a maladaptive ISR could be responsive to this mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>R191H VWM <break/>mouse model</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td><italic>Eif2b5</italic><sup>R191H/R191H</sup> <break/>mutation <break/>in <break/>C57BL/6J background</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>R132H VWM <break/>mouse model</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td><italic>Eif2b5</italic><sup>R132H/R132H</sup> mutation <break/>in <break/>C57BL/6J background</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>2BAct</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>Synthesized <break/>in-house</td></tr><tr><td> Cell line <break/>(<italic>H.sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T with <break/>ATF4-Luc reporter</td><td>PMID: 23741617</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td>Quantigene Plex <break/>2.0 assay</td><td>Thermo <break/>Fisher Scientific</td><td/><td>Custom <break/>gene panel</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td>ONE-GLO <break/>luciferase <break/>assay system</td><td>Promega</td><td>#E6120</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal <break/>anti-MBP</td><td>abcam</td><td>#ab40390 <break/>(RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11141521">AB_11141521</ext-link>)</td><td>IHC 5 ug/ml;

Reported p-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mice were deeply anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> and rapidly fixed by transcardiac perfusion with normal saline followed by 10% formalin. Brains and spinal cords were excised and allowed to post-fix in formalin for an additional 2 hr. Samples were processed for paraffin embedding, sectioned at 6 µm, and mounted on adhesive-coated slides. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out using the antibodies described in the Key Resources Table and species-appropriate polymer detection systems (ImmPRESS HRP, Vector Laboratories), and developed with 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) followed by hematoxylin counterstaining. For GFAP, DAB development was enhanced with nickel. Myelin staining by Luxol Fast Blue was carried out by the Klüver-Barrera method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kluver and Barrera, 1953</xref>). Sections were dehydrated through successive ethanol solutions, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped using xylene-based mounting media.</p><p>To examine histopathological endpoints in the brain, sections from two coronal levels of the corpus callosum were examined beginning at approximately Bregma + 0.7 and+1.0 mm. For the spinal cord, coronal sections from cervical and thoracic levels were examined. Image capture and analysis was achieved using either a 3DHISTECH Pannoramic 250 Digital Slide Scanner (20X, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and HALO image analysis software (version 2.1.1637.26, Indica Labs), or a BX-51 microscope fitted with a DP80 camera (10X) and cellSens image analysis software (Olympus). The same parameters for microscopy and image analysis were uniformly applied to all images for each endpoint. For the spinal cord, the mean area fraction from a single section from both the cervical and thoracic levels served as the value for each subject to normalize to the different size of the anatomical levels. For the corpus callosum, the mean area of positive staining from a single section at each coronal level served as the value for each subject. Data were analyzed by one-way (for single time point experiments) or two-way ANOVA (for multiple time point experiments). Reported p-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Holm-Sidak method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA isolation</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from ~20 mg pieces of each frozen tissue, with a minimum of one extraction performed from each sample. All steps were performed on dry ice prior to the addition of 350 µL of RTL Buffer + 40 µM DTT. Samples were homogenized at 4°C using a Qiagen TissueLyser II (Retsch, Castleford, UK) for 2 × 2 min intervals at 30 Hz with the addition of one 5 mm stainless steel bead (Qiagen catalog # 69965). This was followed by incubation in a Vortemp 56 (Labnet International, Edison, NJ) at 65°C with shaking (300 rpm). The samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 5 min. RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions, eluting in 30 µL nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O. RNA concentration and purity were determined spectrophotometrically.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>QuantiGene plex 2.0 assay</title><p>To measure multiplexed transcript expression levels, we designed a custom QuantiGene Plex Panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flagella et al., 2006</xref>) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Either purified RNA or crude lysates (~15–20 mg of frozen tissue, homogenized using the QuantiGene 2.0 Sample Processing Kit) were used since comparable results were achieved in a head-to-head comparison with a set of samples (data not shown). RNA or tissue homogenates were then subjected to the QuantiGene assay following manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, this involved: (1) capturing target RNAs to corresponding genes on specified beads through an overnight hybridization; (2) a second hybridization to capture the biotinylated label probes for signal amplification; and (3) a final hybridization to capture the SAPE reagent, which emits a fluorescent signal from each bead set. Signal intensities for each bead set, proportional to the number of captured target RNA molecules, were read on a Luminex Flexmap 3D (Luminex, Northbrook, IL). To control for differences in total RNA input between reactions, background-subtracted output data were normalized to the mean of two housekeeping genes, RPL13A and RPL19. The final data are presented as fold-change for each gene relative to the mean of the corresponding WT samples. Data were analyzed in Prism. Student’s t-test was performed for the panel of genes comparing R191H to WT for each time point and brain region. Reported p-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Holm-Sidak method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing</title><p>RNA-seq libraries were prepared using purified RNA isolated as described above. RNA quality and concentration were assayed using a Fragment Analyzer instrument. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit paired with the Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument. For the experiment comparing different ages, N = 3 males/genotype/time point. For the 4-week 2BAct treatment experiment, N = 3 females/condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>RNA-seq data analysis</title><p>RNA-seq library mapping and estimation of expression levels were computed as follows. Reads were mapped with STAR aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>), version 2.5.3a, to the mm10 reference mouse genome and the Gencode vM12 primary assembly annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mudge and Harrow, 2015</xref>), to which non-redundant UCSC transcripts were added, using the two-round read-mapping approach. This means that following a first read-mapping round of each library, the splice-junction coordinates reported by STAR, across all libraries, are fed as input to the second round of read mapping. The parameters used in both read-mapping rounds are: outSAMprimaryFlag =‘AllBestScore’, outFilterMultimapNmax =‘10’, outFilterMismatchNoverLmax =‘0.05’, outFilterIntronMotifs =‘RemoveNoncanonical’. Following read-mapping, transcript and gene expression levels were estimated using MMSEQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Turro et al., 2011</xref>). Transcripts and genes which were minimally distinguishable according to the read data were collapsed using the mmcollapse utility of MMDIFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turro et al., 2014</xref>), and the Fragments Per Kilobase Million (FPKM) expression units were converted to Transcript Per Million (TPM) units.</p><p>In order to test for differential expression between the R191H and WT samples, for each of the three time points, we used MMDIFF with a design matrix corresponding to two groups without extraneous variables. In order to test whether R191H relative to the WT fold-change varied between each of the two consecutive time points (i.e., 5 months vs. 2 months, and 7 months vs. 5 months), we used MMDIFF with the following design matrix testing whether the fold-change between groups A and B (e.g: R191H and WT at 5 months) is different from the fold-change between groups C and D (e.g: R191H and WT at 2 months): # M 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0; # C 0 0, 0 0, 0 0, 0 1, 0 1, 0 1; # P0 1; # P1 1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1. Genes were ranked in descending order according to the Bayes factor and the posterior probability, reported by MMDIFF.</p><p>Singular value decomposition analyses were carried out using R’s SVD function. The right singular vectors of the decomposition, referred to as eigengenes, are used to capture the canonical gene expression patters in the data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alter et al., 2000</xref>). We applied a threshold on the absolute gene loading values defined as two-fold the mean of all absolute values. For GO-term enrichment, analyses were carried out using the online tool at geneontology.org (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2017</xref>).

Tissues were dissociated by incubation in 2 mg/mL papain solution (BrainBits, Springfield, IL) for 30 min at 37°C with agitation, followed by trituration. To remove large debris, suspensions were successively passed through 100 μm and 40 μm strainers. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 280 x g, and pellets were subjected to the Miltenyi Debris Removal protocol with Debris Removal solution according to manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Following this, cells were re-filtered through a 40 μm Flowmi cell strainer (Belart, Wayne, NJ).</p><p>Single cell RNA-seq libraries were created using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library and Gel Bead Kit v2 and associated consumables (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA).~7000 cells per sample were loaded onto the Chromium microfluidic chip for an expected recovery of 4000 cells per sample. Manufacturer’s instructions were followed for library preparation, and cDNAs were amplified for 12 cycles. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>scRNA-seq data analysis</title><p>scRNA-seq fastq files were demultiplexed to their respective barcodes using the 10X Genomics Cell Ranger mkfastq utility. Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) counts were generated for each barcode using the Cell Ranger count utility, with the mm10 reference mouse genome used for mapping reads. For each sample, barcodes that were not likely to represent captured cells were filtered out by detecting the first local minimum above two in a distribution of log<sub>10</sub>(UMIs).</p><p>To identify cell clusters, the four samples were concatenated and we defined genes with variable expression dispersion using Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler et al., 2018</xref>), which resulted in 2622 genes. PCA was performed on these genes using the rsvd R package to reduce the dimensionality of the data, retaining the 50 PCs explaining the highest amount of variation. We then used Seurat’s methodology to build a Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) graph of these cell-embedding data, first generating a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) graph using K = min(750,#cells-1) and a Jaccard distance cutoff of 1/15. The SNN graph was then used as input to the Louvain algorithm, implemented in the ModularityOptimizer software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Waltman and van Eck, 2013</xref>). Since this implementation uses a resolution parameter that strongly affects the number of clusters, we searched the 0.05–1.225 range of this parameter, using the mean unifiability isolability clustering metric as our maximization parameter. This process was initially done on all cells in our data, and subsequently repeated for each cluster individually, in an iterative manner where convergence was defined as not being able to break down a cluster into sub-clusters. This resulted in 10 and 13 clusters in the cerebellum and forebrain, respectively.</p><p>In order to obtain gene markers for each cluster, we ran a differential expression test implemented in Seurat (using a likelihood ratio test between a model that assumes that a gene’s expression values of two compared clusters values were sampled from two distributions, versus a null model which assumes they were sampled from a single distribution). A marker gene of a given cluster was defined as a gene which was found to be significantly overexpressed (adjusted p-value&lt;0.05) in that cluster compared to all other clusters.</p><p>In order to assign cell identities to our identified clusters, we utilized published bulk RNA-seq gene expression data obtained by cell sorting of major brain cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koirala and Corfas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). For each gene that is a cell-type marker in the list compiled from the published data and is expressed in a cluster, we computed its mean expression level across all cells of the cluster and multiplied it by the fraction of cells it was captured in. We then summed these gene scores across all markers of the cell type that are expressed in the cluster of interest and divide that sum by the number of markers of that cell type to account for possible ascertainment biases (as some cell types may have many more markers than others). Finally, we scaled the cell-type scores of each cluster to sum up to one and hence reflect probabilities. Whenever a probability was higher than 0.5, we assigned the identity of that cluster to be of the high probability cell type.</p><p>In order to detect whether ISR activation is cell-type-specific in the WT samples, for each gene in each cluster we performed a differential expression analysis between that cluster and all other clusters as described above. Since the clustering analysis using both WT and R191H samples (described above) found that transcriptionally defined clusters are not influenced by genotype, we used these cluster assignments for the WT, as independent clustering of the WT data alone was not powered enough to obtain the same clustering as when performed on both genotypes. Subsequently, for each cluster we performed a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), using the fgsea R package, with our ISR gene lists – one derived from the CLIC analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2017</xref>) and a manually curated list of ATF4 targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1D</xref>), as the gene sets. In order to detect whether ISR activation is cell type-specific between WT and R191H, for each cluster in the combined WT and R191H data, for each gene in each cluster we performed a differential expression analysis contrasting the cells that correspond to the two genotypes. We subsequently performed the ISR GSEA for each cluster.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Proteomics</title><p>Frozen brain samples were lysed with 0.9 mL 50 mM HEPES, 75 mM NaCl, 3% SDS, pH 8.5 + protease/phosphatase inhibitors and homogenized using a Qiagen TissueLyser II for 8 cycles at 20 Hz. Samples were then sonicated for 5 min. Lysates were centrifuged (16,000 x g, 5 min) to remove cellular debris. Proteins were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol (56°C, 30 min) and alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide (room temperature, 30 min). Excess iodoacetamide was quenched with 5 mM dithiothreitol (room temperature, 30 min). Proteins were precipitated by sequential addition of 4 volumes methanol, 1 vol chloroform and three volumes water, with vigorous vortexing in between. Protein pellets were washed with methanol, air-dried, and resuspended in 50 mM HEPES, 8 M urea, pH 8.5. The samples were then diluted to 4 M urea and digested with Lys-C protease (25°C, 15 hr; WAKO Chemicals, Richmond, VA). The urea concentration was then diluted to 1 M and the samples were digested with trypsin (37°C, 6 hr; Promega, Madison, WI).</p><p>After protein digestion, samples were acidified with 10% trifluoroacetic acid and desalted using C18 solid-phase extraction columns (SepPak). Samples were eluted with 40% acetonitrile/0.5% acetic acid followed by 80% acetonitrile/0.5% acetic acid, and dried overnight under vacuum at 30°C. Peptide concentrations were measured using a Pierce BCA assay, split into 50 µg aliquots, and dried under vacuum.</p><p>Dried peptides were resuspended in 50 µL 200 mM HEPES/30% anhydrous acetonitrile. 5 mg TMT reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were dissolved in 250 µL anhydrous acetonitrile, of which 10 µL was added to peptides. TMT reagent 131 was reserved for the ‘bridge’ sample and the other TMT reagents (126, 127 c, 127 n, 128 c, 128 n, 129 c, 129 n, 130 c and 130 n) were used to label the individual samples. Following incubation at room temperature for 1 hr, the reaction was quenched with 200 mM HEPES/5% hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v). TMT-labeled amples were acidified with 50 µL 1% trifluoroacetic acid and pooled into 11-plex TMT samples at equal ratios, desalted with SepPak, and dried under vacuum.</p><p>Pooled TMT-labeled peptides were fractionated using high pH RP-HPLC. Samples were resuspended in 5% formic acid/5% acetonitrile and fractionated over a ZORBAX extended C18 column (Agilent, 4.6 mm ID x 250 mm length, 5 µm particles). Peptides were separated on a 75 min linear gradient from 5% to 35% acetonitrile in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min on an Agilent 1260 Infinity pump (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). The samples were fractionated into a total of 96 fractions, and then consolidated into 12 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edwards and Haas, 2016</xref>). Samples were dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 5% formic acid/4% acetonitrile for LC-MS/MS processing.</p><p>Peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Easy-nLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a microcapillary column (100 µm ID x 25 cm length, filled in-house with Maccel C18 AQ resin, 1.8 µm, 120 A; Sepax Technologies). The total LC-MS run length for each sample was 180 min comprising a 165 min gradient from 6–30% acetonitrile in 0.125% formic acid. The flow rate was 300 nL/min and the column was heated to 60°C. Data-dependent acquisition mode was used for mass spectrometry data collection. A high resolution MS1 scan in the Orbitrap (m/z range = 500–1200, resolution = 60,000; AGC = 5×10<sup>5</sup>; max injection time = 100 ms; RF for S-lens = 30) was collected, from which the top 10 precursors were selected for MS2 analysis followed by MS3 analysis. For MS2 spectra, ions were isolated using a 0.5 m/z window using the mass filter. The MS2 scan was performed in the quadrupole ion trap (CID, AGC = 1×10<sup>4</sup>, normalized collision energy = 30%, max injection time = 35 ms) and the MS3 scan was analyzed in the Orbitrap (HCD, resolution = 60,000; max AGC = 5×10<sup>4</sup>; max injection time = 250 ms; normalized collision energy = 50). For TMT reporter ion quantification, up to six fragment ions from each MS2 spectrum were selected for MS3 analysis using synchronous precursor selection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Proteomics data analysis</title><p>Mass spectrometry data were processed using an in-house software pipeline as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huttlin et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, raw files were converted to mzXML files and searched against a composite mouse Uniprot database (downloaded on 9 May 2017) containing sequences in forward and reverse orientations using the Sequest algorithm. Database searching matched MS/MS spectra with fully tryptic peptides from this composite dataset with a precursor ion tolerance of 20 ppm and a product ion tolerance of 0.6 Da. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.02146 Da) and TMT tags of peptide N-termini (+229.162932 Da) were set as static modifications. Oxidation of methionines (+15.99492 Da) was set as a variable modification. Linear discriminant analysis was used to filter peptide spectral matches to a 1% FDR (false discovery rate). Non-unique peptides that matched to multiple proteins were assigned to proteins that contained the largest number of matched redundant peptides sequences.</p><p>Quantification of TMT reporter ion intensities was performed by extracting the most intense ion within a 0.003 m/z window at the predicted m/z value for each reporter ion. TMT spectra were used for quantification when the sum of the signal-to-noise for all the reporter ions was greater than 200 and the isolation specificity was greater than 0.75 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ting et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Peptide-level data from each 11-plex was column-normalized to have equivalent geometric means and protein level estimates were obtained by fitting a previously described compositional Bayesian model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O'Brien et al., 2018</xref>). For each protein, log<sub>2</sub> fold-changes are estimated as the posterior means from the model.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joseph Gleeson as the Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Raphael Schiffmann (Reviewer #1); Yuanyi Feng (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Wong et al. provide convincing evidence that the eIF2B activator (also termed stapler) 2BAct, a newly synthesized brain-permeable eIF2B activator compound, initiated in around age 6 weeks effectively prevents behavioral, pathological as well as gene expression and proteomics abnormalities in a mouse model of eIF2B-related disorder (variably termed VWM or CACH). The authors recently have shown that an eIF2B activator ISRIB can boost eIF2B activity and attenuate ISR in vitro.</p><p>This study demonstrates the efficacy 2BAct in vivo in a newly-generated VWM mouse model (R191H mice). VWM is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of eIF2B, a GEF for the translational initiator eIF2 and an inhibitor of eIF2's phosphorylation. The main pathology of VWM involves myelin loss, leading to multiple progressive neurological symptoms or death. Given that eIF2a phosphorylation is the core event for integrated stress response (ISR), which reduce protein synthesis and that IRS activation has been observed in VWM postmortem specimen and is considered as a maladaptive response due to eIF2B deficiency, restoring eIF2B function is thus expected to suppress the maladaptive ISR in VWM and ameliorate VWM symptoms. Data presented by the manuscript show that 2BAct can restore the body weight, improve motor functions, and reduce myelin loss and reactive gliosis of R191H mice. mRNA/transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that 2BAct attenuated the elevated ISR and reduced ATF4 target gene expression in R191H mice. TMT-MS data also support the reduced ISR and largely rescued brain proteome by 2BAct. These data are quite compelling and together support the efficacy of 2BAct in vivo. They demonstrate the feasibility of developing eIF2B activators to treat VWM and can also provided new insight into the pharmacological modulation of ISR signaling in other pathological conditions, such as inflammation, diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The data sets appear to be complete and will likely be of use and interest to the broader community.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It seems that at least as far as the onset of the disease is concerned it is the lower rate of protein synthesis that causes the disease rather than abnormal stress response. The authors variably refer to one or the other. Cabilly et al. Plos One 2012 suggests that rapid protein synthesis is a major problem. The lack of significant upregulation of gadd34 in the first 2.5 also supports protein synthesis defect as the problem here rather than maladaptive stress response. Wong et al. also importantly found that the process of myelination is not source for ER stress. But in subsection “A chronic ISR in the CNS of VWM mice is prevented by 2BAct” – it is not surprising that there is no ISR since maximal eIF2B GEF activity should eliminate ISR. On the other hand, in the first paragraph of the Discussion they emphasize the role of ATF4 target genes as a main culprit in causing CNS dysfunction. So is it global protein synthesis or upregulation/downregulation of ISR genes or both?</p><p>2) What will happen upon exposure to an exogenous stressor in the presence of ISRIB, which acts to avoid ISR? Will it prevent cellular rescue? The activator/stapler eliminates one aspect that is the inappropriate stress response due to the mutation but possibly also the 'appropriate' stress response associated with inhibition by eIF2-p. Will the authors perform such experiments in the near future (I am not asking for additional such experiments for this paper)? If the activation by an ISRIB is potent, why wouldn't it lead to cell death when exposed to exogenous stressors.</p><p>3) Why did the author perform almost all their experiments on the cerebellum (and spinal cord), not a major part of the brain affected by this disease (and not the cerebrum)? Is this a typo? The word 'cerebrum' does not appear anywhere in the text. What happens to the cerebral tissue?</p><p>4) This 'therapeutic approach' will only work when the effect of the mutation is mainly through de-stabilizing the decameric complex. If the mutation disturbs (is close to) the active site, it may not respond to ISRIB. Authors should mention the frequency and location of the various human mutations, to give readers a sense of the therapeutic potential.</p><p>5) To further improve the manuscript, I would like to see more quantitative measurements of gliosis, neuroinflammation, and myelination rather than the IHC data presented in Figure 2. It will also be better to include additional data to show the effect of 2BAct on WT mice and/or WT cells with respect to ISR, as this will further validate the target specificity and therapeutic safety of 2BAct.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42940.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It seems that at least as far as the onset of the disease is concerned it is the lower rate of protein synthesis that causes the disease rather than abnormal stress response.

Reduction of ternary complex by inhibition of eIF2B activity both reduces global protein synthesis and enables the uORF-driven mechanism that promotes ATF4 ORF translation. However, the sensitivity of the two outputs differs – a small reduction in ternary complex concentration causes a small decrease in global protein synthesis, yet it is sufficient to trigger a switch-like response in ATF4 expression as well as expression of other translational targets. Under most conditions of physiological stress (including VWM), the reduction in global mRNA translation is likely small. Thus, we propose that it is the chronic ISR activation that is the major driver of progressive CNS pathology. However, a combined effect of translational induction of ISR targets such as ATF4 and ATF5 and the reduction of bulk protein synthesis rates could be driving the pathological changes.</p><p>Cabilly et al. used a mouse model of VWM (eIF2B5<sup>R132H</sup>) that has a very mild phenotype. They used LPS, which is a severe systemic stress, to reveal a deficiency in these mice. Under these conditions, the contribution of reduced protein synthesis to a particular phenotype is likely to be more significant. This might also be the case for patients who encounter acute stresses.</p><p>We generated the VWM mouse model used by Cabilly et al. and have included new data analyzing the effect of 2BAct in these mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). We measured a very small induction of the ISR in their brains, consistent with the mild behavioral phenotype and normal lifespan observed in these mice (Geva et al., 2010). As is the case for R191H, 2BAct fully normalized the expression of ISR targets in this model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What will happen upon exposure to an exogenous stressor in the presence of ISRIB, which acts to avoid ISR? Will it prevent cellular rescue? The activator/stapler eliminates one aspect that is the inappropriate stress response due to the mutation but possibly also the 'appropriate' stress response associated with inhibition by eIF2-p. Will the authors perform such experiments in the near future (I am not asking for additional such experiments for this paper)? If the activation by an ISRIB is potent, why wouldn't it lead to cell death when exposed to exogenous stressors.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an important consideration for all researchers working with ISR inhibitors (or small molecule eIF2B activators), as well as for the clinical development of this class of molecules.</p><p>Ourin vitro data suggest that high levels of phospho-eIF2α suppress eIF2B activity even in the presence of ISRIB (Wong et al., 2018). This is likely due to the sequestration of all available eIF2B by the high concentration of phospho-eIF2α in the assay. As eIF2 is in excess of eIF2B in cells, this is a plausible scenario in vivo. However, whether various physiological stressors produce sufficiently high level of eIF2α phosphorylation remains to be explored.</p><p>If a stress is sufficiently high as to block the effect of an eIF2B activator, we would expect the “appropriate” stress response to continue functioning. However, if the stress does not reach the threshold, eIF2B activators could exacerbate the effect, as suggested by the reviewer. The eIF2:eIF2B ratio, as well as the amount of eIF2α phosphorylated, is likely to be cell-type dependent. Thus, the threshold at which different cells/tissues will experience a potential loss of eIF2B activator’s effects will be variable. In the future, we plan to conduct further experiments to examine this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why did the author perform almost all their experiments on the cerebellum (and spinal cord), not a major part of the brain affected by this disease (and not the cerebrum)? Is this a typo? The word 'cerebrum' does not appear anywhere in the text. What happens to the cerebral tissue?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed targeted gene expression analysis on all regions of the brain (cerebellum in Figure 3A; forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain of cerebrum in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A) and found little difference between the regions with respect to ISR induction. Based on this, we used the cerebellum for further analysis for four reasons:</p><p>1) Cerebellar ataxia is a classical phenotype of the disease (van der Knaap et al., 2006; Bugiani et al., 2010)</p><p>2) Bergmann glia are reported to be involved in VWM pathology (Dooves et al., 2017).</p><p>3) Ease of isolation of the tissue</p><p>4) Reduced chance of confounding results as it does not involve a “mixture” of brain regions</p><p>We analyzed the spinal cord as it has been reported to show significant pathology in both mutant mice as well as VWM patients (Meoded et al., <italic>Neuropediatrics</italic> 2011;Leferink et al., 2018). Our spinal cord data are consistent with existing evidence, as we observed the greatest degree of ISR induction and histological pathology in this tissue.</p><p>Finally, we have added new single-cell RNA-seq data from two brain regions, forebrain and cerebellum (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplements 1-3). Notably, our analysis implicates astrocyte populations (and specifically Bergmann glia in the cerebellum) as the primary source of ISR activation in both tissues. To our knowledge, this represents the first unbiased identification of astrocytes as the likely causal cell population in this VWM mouse model, and corroborates IHC findings by others. We also observe lesser but significant ISR induction in other non-neuronal cell types, suggesting that these cells may also contribute to disease progression. Notably, the basal expression level of ISR targets is higher in the astrocyte population than in other cell types, which may explain their heightened sensitivity to the eIF2B mutation. These findings will guide further studies with human post-mortem tissues to delve into the causal cell populations in the human disease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) This 'therapeutic approach' will only work when the effect of the mutation is mainly through de-stabilizing the decameric complex. If the mutation disturbs (is close to) the active site, it may not respond to ISRIB. Authors should mention the frequency and location of the various human mutations, to give readers a sense of the therapeutic potential.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously showed that eIF2B activators can boost the GEF activity of five different VWM mutations in various subunits of the eIF2B complex, including one (eIF2B5<sup>R136H</sup>) that did not have apparent in vitro defects in decamer stability or enzymatic activity (Wong et al., 2018). As discussed in point 1 above, 2BAct also rescued the mild ISR of the eIF2B5<sup>R132H</sup> mutant in vivo. Thus, eIF2B activators have worked on all mutations tested to date, including one whose defect is not captured by our in vitro assays.</p><p>It is possible to introduce non-naturally occurring mutations that block ISRIB binding to eIF2B (Sekine et al., 2015; Wong et al., 2018; Tsai et al., 2018). However, to date, no VWM mutations have been identified in the ISRIB/2BAct-binding region of eIF2B. We have updated the last paragraph of our Discussion section to encompass these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) To further improve the manuscript, I would like to see more quantitative measurements of gliosis, neuroinflammation, and myelination rather than the IHC data presented in Figure 2. It will also be better to include additional data to show the effect of 2BAct on WT mice and/or WT cells with respect to ISR, as this will further validate the target specificity and therapeutic safety of 2BAct.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured myelination in two independent ways (Luxol Fast Blue and MBP staining) in both the cerebellum and spinal cord (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1; spinal cord MBP data newly added). We also used two different markers each to measure gliosis (GFAP and Olig2) and inflammation (ATF3 and Iba-1). We note that the magnitudes of our observed changes are large, and given the large number of samples analyzed (6 males and 6 females per condition), highly significant. Thus, we believe that our data represent accurate quantitative measurements. Furthermore, our RNA-seq data (Figure 3 and Supplementary File 1C) revealed decreased expression of myelination- and glial-related genes, which was rescued by 2BAct. Collectively, we believe the data are all internally consistent and adequately support our conclusions.</p><p>With respect to the target specificity of eIF2B activators, we have included new data (Figure 4—figure supplement 2) comparing gene expression in placebo- and 2BAct-treated WT mice. The heatmap of RNA-seq data shows that 2BAct-treated mice have similar transcriptomes to and do not cluster away from placebo-treated mice. The volcano plot reiterates this point by plotting the differential expression of 2BAct-treated vs. placebo-treated samples. Thus, eIF2B activators do not elicit gene expression changes under normal conditions. We re-emphasize that 2BAct itself is not a suitable therapeutic for humans due to CV liabilities. Other eIF2B activators that may be generated in the future will require in vivo testing for on- and off-target effects on a case-by-case basis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
