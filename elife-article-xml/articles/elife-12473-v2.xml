These parasites live in the vasculature, producing eggs that spur a variety of chronic, potentially life-threatening, pathologies exacerbated by the long lifespan of schistosomes, that can thrive in the host for decades. How schistosomes maintain their longevity in this immunologically hostile environment is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that somatic stem cells in <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> are biased towards generating a population of cells expressing factors associated exclusively with the schistosome host-parasite interface, a structure called the tegument. We show cells expressing these tegumental factors are short-lived and rapidly turned over. We suggest that stem cell-driven renewal of this tegumental lineage represents an important strategy for parasite survival in the context of the host vasculature.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12473.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12473.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12473.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Schistosomes are parasitic worms that infect and cause chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people in the developing world. A major reason these parasites are so damaging is that they are capable of living and reproducing in the human bloodstream for decades.</p><p>Previous research had shown that schistosomes have a population of stem cells that are proposed to promote the parasite’s survival inside the host’s bloodstream. However, it was not clear what role these cells play in the worms.</p><p>Collins et al. have now found that, in a parasitic worm called <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, a large number of these stem cells are destined to become cells that generate the parasite’s skin. This unique tissue is known as the tegument, and had long been thought to have evolved in parasitic flatworms to help them survive in their host and evade its immune defenses. Therefore, Collins et al.’s findings suggest a new mechanism by which stem cells can promote the survival of a parasite inside its host.</p><p>In the long-term, these findings could lead to new treatments for parasitic infections and may shed light on the evolution of parasitic flatworms.

However, the role these cells play in the biology of the parasites in their mammalian host was unexplored.

Previously, we demonstrated that many genes down-regulated at 48 hr following irradiation were associated with the schistosome neoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that by comparing the gene expression profiles of parasites shortly after neoblast ablation (48 hr) to parasites two weeks after their neoblasts had been killed, we could characterize the long-term consequences of neoblast depletion. Specifically, we expected genes down-regulated at both early and late time points to be neoblast-enriched factors, whereas genes only down-regulated at later time points would be genes that require neoblasts for maintaining their expression. To add specificity to this dataset, removing genes whose expression could be influenced non-specifically by irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Solana et al., 2012</xref>), we also profiled parasite transcriptomes after long-term RNA interference (RNAi) targeting either of two genes required for the maintenance of proliferating neoblasts: <italic>fgfrA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2013</xref>) or <italic>histone H2B</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>From our transcriptional profiling experiments of male somatic tissues we identified 135 genes that were down regulated (≥1.25x, p&lt;0.05) in both our irradiation and RNAi datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As anticipated, this gene set included a number of known stem cell- (e.g., <italic>nanos2</italic> and <italic>ago2</italic>-1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2013</xref>]) and cell cycle-specific (<italic>cyclinB</italic> and <italic>mcm2</italic>) genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). More importantly, we identified 105 genes that were not down-regulated at D2 post-irradiation but were significantly down regulated (≥1.25x, p&lt;0.05) at D14 post-irradiation and following RNAi of either <italic>fgfrA</italic> or <italic>histone H2B</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For brevity, we will refer to these 105 genes as delayed irradiation-sensitivity (DIS) genes. We also noted a small class of genes that were modestly down regulated at early time points and highly down regulated after long-term stem cell depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The most striking example of this class was the schistosome orthologue of the planarian <italic>p53</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2010</xref>), which was down-regulated ~2 fold at 48 hr and nearly 150 fold at D14 post-irradiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>To validate our transcriptional profiling experiments, we examined a subset of these DIS genes by whole-mount in situ hybridization at D2 and D7 following irradiation. As anticipated, expression of <italic>cathepsin B,</italic> a gene expressed in differentiated intestinal cells, was unaffected at either time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Conversely, the expression of genes associated with the neoblasts (<italic>fgfrA</italic> and <italic>nanos2</italic>) was substantially reduced at D2 and the expression of these genes did not return by D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), confirming that stem cells are irreversibly depleted by irradiation. Consistent with our RNAseq data, the number of cells expressing <italic>p53</italic> is modestly reduced at D2 post-irradiation and dramatically reduced by D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In contrast to the neoblast-expressed genes and <italic>p53</italic>, at D2 the number of cells expressing the DIS genes <italic>tsp-2, sm13, sm29,</italic> and <italic>val-8</italic> was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). However, by D7 post-irradiation the expression of these genes was severely depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We did note in our RNAseq experiments, and in independent qPCR experiments, a modest increase in <italic>val-8</italic> mRNA levels 48 hr post-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since, the number of <italic>val-8<sup>+</sup></italic> cells did not appear to dramatically change at 48 hr post-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), it is possible that some <italic>val-8<sup>+</sup></italic> cells had elevated levels of the <italic>val-8</italic> mRNA. To directly examine the relationship between genes expressed in neoblasts and the DIS genes, we performed double fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments with <italic>histone H2B, p53</italic>, and <italic>tsp-2</italic>. We observed no co-expression of the DIS gene <italic>tsp-2</italic> with <italic>histone H2B</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, suggesting that DIS genes are expressed in a population of cells other than neoblasts. Consistent with our observations following irradiation, we observed that <italic>p53</italic> was expressed in both the <italic>histone H2B<sup>+</sup></italic> neoblasts and <italic>tsp-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these data strongly support the model that the DIS genes are expressed in an irradiation-sensitive population of cells that is molecularly distinct from the neoblasts.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12473.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cells expressing DIS genes are lost following stem cell depletion and express genes associated with the schistosome tegument.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Whole-mount in situ hybridization to detect genes expressed in: the intestine (<italic>Cathepsin B</italic>); neoblasts (<italic>fgfrA</italic>, <italic>nanos2</italic>); or cells expressing DIS genes (<italic>tsp-2</italic>, <italic>sm13</italic>, <italic>sm29</italic>, <italic>val-8</italic>) in either untreated parasites or worms at D2 or D7 following irradiation. <italic>p53</italic> is also shown as an example of a gene modestly down-regulated at early time points and highly down-regulated at late time points after neoblast ablation.

The schistosome surface is covered by a continuous syncytial structure, called the tegument (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), which serves as the primary barrier between the parasite and its host. This unique tissue is connected by cytoplasmic bridges to nucleated cell bodies that sit in the mesenchyme, beneath the parasite’s body-wall muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Morris and Threadgold, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wilson and Barnes, 1974</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). To determine if these DIS genes are expressed in a tegument-associated cell population, we performed double FISH experiments. We first examined the distribution of the mRNA for a Tetraspanin, TSP-2, that encodes a well-characterized tegument-specific factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braschi and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tran et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pearson et al., 2012</xref>). TSP-2 is currently being explored as an anti-schistosome vaccine candidate due to its presence on the parasite surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hotez et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with <italic>tsp-2</italic> being expressed in a tegument-associated cell population, we found that a majority of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+ </sup></italic>cells are located immediately beneath the parasite’s body-wall muscle layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). To further examine this <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cell population, we performed double FISH with other DIS genes known to encode proteins expressed in the tegument. We observed that DIS genes encoding a panel of known tegumental factors, including <italic>sm13</italic> (Smp_195190), <italic>sm29</italic> (Smp_072190), <italic>sm25</italic> (Smp_195180), an amino acid transporter (Smp_176940) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wilson, 2012</xref>), a dysferlin protein (Smp_141010) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braschi and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wilson, 2012</xref>), an endophillin B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castro-Borges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wilson, 2012</xref>), and a cd59-like molecule (Smp_081920) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wilson, 2012</xref>) were expressed in a largely overlapping population of cells with <italic>tsp-2</italic> immediately beneath the dorsal body-wall muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Given their position in the parasite, and their expression of many known tegumental genes, our data indicate that <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells represent a population of tegument-associated cells.</p><p>Our data suggest that <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells co-express many known tegumental factors and are lost within a few days following stem cell depletion. We envision two models to explain these observations. First, <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells could represent a relatively long-lived population that requires the continual presence of the somatic neoblasts for their survival. Alternatively, the <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells could be a short-lived cell population that requires a pool of stem cells for its continuous renewal. In the absence of this renewal, the <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are rapidly depleted. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed pulse-chase experiments with the thymidine analogue EdU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Salic and Mitchison, 2008</xref>). This approach allows us to specifically label neoblasts at S-phase and monitor their differentiation over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2013</xref>). In these experiments, parasite-infected mice were injected with EdU and the distribution of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells relative to the <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells was monitored every other day for 11 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). If the <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic>cells are long-lived and turn over slowly, we would anticipate that few <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic>cells would become EdU<sup>+</sup> over the chase period. However, if these cells were renewed rapidly by the neoblasts, we would expect a large fraction of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells to become EdU<sup>+</sup>. Furthermore, since EdU levels are diluted following cell division, over time differentiating neoblasts would contain less EdU, resulting in a reduction in the EdU levels in <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12473.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title><italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are renewed by stem cells and then rapidly turned over.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cartoon showing EdU pulse-chase strategy to examine the differentiation of stem cells into <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells.

After a 3-day chase period, however, we noted that over 40% of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic>cells were newly born EdU<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref>). This result suggests that stem cells initially incorporating EdU were capable of replenishing nearly half of the <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells within three days. Beyond D5, we noted a rapid reduction in the number of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> EdU<sup>+</sup> cells and an overall reduction in the EdU levels per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref>). These data suggest that <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are a short-lived cell population that is continuously renewed by the neoblasts during the parasite’s life in its definitive host. To determine if this rapid rate of neoblast-driven renewal was unique to <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, we also examined the kinetics of EdU labeling of the schistosome intestine. In contrast to the <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, only 2.5% of <italic>cathespin B<sup>+</sup></italic> intestinal cells were EdU<sup>+</sup> at D3, and this level remained fairly constant throughout the 11D time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,d</xref>). Thus, the kinetics of tegumental cell birth differs from that of intestinal cells. Taken together, our data suggest that on a population level neoblasts are 'biased' toward the rejuvenation of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells over other lineages.</p><p>In planarians, a population of postmitotic neoblast progeny displays similar sensitivity to irradiation as this <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> tegument-associated cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>). These planarian neoblast progeny similarly express a p53-like protein as well as a large collection of planarian-specific molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Most importantly, these planarian cells serve as progenitors to terminally differentiated epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tu et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it appears that free-living and parasitic flatworms utilize similar developmental strategies for epidermal maintenance. Presently, electron microscopy is the only methodology to unambiguously identify tegumental cell bodies in schistosomes. Therefore, with current technology, it is not possible to determine which of the irradiation-sensitive cells expressing DIS genes are terminally differentiated tegumental cell bodies. In light of this limitation, our data are consistent with two models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). In the first model, proliferating neoblasts differentiate to produce a short-lived population of terminally differentiated tegumental cell bodies expressing <italic>tsp-2</italic> and other DIS genes (i.e., <italic>sm13, sm25, sm29</italic>, etc.). In the alternative model, cells expressing <italic>tsp-2</italic> (and other DIS genes) represent a population of short-lived progenitors to terminally differentiated tegumental cell bodies. Regardless of which model (or combination of these models) is correct, our data suggest that a primary function of the schistosome neoblasts is to generate cells that contribute to the tegument.</p><p>The mammalian bloodstream would appear to be a rather inhospitable niche for a pathogen. In the case of schistosomes, there is little dispute about the importance of the tegument in defending the parasite from host immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">McLaren, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Skelly and Alan Wilson, 2006</xref>), yet the properties of this tissue that afford the parasite protection in blood are unclear. Indeed, numerous ideas have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including tegumental absorption of host antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Smithers et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clegg et al., 1971</xref>) and the turnover of the unique tegumental outer membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Perez and Terry, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wilson and Barnes, 1977</xref>). Based on our data, we suggest that neoblast-driven tegumental regeneration may play a key role in the parasite’s ability to survive in the mammalian host. By undergoing continuous tegumental renewal, the parasite is likely capable of rapidly turning over the tegument and regenerating damage inflicted inside the host (e.g., via immune attack). Thus, an important goal for future studies is to address the role of neoblasts in parasite survival and tegumental function in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Parasite acquisition and culture</title><p>Adult <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (6–8 weeks post-infection) were obtained from infected mice by hepatic portal vein perfusion with 37°C DMEM (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) plus 5% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Hyclone/Thermo Scientific Logan, UT) and heparin (200–350 U/ml).

Here they report on the participation of these cells in the constant renewal of the tegument of these organisms. The authors show that the adult stem cells (neoblasts) generate a short-lived cell population of terminally differentiated tegumental cell bodies/progenitors expressing several of formerly characterized tegumental factors associated with the parasite's surface. The study sheds new light on the function of neoblasts for parasite survival. This is a significant contribution to our understanding of how these organisms can survive for decades within the hostile bloodstream of its final mammalian host while defending immune attacks. Moreover, given the importance of many of the molecules found in the tegument in terms of vaccine discovery and development, the work presented here on their biogenesis has important ramifications for the development of future control strategies for this important human disease.</p><p>There are, however, a few essential revisions the authors need to address in order for this well-designed study to be ultimately published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is some confusion regarding gene annotations among <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>:</p><p>In contrast to <italic>cyclinB</italic> and <italic>mcm2, nanos2</italic> and <italic>ago2-1</italic> cannot be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> (please comment);</p><p>Smp_179320 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) is annotated as <italic>ago2</italic> in GeneDB;</p><p>Smp_051920 (hypothetical protein, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) is annotated as <italic>nanos1</italic> (not <italic>nanos2</italic>) in GeneDB;</p><p>Smp_157300 (tyrosine kinase, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) is annotated as basic fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 A in GeneDB; is this corresponding to <italic>fgfrA</italic> targeted by RNAi?</p><p>Why can <italic>histone H2B</italic> not be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> although it was a target of RNAi?;</p><p>Smp_181530 (tetraspanin, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>) is annotated as <italic>cd63</italic> antigen (tetraspanin family member) in GeneDB; does this gene correspond to <italic>tsp-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>)?</p><p>Smp_141010 is annotated as <italic>dysferlin1</italic> in GeneDB whereas it is named <italic>fer-1-</italic>related in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><p>2) Many genes are downregulated by <italic>h2b(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>fgfrA(RNAi)</italic> to a comparable extent, e.g. Smp_133990 (topbb1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and Smp_174820 (Ser/Thr kinase, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These genes show also a similar downregulation after 48h and D14 post-irradiation. However, some genes, e.g. Smp_095290 (zinc finger protein, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), Smp_194180 (hypothetical protein, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and Smp_139530 (cellular tumor antigen P53, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) show a much higher transcriptional downregulation following <italic>h2b(RNAi)</italic> in comparison to <italic>fgfrA(RNAi).</italic> How can this be explained? Is this due to differences of RNAi efficacies (have these been determined by real time PCR)?</p><p>3) Interestingly, this finding is paralleled by a significantly higher downregulation after D14 in comparison to 48h post-irradiation. How can this be explained (e.g. by mRNA stability?), and is this somehow related to the former observation (differences in RNAi efficacies)?</p><p>4) How can the differing reductions of <italic>histone H2A</italic> transcription levels (Smp_086860 and Smp_002930) be explained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>)?</p><p>The observation of deviating transcriptional downregulation following <italic>h2b(RNAi)</italic> in comparison to <italic>fgfrA(RNAi)</italic> can also be seen for genes only down-regulated at late time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), e.g. SmVAL8, Sm25, Sm13, and SmVAL12 (Smp_123550, Smp_195180, Smp_195190, and Smp_123540). Moreover, SmVAL8 transcription seems to be slightly but significantly increased after 48h post-irradiation before drastically downregulated (D14). How can this be explained?</p><p>5) One would expect that the ablation of neoblasts and the following decreased replenishment of tegumental cell bodies impede surface renewal. As a consequence this would lead to morphological changes at the surface area. Has this been observed microscopically?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12473.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) There is some confusion regarding gene annotations among <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>: In contrast to cyclinB and mcm2, nanos2 and ago2-1 cannot be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> (please comment); Smp_179320 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) is annotated as ago2 in GeneDB; Smp_051920 (hypothetical protein, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) is annotated as nanos1 (not nanos2) in GeneDB; Smp_157300 (tyrosine kinase, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) is annotated as basic fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 A in GeneDB; is this corresponding to fgfrA targeted by RNAi?; Smp_181530 (tetraspanin, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>) is annotated as cd63 antigen (tetraspanin family member) in GeneDB; does this gene correspond to tsp-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>)?

Thus, neoblast ablation (by for example <italic>fgfrA</italic> RNAi or irradiation) fails to completely reduce the <italic>H2B</italic> mRNA levels while still drastically reducing the number of neoblasts expressing high levels of <italic>H2B</italic> transcript (See Collins et al., 2013 Nature 494, 476–479, Figure 4C vs. Figure S8).</p><p> <italic>2) Many genes are downregulated by h2b(RNAi) and fgfrA(RNAi) to a comparable extent, e.g. Smp_133990 (topbb1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and Smp_174820 (Ser/Thr kinase, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These genes show also a similar downregulation after 48h and D14 post-irradiation. However, some genes, e.g. Smp_095290 (zinc finger protein, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), Smp_194180 (hypothetical protein, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and Smp_139530 (cellular tumor antigen P53, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) show a much higher transcriptional downregulation following h2b(RNAi) in comparison to fgfrA(RNAi). How can this be explained? Is this due to differences of RNAi efficacies (have these been determined by real time PCR)?</italic> </p><p>In our experience RNAi of <italic>H2B</italic> rapidly results in a complete loss of proliferative neoblasts whereas RNAi of <italic>fgfrA</italic> fails to ablate the entire neoblast pool (see Collins et al., (2013) Nature 494, 476–479). Therefore, we fully expect that <italic>h2b</italic> RNAi will result in a larger fold change down regulation for neoblast expressed and DIS genes even though both <italic>H2B</italic> and <italic>fgfrA</italic> genes are down-regulated &gt;10 fold in our RNAseq datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Interestingly, this finding is paralleled by a significantly higher downregulation after D14 in comparison to 48h post-irradiation. How can this be explained (e.g. by mRNA stability?), and is this somehow related to the former observation (differences in RNAi efficacies)?</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are correct, this is a very interesting observation and we have added additional data analyzing Smp_139530 (<italic>p53</italic>) to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We find that in addition to being expressed in neoblasts the schistosome <italic>p53</italic> homolog is also highly expressed in <italic>tsp-2</italic> cells. Based on this observation we interpret our transcriptional profiling results as follows: At 48 hours following irradiation <italic>p53</italic> is partially down-regulated due to neoblast loss and then by day 14 the transcript is highly down regulated due to loss of the <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells. This result also adds value to the paper since the planarian orthologue of this gene is expressed in a similar manner (i.e., in the neoblasts and their immediate progeny, see Pearson &amp; Sánchez Alvarado (2010) Development 137, 213–221). This provides additional evidence supporting the evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms regulating planarian and schistosome epidermal lineages.</p><p> <italic>4) How can the differing reductions of histone h2a transcription levels (Smp_086860 and Smp_002930) be explained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>)?</italic> </p><p>We have examined the sequences of Smp_086860 and Smp_002930 and they appear to encode two distinct Histone H2A genes with differing amino acid sequences. Why do we observe differing levels of fold change down regulation? One possibility is that one of these genes is a histone variant. In other organisms histone variants can be regulated differently than the conical histones (see Kamakaka and Biggins. (2005) Genes and Dev. 19:295-316). Indeed, Smp_002930 shares &gt;90 identity to histone H2A isoforms in Humans, whereas Smp_086860 only shares about 75-80% identity with human H2A proteins. Thus, Smp_086860 may encode a neoblast-enriched H2A variant.</p><p> <italic>The observation of deviating transcriptional downregulation following h2b(RNAi) in comparison to fgfrA(RNAi) can also be seen for genes only down-regulated at late time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), e.g. SmVAL8, Sm25, Sm13, and SmVAL12 (Smp_123550, Smp_195180, Smp_195190, and Smp_123540).</italic> </p><p>This comment was addressed in point 2.</p><p><italic>Moreover, SmVAL8 transcription seems to be slightly but significantly increased after 48h post-irradiation before drastically downregulated (D14). How can this be explained?</italic> </p><p>We have examined this observation in more detail by performing qPCR at 48 hours post-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and in situhybridizations for <italic>val-8</italic> at both 48 hours and 7 days post-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We observe that <italic>val-8</italic> is expressed at slightly higher levels at 48 hours post-irradiation by qPCR yet doesn’t seem to be expressed in noticeably more cells at the same time point by in situ hybridization. Thus, we speculate that <italic>val-8</italic> mRNA maybe present at slightly higher levels in the <italic>val-8<sup>+</sup></italic> cells at 48 hours. Based on this we speculate that irradiation may alter the differentiating neoblasts such that they turn on some differentiation markers (e.g., <italic>val-8</italic>) at slightly higher levels.</p><p><italic>5) One would expect that the ablation of neoblasts and the following decreased replenishment of tegumental cell bodies impede surface renewal. As a consequence this would lead to morphological changes at the surface area. Has this been observed microscopically?</italic></p><p>This is an excellent point and a major priority of our ongoing efforts. However, there are several challenges we need to tackle before we can address this issue in a comprehensive manner and therefore we feel this extends beyond the scope of this manuscript. We first must determine when the tegumental cell bodies are depleted following neoblast loss. The data presented here do not address this point. In principle, the <italic>tsp-2</italic> mRNA<sup>+</sup> cells could represent the entire tegumental cell pool, a subset of the tegumental cell bodies, or progenitors to the definitive tegument (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Addressing this point will allow us to determine the proper time point to examine the tegument microscopically. As far as microscopic analyses the preferred methodology would be Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), ideally using the methodology developed by Hockley and McLaren (Hockley DJ, McLaren DJ. 1973 Int J Parasitol. 3(1):13-25) that allows for visualization of both the inner and outer tegumental membranes. Unfortunately, our efforts to robustly reproduce this approach have yet to be successful, and therefore we are exploring other methodologies, including High Pressure Freezing and Freeze Substitution that should better preserve the membranes. Finally, since it has been noted that the tegument does not behave normally in vitro (see pg., 252 in Skelly, P. J. and R. A. Wilson (2006). &quot;Making sense of the schistosome surface.&quot; Adv Parasitol 63: 185-284) the ideal experiment would be to examine the tegument of neoblast-depleted parasites during the course of an experimental infection. While we are developing the methodologies to perform these experiments, they are still at least a year from reaching a publishable endpoint.</p></body></sub-article></article>
