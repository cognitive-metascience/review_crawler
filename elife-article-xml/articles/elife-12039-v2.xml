chromosome segregation. However, the signaling mechanisms that directly regulate this process are poorly understood. Here we show that the mammalian Rho GEF homolog, ECT-2, functions through the conserved RAS/ERK MAP kinase signaling pathway in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline to regulate the disassembly of SC proteins. We find that SYP-2, a SC central region component, is a potential target for MPK-1-mediated phosphorylation and that constitutively phosphorylated SYP-2 impairs the disassembly of SC proteins from chromosomal domains referred to as the long arms of the bivalents. Inactivation of MAP kinase at late pachytene is critical for timely disassembly of the SC proteins from the long arms, and is dependent on the crossover (CO) promoting factors ZHP-3/RNF212/Zip3 and COSA-1/CNTD1. We propose that the conserved MAP kinase pathway coordinates CO designation with the disassembly of SC proteins to ensure accurate chromosome segregation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12039.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12039.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12039.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most plants and animals, including humans, have cells that contain two copies of every chromosome, with one set inherited from each parent. However, reproductive cells (such as eggs and sperm) contain just one copy of every chromosome so that when they fuse together at fertilization, the resulting cell will have the usual two copies of each chromosome.</p><p>Embryos that have incorrect numbers of chromosome copies either fail to survive or develop disorders such as Down syndrome. Therefore, it is important that when cells divide to form new reproductive cells, their chromosomes are correctly segregated.</p><p>To end up with one copy of each chromosome, reproductive cells undergo a form of cell division called meiosis. During meiosis, pairs of chromosomes are held together by a zipper-like structure called the synaptonemal complex. While held together like this, each chromosome in the pair exchanges DNA with the other by forming junctions called crossovers. Once DNA exchange is completed, the synaptonemal complex disappears from certain regions of the chromosome.</p><p>Using a range of genetic, biochemical and cell biological approaches, Nadarajan et al. have now investigated how crossover formation and the disassembly of the synaptonemal complex are coordinated in the reproductive cells of a roundworm called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. This revealed that a signaling pathway called the MAP kinase pathway regulates the removal of synaptonemal complex proteins from particular sites between the paired chromosomes. Turning off this pathway’s activity is required for the timely disassembly of this complex, and depends on proteins that are involved in crossover formation.</p><p>This regulatory mechanism likely ensures that the synaptonemal complex starts to disassemble only after the physical attachments between the paired chromosomes are “locked in”, thus ensuring that reproductive cells receive the correct number of chromosomes. Given that the MAP kinase pathway regulates cell processes in many different organisms, a future challenge is to determine whether this pathway regulates the synaptonemal complex in other species as well.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12039.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12039.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>MAP kinase</kwd><kwd>SYP-2</kwd><kwd>germline</kwd><kwd>crossover recombination</kwd><kwd>synaptonemal complex</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Lalor Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nadarajan</surname><given-names>Saravanapriah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tzur</surname><given-names>Yonatan B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM086434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blower</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MRC-Core funding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinez-Perez</surname><given-names>Enrique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG011085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>J Wade</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM072551</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colaiacovo</surname><given-names>Monica P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Coordination between crossover designation and synaptonemal complex disassembly is executed via a conserved MAP kinase pathway and is critical for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis is critical for sexually reproducing organisms. Meiosis is the specialized cell division program by which diploid germ cells generate haploid gametes that during fertilization will form a diploid zygote. This is accomplished by following a single round of DNA replication with two consecutive rounds of cell division (meiosis I and II) in which, first pairs of homologous chromosomes (bivalents), and then sister chromatids, separate away from each other. At center stage during prophase I of meiosis from yeast to humans is a tripartite proteinaceous structure known as the synaptonemal complex (SC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colaiácovo, 2006</xref>). The SC is a ladder-like structure comprised of lateral element proteins running along the axes of the homologs and central region proteins connecting these axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colaiácovo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Page and Hawley, 2003</xref>). The SC is required to stabilize the interactions between pairs of homologous chromosomes and for interhomolog crossover (CO) formation in budding yeast, worms, flies, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nag et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Storlazzi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Page and Hawley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacQueen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colaiácovo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Vries et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smolikov et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2009</xref>), all of which are prerequisite steps for achieving accurate chromosome segregation at meiosis I. Importantly, the SC must be disassembled prior to the end of prophase I to ensure timely and proper chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sourirajan and Lichten, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jordan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dix et al., 1997</xref>). Several proteins have been recently implicated in regulating the disassembly of SC proteins, including polo-like kinase in mammals and budding yeast, Ipl1/Aurora B kinase in budding yeast, the condensin complex component dcap-g in flies and both AKIR-1 (a member of the akirin protein family) and ZHP-3 (ortholog of budding yeast Zip3) in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sourirajan and Lichten, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jordan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Resnick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jordan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clemons et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhalla et al., 2008</xref>). However, whether these factors directly regulate the SC in vivo and the mechanisms by which they promote the disassembly of SC proteins are not fully understood.</p><p>We previously showed that the SC disassembles asymmetrically in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, progressing from being localized along the full length of the interface between homologous chromosomes in early prophase to persisting at discrete chromosome locations, termed the short arm domains, corresponding to one end of every pair of homologs at late prophase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nabeshima et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, factors required for CO formation are necessary for the asymmetric disassembly of the SC and localized retention of SC central region proteins. Since in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> a single CO occurs at the terminal third of every pair of homologous chromosomes, we proposed that chromosomes remodel around the single off-centered CO event at the pachytene-diplotene transition. This results in bivalents with a cruciform configuration comprised of two perpendicular chromosomal axes (namely the long and short arm domains) intersecting at the chiasma, where the long arms face the poles and the short arms occupy an equatorial position on the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nabeshima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Riddle et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maddox et al., 2004</xref>). This remodeling includes changes in chromosome compaction as well as changes in both the localization and the types of proteins associated with the long and short arm domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nabeshima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martinez-Perez and Villeneuve, 2005</xref>). Subsequent studies in yeast, flies and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newnham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qiao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bisig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takeo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gladstone et al., 2009</xref>) also observed an asymmetric disassembly of the SC, with a residual localized retention of the SC at centromeres. However, the mechanism linking CO recombination sites to asymmetric SC disassembly remained unknown.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12039.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ECT-2 regulates AIR-2 localization and SC dynamics in meiotic prophase I.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of SC dynamics and chromosome remodeling during prophase I of meiosis. A single pair of homologous chromosomes (bivalent) is shown for simplicity. Upon entrance into pachytene, the SC is present along the full length of the pairs of homologous chromosomes. CO formation is completed within the context of fully synapsed chromosomes, and in worms, a single CO is formed per homolog pair usually at an off-centered position. Chromosome remodeling has been proposed to take place around the off-centered CO (or CO precursor) resulting in a cruciform configuration comprised of two intersecting perpendicular chromosomal axes of different lengths (long and short arms of the bivalent, corresponding to the longest and shortest distances from the off-centered CO/CO precursor site to opposite ends of the chromosomes). This remodeling involves disassembly of central region components of the SC (SYP-1/2/3/4) along the long arms of the bivalents starting during late pachytene and diplotene resulting in the restricted localization of these proteins to the short arms. During diplotene and diakinesis, chromosomes undergo condensation as evidenced by a coiling of the arms and increased bivalent compaction. In late diakinesis, the SC proteins located on the short arms are replaced by AIR-2, which promotes the separation of the homologs at the end of meiosis I. CO – crossover, S – short arm and L – long arm.

This consists of CO licensing during mid-pachytene followed by CO designation at or just prior to the mid-to-late pachytene transition in a manner dependent of the pro-CO factor COSA-1/CNTD1. Since DSBs outnumber COs in most species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martinez-Perez and Colaiácovo, 2009</xref>) this has been proposed as a strategy to pare down the number of early recombination sites that will become CO sites thus both ensuring and limiting the number of COs. These and other features of meiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, including the existence of various markers that distinguish the short and long arm subdomains and the CO precursor sites, therefore provide an ideal scenario to understand the regulation of the disassembly of the SC proteins from distinct chromosome subdomains and late prophase I chromosome remodeling.</p><p>Here, we report that regulation of the disassembly of the SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents in <italic>C. elegans</italic> requires the mammalian Rho GEF homolog, ECT-2. We show that ECT-2 functions through the conserved MAP kinase pathway to regulate the asymmetric disassembly of SC proteins during prophase I of meiosis. We show that MPK-1 potentially directly phosphorylates SYP-2, a central region component of the SC, and that constitutively phosphorylated SYP-2 impairs the disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms. Moreover, inactivation of MPK-1 takes place in late pachytene in a manner dependent on pro-CO factors ZHP-3/RNF212/Zip3 and COSA-1/CNTD1 and concomitant with the initiation of SC disassembly. Therefore, we propose a model in which MPK-1 is inactivated in response to CO designation resulting in either de novo loading of unphosphorylated SYP-2 or dephosphorylation of chromatin-associated SYP-2, which triggers disassembly of SC proteins from along the long arms. Thus, coordination between CO designation and the disassembly of SC proteins executed via a conserved MAP kinase pathway is critical for ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ECT-2 regulates synaptonemal complex dynamics</title><p>We identified <italic>ect-2</italic>, the homolog of mammalian Rho GEF, in a targeted RNAi screen for novel components regulating chromosome remodeling and short/long arm identity by using the mislocalization of Aurora B kinase, AIR-2, which localizes to the short arms of diakinesis bivalents in wild type oocytes as a readout (see Materials and methods). ECT-2 (Epithelial Cell Transforming sequence 2) is a highly conserved protein, initially identified as a proto-oncogene in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miki et al., 1993</xref>). It encodes a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) that belongs to the Dbl family and functions as a key activator of Rho GTPase mediated signaling with roles during cytokinesis, DNA damage-induced cell death, cell polarity establishment during embryogenesis, vulval development, and epidermal P cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prokopenko et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saito et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Srougi and Burridge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canevascini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Motegi and Sugimoto, 2006</xref>).

Specifically, the SC failed to assemble on the chromosomes and instead SYP-1 formed aggregates referred to as polycomplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Those nuclei that had already gone through the leptotene/zygotene stage before the temperature shift showed normal synapsis during early and mid pachytene stages, but the central region components of the SC remained localized along the long arms of the bivalents and failed to become restricted to the short arms during late prophase (a defect herein referred to as impaired disassembly of the SC proteins) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the ERK MAP kinase, MPK-1, is expressed in both somatic tissues as well as in the germline where it controls several aspects of germ line development including pachytene progression and germ cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Church et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kritikou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). However, the role of MPK-1 in SC dynamics has never been explored. We therefore tested whether the ERK MAP kinase pathway regulates SC dynamics in the germline. Analysis of <italic>mpk-1(ga117)</italic> null, <italic>mpk-1(ga111lf)</italic> and <italic>mpk-1(ku1lf)</italic> temperature-sensitive loss-of-function mutants revealed defects in SC assembly as indicated by the formation of polycomplexes, similar to <italic>ect-2(zh8gf)</italic> mutants at the non-permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, germline nuclei that had already passed through the leptotene/zygotene stage before the temperature shift exhibited normal SC tracts along chromosomes at the pachytene stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Since nuclei fail to progress from early/mid-pachytene to late-pachytene in <italic>mpk-1(ga117)</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2007</xref>), we analyzed the disassembly of SC proteins in <italic>mpk-1(ga111lf)</italic> mutants. The <italic>mpk-1(ga111)</italic> temperature sensitive loss-of-function mutant has been shown to still have a low level of dpMPK-1 activity and an incompletely penetrant pachytene arrest phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). Nuclei that were able to progress from pachytene to diplotene exhibited normal SC disassembly similar to the <italic>ect-2(ax751rf)</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the role of the ERK MAP kinase pathway in the disassembly of SC proteins, we analyzed <italic>let-60</italic>, which encodes for the RAS protein that functions upstream of the MAP kinase cascade to activate the MAP kinase pathway. A <italic>let-60(ga89gf)</italic> temperature-sensitive gain-of-function mutant leads to constitutive activation of MAP kinase both in somatic tissues and the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). Similar to the <italic>ect-2(zh8gf)</italic> mutant, <italic>let-60(ga89gf)</italic> mutants exhibit defects in both SC assembly, as evidenced by the presence of polycomplexes, and the disassembly of the SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents, where they persisted at the non-permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similar defects in the disassembly of SC proteins are also observed in the <italic>lip-1(zh15rf)</italic> reduction-of-function mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), where the LIP-1 phosphatase fails to inactivate, MPK-1 in late pachytene, which therefore persists throughout pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hajnal and Berset, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rutkowski et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that the constitutive presence of active MPK-1 impairs the disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents. In contrast, we did not observe any defects in SC assembly in <italic>lip-1(zh15rf)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Further, we found that LAB-1 localization was not altered in either <italic>let-60(ga89gf)</italic> or <italic>lip-1(zh15rf)</italic> mutants suggesting that MAP kinase specifically regulates the disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents and not other aspects of late prophase chromosome remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Altogether these data suggest that the MAP kinase pathway plays an essential role in regulating the disassembly of SC proteins whereas the defects we see in SC assembly might be a secondary consequence of the role of MAP kinase in mitosis or due to several other germline functions of MPK-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ECT-2 functions through the ERK MAP kinase pathway to regulate the disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents</title><p>To examine the connection between ECT-2 and the ERK MAP kinase pathway, we took advantage of the tightly regulated windows where the activated diphosphorylated form of MPK-1 (dpMPK-1) can be detected in the germline. In the <italic>ect-2(ax751rf)</italic> mutant, we see reduced dpMPK-1 signal in the mid-late pachytene region compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>). We next tested whether the Rho GTPase, RHO-1, activates ERK MAP kinase signaling in the germline, similar to its role in the regulation of vulval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canevascini et al., 2005</xref>). Given the highly abnormal gonads observed following strong loss of <italic>rho-1</italic> function, partial RNAi knockdown of <italic>rho-1</italic> was performed to obtain germlines with essentially wildtype morphology/organization (see Materials and Methods). Similarly to the <italic>ect-2(ax751rf)</italic> mutant, partial depletion of <italic>rho-1</italic> also results in reduced dpMPK-1 signal in the mid-late pachytene region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). In addition, the expression pattern of RHO-1 is similar to that observed for ECT-2 in the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). In contrast to <italic>ect-2(ax751rf)</italic> mutants and to <italic>rho-1</italic> partial knock down, dpMPK-1 expression is not turned off at late pachytene and during diplotene in the <italic>ect-2(zh8gf)</italic> mutant. Instead, dpMPK-1 persists from pachytene to diakinesis similar to <italic>let-60/RAS</italic> gain-of-function mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplements 5A and B</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2007</xref>]). Taken together, these data indicate that ECT-2 and RHO-1 either promote MPK-1 activation or block MPK-1 inactivation in the germline.</p><p>Next, we performed epistasis analysis to test whether ECT-2 functions through the MAP kinase pathway to regulate the disassembly of SC proteins. First, we analyzed the brood size in <italic>ect-2(ax751rf); let-60(ga89gf)</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). <italic>let-60(ga89gf)</italic> mutants exhibit a severely reduced brood size compared to <italic>ect-2(ax751rf).</italic> Interestingly, <italic>ect-2(ax751rf); let-60(ga89gf)</italic> double mutants exhibit a severely reduced brood size similar to <italic>let-60(ga89gf)</italic>. Further, <italic>ect-2(ax751rf); let-60(ga89gf)</italic> double mutants exhibit defects in the disassembly of SC proteins similar to <italic>let-60(ga89gf)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). These data show that LET-60 functions downstream of ECT-2 in the germline. We also analyzed <italic>ect-2(zh8gf); mpk-1(ga11lf1)</italic> double mutants for defects in the disassembly of SC proteins. We found that <italic>mpk-1(ga111lf)</italic> is able to suppress the SC disassembly defect of <italic>ect-2(zh8gf)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Thus, our data demonstrates that ECT-2 functions through the MAP Kinase pathway to regulate the disassembly of the SC proteins on the long arms of the bivalents uncovering a novel mode of regulation for this structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Phosphorylation of SYP-2 is dependent on the ERK MAP kinase pathway</title><p>To determine how the disassembly of the SC proteins is regulated by MPK-1, we tested whether SC components might be a direct phosphorylation target of MPK-1. First we examined the central region components of the SC, SYP-1, SYP-2, SYP-3 and SYP-4, for the presence of potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites using the phosphorylation site predictor programs GPS 2.1 and KinasePhos 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). This identified potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites on SYP-1, SYP-2, SYP-4 and none on SYP-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, to verify the predicted MAP kinase phosphorylation sites in the SYP proteins, we immunoprecipitated the SYP-1/2/3 proteins from lysates of adult worms expressing either SYP-2::GFP or SYP-3::GFP and performed extensive mass spectrometry analysis to look for post-translational modifications (a similar analysis was not possible for SYP-4 given that neither functional antibodies or tagged transgenic lines are currently available). In addition, a phospho-proteomics approach was applied to wild type lysates to further confirm the MAP kinase phosphorylation sites in the SYP proteins (see Materials and methods). These combined approaches confirmed that SYP-2 is phosphorylated at S25, a potential MAP kinase phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12039.017</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of SYP-2 is dependent on the MAP kinase pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of SYP-1, SYP-2, and SYP-4 proteins with predicted MAP kinase phosphorylation sites indicated in black and site confirmed by mass spectrometry indicated in red.

The reciprocal experiment showed that the SYP-2 protein co-immunoprecipitates with dpMPK-1 in pull downs from adult worm lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This in vivo interaction was further confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis where we identified two MPK-1 peptides in the SYP-2 pull down (data not shown).</p><p>To further confirm whether SYP-2 is phosphorylated in vivo, we incubated worm lysates with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) either in the presence or absence of the phosphatase inhibitor EDTA, and ran these samples on Phos-tag gels for a better separation of phosphorylated from non-phosphorylated bands. CIP treatment results in phosphate removal and a faster running band for SYP-2, whereas when CIP activity is inhibited using EDTA two bands are detected corresponding to the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of SYP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This shows that SYP-2 is phosphorylated in vivo and that SYP-2 exists in both phosphorylated as well as unphosphorylated forms. Further, in <italic>mpk-1(ga117)</italic> null mutants, the upper band corresponding to phosphorylated SYP-2 is not present, suggesting that phosphorylation of SYP-2 is dependent on MAP kinase. In <italic>let-60(ga89gf)/RAS</italic> gain-of-function mutants, we detect two bands corresponding to the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated SYP-2 protein, instead of only the phosphorylated band. This could be due to only a subset of the SYP-2 protein being phosphorylated by MPK-1. This is consistent with the expression pattern of MPK-1 in the germline where the active form of dpMPK-1 is expressed only from mid to late pachytene. Meanwhile, SYP-2 is expressed from the leptotene/zygotene stage to late diakinesis. Therefore, SYP-2 could be phosphorylated by dpMPK-1 at the mid to late-pachytene region thereby regulating the localization of SYP-2 in a spatio-temporal manner. Further, we found that the SYP-2 (S25A) phosphodead mutant protein runs at the same size of the unphosphorylated SYP-2 band, suggesting that there are no additional phosphorylation sites in the SYP-2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We used SYP-3 as a negative control, since our analyses indicate it lacks phosphorylation sites, and we did not detect any shift in band size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). While this suggests that there may only be an unphosphorylated form of SYP-3, we cannot rule out the possibility that either a small fraction of SYP-3 in the extract tested is phosphorylated or that phosphorylation may not lead to a mobility shift under the conditions utilized in this analysis. We used MPK-1 as a positive control, where the band corresponding to dpMPK-1 (phosphorylated form of MPK-1) is not present after CIP treatment whereas it is present when CIP activity is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These data show that SYP-2 is phosphorylated in vivo and that its phosphorylation is dependent on the MAP kinase pathway.</p><p>Finally, to determine whether SYP-2 is a potential direct target for phosphorylation by MPK-1, we performed an in vitro kinase assay. Recombinant SYP-2 protein expressed and purified from <italic>E.coli</italic> was incubated with and without the MPK-1 mouse homolog ERK MAP kinase and examined by mass spectrometry to verify phosphorylation. We found that SYP-2 was phosphorylated by MAP kinase at the S25 site in vitro in the presence of ERK MAP kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The phosphorylated peptide was not observed in the absence of the kinase or when the kinase reaction was subsequently incubated with lambda phosphatase. Altogether, our data indicate that in vivo phosphorylation of SYP-2 is dependent on the MAP kinase pathway and that SYP-2 is an in vitro phosphorylation substrate of the ERK MAP kinase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Phosphorylation of SYP-2 at S25 prevents disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents</title><p>To determine the role for the MPK-1-mediated phosphorylation of SYP-2, we generated phosphodead and phosphomimetic SYP-2 mutants using CRISPR-Cas9 technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tzur et al., 2013</xref>). We generated lines where the S25 residue was mutated to either an alanine to generate a phosphodead mutant or to aspartic acid to generate a phosphomimetic mutant. We did not observe defects in either SC assembly or disassembly in the <italic>syp-2</italic> phosphodead mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result was not surprising since the <italic>mpk-1(ga111lf)</italic> mutant did not show any defects in the disassembly of SC proteins at the non-permissive temperature and we already hypothesized that the SC assembly defects we see in both <italic>mpk-1</italic> loss- and gain-of-function mutants could be due to other roles played by MPK-1 in germline development or through its effects on different target proteins. However, in the <italic>syp-2</italic> phosphomimetic mutant, while SC assembly was normal, the disassembly of SC proteins was impaired as exemplified by SYP-1, SYP-2, SYP-3 and SYP-4 persisting on the long arms and failing to become restricted to the short arms of the bivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that constitutive activation of dpMPK-1 leads to failure in disassembly of SC proteins from the long arm of the bivalents (this study), and that all four SYP proteins are interdependent on each other for their localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colaiácovo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smolikov et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2009</xref>).

However, we see a reduction in brood size (109 ± 32), accompanied by 14.3% embryonic lethality and 2.1% males, in <italic>syp-2</italic> phosphomimetic mutants indicating that impaired disassembly of the SC proteins results in defects in chromosome segregation.

Our study of HIM-18/Slx4, which is involved in the resolution of Holliday junction intermediates into COs, indicated that the symmetry-breaking event detected at late pachytene is likely a CO precursor and not a completed CO event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, analysis of <italic>him-18</italic> null mutants showed six ZHP-3 foci per oocyte marking the six CO precursor sites also observed in wild type during late pachytene, and the establishment of long and short arm domains as indicated by LAB-1, SYP-1 and AIR-2 localization. Since our current study indicates that the MPK-1 pathway regulates the disassembly of SC proteins we tested the hypothesis that MPK-1 coordinates recognition of a CO precursor/intermediate with disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents. First, active dpMPK-1 and foci for the pro-CO factor COSA-1 are both observed at the same time in pachytene stage nuclei suggesting a correlation between CO precursors and active MPK-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Second, we observed a significant persistence of dpMPK-1 signal in <italic>zhp-3</italic> and <italic>cosa-1</italic> mutants compared to wild type suggesting that inactivation of MPK-1 is linked to formation of a CO precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>).

The partial suppression observed in <italic>ect-2(rf);cosa-1</italic> mutants can be ascribed to the fact that <italic>ect-2(rf)</italic> is a reduction-of-function mutant and still has dpMPK-1 activity as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> as well as by the presence of phoshorylated SYP-2 detected on Westerns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The <italic>cosa-1; syp-2(S25A)</italic> partial rescue leads us to hypothesize that there may be additional kinases regulating the other SYP proteins in an MPK-1-dependent manner. Indeed, while we did not find evidence for additional MPK-1 phosphorylation sites on SYP-2, there are additional phosphorylation sites for other kinases, such as the polo-like kinase, on SYP-1 and SYP-4, verified by mass spectrometry (Nadarajan and Colaiacovo, unpublished and PHOSIDA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosida.com">http://www.phosida.com</ext-link>) and Polo-like kinase itself was identified as a target of MPK-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arur et al., 2009</xref>).

Here we provide novel insight into the regulation of the disassembly of SC proteins from along the long arms of the bivalents in response to progression through the CO specification pathway via regulation of phosphorylation of a central region component of the SC. First, we discovered a novel role for ECT-2 in the regulation of SC dynamics during prophase I of meiosis. Second, we showed that ECT-2 functions through the conserved MAP kinase pathway to regulate the disassembly of SC proteins. Third, we showed that SYP-2 is a potential direct target of phosphorylation by the MAP kinase pathway both in vivo and in vitro, and that constitutively phosphorylated SYP-2 impairs the disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents. Fourth, we showed that pro-crossover factor COSA-1 and dpMPK-1 are expressed at the same time in the pachytene region, and that inactivation of dpMPK-1 at the late pachytene and diplotene regions requires the pro-crossover activities of ZHP-3 and COSA-1. Taken together, these data identify the MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation of SYP-2 as part of a mechanism set in place to trigger the disassembly of SC proteins once CO designation occurs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>An MPK-1 mediated surveillance mechanism links CO designation to disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalent</title><p>The central region component of the SC in budding yeast, Zip1, is continuously added to the SC during meiotic prophase and exhibits differential dynamics near the recombination site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Voelkel-Meiman et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> SC has been proposed to be a dynamic structure that can disassemble and reassemble locally in response to exogenous DNA damage induced by irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Couteau and Zetka, 2011</xref>). Here, we identify a regulatory mechanism underlying the important step of disassembly of the SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents. Our studies have revealed the existence of both a phosphorylated and an unphosphorylated pool of SYP-2 protein. We propose that SYP-2 is phosphorylated by MPK-1 at the S25 site and that this must take place during the mid to late pachytene stage when activated MPK-1 is expressed. Our studies revealed that a constitutively phosphorylated SYP-2 resulted in an inability to remove the SYP proteins from the long arms of the bivalents in a timely manner. However, an inability to phosphorylate SYP-2 at S25 does not affect either SC assembly or disassembly, and we did not detect residual or novel phosphorylation in <italic>syp-2(S25A)</italic> mutants in our CIP assays. These observations lead us to suggest that phosphorylation of SYP-2 at S25 may 'prime' this protein for subsequent dephosphorylation once crossover designation is detected. This would ensure that homologous interactions are not prematurely dissolved until CO specification takes place, thus guaranteeing that homologs are locked and ensuring subsequent accurate chromosome segregation. The CO precursor markers and dpMPK-1 are expressed during the same time in the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that the timing when CO designation is completed coincides with when dpMPK-1 is turned off (germ cells progress from pachytene to diplotene). Our model is that MPK-1 functions as part of a surveillance mechanism in the pachytene region that recognizes the CO precursor and triggers the disassembly of SC proteins from along the long arms of the bivalents upon CO designation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our model is further supported by the impaired disassembly of SC proteins detected in the absence of CO designation in <italic>zhp-3</italic> and <italic>cosa-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhalla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>) and our observation that dpMPK-1 persists into late pachytene and diplotene in <italic>zhp-3</italic> and <italic>cosa-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12039.025</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for MPK-1-mediated coordination between CO designation and the disassembly of SC proteins during meiosis.</title><p>Proposed model for MPK-1 function in coordinating CO designation and the disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents.

In the second step, the SYP proteins are lost from the short arms of the bivalents. This second round of removal might be regulated in a manner independent of the MAP kinase pathway. This is supported by our observation that the SYP proteins are able to disassemble from the short arms of the bivalents in <italic>fog-2(oz40)</italic> female animals where MPK-1 is not active in the proximal oocytes, in a manner indistinguishable from wild type (Nadarajan and Colaiacovo, unpublished results). How then are the SYP proteins selectively lost from the long arms but not from the short arms of the bivalents during the diplotene stage? There are several possible ways this could be carried out: 1) There could be proteins localizing to the short arms of the bivalents in late pachytene to prevent loss of the SYP proteins specifically from the short arms; 2) a phosphatase could specifically localize to the long arms of the bivalents and dephosphorylate the SYP-2 protein located only on that chromosome subdomain thereby leading to loss of SYP proteins from the long arms while localization of this phosphatase to the short arms of the bivalents could be blocked by other proteins; and 3) there might be factors preventing the addition of unphosphorylated SYP-2 protein on the short arms of the bivalents. In fact, there are precedents for such modes of regulation acting on the short/long arms of the bivalents, as exemplified by LAB-1, the ortholog of Shughoshin in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and the HORMA domain containing proteins HTP-1/HTP-2. LAB-1 localizes exclusively to the long arm of the bivalents in late prophase where it prevents Aurora B Kinase, AIR-2, from loading on the long arm of the bivalents and restricts its localization to the short arm by recruiting the PP1/Glc7 phosphatases GSP-1 and GSP-2, thereby ensuring homologous chromosome segregation during meiosis I and sister chromosome segregation during meiosis II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tzur et al., 2012</xref>). Similar to LAB-1, the HORMA domain containing HTP-1/2 proteins relocalize from being associated along the full length of the chromosomes to being exclusively localized to the long arm of the bivalents during chromosome remodeling in late prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martinez-Perez et al., 2008</xref>). It has been suggested that differentially regulated pools of HTP-1/2 near the chromosome axes and/or post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation within the closure motifs of HTP-3, which remains associated with both long and short arms and with whom HTP-1/2 interact, could contribute to their distinct localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Regulation of asymmetric disassembly of SC proteins – an evolutionarily conserved mechanism?</title><p>How conserved is the asymmetric disassembly of SC proteins?

Studies in yeast show that the SC that persists at centromeres, after the SC disassembles throughout other regions of the chromosomes, promotes centromere bi-orientation thereby ensuring homologous chromosome segregation at meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gladstone et al., 2009</xref>). In mouse spermatocytes, the SC that persists between the chiasmata, after SC disassembly in the pachytene region, is proposed to regulate local remodeling of homologous chromosome axes thereby promoting centromere and chiasmata functions, which are to ensure proper homolog segregation at meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qiao et al., 2012</xref>). While chromosomes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are holocentric, and therefore lack a localized centromere, we propose that the CO designation-triggered asymmetric disassembly of SC proteins, and concomitant chromosome remodeling, are set in place to ensure that the short arm of the bivalents can function in a manner orthologous to centromeres to promote bi-orientation of the homologs thereby ensuring accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I suggesting the existence of a conserved regulatory mechanism. Further support for this stems from the demonstration that chromosome segregation at meiosis I in <italic>C. elegans</italic> occurs by outward pushing forces from microtubules assembling at the interface between the short arms of the separating homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dumont et al., 2012</xref>).

To generate a phosphodead <italic>syp-2</italic> mutant, serine 25 (S25A) was mutated to alanine. To generate a phosphomimetic mutant, serine 25 (S25D) was mutated to aspartic acid. We used the sgRNA recognition site (gaaaacagctgcagtaactgtgg) 139 base pairs downstream of the start codon.

Worms were frozen in liquid nitrogen followed by grinding using mortar and pestle. Frozen ground worms were mixed with an equal volume of lysis buffer and sonicated in a Diagenode Bioruptor sonication water bath (Bioruptor Sonication, VCD300) alternating for 15 s on and 45 s off for a total of 20 min. Crude worm lysate was spun down at 14000 rpm and filtered with a 0.45um syringe filter (Millex-HP filter unit, Catalog # SLHP033RS). 500 μl of worm lysate was incubated with 30 μl anti-GFP conjugated agarose beads (MBL, Catalog # D153-8) overnight at 4°C on a nutator. Beads were washed 3 times with 1XPBS and boiled in 2xSample buffer for 5 min. For SYP-2 interaction with dpMPK-1, supernatant was run on a 4–15% gradient gel and protein-protein interaction was verified on western blots with the appropriate antibody. Anti-IgG conjugated agarose beads were used as control. To verify the interaction by mass spectrometry, protein in the supernatant was precipitated using the proteoExtract protein precipitation kit (CALBIOCHEM, catalog # 539180) followed by mass spectrometry analysis. To identify phosphorylation sites on the SYP proteins, the supernatants were run on 4–15% gradient gel, stained with a Pierce silver stain kit (catalog # 24612) and bands of the appropriate size were analyzed by mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Calf intestinal phosphatase assay</title><p>Immunoprecipitation was prepared as mentioned above.

The immunoprecipitate was purified after CIP treatment by using a Pierce SDS-PAGE sample prep kit (catalog # 89888). The sample was boiled for 5 min and run on a SuperSep phos-tag 12.5% precast gel (catalog # 195–16391 from Wako) to get better separation of phosphorylated from non-phosphorylated protein. To improve the efficiency of protein transfer to PVDF membrane, gel was soaked in transfer buffer with 5 mmol/L EDTA for 10 min with gentle agitation then washed with transfer buffer for 10 min.

Frozen nuclear pellets were solubilized in 250 µL of 8 M urea, 20 mM HEPES containing phosphatase inhibitors (sodium orthovanadate 100 mM, sodium fluoride 500 mM, glycerol phosphate 1 M, disodium pyrophosphate 250 mM). Samples were thawed at room temperature on an Eppendorf mixer. Protein amount was normalized to 500 µg and made up to 1 mL in 8 M urea, 20 mM HEPES. Sample disulfide bridges were reduced by addition of 10 mM dithiothreitol and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark with mixing. Reduced cysteine residues were capped by addition of 25 mM iodoacetamide and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Addition of 3 mL of 20 mM HEPES reduced the urea concentration to below 2 M, thereby permitting trypsin digestion. 320 µL of immobilised TPCK trypsin bead slurry (P/N 20230 Thermo Scientific) was washed three times with 20 mM HEPES to remove storage buffers then split evenly between the two samples. Samples were incubated for 18 hr at 37°C with mixing. Digestion was halted by acidifying the samples with &lt;pH 4 by addition of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Samples were centrifuged to pellet the trypsin beads and the supernatant, containing peptides, was recovered. Peptides were desalted by reversed-phase chromatographic cartridges (Oasis HLB, Waters Corporation). Cartridges were activated in neat acetonitrile (MeCN) then washed twice with 2% MeCN containing 0.1% TFA. Samples were loaded and permitted to bind to the column slowly under vacuum. Bound peptides were washed twice with 2% MeCN containing 0.1% TFA and then eluted with 1 mL of 1 M glycolic acid in 50% MeCN, 5% TFA. Phosphopeptides were enriched from the eluted peptide solution through use of titania beads (TiO2, Titansphere, 5 µm, GL Sciences Inc.) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casado et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, 50 µL of titanium dioxide beads in 1% TFA was added to each sample then incubated for 5 min with agitation. Glygen filter-tips were washed with neat MeCN then the sample was loaded into the tips. The tips were centrifuged and flow-through was discarded leaving the titanium beads with bound peptides above the filter. Samples were washed with 1 M glycolic acid in 80% MeCN, 5% TFA to remove non-phosphorylated peptides (discarded) and then washed with 100 mM ammonium acetate in 25% MeCN to remove acidic non-phosphorylated peptides (discarded). Any remaining salts or non-phosphorylated peptides were removed by washing with 10% MeCN in triplicate. Phosphorylated peptides were eluted by four successive 50 µL volumes of 10% MeCN, 5% ammonium hydroxide solution into a 1.5 mL Protein Lo-bind Eppendorf. Eluted phosphopeptides were dried under vacuum in a speed vac concentrator. Dried phosphopeptides were solubilized in 25 µL of 0.1% TFA and transferred to a hydrophobic insert tube within an autosampler vial. Both samples were loaded into a temperature controlled autosampler within an UltiMate 3000 RSLC nanoLC instrument coupled online to an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Sample loading was achieved with a flow of 8 µL/min onto a trap column (Thermo Scientific Acclaim Pepmap 100; 100 µm internal diameter, 2 cm length, C18 reversed-phase material, 5 µm diameter beads, 100Å pore size) in 98% water, 2% MeCN, 0.1% TFA. Peptides were then eluted on-line to an analytical column (Thermo Scientific Acclaim Pepmap RSLC; 75 µm internal diameter, 25 cm length, C18 reversed-phase material, 2 µm diameter beads, 100 Å pore size) and separated using a gradient with conditions: initial 5 min with 4% B (96% A), then 120 min gradient 4-45% B, then 10 min isocratic at 100% B, then 5 min isocratic at 4% B (solvent A: 98% water, 2% MeCN, 0.1% formic acid; solvent B: 20% water, 80% MeCN, 0.1% formic acid). The LTQ-Orbitrap Velos system acquired full scan survey spectra (<italic>m/z</italic> 350 to 1500) with a 15000 resolution at m/z 400. A maximum of the 10 most abundant multiple charged ions registered in each survey spectrum were selected in a data-dependent manner, fragmented by collision induced dissociation (multistage activation enabled for neutral loss of phosphate group) with a normalized collision energy of 35% and scan in the LTQ ion trap (<italic>m/z</italic> 50 to 2000). In the data-dependent acquisition, a dynamic exclusion was enabled (exclusion list restricted to 500 entries, 60 s duration and 10 ppm mass window).</p><p>Phosphopeptide identification was performed by uploading the raw data to Mascot Distiller v2.3.2.1, which was used to smoothen and centroid the MS/MS data. Mascot v2.3.0 search engine was used to match peaks to peptides in proteins present in the WormPep233 FASTA file (downloaded January 2013) containing 26011 sequences. The process was automated with Mascot Daemon v2.3 with MS1 (precursor ions) mass tolerance set to 10 ppm and MS2 (product ions) mass tolerance set to 600 mmu. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was assigned as a fixed modification whereas phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues, pyro-glutamination on N-terminal glutamine residues, and oxidation on methionine residues were assigned as variable modifications. Trypsin was selected as the digestion enzyme (C-terminal arginine and lysine cleavage expected provided there is not a proline C-terminal to the arginine/lysine residue) and 2 missed cleavages were allowed. Sites of modification are reported when they had Mascot delta scores &gt;10. Delta scores were calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Savitski et al., 2011</xref>). Otherwise the site of modification was deemed to be ambiguous and phosphopeptides are reported as the start-end residues within the protein sequence.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center for providing strains and to M Zetka for the HTP-3 antibody.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom, Bernard de Massy, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Nadarajan et al. entitled &quot;The MAP kinase signaling pathway coordinates crossover designation with synaptonemal complex disassembly during meiosis&quot; begins with the discovery that <italic>ect-2</italic>, a regulator of the MAP kinase signaling pathway, is required for AIR-2 recruitment to/stabilization on bivalent chromosomes at the end of meiotic prophase in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline. Consistent with the possibility that ECT-2 regulates MAP kinase signaling in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, the study also found that an activated form of MPK-1 (dbMPK-1) is reduced in mid/late prophase regions of the <italic>ect-2</italic> -deficient germlines, and that a let-60 gain-of-function allele is epistatic to an <italic>ect-2</italic> reduction-of-function allele with respect to a meiotic chromosomal phenotype described later in the study (SC disassembly, see below).</p><p>Although <italic>ect-2</italic> became of interest based on the fact that it is involved in AIR-2 localization to meiotic chromosomes, this study does not go on to characterize this potential function of MAP kinase signaling in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline. Instead the authors are interested in the possibility of a functional relationship between MAP kinase signaling and the asymmetric disassembly of synaptonemal complex (SC), a meiotic chromosomal structure that is assembled at the interface of chromosome axes along the full length of the bivalent. This relationship is being analyzed by various approaches.</p><p>The major findings presented in this study are thorough and strong and make the clear case that MAP kinase signaling can influence SC disassembly dynamics during late meiotic prophase in <italic>C. elegans</italic> germlines. However, the interpretations of several key experiments highlighted in the title and Abstract are not convincing, and the manuscript needs substantial revision in order to provide a clear description and understanding of the pathway analyzed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data presented fall short of supporting the authors' assertion that MAP kinase signaling is part of &quot;a mechanism set in place to trigger SC disassembly&quot;. If MAP kinase signaling is part of an essential mechanism that normally triggers SC disassembly, one could expect to see misregulated SC disassembly in <italic>ect-2</italic> and <italic>mpk-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants. Alternatively, the role of MAP kinase may be only inhibitory (at least when constitutively activated) and its role in a wild type context with respect to SC disassembly thus remains undetermined.</p><p>2) Interpretation of accumulation of SYP-1 as evidence for failure of SC disassembly (or abrogation of, as in the Abstract) is very confusing. Constitutive phosphorylation of SYP-2 is correlated with persistence of SYP-1 on long arms but not with failure to disassemble the SC otherwise homolog arms would be kept aligned. Thus SC does disassemble in these conditions but some properties of SYP-1 is altered leading to its retention on axis.</p><p>3) Direct evidence for in vivo phosphorylation of Syp-2 by Map kinase is not convincing: the <italic>mpk-1</italic> null mutants do not progress from early/mid to late pachytene (as pointed out in the first paragraph of the subsection “The ERK MAP kinase pathway is involved in regulating SC dynamics”). Thus, if (hypothetically) SYP-2 is only capable of being phosphorylated during late pachytene, an absence of SYP-2 phosphorylation in <italic>mpk-1</italic> null mutants could be a consequence of a progression defect, and not because SYP-2 is normally a direct target of MAP kinase activity in vivo.</p><p>4) Only SYP-1 is being monitored for SC disassembly, the other SC components should also be tested. Whether they are interdependent or not in the context analyzed here is not known.</p><p>5) The conclusion for a role of MPK for coordinating crossing over designation and SC disassembly requires the validation of the prediction that double mutants as <italic>cosa-1 mpk-1</italic> (rf), <italic>cosa-1 ect-2</italic>(rf), and <italic>cosa-1 syp-2</italic>[S25A] show wild type SC disassembly at late pachytene/early diplotene.</p><p>6) The authors propose that the MAP kinase coordination is essential for ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. However, the consequences of failure to disassemble the SC on the long arm are not clear? Is the second (i.e. short arm disassembly) impacted? Why do SC disassembly defective mutants have no increase of% of males? (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>7) How are AIR-2 and LAB-1 localized at diakinesis in the <italic>syp-2</italic> phosphomimetic mutant?</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Figures of diplotene (2, 3, 5 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>): A general comment is that the quality of several images are poor and the actual identification of short and long arms difficult to sort out. Fundamentally, one of the key phenotype evaluated (SC disassembly or not) is based on the colocalization (or not) of <italic>Htp-3</italic> and <italic>Syp-1</italic>.</p><p>However, no quantification is provided on these colocalizations, per nucleus, and how many nuclei have been looked at, at which stage, which criteria were used for staging and what is the variability of phenotypes? In terms of staging for instance in Figure.2A <italic>lip-1</italic>(rf), the nucleus looks like diakinesis with arms separated? Overall providing one nucleus is not sufficient. Quantification is needed. This should be revised.</p><p>Specific issues on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>:</p><p>Persistence of SC on long arms in <italic>ect-2gf</italic> looks much more robust than persistence of SC on long arms in <italic>let-60gf</italic> where co-localization between <italic>Htp-3</italic> and <italic>Syp-1</italic> is not clear.</p><p><italic>Mpk-1(lf)</italic> mutant does not look like diplotene, probably earlier prophase, but the authors write in the text that SC disassembly is normal in this mutant? This is not convincing. In addition, the conditions used for analyzing the temperature sensitive mutants should be clarified and given for each experiment with wild type controls at both permissive and non-permissive temperatures: Previous studies have documented SC polycomplex formation in wild-type germlines at 25 degrees, among other defects. Even though it is mentioned for <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, it is not clearly mentioned in the Materials and methods that the WT worms were subject to the same temperature shifts. No data is presented that would give an assessment of how quickly the alleles are inactivated or potentially even re-activated. This would be crucial to know, especially when analyzing the <italic>ect-2 rf</italic> mutant, that has only subtle phenotypes. In addition, a <italic>let-60gf</italic> allele is used that is not the standard allele <italic>let-60(n1046)</italic>, without any explanation or reassurance that it behaves as the standard allele.</p><p>Similar comment to <italic>ect-2 mpk-1</italic> double mutant with distinct DAΠ and <italic>Htp-3</italic> staining patterns.</p><p>Does <italic>ect-2 gf</italic> have a phenotype with respect to axis morphology (HTP-3) or chromosome structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>)?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-F</xref>:</p><p>It should be mentioned in the text, legend and figure that it is not the endogenous SYP that is detected here. Please clarify which experiments involve SYP-2::GFP.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: Please clarify: the legend does not clearly indicate what is shown in the figure. The numbers in orange, blue and red, &quot;b ions&quot; and &quot;y ions&quot; and the plot itself are not easy to understand.</p><p>2) Schematic representation (such as on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and 11) can help but should be also provided for all genotypes.</p><p>3) Is the S25 phosphorylation site of <italic>Syp-2</italic> conserved?</p><p>4) Size markers and loading controls are needed on all western blots. For instance, it is impossible to know whether the bands detected in 4D have the same migration as the ones in 4E (upper? or lower?). Provide a longer exposure for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>.</p><p>In addition, the <italic>Syp-2</italic> band in <italic>mpk-1</italic> (null) has a slower migration? Is this reproducible? Does it mean an <italic>Mpk-1</italic> independent phosphorylation? In addition, with respect to migration, the same migration does not allow concluding that the protein is not phosphorylated (contrary to what is written in the text).</p><p>5) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Phosphorylation of SYP-2 is dependent on the ERK MAP kinase pathway”: You may mean mutant lysates?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>: Why is <italic>let-60(ga)</italic> epistatic to <italic>ect-2(ax)</italic> for brood size and not for embryonic lethality?</p><p>In <italic>ect-2(zh8); mpk-1(ga111)</italic>, 0% hatch and 0% embryonic lethality. Should it be N/A instead? Why does <italic>ect-2 (ax)</italic> have a HIM phenotype? Why not other mutants?

However, the interpretations of several key experiments highlighted in the title and Abstract are not convincing, and the manuscript needs substantial revision in order to provide a clear description and understanding of the pathway analyzed.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The data presented fall short of supporting the authors' assertion that MAP kinase signaling is part of &quot;a mechanism set in place to trigger SC disassembly&quot;. If MAP kinase signaling is part of an essential mechanism that normally triggers SC disassembly, one could expect to see misregulated SC disassembly in ect-2 and mpk-1 loss-of-function mutants. Alternatively, the role of MAP kinase may be only inhibitory (at least when constitutively activated) and its role in a wild type context with respect to SC disassembly thus remains undetermined.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned in the text, ECT-2 and MAP kinase also have roles in the pre-meiotic region of the germline and meiotic progression, respectively. This impedes the analysis of SC disassembly in <italic>ect-2</italic> and <italic>mpk-1</italic> null mutants, and is the reason why we utilized the available temperature sensitive mutants instead:</p><p>“Importantly, we shifted <italic>ect-2(ax751rf)</italic> worms to the non-permissive temperature at the L4 larval stage to bypass the requirements for ECT-2 during somatic development and germ cell mitotic proliferation such as seen in <italic>ect-2(e1778)</italic> null mutants, which are sterile and exhibit fewer germ cells with abnormal nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).”</p><p>“Since nuclei fail to progress from early/mid-pachytene to late-pachytene in <italic>mpk-1(ga117)</italic> null mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">48</xref>], we analyzed SC disassembly in <italic>mpk-1(ga111lf)</italic> mutants.”</p><p>We found that the <italic>ect-2(ax751)</italic> temperature sensitive reduction-of-function mutant still has a reduced level of dpMPK-1 and it is still able to phosphorylate SYP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that we were not able to see an SC disassembly defect in <italic>ect-2(ax751)</italic> mutants due to the presence of low level dpMPK-1 activity (Results, last paragraph).</p><p>The <italic>mpk-1(ga111)</italic> temperature sensitive loss-of-function mutant has been shown to still have a low level of dpMPK-1 activity and an incompletely penetrant pachytene arrest phenotype (Lee et al., 2007). SC disassembly still occurs in the nuclei that exit pachytene. The residual dpMPK-1 activity most likely also explains why we do not see an SC disassembly defect in this mutant (subsection “The ERK MAP kinase pathway is involved in regulating SC dynamics”, first paragraph).</p><p> <italic>2) Interpretation of accumulation of SYP-1 as evidence for failure of SC disassembly (or abrogation of, as in the Abstract) is very confusing. Constitutive phosphorylation of SYP-2 is correlated with persistence of SYP-1 on long arms but not with failure to disassemble the SC otherwise homolog arms would be kept aligned. Thus SC does disassemble in these conditions but some properties of SYP-1 is altered leading to its retention on axis.</italic> </p><p>SC disassembly has now been shown to be a two-step process in many organisms including budding yeast, female flies, worms and mice. In mice, for example, SYCP1, a central region component of the SC, is first lost from along the lengths of the chromosomes and retained at paired centromeres as cells progress towards metaphase. In a second step, SYCP1 is removed from centromeres by late diplotene and diakinesis (Bisig et al., 2012). In the case of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, first the SC disassembles from along the long arms of the bivalents and is restricted to the short arms where it is maintained through mid diakinesis. In a second step, it is then lost from the short arms by late diakinesis (around the -3 oocyte), as described in the text: “The SYP proteins are removed from the chromosomes in two steps, first SYPs are lost from the long arms of the bivalents in the late pachytene to early diplotene stage nuclei, but are selectively maintained on the short arms of the bivalents until late diakinesis (-3 oocyte; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).”</p><p>We have now also added a new diagram/cartoon to better illustrate this process at the beginning of the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Based on the two-step process of SC disassembly it is correct to describe what we are seeing as defects in the ability of the SC to disassemble from along the long arms of the bivalents. We understand the reviewer’s point that since the SC is built to hold homologs together, then normal disassembly equates to the physical separation of homolog arms. However, the term SC disassembly has been widely utilized to refer to the physical separation of homolog arms and the loss of the SC proteins from specific chromosome subdomains. The latter, however, is not occurring normally when there is constitutive phosphorylation of SYP-2. To clarify this terminology, we now explain it the first time that we describe the defect in our manuscript: “Those nuclei that had already gone through the leptotene/zygotene stage before the temperature shift showed normal synapsis during early and mid pachytene stages, but the central region components of the SC remained localized along the long arms of the bivalents and failed to become restricted to the short arms of the bivalents during late prophase (a defect herein referred to as impaired SC disassembly) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)”.) We also replaced the term “abrogates” with “impairs” in the two locations in the text where that term was utilized. It is also important to note that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> the central region of the SC is comprised of four SYP proteins (SYP-1/2/3/4). These four SYP proteins have been shown before to be interdependent for their localization (Colaiacovo et al., 2003; Smolikov et al., 2007 and Smolikov et al., 2009). Therefore, the localization of SYP-1 reflects the localization pattern of all the SYPs and previous publications from many labs, including ours, have used SYP-1 as a readout to study the SC assembly and disassembly process (Nabeshima et al., 2005; Bhalla et al., 2008; Martinez-perez et al., 2008; Clemon et al., 2013). However, to further clarify this we now also include analysis of SYP-2, SYP-3 and SYP-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) and show that all four SYP proteins fail to be lost from along the long arms. This further indicates that the presence of SYP-1 on the long arm at a stage when it should have normally been lost from this chromosome subdomain is not due to any altered properties of SYP-1 and instead indicates that there is a defect in disassembling all SC central region components from along the long arms of the bivalents.</p><p><italic>3) Direct evidence for in vivo phosphorylation of Syp-2 by Map kinase is not convincing: the mpk-1 null mutants do not progress from early/mid to late pachytene (as pointed out in the first paragraph of the subsection “The ERK MAP kinase pathway is involved in regulating SC dynamics”). Thus, if (hypothetically) SYP-2 is only capable of being phosphorylated during late pachytene, an absence of SYP-2 phosphorylation in mpk-1 null mutants could be a consequence of a progression defect, and not because SYP-2 is normally a direct target of MAP kinase activity in vivo.</italic> </p><p>The activated form of MPK-1(dpMPK-1) is present starting from mid-pachytene in wild type (Lee et al., 2007), and this led us to hypothesize that SYP-2 could get phosphorylated starting from mid-pachytene (not late pachytene as indicated by the reviewer). In the <italic>mpk-1(ga117)</italic> null mutant, even though nuclei do not progress to late pachytene, they still have early and mid-pachytene stage nuclei as mentioned in the manuscript: “Since nuclei fail to progress from early/mid-pachytene to late-pachytene in <italic>mpk-1(ga117)</italic> null mutants [Lee et al., 2007]”</p><p>In the Results section we stated: “This could be due to only a subset of the SYP-2 protein being phosphorylated by MPK-1. This is consistent with the expression pattern of MPK-1 in the germline where the active form of dpMPK-1 is expressed only from mid to late pachytene. Meanwhile, SYP-2 is expressed from the leptotene/zygotene stage to late diakinesis. Therefore, SYP-2 could be phosphorylated by dpMPK-1 at the mid to late-pachytene region thereby regulating the localization of SYP-2 in a spatio-temporal manner.”</p><p>We have also provided several lines of evidence that show that SYP-2 is a direct target of MAP kinase: 1) We identified the SYP-2 (S25) MAP kinase phosphorylation site by two different approaches in the worm (pull downs followed by mass spectrometry and by a phosphoproteomics approach); 2) We used CIP assays and the <italic>mpk-1</italic> null mutant to show that it is a target; 3) in vitro kinase assays showed that the S25 site is phosphorylated by MAP kinase; 4) Analysis of a phosphomimetic mutant in which the syp-2(S25) site was mutated to <italic>syp-2(S25D),</italic> showed in vivo that the mutant phenocopies the <italic>ect-2(gf)</italic> and MAP kinase gain-of-function phenotypes consistent with our hypothesis. We attempted to generate a phospho-specific antibody against the SYP-2(S25) site but we were not successful.</p><p><italic>4) Only SYP-1 is being monitored for SC disassembly, the other SC components should also be tested. Whether they are interdependent or not in the context analyzed here is not known.</italic> </p><p>To address the reviewers’ comment we also analyzed SYP-2, SYP-3 and SYP-4 localization in <italic>ect-2(gf), let-60(gf),</italic> and <italic>syp-2</italic> phosphomimetic mutants. Consistent with our previous findings for SYP-1, all other three SYP proteins also failed to disassemble normally from along the long arms of the bivalents in <italic>ect-2(gf), let-60(gf)</italic> and the <italic>syp-2</italic> phosphomimetic mutant indicating an SC disassembly defect. This new data is now shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p> <italic>5) The conclusion for a role of MPK for coordinating crossing over designation and SC disassembly requires the validation of the prediction that double mutants as cosa-1 mpk-1 (rf), cosa-1 ect-2(rf), and cosa-1 syp-2[S25A] show wild type SC disassembly at late pachytene/early diplotene.</italic> </p><p>As per the reviewers’ suggestion, we analyzed SC disassembly in <italic>cosa-1(me13) mpk-1(ga111), ect-2(ax751); cosa-1(me13)</italic> and <italic>cosa-1(me13);syp-2(S25A)</italic> double mutants. Consistent with our conclusion that MAP kinase coordinates crossing over designation with SC disassembly, we found that the SC is able to disassemble in these double mutants, but with different penetrance levels. Specifically, <italic>mpk-1(ga111)</italic> is able to completely suppress the SC disassembly defect observed in a <italic>cosa-1(me13)</italic> mutant, whereas <italic>ect-2(ax751)</italic> and <italic>syp-2(S25A)</italic> show a 11.5% and 40.9% suppression of the <italic>cosa-1(me13)</italic> SC disassembly defects, respectively. Since <italic>ect-2(ax751)</italic> is a reduction-of-function mutant and it has residual dpMPK-1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), we would not expect a complete suppression. We hypothesize that the reason we see a complete suppression in <italic>cosa-1(me13) mpk-1(ga111),</italic> but a partial suppression in <italic>cosa-1(me13);syp-2(S24A)</italic> double mutants, is that another SYP protein could be a substrate of MPK-1. However, we did not find any additional MAP Kinase phosphorylation sites in any of the SYP proteins, other than the S25 site in SYP-2. Interestingly though, there are phosphorylation sites for polo-like kinase on SYP-1 and SYP-4, which were verified by mass spectrometry. Polo-like kinase itself has been identified as a target of MPK-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Arur et al., 2009). It is possible that MAP kinase prevents the SC from disassembling prematurely through direct phosphorylation of SYP-2 and phosphorylation of SYP-1 and SYP-4 by polo-like kinase. The analysis of all the requested double mutants and interpretation of the observed outcomes have been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and in the main text (Results section, last paragraph).</p><p> <italic>6) The authors propose that the MAP kinase coordination is essential for ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. However, the consequences of failure to disassemble the SC on the long arm are not clear? Is the second (i.e. short arm disassembly) impacted? Why do SC disassembly defective mutants have no increase of% of males? (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</italic> </p><p>We cannot detect an increase in the% of male progeny because <italic>ect-2(gf)</italic> and <italic>let-60(gf)</italic> mutants have really reduced brood sizes (a very low number of eggs are laid), mostly in the range of 0.7 to 4.5 eggs are laid per hermaphrodite in these mutants, instead of the close to 200 eggs laid per hermaphrodite by wild type, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, and this masks the ability to detect males. However, in the <italic>syp-2</italic> phosphomimetic mutant, where we see an SC disassembly defect only in 54% of the animals (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we see a milder reduction in brood size (109 ± 32), accompanied by 14.3% embryonic lethality and 2.1% males, indicating that impaired SC disassembly is resulting in a defect in accurate chromosome segregation. We now include this information in the subsection “Phosphorylation of SYP-2 at S25 prevents SC disassembly”. We also suggest that SC disassembly from the short arm could be regulated either by different kinases or by a different mechanism (as described above in response to point #5 and in the manuscript). In the second step, given the interdependence of the SYP proteins, the SC would end up being removed by these other kinases (potentially polo-like kinases) from both long and short arms. We are currently examining the regulation of the second step of SC disassembly and its communication with the first step of SC disassembly, but these studies fall beyond the scope of this current manuscript and will be described in detail elsewhere.</p><p><italic>7) How are AIR-2 and LAB-1 localized at diakinesis in the syp-2 phosphomimetic mutant?</italic></p><p>We have examined this and show that both LAB-1 and AIR-2 localization in the <italic>syp-2</italic> phosphomimetic mutant is similar to wild type. This new data is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>.

Fundamentally, one of the key phenotype evaluated (SC disassembly or not) is based on the colocalization (or not) of Htp-3 and Syp-1.</italic> </p><p>To address this we have provided better resolution images for these figures and included higher magnifications images of a single bivalent to better illustrate what is being observed along the long and short arms of the bivalents. We also included diagrams/cartoons to make this clear. Finally, we also included additional images where the long arms are marked with LAB-1 for key mutants as a supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>However, no quantification is provided on these colocalizations, per nucleus, and how many nuclei have been looked at, at which stage, which criteria were used for staging and what is the variability of phenotypes?

No data is presented that would give an assessment of how quickly the alleles are inactivated or potentially even re-activated.

However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D and 4E</xref> are phos-tag gels used for better resolution of the bands. Size markers are not recommended for phos-tag gels since they can cause problems in uniform band migration, so here we now show the expected sizes. The Western blot on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> was run on a polyacrylamide gradient gel to show in vivo interaction between SYP-2 and dpMPK-1. Unlike the phos-tag gel, we were not able to see the separation of phosphorylated versus non-phosphorylated SYP-2 proteins in the polyacrylamide gel so we cannot say whether the band that pulls down with dpMPK-1 is a phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated band. The data originally shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> has now been replaced by a longer exposure for a new blot given that we were also asked to also analyze the <italic>ect-2</italic> null, rf and gf mutants (see Reviewer comment #11) and that is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>.</p><p> <italic>In addition, the Syp-2 band in mpk-1 (null) has a slower migration?
