memory pool providing long lasting immunity. While it has been described that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation becomes defective in old age, the cellular mechanism is largely unknown. Autophagy is a major cellular lysosomal degradation pathway of bulk material, and levels are known to fall with age. In this study, we describe a novel role for autophagy in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation. Mice lacking the autophagy gene <italic>Atg7</italic> in T cells failed to establish CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory to influenza and MCMV infection. Interestingly, autophagy levels were diminished in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from aged mice. We could rejuvenate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in elderly mice in an autophagy dependent manner using the compound spermidine. This study reveals a cell intrinsic explanation for poor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory in the elderly and potentially offers novel immune modulators to improve aged immunity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03706.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03706.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03706.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the face of an infection, the immune system mounts an aggressive response by producing many copies of killer immune cells called CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that recognize and destroy any cells infected with the invading pathogen. The number of killer cells produced depends on the extent of the infection. Once the infection has been brought under control, most of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells die off. The small numbers that are retained—called memory cells—‘remember’ the pathogen, so that if it invades the body again, they can help the immune system to respond more quickly and effectively.</p><p>Memory cells are also critical to the effectiveness of vaccines, many of which introduce a dead or weakened pathogen into the body. This does not cause an infection, but does allow the immune system to create memory cells that are able to fend off the same pathogen in the future. However, vaccines only work in individuals that are able to produce and maintain memory cells, which many older people are less able to do.</p><p>An important system that maintains cells, called autophagy, destroys and removes the ‘junk’ and toxic by products that all cells accumulate over time as a result of normal cell functions. Without autophagy, cells become less able to produce energy and they may die. Puleston et al. show that autophagy begins to fail in old mice, which prevents the formation of a proper memory response. In addition, mice that lack an important gene needed for autophagy are unable to produce memory cells after being infected with viruses such as influenza.</p><p>Puleston et al. found that boosting autophagy in older mice using a chemical called spermidine—which is also found naturally in many tissues—helped to restore the mice's ability to create and maintain memory cells. Spermidine-treated mice developed a stronger immunity to influenza after vaccination compared with other mice of a similar age. Further research is required to better understand how spermidine works to see if it could be developed into a drug that safely boosts the immune system of humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03706.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03706.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>memory T cell</kwd><kwd>vaccination</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>spermidine</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Human Immunology Unit, Oxford</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Puleston</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Hanlin</given-names></name><name><surname>Powell</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lipina</surname><given-names>Elina</given-names></name><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>Alexander S</given-names></name><name><surname>Cerundolo</surname><given-names>Vincenzo</given-names></name><name><surname>Townsend</surname><given-names>Alain RM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>088098/Z/08/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Puleston</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name><name><surname>Klenerman</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Allan and Nesta Ferguson Charitable Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Puleston</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>Alexander S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004101</institution-id><institution>Lady Tata Memorial Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>Alexander S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Autophagy is required for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation; in aged individuals autophagy levels are diminished, and increasing autophagy enhances their CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Upon successful clearance of a pathogen, the majority of short-lived effector T cells die and the remaining cells differentiate into a memory T cell population that provides long lasting immunity. While the cytokines, surface molecules, and signaling components involved in T cell memory formation have been extensively studied, the molecular pathways supporting these cell fate decisions are poorly understood. The T memory population is (1) quiescent, (2) long-lived and actively maintained, and (3) relies on mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pearce and Pearce, 2013</xref>). Both reduced cell cycling and longevity of this stem cell-like population demand rigorous maintenance of the cytoplasm as debris cannot be diluted to daughter cells, reminiscent of true stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mortensen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Warr et al., 2013</xref>). Across mammalian cell types, clearance of debris and damaged organelles such as mitochondria is typically executed via autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A recent study showed that formation of the influenza-specific B cell memory pool requires autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). However, while the role of autophagy in the homeostasis of naïve T cells is well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Puleston and Simon, 2014</xref>), nothing is known about the requirement of autophagy in antigen-experienced T cells. The T cell memory pool has previously been shown to be controlled by PI3K/Akt and AMPK signaling as well as mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rolf et al., 2013</xref>), all of which also control autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jung et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, T cell memory responses can be improved with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, rapamycin also rejuvenates HSCs in old mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Neither of these studies addressed autophagy as a contributing mechanism.</p><p>Evidence for age-related declining levels of autophagy stems largely from lower organisms such as yeast, flies, and worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubinsztein et al., 2011</xref>). A recent study showed that the polyamine spermidine induces autophagy and thereby prolongs life span in model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eisenberg et al., 2009</xref>). Our own work demonstrated decreased levels of autophagy in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells of old individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Phadwal et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, investigating a mouse model lacking the essential autophagy gene <italic>Atg7</italic> specifically in T cells, we find peripheral T cell lymphopenia, leading to proliferation and an activated phenotype within the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment. While <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> T cells respond normally during the early stages of live viral challenge, a severely compromised memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment was found in response to influenza and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Using bone marrow (BM) chimeras, we excluded that this is due the effects of lymphopenia; poor CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help; exhaustion, or altered cytokine receptor expression. Moreover, autophagy was found to be highest in antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells when compared to naïve cells. Antigen-specific <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also underwent more cell death at the time of memory formation, display compromised mitochondrial health, and increased expression of the glucose receptor GLUT1, a marker for glycolysis. Furthermore, recall CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to repeat immunizations and vaccination protocols were greatly diminished. This being reminiscent of the human ageing immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Haq and McElhaney, 2014</xref>), we confirmed reduced autophagy at the transcriptional and functional level in murine T cells from old mice. Importantly, we were able to restore the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory response in old mice with the autophagy-inducing compound spermidine, but not in autophagy-deficient mice. Finally, we found that spermidine induces autophagy independently of mTOR in T cells. Enhancing autophagy in an mTOR-independent manner may provide a safe way to improve vaccine responses in the elderly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Autophagy controls T cell numbers in naïve T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice</title><p><italic>Atg7flox/flox</italic> mice were bred with <italic>CD4-Cre</italic> mice to generate mice with defective autophagy in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>). Successful excision and thereby absence of <italic>Atg7</italic> mRNA and Atg7 protein was confirmed in purified T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, respectively). Using the imaging flow cytometer (ImageStream) to count LC3 puncta in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Phadwal et al., 2012</xref>), we demonstrated that functional autophagy was significantly diminished in <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> with examples of ImageStream images in right panel). In addition, using a classical technique to detect lipidated LC3, we confirmed that basal autophagy was diminished in the presence and absence of the autophagy flux inhibitor Bafilomycin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Previous reports have noted a number of changes to the naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment in the absence of autophagy, with T cell lymphopenia, a consistent observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pua et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Puleston and Simon, 2014</xref>). We set out to investigate if an altered naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment exists in T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. We confirmed observations from previous reports using similar autophagy-deficient mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pua et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2009</xref>) that thymic development of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was normal in 6-week old T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, mice were lymphopenic for both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lymph nodes and blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited an activated phenotype with increased CD44 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and decreased CD62L expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), resembling a ‘virtual memory’ compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akue et al., 2012</xref>). We observed similar frequencies of central effector memory CD62L<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>, however, T-<italic>Atg7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice accumulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with an effector memory phenotype (CD62L<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Similarly, data from a mouse model in which another essential autophagy gene, <italic>Atg5</italic>, was deleted under the hematopoietic stem cell-specific promoter Vav, showed T cell lymphopenia and the expanded virtual memory T cell compartment (CD8<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>) suggesting this phenotype is not <italic>Atg7</italic> specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Next, we established that proliferation was increased in the activated CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment by Ki-67 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The observed activated phenotype and increased cell turnover in <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are likely driven by homeostatic proliferation in an attempt to fill the depleted T cell niche. Indeed, the expression of the homeostatic proliferation marker CD24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2006</xref>) was found to be significantly increased on <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To investigate whether lymphopenia drives this activated phenotype in the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment, we generated 1:1 mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeras from CD45.2<sup>+</sup> T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> BM mixed with CD45.1<sup>+</sup> wild-type BM. Both BMs contributed equally to form the new hematological system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were still diminished even in the presence of a replete T cell niche, suggesting the survival defect previously described for autophagy-deficient T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pua et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mortensen et al., 2010</xref>) is cell-intrinsic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). However, the activated <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell phenotype was no longer detected in BM chimeras as measured by the frequency of donor CD45.2<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells found to be CD62L<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) and CD44<sup>hi</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These data indicate that the observed homeostatic proliferation and the change in surface phenotype of <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are driven by lymphopenia and are not cell-intrinsic.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03706.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lymphopenia induces homeostatic proliferation and an activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell phenotype in T-<italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Frequency of mature single positive CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in thymi of 6 week old mice (n = 4), representative FACS plot of three independent experiments.

However, the importance of autophagy in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to infection is unknown. To investigate this, we challenged <italic>T-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice with influenza (PR8 strain) and MCMV. In T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, we found normal expansion of the antigen-specific effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell (CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>eff</sub>) compartment using influenza-specific tetramers on day 10 (peak response) in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, due to the pre-existing lymphopenia observed in naïve mice, the absolute counts were diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>eff</sub> response to MCMV in the blood on day 7 was also normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hutchinson et al., 2011</xref>). However, the ability of T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice to form memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub>) to both influenza and MCMV is severely compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Performing serial bleeding on influenza infected mice over time, we demonstrated a catastrophic collapse of the antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell pool at day 21, resulting in a failure to retain CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> in T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, the response to the ‘inflationary’ epitopes m38 and IE3 from MCMV is also compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In response to these epitopes, wild-type CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells continue to expand throughout MCMV chronic infection. However, <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells fail to inflate and instead undergo a dramatic contraction leading to a failure to form a MCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory pool. This profound CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell contraction in T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice is also observed in response to a conventional, non-inflating MCMV epitope (m45, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). While viral titers against influenza in the lungs of wild-type and T-<italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice were comparable at day 3 of infection, they were significantly higher on day 6 in T-<italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This is most likely due to the significantly lower absolute number of antigen-specific effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. As T-<italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice survived influenza challenge, we expect that the virus is eventually cleared in all mice.

Furthermore, a defect in the frequency of memory precursor cells might also impact upon CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> formation in T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. Mixed BM chimeras demonstrated that the frequency of short-lived effector (SLEC, CD127<sup>+</sup>KLRG1<sup>−</sup>) and memory precursor (MPEC, CD127<sup>−</sup>KLRG1<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was in fact normal in T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

While this is well described for naïve autophagy deficient T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Puleston and Simon, 2014</xref>), it had not been analyzed in antigen-specific T cells. As expected, in wild-type mice challenged with MCMV, we found highest levels of cell death among antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells just after the peak of the effector phase on day 9, whereas in T-<italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, cell death was found to increase over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This could not be explained by a change in levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The control of mitochondrial quality and reactive oxygen species (ROS) via mitophagy, the degradation of mitochondria, has been found to prevent cell death in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pua et al., 2009</xref>). In keeping with this, mitochondrial content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and mitochondrial ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) were significantly increased in <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. While this likely explains the increased cell death, as shown for other hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mortensen et al., 2010</xref>) and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pua et al., 2009</xref>), mitophagy is also thought to be essential for maintenance of healthy mitochondrial energy generation. This notion is consistent with our data in other <italic>autophagy-deficient</italic> hematopoietic cell types (macrophages and primary leukemic lines, submitted) demonstrating increased glycolytic enzymes by proteomic analysis, increased lactate production and decreased oxygen consumption using metabolic seahorse measurements. Indeed, studies by Pearce et al showed that formation of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> pool is accompanied by a switch to mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pearce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sukumar et al., 2013</xref>). However, in the physiological viral infection models used here, aiming to mimic human infection, the scarcity of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells prevented us from performing these metabolic measurements. In addition, due to the loss of CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> in the absence of <italic>Atg7</italic> by day 30, any metabolic analysis was restricted to early time points when antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are still present in T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. We resorted to the measurement of a surrogate marker of glycolysis, the glucose transporter GLUT-1 on antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by two different techniques, (a) the fluorescently labeled GLUT-1 binding domain of HTLV (human T cell leukemia virus), which specifically detects GLUT-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Manel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kinet et al., 2007</xref>), and (b) a GLUT-1 antibody staining. As expected, GLUT-1 is upregulated on CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>eff</sub> (day 9) and then downregulated on CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> (day 22) in wild-type mice as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells switch to mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, antigen-specific <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>eff</sub> expresses more GLUT-1 and downregulation does not occur to the same extent at the later time points compared to WT cells (day 22) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that autophagy supports the metabolic switch during the differentiation from T<sub>eff</sub> to T<sub>mem</sub>. This was confirmed using the GLUT-1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, treatment with the anti-diabetic drug metformin that induces mitochondrial β-oxidation metabolism in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pearce et al., 2009</xref>) did not rescue the memory T cell compartment in this model (data not shown).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03706.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title><italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells show increased mitochondrial content, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis and fail to down-regulate GLUT-1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The spleens of unimmunized and MCMV-infected mice were stained with the apoptotic marker Annexin V and a dead cell dye that stains cells with disrupted membranes on the time points indicated.

We first confirmed that spermidine induces autophagy in T cells in vitro in a dose and time-dependent manner shown by increased levels of LC3-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Spermidine levels in the blood are known to decrease with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pucciarelli et al., 2012</xref>). To mimic this, we used the inhibitor of the natural spermidine synthesis pathway DFMO in the human Jurkat T cell line and found that autophagy levels detected by LC3 western blot significantly dropped in BafA treated samples and untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Autophagy levels could be rescued by the addition of very low levels of spermidine in T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). As mTOR inhibition, such as achieved with rapamycin, is well known for its multiple side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lamming et al., 2013</xref>), we confirmed that spermidine induces autophagy in T cells in an mTOR-independent manner. Rapamycin completely abolished the phosphorylation of S6K, a major target downstream of activated mTOR, whereas spermidine had no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Finally, we administered spermidine to old and young mice via the drinking water at concentrations known to induce autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eisenberg et al., 2009</xref>) during the influenza vaccination protocols as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>. In response to first and second vaccination, and as observed in ageing humans, old mice do not mount a robust CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response as compared to young mice. Spermidine dramatically enhanced influenza-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in old vaccinated wild-type mice but not in old vaccinated T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice as tracked over time in blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Similarly, the response to live influenza challenge in the blood was improved twofold to threefold (back to levels similar to young mice) when spermidine was administered to old mice, but not in the absence of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). In the lungs, the number of NP-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to influenza challenge in vaccinated old mice were improved fivefold to sixfold in the presence of spermidine, but had little effect on the response of aged T<italic>-Atg7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Hematopoietic and immune health both decline significantly with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beerman et al., 2010</xref>). With the ageing population, this has become a substantial health and socio-economic problem for the developed world. Our work sheds light on the cellular mechanisms of immune ageing and how to improve responses to vaccination in the elderly.</p><p>The naïve T cell compartment in the absence of several different essential autophagy genes has been extensively analysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Puleston and Simon, 2014</xref>). These models uniformly demonstrated increased damaged mitochondria leading to cell death and peripheral lymphopenia. In this study, we show how this lymphopenia drives the remaining T cells to take on an activated/memory phenotype as they proliferate in an attempt to re-fill the T cell niche, often termed ‘virtual memory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jia and He, 2011</xref>). Thus, we provide a link between lymphopenia and the formation of the ‘virtual memory’ compartment and highlight the significant changes in T cell surface phenotype that can occur in a lymphopenic environment. Interestingly, the virtual memory compartment is also a hallmark of the ageing adaptive immune system. This observed phenotype in naïve mice would have precluded a coherent analysis of antigen-activated T cells; however, the use of mixed BM chimeras crucially excluded a contribution of the skewed naïve repertoire to the CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> phenotype.</p><p>In this study, we showed a novel and essential link for autophagy in the formation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> to infection. The absence of autophagy also dramatically altered the ability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to respond to secondary infection. Interestingly, the severely depleted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recall response did not prevent T-<italic>Atg7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice from surviving a lethal secondary heterotypic influenza challenge. Influenza virus is typically controlled by both antibodies and cellular immunity. However, in a heterotypic challenge, the surface hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (recognized by antibodies) differ between the two heterotypic strains, while the viral internal proteins (presented by MHC class I to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) remain the same, leaving the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to provide protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rimmelzwaan et al., 2007</xref>). The unique protective role of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in heterotypic immunity was described several decades ago in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rimmelzwaan et al., 2007</xref>). The observation that the majority of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes are cross-reactive between subtypes and are located in the most conserved regions of the internal proteins (nucleoprotein and matrix protein) confirms their role. In humans, the evidence, typical for human studies, is sparse and more circumstantial. A study from 1983 by McMichael et al demonstrated that in experimentally infected individuals, virus-specific cytotoxicity inversely correlated with the extent of virus shedding in the absence of virus-specific antibodies for the strain that was used for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McMichael et al., 1983</xref>). More recently, Lalvani et al found higher frequencies of pre-existing T cells to conserved epitopes in individuals who developed less severe illness in the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic in the absence of cross-protective antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sridhar et al., 2013</xref>). We would postulate therefore that the survival of the T-<italic>Atg7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice after the secondary heterotypic challenge relies on the very few effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells generated. These data also suggest that eliciting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory responses in influenza vaccination is highly desirable, particularly to protect from pandemic flu.</p><p>This also raises interesting questions as to why such robust secondary T cell responses have evolved when survival can be achieved with a fraction of what is observed normally in nature. Although no CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> cells can be detected by conventional tetramer technology 20–30 days post-immunization in T-<italic>Atg7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, some memory cells must remain below the detection limit at very low frequency. In addition, these <italic>Atg7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells must maintain normal functional and proliferative capacity as they are detected at early time points after secondary immunization, characteristic of true memory T cell kinetics.</p><p>To explain how autophagy affects the maintenance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> cells, we addressed two alternative hypotheses experimentally: (1) accumulation of cellular damage affects the long-lived CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> in particular and (2) autophagy is required for the switch from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration important for the survival of CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> cells. Regarding the first one, we show evidence for the accumulation of mitochondria and ROS in the absence of autophagy. However, a limitation of our study is, we did not test for accumulation of other organelles and protein aggregates. As for the second hypothesis, initial studies involved TRAF6 (TNFR-associated factor 6) in the regulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> development by modulating fatty acid metabolism and thereby increasing mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pearce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van der Windt et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, TRAF6, as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has recently been shown to stabilize essential proteins in the autophagy pathway such as Ulk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nazio et al., 2013</xref>) and Beclin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shi and Kehrl, 2010</xref>). We therefore hypothesize that TRAF6 controls metabolism via autophagy and propose three mechanisms contributing to autophagy's role in mitochondrial respiration: (1) through lipophagy, the degradation of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weidberg et al., 2009</xref>), autophagy provides the fatty acids that fuel the Krebs cycle with Acetyl-CoA though β-oxidation, (2) through degradation of glycolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>), and (3) through mitophagy, autophagy provides mitochondrial quality control that is required for functional mitochondrial ATP generation. We provide evidence for the latter mechanism here. This suggests that autophagy is important in the control of metabolic pathways in T cells. Interestingly both the accumulation of damaged mitochondria/oxidative stress as well as a bias to preferentially use glycolysis are hallmarks of the ageing cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hipkiss, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we showed that autophagy levels are impaired in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from aged mice. Using spermidine, we could dramatically improve the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to vaccination and infection in elderly mice in an autophagy-dependent manner. However, aged CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells also undergo immune senescence. While inducing autophagy with spermidine in the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment clearly contributes to the increased numbers of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, the limitation of these experiments is that we cannot gauge the contribution of improved CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell function to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers. This will be included in future studies.</p><p>These results offer the first cell-intrinsic explanation as to why T cell memory is defective in old age. Spermidine is a pleiotropic compound and its major function has been described in yeast as an inhibitor of histone acetyl transferases, inducing epigenetic changes to autophagy-related gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eisenberg et al., 2009</xref>). We showed that spermidine operates independently of mTOR to induce autophagy. These findings offer the prospect of improving vaccine T cell responses in the elderly through spermidine in an mTOR-independent fashion. However, no other ways of inducing autophagy were tested here. We expect that fasting or other mTOR-independent drugs such as resveratrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morselli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morselli et al., 2010</xref>) may also be beneficial for CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> maintenance. However, spermidine is significantly more attractive than previously published T<sub>mem</sub>-boosting compounds such as metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pearce et al., 2009</xref>) and rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2009</xref>), that come with unwelcome side effects and toxicity in humans. The elucidation of the precise role of spermidine will be the subject of future work and will enable its development as a safe, readily administrable immune-modulating drug.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>CD4-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2001</xref>) were from Adeline Hajjar (University of Washington) and crossed with <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Komatsu et al., 2005</xref>) to obtain T-<italic>Atg7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<italic>CD4-Cre</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>Atg7</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup>) on a C57BL/6 background.

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Autophagy as a critical regulator of CD8+ T cell memory and a route to improved vaccination in the elderly” for consideration at <italic>eLife.</italic> Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors, and 2 expert reviewers in your field.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers and Reviewing editor all feel that, overall, this is an interesting, well-performed study addressing the role of autophagy and ageing effects on autophagy in viral-specific CD8 memory T cells. We think that this study has important potential implications for understanding the role of autophagy in a crucial basic aspect of immunology, T cell memory, and, as pointed out by the authors, has potential clinical implications for improving vaccine responses in the elderly.</p><p>The reviewers have made several suggestions to further improve the manuscript. We are enclosing a list of the major points. Some of the points request further text explanations or modifications of the data analysis. Other points suggest a need for some additional data; however, as a general principle, given the overall enthusiasm for the work and the editorial policies of <italic>eLife</italic>, if these points cannot be quickly addressed by new experimental data, we ask that you revise the text (Discussion) to acknowledge the limitations of the present study.</p><p>One exception to this principle is point #8; although we recognize that your lab has previously published studies using the BDS feature to measure autophagic flux in lymphocytes, we do believe that, prior to publication, this assay should be confirmed by at least one additional autophagic flux assay to more convincingly demonstrate a defect in autophagic flux in T/Atg7-/- cells. Another exception is point #9; the LC3 assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and 6E</xref> are performed in the same cells; the difference in the blots for control cells suggests a technical problem that should be resolved prior to publication.</p><p>1) The authors have not directly examined the effects of memory CD8 T cells on viral clearance and/or protection against pathological lung damage during influenza virus. If the authors have data in the adoptive transfer experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> evaluate the functions of wild-type and Atg7-/- memory T on viral clearance and/or lung damage, such data should be included in the manuscript. If they have not collected such data in their experiments, they should acknowledge this limitation.</p><p>2) The authors use a model of heterotypic immunity against influenza to avoid a model in which antibody-mediated responses are involved in protection against viral challenge. However, it is notable that mouse survival is not affected by autophagy deficiency in T cells. The reviewers ask whether the authors have tried to use higher titers of the viruses or lethal strains such as those described before (Virology 2011, 412:36-45). If antibodies are the main effectors against influenza and CD8 T cells are not sufficient or required for the protection against influenza challenge, this should be clarified by the authors. In addition, the authors should more fully discuss the data on the role of human CD8 T cell responses in protection against influenza challenge after vaccines. The argument that the findings in mice may have relevance to diminished vaccine responses to flu vaccines in elderly relies on the relevance of CD8 T cell memory responses to vaccine efficacy. The final paragraph mentions briefly that CD8 T cell responses are an important correlate of vaccine protection; however, this should be discussed more extensively in light of the lack of in-depth experimental evidence in this study in the mouse for a role of memory CD8 T cells in protection against disease caused by viral challenge.</p><p>3) T/Atg7-/- mice show defects in T cell development and a reduction of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes (J. Immunol. 182:4046-4055 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors should show the percentage and total numbers of antigen-specific CD8 T cells among all cells in the lung, not just among gated CD8 T cells. The authors conclude that there is “normal expansion of the antigen-specific effector CD8+ T cell compartment”.

While viral titers in the lungs of T-Atg7-/-mice are comparable to WT mice at day 3 of infection, they are significantly higher on day 6, suggesting T-Atg7-/- mice clear virus less efficiently than WT mice. This is probably due to the significantly lower absolute count of effector antigen-specific CD8 T cells. We expect that T-Atg7-/- mice would eventually clear the influenza virus as they survive the influenza challenge. The reason we did not measure this in a bone marrow chimera or adoptive transfer setting is because both the Atg7+/+ CD45.1 and Atg7-/- CDD45.2+ CD8 T cells would contribute toward viral clearance and it would be impossible to discern either's contribution. However, an additional mouse model as suggested by the reviewer, i.e. adoptive transfer experiments of Atg7-/- T cells into a T cell depleted host, would probably address this issue. This experiment could not be accomplished in the time frame given. We have now added the graph of viral clearance as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The authors use a model of heterotypic immunity against influenza to avoid a model in which antibody-mediated responses are involved in protection against viral challenge. However, it is notable that mouse survival is not affected by autophagy deficiency in T cells. The reviewers ask whether the authors have tried to use higher titers of the viruses or lethal strains such as those described before (Virology 2011, 412:36-45)</italic>.</p><p>We too have thought about this experiment. However, even in wild type mice it is possible to overcome heterotypic immunity with a suitably intense secondary challenge. Furthermore, the dose we used is already at least 10,000 morbid doses and therefore, we think using a different strain also at a highly lethal dose is unlikely to give different results. Because of this, we feel that doing this experiment in knock out animals would not add any information on how these animals are protected.</p><p><italic>If antibodies are the main effectors against influenza and CD8 T cells are not sufficient or required for the protection against influenza challenge, this should be clarified by the authors</italic>.</p><p>CD8 T cells are indeed required for the protection against the heterotypic influenza challenge as presented here in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. However, antibodies are essential for the protection against influenza infection such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4">Figure 2 to 4</xref>. In fact a recent paper in Nature Medicine (ref 6) shows that mice with B cell–specific deletion of Atg7 (B/<italic>Atg7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice) showed normal primary antibody responses after immunization against influenza but failed to generate protective secondary antibody responses when challenged with influenza virus, resulting in high viral loads, widespread lung destruction and increased fatality. We have now made the requirement of CD8+ T cells clear in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>In addition, the authors should more fully discuss the data on the role of human CD8 T cell responses in protection against influenza challenge after vaccines. The argument that the findings in mice may have relevance to diminished vaccine responses to flu vaccines in elderly relies on the relevance of CD8 T cell memory responses to vaccine efficacy. The final paragraph mentions briefly that CD8 T cell responses are an important correlate of vaccine protection; however, this should be discussed more extensively in light of the lack of in-depth experimental evidence in this study in the mouse for a role of memory CD8 T cells in protection against disease caused by viral challenge.</italic></p><p>We fully agree with the reviewers and both these points (role of CD8 T cells in humans and the lack of depth knowledge about how mice are protected in this mouse model) have now been added to the Discussion, We fully agree with the reviewers and both these points (role of CD8 T cells in humans and the lack of depth knowledge about how mice are protected in this mouse model) have now been added to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) T/Atg7-/- mice show defects in T cell development and a reduction of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes (J.
